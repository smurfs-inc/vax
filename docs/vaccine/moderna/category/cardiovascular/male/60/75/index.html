                                                I woke up at approximately 4:00 am with an extremely dry mouth. I went into the bathroom and took a drink of water. I returned to bed. I noticed that my breathing was becoming more rapid. I had trouble catching my breath. I sat up on the side of the bed. My heart was pounding and quick. My breathing was difficult. I woke up my wife. After about 5 minutes my symptoms improved. She took my pulse which was now at 62ppm.  I laid back down in a reclined position. My symptoms of difficulty breathing and elevated heart rate quickly returned. My pulse was now up to 98 ppm.  I sat up again. My symptoms gradually improved. Being unsure of what was going on my wife called 911.  The ambulance arrived in about 8 minutes.  I was about 60% better. Vitals were improving other than my blood pressure which was 180/100 Being unsure of what was happening, I was transported to Hospital.   I  had a chest x-ray, a chest CT scan with contrast to rule out a blood clot, blood work including tests to rule out MI x2. All test were negative.  By about 6:30 am I was feeling at least 80% better. My breathing I felt had returned to normal. My pulse was down into the 50&#34;s which is my normal range.

                                                DVT blood clot; A spontaneous report was received from a 60-year-old male consumer who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) blood clot.    The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included factor V Leiden, enlarged prostate, DVT, pulmonary embolism and hypertension. Concomitant medications reported included valsartan, alfuzosin, and acetylsalicylic acid.   On 07 Jan 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011J20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient developed DVT blood clot and experienced leg pain so intense that he could not walk. A doppler exam showed the DVT was from the top of the calf to mid-thigh. Treatment for the event included a rivaroxaban starter pack with dose tapering.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event deep vein thrombosis (DVT) blood clot was not reported.  The outcome of the event, DVT blood clot, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 60-year-old male patient with a relevant medical history of factor V Leiden, DVT, pulmonary embolism and hypertension who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011J20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Patient experienced the medically significant unlisted event of Deep vein thrombosis approximately four days after administration of vaccine. Treatment for the event included rivaroxaban. Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the event occurring after receiving the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event of Deep vein thrombosis is possibly related to the product. Of note, the patient&#39;s underlying Factor V Leiden which predispose to developing abnormal blood clots, and prior medical history of DVT with pulmonary embolism are considered risk factors to the occurrence of the event.

It retuned to normal after 6 hours, and then occurred again 1 week later...for 6 hours. I took Bystolic, and about 8 hours later it returned to baseline (about 62/min.  on Sun 1/24/2021, I woke up to bloody diarrhea x several episodes...this continued until Wed 27th, at which time my son (a 4th year graduating MD student) drove me to hospital and I was seen in ER room by MD. I was admitted, and had emergency surgery 1/27/2021 straight from Er Room. I had life saving surgery the next day to stop a lower GI bleed (of unknown origin). I was discharged 3 days later, and I am awaiting more testes, appts, etc.... I have lost time, money, and work from this near death experience... and the tachycardia still needs to be followed up on . I am EXTREMELY upset by these events, as I almost died....was hospitalized, incurred a lot of expense, used up all my sick pay and personal days, and out-of -pocket to my healthcare insurer.

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

                                                The patient was given his vaccine at 11:40am and a few minutes later 11:43am he said he was feeling very flushed and off. He said this extremities (hands and feet) felt hot and blotchy which is not normal for him (he does have neuropathy). He was sitting down for a couple minutes and I gave him water to drink just to calm down if it had been anxiety, but it did not seem to help. He started to complain of his heart pounding and beating rapidly. He said he was sweating and just felt very strange. I asked if he was short of breath at all which he denied. I immediately called 911 to have him be checked out and make sure he was ok since his symptoms had been going on for a few minutes, he was still complaining, and was not resolved with sitting or drinking a cold water. The patient did state that he had not eaten yet today (he does intermittent fasting and normally does not eat until 2pm), he did not take his blood pressure medication atenolol, and had driven about an hour here with his mother as she also got the vaccine today. While waiting for the ambulance I took his blood pressure which was very high 187/95mmHg which the patient confirmed is high for him. The ambulance arrived within 10 minutes and they checked him out. He did decline to go to the hospital after a thorough evaluation. The patient left once the paramedics cleared him at about 12:35pm so he was sitting and being monitored for a good 45 minutes before he left the store. The patient was never given any meds during this process and was cleared to go home by paramedics.

                                                Patient had vaccine and waited the 15 minute waiting period.  He felt well after 15 minutes and left the observation waiting area. He went up front to purchase something 5 minutes later and collapsed face first on the floor as observed by a nearby customer. The customer said he started having convulsing seizures and the customer went to aid in keeping the patient safe. the pharmacy manager (myself) was alerted and I immediately ran upfront to the patient with the emergency bag. 911 was already on the cashiers phone. They dispatched an ambulance. The only treatment was keeping the patient on his side and safe. He was having some labored breathing initially which quickly calmed down. The EMT arrived and they called his Dr office off the VAR. They said he had some hx of seizure. He had selected no to question #6 on VAR (Have you had  History of seizure for which you are on medication for). He became conscious before transport to the hospital. The EMT stated that he seemed to be covering  as expected from seizure.   He was then transported to Hospital Center.

Went to ER and was given EKG, Chest X-Ray, and blood tests to check for heart attack. Symptoms subsided after a bit. Labs were inconclusive. Sent home. Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

Uncomfortable but never to the point of difficulty breathing. ~08:30, BP 128/99 (I think) Systolic up only a bit.  Diastolic very high for me sent to urgent care part of clinic.   Monitored BP, oxygen, did EKG (normal), symptoms started easing ~ 09:40.  Sent home. Attending PA though it might just be a Vaso-Vagel response, but, after hundreds upon hundred of needles, I&#39;ve never had such a response, and, my symptoms did not involve a low BP, fainting or nausea, rather I remained conscious, had throat constriction with increased BP and a narrowed pulse pressure  range.

                                                Patient received his first dose of Moderna vaccine and reported feeling his heart rate go up around 20 minutes later. He alerted the nurse, who checked his vital signs, which were slightly elevated with a minor elevation in heart rate at 106. He denied dizziness, chest pain, extremity numbness/tingling, and any other signs. He continued to feel palpitations for about 30 minutes, but HR continued within normal limits &lt; 100 during that time. After about a half an hour he began to feel better, and was assisted to his car by county staff.  EMS offered and declined.

                                                Patient called me this morning to advise me that he experienced heart attack symptoms 45 minutes after receiving his first does of Moderna and self-admitted to the ER. ER confirmed that he had experienced a heart attack and had one clogged artery. He asked about reporting and I told him I would report to VAERS on his behalf as his doctor and the hospital refused to do so. He asked whether or not I would suggest he receive his second dose and I suggested that he speak with his cardiologist and doctor to make that decision. I also informed him that he can search VAERS to see what the other reactions may have been that were reported. Patient indicated that he felt well and has recovered.

                                                Patient received their vaccine and sat in a chair, within approx. two minutes the patient told another patient they felt hot, I was already walking to the patient to check on them,. The patient&#39;s eyes were glazed, Almost immediately the patients eyes rolled back in his head. I shook his arm and shouted to him , he was unresponsive with agonal breaths.. I shouted for help from the other nurses. RNs came immediately. We moved him to the floor, called for an epinephrine injection to be prepared, I began to prepare the site for epinephrine injection to his thigh, nurse checked for pulse... at this time the patient was still unresponsive with agonal breaths... no pulse was felt so compressions were commenced by RN. Nurse gave approx. 15 compressions to the patients chest ,  the patient spontaneously  began to recover. Carotid and radial pulses were felt at this time. Breathing returned to normal. While this was occurring, we called a code blue and 911 was activated. By the time 911 responded the patient was fully conscious , alert and responsive. He could tell us his name and how he felt prior to this incident. The patient was transferred via a  stretcher by EMS 911 and RN accompanied him to the ER to give a report. The timeframe for being pulseless and having agonal breaths lasted no more than 30-40 seconds. Patient denied any history of a seizure disorder. No  epinephrine or IM Benadryl were administered at the incident site by the responding staff due to the spontaneous recovery.

                                                4 days after the vaccination I started having breathing problems and a racing heart. I first went to Urgent Care and they sent me to the E.R. immediately.  They x-rayed my chest and ran 3 EKG&#39;s which all came out normal. However, they wanted to check my into the hospital to run a heart stress test the next day. I chose to go see and cardiologist and a pulmonary specialist. Those are appointments are being scheduled.

Felt almost as if the heart wasn&#39;t &#34;doing&#34; much -- in terms of pumping blood. Not aware of anything ingested to have caused this and I do not recall this having happened before (hence the association, possibly having to do with the vaccine -- speculative, obviously). Uncertain how long it lasted. Guessing 20-30mins(?).

I was atrial fibrillation free for 7 months, no medications, until two days after my second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Since then, i have had recurrent atrial fibrillation and some episodes of atrial flutter which my cardiologist believes could be related to the vaccine.

                                                I was extremely tired on Saturday. My shoulder hurt. About 3 pm, while urinating, I felt very light-headed as if I was about to faint. I stopped urinating and went back to bed.  That evening, about 8:30, I tried to eat dinner, but after three bites, I felt extremely tired. I leaned back in my chair, and I passed out. My wife woke me, but it took several minutes. She said my eyes rolled back in my head. She splashed water on my face. She said that I stopped breathing.  I woke up, then pushed my plate away and put my head on the table. I could not hold it up. I was sweating profusely. After several minutes, I felt that I was about to have diarrhea. My daughter and wife tried to walk me to the bathroom, but I did not have the energy to get there. I collapsed in the hall and hit my head on the door jamb. After several minute of trying , they pulled me up, and I then got the strength to walk the rest of the way. I had diarrhea, not suddenly, but it was as if my GI system emptied. It was soft, not loose, and there was a lot.  I went back to bed, and eventually slept.  I felt queasy the next day (Sunday), and I felt lightheaded at times, so I just sat or laid down. But I was feeling better. Today (Monday) I feel much better. A little tired, but much better. I went to the Pharmacy this morning, and they referred me to this website. I did not see the doctor.

                                                Patient with prior Covid infection Nov 2020, fully recovered, received first dose Moderna vaccine on 3/13/21 and next day developed body aches, fevers, chills, shortness of breath. Admitted 3/17/21 due to hypoxia, had ground glass opacities on CT. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x 2.  Vigorous immune response could have caused lung inflammation and hypoxia, similar to a covid infection, but from the vaccine. 60YM with a history of a chronic inflammatory arthritis on methotrexate, hospitalization in November 2020 with Covid pneumonia, he was discharged on 1 to 2 L of home oxygen, and reports that he was told by his PCP about a month after discharge that he was able to come off the oxygen as his oxygen saturations had normalized.  He returned to his usual state of health and activity with no issues until he received the first dose of his Moderna covid-19 vaccine through his primary care office on 3/13.  The next day he developed arm pain and then progressive body aches, headaches, fevers, chills, and shortness of breath.  He presented to the ER and was found to be febrile with hypoxia and admitted for treatment and evaluation.   Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with ground glass opacities on CT : oxygen 87% on RA in ER, 84% on room air 3/19, resolves with oxygen support of 2lpm.  CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x2 as well as respiratory virus panel, CT shows ground glass opacities, patient was started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline for empiric treatment for possible community-acquired pneumonia, although procalcitonin was negative.  BNP was elevated at 458, so an echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal EF, and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.  Patient was given 2 doses of furosemide during the hospitalization and BNP normalized. Patient was started on prednisone to calm down a possible inflammatory response triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine in a person who likely already has antibodies, causing hypoxia.  With this patient significantly improved and at discharge is on room air at rest, but still requires 2 L/min with exertion.  CRP was markedly elevated, supporting an inflammatory process.  Autoimmune lung disease panel was sent and is in process at time of discharge.  Patient requested discharge home, Discharged on a slow prednisone taper to avoid rebound with abrupt discontinuation of steroids.  Patient will complete 2 additional days of Augmentin and doxycycline at discharge.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter considered THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia) and PURPURA (Purpuric rash) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation), NAUSEA (nausea), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools), PYREXIA (Fever) and CHILLS (Chills).    Concomitant medications were not provided.  Hepatitis panel showed a heavy viral load of more than 11 (no reference range was provided).  Per reporter, on presentation to the emergency room the patient was afebrile, had a blood pressure 183/106 mmHg, pulse rate of 82 per minute and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Treatment included anti-hypertensives and intravenous diuretics. On day 3 of hospitalization, patient left the hospital against medical advice.  Based on reporter&#39;s causality, the event purpuric rash is assessed as possible related to mRNA-1273. However, the reporter also indicated it could have been precipitated by the underlying thrombocytopenia, liver cirrhosis and Hepatitis C infection.

Symptoms progressed and included severe fatigue and muscle aches.  Patient was taking tizanidine and oxycodone to manage muscle / body aches which had been prescribed for his chronic back pain issues.  Patient was noted to be excessively sleeping, and also had fallen twice between vaccination and hospital presentation. 4 days following vaccination he presented to the emergency department with severe lethargy and confusion.  He was admitted with presumption of overdose of medication, given activated charcoal.  A CT of the head (4/11/2021) was completed which demonstrated No acute intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection or acute territorial infarct. Suggestion of a chronic lacunar infarct involving the left lentiform nucleus. Regions of low attenuation involving the cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left, which, allowing for image degradation secondary to patient motion artifact, are likely artifactual in nature; follow-up is recommended to assess for stability/resolution.For first several days patient suffered delirium with agitation, he was disoriented to place and time.  CK on admission, 4/11/2021, was 17,086, indicating rhabdo.  Creatinine on admission was 4.39, indicating new acute renal failure. Liver enzymes were elevated with AST of 477 and ALT of 218. PT was 10.6, INR 0.99.  ABG demonstrated metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.22, co2 45, HCO3 18.4.  Over several days his mentation improved however was noted to still need light supplemental oxygenation.  Because of the delirium a brain MRI was completed on 4/13/2021, which demonstrated acute ischemic infarcts on DWI sequence noting bilateral, right greater than left, acute cerebellar infarcts. Small acute lacunar infarcts at bilateral basal ganglia/genu internal capsule.  Due to the infarcts a stroke workup was completed. Carotid duplex was performed and notable for only small bilateral carotid plaque.  Renal ultrasound unremarkable.  A CTA of the chest was completed on 4/15/2021 for continued hypoxemia, need for nasal cannula to maintain spo2 saturation.  Findings included multilobar pulmonary embolism.  Venous duplex dopplers of the lower extremities were also completed on 4/15/2021 demonstrated an isolated left popliteal vein DVT. No evidence of right leg DVT.  Over several days CK and Cr returned to baseline / normal levels.  He remains hospitalized and is still undergoing treatment.

That was followed by loss of balance, weakness, and inability to walk.  He collapsed and either passed out or slept for 2-3 hours.  Upon awakening he still felt weak and unbalanced.  He also had bitten his tongue and lip while unconscious. He slowly recovered over a period of 3-4 days after the vaccination.  He has never before had a stroke or a seizure. No one was with him to observe any of his symptoms.

                                                Within an hour or two of the vaccine second dose every area where I have ever had joint problems gave me problems. The worst was the arthritis in my left thumb, which also suffers from Carpal tunnel. My thumb where I do have arthritis became so painful and sensitive to any movement that I could not use it. At one point the pain took me to my knees. I now think that the far above average pain in that joint that I have been having for  several weeks  may have been from the first dose but the extreme increase in pain right after the vaccine seems very likely to be the vaccine. I also had painful electric like jolts in my back and ankle and have been experiencing higher than normal chest, center of rib cage pain. All these areas are problem spots for me but for all of them to flare up at once right after the vaccine is unprecedented as was the pain in my left wrist/thumb.

Was having abdominal pain and rapid heart rate since infection, had not been seen by a medical provider during or after infection.  No PCP.  He reported during observation time that he had a rapid heartrate.  I monitored him for another 20 minutes with no improvement (HR in 120?s, regular.  No other symptoms) and sent him to the ED.

                                                Because pt was uncomfortable he did not use his CPAP machine. 45 hours after second dose was administered my husband was sitting up in bed eating breakfast, He tilted his head back to swallow his his escitalopram and baby aspirin, sipped his coffee chewed and swallowed. He then went speechless and began staring off to his left. He lost consciousness. His chin stretched out to the left and his head rolled back as did his eyes. Eyelids remained open. His head and upper body began to tremble and seemed stiff though his hands remained down by his side. Time slows when in such an emotional situation but I think the complete event lasted about 35 real seconds.  I wonder if his temperature being elevated a couple of degrees and with his absolute lymphocytes on the rise if his strong immune response revealed a family predisposition to dystonia?

A few minutes after taking the vaccine, blood pressure fell, dizzy with risk of passing out, weak, very rapid heart beat, nausea. Jumped up and starting moving to create energy to avoid passing out. The dizziness reduced somewhat and did not get worse, but was still present. Heart rate slowed after a significant period of time. Then symptoms resolved. No emotional triggers and no history of any such events at any time in 60 years.

                                                On or around April 15th I developed a pain in my left calf.  As a senior citizen and avid golfer I chalked this up to age and activity. But the  problem didn&#39;t go away and on some days would be more painful than others. Additionally, the point where my calf hurt seem to move around and sometimes be higher on my calf behind my knee.  Some days the pain was gone altogether only to return the later that same day or the next.   At the beginning of May I started to develop a cough.  I had no fever or other symptoms so I thought it might be seasonal allergies.   The cough continued to get worse so I made an appointment with my doctor on 5/26/21 and was seen that day. I was given a COVID test even though I had taken the vaccine and scheduled for an ultrasound on Friday 5/28/21. During the ultrasound they discovered a DVT in my left calf that extended from my ankle to behind my knee.  Since I was also coughing they scheduled me for a CT scan that same day. The CT scan showed multiple PE&#39;s in both lungs. They sent me to the hospital.

On 6/5 He awoke at 3:00 a.m.  in the setting of leg cramps.  He got out of bed to walk off the cramps, but then developed substernal chest pain.  He describes the pain as ?squeezing? and cramping with radiation towards the left shoulder.  He began to feel lightheaded and diaphoretic, and thus began driving himself to the ED.  On the way, he felt his symptoms were worsening so he called dispatch he recommended he pull over at a nearby gas station.  EMS met him there and transported him the rest of the way to the ED. In the outside ED, he was initially hypertensive to 175/99.

                                                He got his vaccine, had extreme pain in his right arm.  He went back to the pharmacy and let her know that it hurt for several days and then went away, and he is still having the tenderness in the arm.  It was so painful that he could not sleep on it due to the pain.   He then had no problems up until 5/24/21 when he noticed some swelling on his ankle of his right leg.  He put it in cold water to see if the swelling would go down and it did not.  Then he didn&#39;t think about it again until it was stiff, swollen and wanted to turn to the right side and hard for him to drive and taking his anti-inflammatories.  It progressively got worse and around 5/25/21 the swelling was severe and doubled in size and getting worse and on 6/3/21 he could not get his pants off due to the swelling and he went to the Dr. The next day.  He had pain behind the knee, ankle, pain in the leg.  He went to the doctor, and they sent him to the ER for an US which showed DVT of the right leg.  He was informed that it was large and that it was in the thigh of his right leg and not returning blood to his heart.  He was put on Eliquis 5 mg twice a day and is doing well for him.  The swelling is a little better, the ankle is still swollen, and the leg is still swollen, the top of his foot is really bad, front of his leg and thigh.  The knee does not seem to be swollen, but the thigh is.   He has no problem with the left side.  He is to follow up with his doctor on Thursday.  He is on Hydrocodone as well for the pain as needed for his neck pain and lower back.

On May 8 these symptoms gradually disappeared, but during the night I woke and was drenched in sweat. The night sweats continued for the next four nights and then disappeared. On May 13 my wife heard a strange noise in my chest which I later identified as a heart murmur. I did not have any pain or other obvious symptoms, but I felt a slight tingling in my toes and fingers. I went to urgent care, where I was referred for an echocardiogram. The echocardiogram was performed on the morning of May 21, and endocarditis with highly mobile vegetation on the right coronary cusp leaflet of the aortic valve was identified.

I had a moderate case of COVID in May 2020 and had positive IgG AB in August. The symptoms started with heavy shaking chills, lasting 1 1/2 hours , fever and most concerning sustained tachycardia with heart rate of 180&#39; to 200&#39; over hours, which then destabilized into runs of Vtach and complex ventricular dysrythmia, low BP, profound weaklness, head aches and joint and muscle pains ( similar to the experienced COVID symptoms )

At first it felt like congestion, but then started radiating into my shoulders, then into my arms and up into my neck. They called an ambulance. They gave me Benadryl and aspirin, which made me feel better.  They missed twice trying to blood, but said I refused, so they couldn&#39;t get blood results.  I don&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction.

My resting heart rate was at 100 for a few hours.  Normally, it&#39;s around 76.    I noticed on deep breaths, I felt the need to cough (no phlegm, just a dry cough.  One or two coughs per attempt).  No medical care sought.    Those symptoms dissipated and I felt good.  Then on January 20 and 21, the chills returned.  They lasted about 8-10 hours, then they were gone.  I also developed a headache during the 20 and 21 episodes.  I checked yes in the below adverse recovery box, but I am uncertain as to what tonight and the rest of the days have in store.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

Due to past history of allergic reactions, gave him diphenhydramine at 3:42pm. He felt okay for a short period of time and then started to have tightness in his chest.  He could still breathe fine, but called 911 due to past anaphylactic reactions.  While on the phone with 911 he stated feeling more tightness in his  and then decided to give epi-pen shot in left upper left thigh at 4:02pm.  The EMT showed up immediately after and took patients vitals.  EMT advised if wanted follow up monitoring could take him to ER. Patient wanted to go to ER for further monitoring.  We followed up with patient&#39;s wife and she said he was still not feeling very good and had follow up appointments with his cardiologist.  He also came in the store on 2-26-21 and all his test were normal, but still was not feeling like himself.

Still experiencing a lot of anxiety at night. Admits to heart palpitations and hard time breathing. Can&#39;t sit still. Reports manic episodes and cycles of depression over the course of hours. Patient states it has gotten a tiny bit better. Tried trazodone which helps temporarily. Denies chest pain. Patient states he has no appetite. Palpitations resolved pretty quickly. Shortness of breath is described as tightness that comes with anxiety feeling. Resolves with shoulder massage. Occurring three times per day. Also admits to dry mouth. Patient admits to needing to sleep with multiple pillows or feeling like he had to sit up and couldn&#39;t lay down as shortness of breath would get worse.  EKG in office on 2/24/21 showed ST-T changes and given symptoms patient was transferred to emergency room via ambulance.  Work up in hospital was unremarkable and patient was diagnosed with pericarditis (unknown etiology) and prescribed NSAIDS from ER and discharged.  Admission not required.   Patient followed up to us as outpatient on 03.02.21.  Patient felt much better and had not take motrin for 1 day.  COVID testing obtained at this point (unclear why ER did not send it).  Patient referred to outpatient cardiology given risk of cardiovascular disease, stress echo, and event monitor.

Daily diarrhea, watery stool, cramping and bleeding lasting one month.  Currently slowly resolving.  Treated with a variety of remedies over the month, individually and in combination.  ( Pepto bismol, charcoal capsules, imodium, rice, tumeric, and Xifaxin)  Imodium would stop the cramping but not the wateriness of the stool.  Unlike any diarrhea over the course of my life. I will not be taking any booster shots.

Gave him another bottle of water, explaining re: low BP and hydration.  Reassessed after an additional 5 minutes (11:53) with BP further improved to 100/62.  Denied improvement in vision or lightheadedness.  Client sat for 30 more minutes.  I attended to another client at 12:00, with another RN monitoring him.  When I returned to check on him, she said he did not exhibit any signs of being in distress and got up to leave voluntarily.

                                                The night of my vaccination I went to bed early. I was tired and a little achey. I woke up about 2:00 AM with significant discomfort in my chest. My chest felt heavy and when I inhaled it felt like someone was squeezing both lobes of my lungs. I got out of bed and went to the bathroom to urinate. I went back to bed and tried to get back to sleep. The discomfort in my chest continued and seemed to get worse. I got back out of bed at about 2:45 AM and went downstairs where I walked around my living room to see if that would help me feel better. I continued to feel severe discomfort in my chest and lungs. I did not otherwise feel bad. I was not congested. I could  still take a deep breath but it hurt to do so.  I took my temperature and I did not have a fever. At about 3:00 AM I woke up my wife and she drove me to the emergency room at Medical Center. On the car ride to the hospital I started to feel much better. By the time I checked into the emergency room most of my discomfort had dissipated and only a very slight feeling of heaviness remained in my chest.

I had symptoms of a Pulmonary embolism while cross country skiing March 18 and officially diagnosed with PE on March 22, 2021.  I was tested for Covid 19 on March 23, 2021 with negative results.  I had been reporting my side effects (which were none) for the previous 6 weeks following the second vaccination. I did have cramping like feeling in my right calf following a x-country ski weekend about 4 weeks prior  to the actual PE (2/22/21) but it appeared to resolve after about 7-10 days

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event.    On 23-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MYALGIA (Minor Aches like he was getting a cold). On 25-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and COVID-19 (Tested positive for COVID) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation), COVID-19 (Tested positive for COVID) and MYALGIA (Minor Aches like he was getting a cold) outcome was unknown.   She said they had been very careful, but had met with some friends and 2 of their friends also tested positive.    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: positive (Positive) positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.      The day after he received the vaccine he felt minor aches, like he was coming down with a cold. On that Thursday he went into a fib. She took him to the ER and it took several hours to regulate his heart rate. While making arrangement to transfer him to a new hospital they did a COVID test and it was positive. They were shocked as he had not been showing any symptoms. He spent the night in the hospital.  Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. However the event of Covid 19 and myalgia is unlikely related to vaccine. Covid 19 is  a confounding factor for the event of myalgia and base of the available information, the vaccine is not known cause of Covid 19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and a few weeks later he noticed jaundice and hematuria. He was admitted to the Hospital, and was noted to have dramatically elevated eosinophils (26.29 k/uL), elevated creatinine (2.36 mg/dL) and elevated LFTs (AST/AST/Alk Phos/Tbili all up, mostly direct). His eosinophils improved with pulse dose steroids and the diagnostic work up continues. There is diagnostic uncertainty about what caused this dramatic increase in eosinophilia, but it appears temporally related to getting the vaccination. Our working diagnosis is autoimmune vasculitis, but he is also being treated for possible parasitic infection, and will require very close follow-up. 61M with PMHx HTN p/w generalized fatigue, L flank pain, and decreased UOP.   He was in his usual state of health until 5 days prior to admission with onset of general fatigue/sluggishness. This was followed by a few days of dull abdominal pain, watery bowel movements, and increased frequency which spontaneously resolved, though the fatigue persisted. Yesterday evening, he noticed new L flank pain, red urine, and decreased UOP associated with mild dysuria (he describes it as needle-like pain in his urethra) which prompted him to call EMS. Denies fevers/chills/night sweats, myalgias, respiratory symptoms, melena/hematochezia. He&#39;s never had pyelonephritis or kidney stones before, no recent urinary instrumentation, antibiotic use, or hospital stays.    He recently received the first COVID vaccine and is due for the second COVID shot on Monday. He lives with his sister and works as a mechanic. He is not on any other medications or supplements. Not currently sexually active.

Notably has been afebrile and fairly well appearing. Symptoms were preceded by several days of watery diarrhea, cough with sputum production and subjective weight loss. Recently received moderna vaccine, and he was concerned it causes his symptoms.  Underwent extensive workup as below with involvement of multiple services including Renal, Pulm, Rheum, Allergy, ENT, and Cardiology. Had one nasal lesion biopsied by ENT, which was non-diagnostic. Renal bx prelim without clear e/o vaculitis, although obtained after steroids. Negative testing for primary hypereosinophilic syndrome. Extensive w/u notable for ANCA positive at 1:80 with  MPO only slightly elevated (20, uln 19) and PR3 wnl.  cMRI with eosinophilic cardiomyopathy, for which cards was consulted as below. Additionally, toxacara ab positive and schistosoma ab indeterminate, although per ID both schistosomiasis and toxacara infection unlikely. Per rheum, overall felt presentation 2/2 hypereosinophilic syndrome, potentially the eosinophilic stage of EGPA (given low &#43; ANCA, low &#43; MPO) vs.  End organ effects of idiopathic eosinophilia. Briefly received CTX 2g IV qd (4/10 - 4/12) until diagnostics returned. Treated with solumedrol 1g qd x3d (4/11-4/13) transitioned to prednisone 60 mg qd (4/14-) to be continued until rheum f/u, with rapid decline in eosinophilia. Received pre-treatment with PO ivermectin 20 mg before steroids. Treated with flonase nasal spray, symbicort and albuterol for respiratory symptoms. Deferred cyclophosphamide, with consideration of IL-5 or IL-5R targeted biologics as an outpatient. Treated with atovaquone for PCP ppx. Per ID, treated with praziquantel (for schistosomiasis) and albendazole (for toxacara) out of an abundance of caution, although low c/f visceral larva migrans given lack of compatible imaging findings and no known exposure to dogs and cats or schistosomiasis given remove travel history.

Baseline Cr unknown but Cr was 1.5 (OSH BI) and urine alb:Cr was elevated to 36 in 6/2018, at which time CKD was thought to be 2/2 untreated HTN. Now presented with persistent hematuria, HTN and proteinuria with UCx without e/o infection, all favoring nephritic process. Renal and urology consulted MALB/CCR 994.5. CT scan with hydronephrosis, felt to be eosinophilic pyelonephritis. Pt underwent uncomplicated renal bx 4/14 (after steroids) which showed preliminary very mild focus of interstitial nephritis with scattered eosinophils and immunofluorescence evidence suggestive of a mild immune complex-mediated disease without current activity. EM pending. He was treated with sodium bicarb 1300 mg bid. Hematuria improved but did not resolved by time of discharge. Cr on discharge 1.6, close to baseline of 1.5 in 2018.    #Sclera Icterus #CBD Dilation on CT #Elevated LFT Sclera icteric and CBD dilation on RUQUS to 1.8cm with gallbladder sludge and small gallstones. MRCP with diffuse intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation to the level of ampulla, with associated ductal and gallbladder wall edema, complex material in the gallbladder lumen and CBD, and confluent periportal lymphadenopathy. No obstructing stone or discrete mass. Findings likely represent cholangitis such as eosinophilic cholangitis in light of severe eosinophilia.. No documented LFTs here, but OSH (BI) records indicate normal LFTs and viral hepatitis studies in 6/2018. Repeat Hep B non-reactive non immune, HCV non immune, HAV non-reactive.  BIli remained stable and ALT and AST continued to rise after initiation of steroids. GI was consulted. RUQUS 4/15 with dopplers with persistently dilated CBD to 1.4 cm with sludge in CBD but with patent portal vein and hepatic veins. Anti smooth muscle ab positive on day of discharge; antimitochondrial ab pending. LFT uptrending at time of discharge, although patient declined to stay inpatient for further workup. LFT at discharge ALT 194, AST 114, ALP 262, TBili 6.3, DBili 5.3. ERCP to be considered as an outpatient.     #HTN SBP on admission 160-180. History of HTN, not on any home anti-hypertensives. Per BI records, he was prescribed amlodipine 10/valsartan 160 in 6/2019, but pt reports self-discontinuation after ~2 doses. BP remains poorly controlled. Likely related to potential nephritic syndrome or renal infiltration by eosinophils, likely with contribution of high dose steroids. While inpatient, treated with hydralazine, labetalol, carvedilol, and amlodipine. BP regimen on discharge amlodipine 10 mg qd, carvedilol 25 mg qd. Avoiding ARBs and ACEI per Renal, although will likely need to add once AKI resolved.    #Microcytic Anemia Patient with drop in Hct from 14.1 on admission to 11.4 4/14. Continues with hematuria, but denies current hematochezia. Suspect combination of blood loss and hypopoliferation given RPI 0.29, likely anemia of inflammation/acute illness given ferritin 1.010. Vitamin B12 &gt;2000, Folate 11. Iron 151, unable to calculate TIBC. Noted to have persistently low MCV in low 70. Hemoglobin electrophoresis ordered.    #Vitamin D deficiency #HyperPTH 25-OH Vitamin D 6. No e/o hypocalcemia. Phos slightly elevated on admission, but subsequently downtrending, likely iso renal dysfunction. Treated with ergocalciferol 50,000 U weekly x12 weeks   #Right mandible lesion Sclerotic changes of the right mandible near the condyle noted on CT scan. Surgeon recommends outpatient follow-up, although patient declined.    #Hematochezia #Hemorrhoids Patient with new bloody diarrhea 4/11. Some e/o hemorrhoids on exam. CBC stable. Treated with tucks pads, dibucaine ointment and hydrocortisone cream.   #Little Medical Follow-up Pt reports that he has not seen a doctor in ~3 years.Cholesterol 124l LDL 73, HDL 10. HgbA1c 5.2. Will join Dr&#39;s panel on discharge   #CHIP mutation  RHP with DNMT3A mutation at low VAF. Will follow in cancer precursor clinic

                                                After my second shot after approximately 8 hours I got a severe headache perfuse sweating and vomiting, this went on continuously until Monday when I went to a family practitioner, she blew off my symptoms and sent me home where I continued to have these symptoms on and off. When on I was completely disabled. I filed a complaint they called on 4/15/2021, and told me I should go to ER, I told them I was flying the next day to see my mother who is passing away. I promised if my symptoms were still there in morning I would go to ER. I woke up feeling great and then I had a bowel movement my headache was so bad I thought I was having a stroke, I started sweating bullets and vomiting. it was so bad the only thing I can compare it to was when I had  Tick fever in the early 90&#39;s. I called 911 at hospital I was in a dangerous arrhythmia throwing PAC&#39;s and going in and out of 2nd third degree heart blocks. They can not figure out why, the neurologist I saw theory is the same I had, a severe inflammatory reaction to the 2nd moderna shot. He put me on a 3 day course of prednisone which helped a lot in my recovery. I am currently on a heart monitor to see if the heart block was just temporary. I see the neurologist again in 3 weeks.

                                                32 hours after the vaccine, he suffered a massive heart attack due to a blood clot and a massive clot in the right arm. He went to the hospital and under went surgery at 12 am on Saturday. The coronary surgeon mentioned that this was not from heart disease as all vessels were clear. Rather, this was due to an embolism due to an unknown origin. A further work up concluded that he also had blood clots throughout his body (both lungs, one kidney, heart, liver, legs, arms, and possibly brain). By 12 p.m. we were asked back to the hospital as he was worsening. Treatment options included a heparin drip, which caused a brain hemorrhage. He was just at the doctors two times this week, on Tuesday and Wednesday and was fine no issues found. They went through with the 2nd dose and came to our home on Thursday.

                                                Went in to physician due to shortness of breath. Found pericarditis.  The physician went in to do a pericardial window and the patient experienced bleeding so the surgeon had to perform a sternotomy to determine where the bleeding originated. Once the chest was opened the surgeon noted a mass that appeared to look like a fungus on the heart. Biopsy of the heart mass, pericardial fluid and a mass on the liver were performed.  The biopsy results originally came back as adenocarcinoma of the urinary (bladder, kidneys) origin. The physicians noted that that would be highly unlikely since there were no tumors noted in the urinary area.  Pathology was sent off again from the pericardial fluid that was obtained by &#34;extracting RNA from tumor enriched sections.  This pathology showed the cells to be squamous cell carcinoma with 90% probability of coming from the lung. The doctors are finding this very unusual .  My husband was very healthy prior to this with no symptoms.  Could this be caused by the vaccine?

The patient presents with fever. 61 year old male presents to the emergency department for a fever with an onset of 1 day. Patient was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in April 2021. Patient states he has had 2 rounds of chemotherapy but states he could not have his 3 round last week because his white count was too low. Patient is also complaining of dull chest pain that is exacerbated with deep breathing, cough, and a headache but denies vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, dysuria, hematuria, and nausea. Patient was diagnosed with blood clots on 05/09/2021 but states that he is not having similar symptoms to when he was diagnosed with blood clots. Patient is taking Xarelto. He has never had COVID but is vaccinated. Patient sees Dr. (Name) at the UI Oncology clinic.  5/25/21: 61-year-old male on chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, also recently diagnosed pulmonary embolism on rivaroxaban, presents with 1 day of fever.  Initially, did not have any cough or shortness of breath, was admitted to the hospital, where a chest x-ray, urinalysis and examination failed to reveal an exact source of the fever.  His absolute neutrophil count was less than 500, so he was admitted for neutropenic fever. Cultures were obtained. IV antibiotics started.  COVID-19 was tested and, surprisingly, came back positive.  The patient has actually had both of his COVID-19 vaccines and basically, does not have pneumonia, shortness of breath, or hypoxemia.  We did not use any medications for COVID while in the hospital, watching for any signs of respiratory compromise, but none developed.  Blood cultures were negative.  He was switched from ceftazidime to doxycycline at time of discharge.  Will follow up with Dr. (Name) for his next cycle of chemotherapy.  Because of his COVID-19 positivity, we will not schedule any immediate followup appointments, although the patient will call if he has persistent fever, dyspnea, or signs of hypoxemia.  For the past 2 days, the T- max has been 99.9, and most the time 98.6.  He was seen the day of discharge, doing quite well.  Blood pressure 153/80, pulse 90, regular, oximetry 95% on room air.  Glucose was 210. Discharged on Rivaroxaban 15 mg b.i.d., doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d., Robitussin AC as needed for cough, Lantus 28 units at bedtime, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily.  The patient did get 1 dose of Neupogen 480 mcg subcu while in the hospital.

When I woke up, my body temperature was 100.4 F. Around 10 am I went to the kitchen to prepare my breakfast. During this time I was feeling that my head was heavy. Then I start to feel that I cannot stay anymore and I sat down on my stool. I don&#39;t know what happened after that because I lost my consciousness. After that   I found myself lying on the back of my kitchen floor and I was completely wet. Few minutes later my body temperature was normal 97.88 F and I started to feel much better.

                                                On June 1, I was hospitalized for pancreatitis although I had none of the preexisting conditions for it such as a history of drinking alcohol or anything else that the hospital could find.  Next on June 16, I began feeling lightheaded.  I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a specialist.  After some testing, Doctor informed me that my heart was beating lower than the normal range.  I just had a heart stress test done a few years earlier and my heart was more than fine.  It is hard for me to understand how my heart health could have such a dramatic reversal so quickly.

He was transported to Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. His partner reports he was healthy with the exception of hypertension. She reports he was thin, never smoked, didn&#39;t drink alcohol and rarely used marijuana.  She reports only a visual autopsy was performed and pt was cremated.

They said it might have been anxiety or tissue got stuck under rib. They did keep me overnight for observation.

                                                My husband passed away June 3, 2021 resulting from complications which began a few hours after receiving his 2nd Moderna shot on April 29, 2021. He never tested positive for Covid19, however his first symptoms were the typical fever, muscle aches, rash. He declined daily from a host of mysterious symptoms including full body rash, blood clots, muscle spasms, atrial fibrillation, ulcers lining his esophagus and colon, and exorbitant WBC (157K) with extremely high eosinophils (90%). He was treated with a host of drugs including antibiotics, steroids, blood thinners, ivermectin and finally chemotherpay (Campath). His ICU team  included hematology, pulmonology, ... oncology and infectious disease. After an incredible amount of diagnostic testing ( daily routine blood work, EKGs, chest x-rays, CT scans, MRI, bone marrow biopsy, endoscopy, colonoscopy, skin biopsy, genetic testing) no definitive diagnosis could be made, however, he was given the possible diagnosis of chronic eosinophilia leukemia in late May. The big question among the medical staff was, &#34;Did the shot trigger something?&#34; He was eventually treated with the chemotherapy drug Campath, which reduced the WBC and EOs some, but his organs, especially, lungs had been very compromised by the high WBC and eosinophils. Several days after being placed on a ventilator and given a feeding tube at the end of May, a CT scan and MRI confirmed patient had suffered multiple strokes. He passed away a half hour after being taken off the ventilator the morning of June 3, 2021. His death certificate read:  A. cardiopulmonary arrest  B. acute hypoxic respiratory failure  C.  hypereosinophila

                                                a 62 y/o M  who presents with concerns for an allergic reaction to the second dose of the Covid vaccine.  According to him he got the vaccine around 8:45 AM.  He has a history of anaphylactic type reactions with a swelling and urticaria in the past but has not had any symptoms in the last 5 years.  He felt sudden onset pit in his stomach, tingling and warm sensations over his face and some chest tightness.  He denies all the symptoms currently.  He did get medications prior to arrival but states his symptoms were already getting better before he been given anything.  He was given epinephrine as well as Benadryl beforehand.  He denies any symptoms currently.  Denies headache, change in vision, difficulty swallowing, lightheadedness or vertigo, chest pain, sore throat, wheezing, cough, nausea or vomiting, rash, falls or injuries.  Denies any recent foreign travel or sick contacts.  He did work a full shift yesterday and was coming off a 24-hour shift prior to getting his vaccination. He denies any significant reactions to the first vaccine.   Medical Decision Making  On initial presentation is an overall well-appearing 62-year-old male who has normal vital signs without fever or tachycardia.  He is presenting with concern for allergic reaction of the field to a recent vaccination.  The vaccine was given roughly 1 hour prior to arrival. He was given epinephrine intramuscularly as well as IV Benadryl.  He states he is currently feeling mildly tired from the Benadryl. He denies any other recurrent symptomatology and feels better.  Examination is not concerning for anaphylaxis at this time, no evidence of airway involvement or multisystem involvement.  No evidence of local allergic reaction.  Low clinical concern for occult infection, metabolic abnormality, ACS or arrhythmia for a cause of his symptoms.  He is overall very well-appearing.  Labs have been obtained as part of screening for reactions to the vaccination per CDC recommendations including a tryptase and C4 complement.  They were drawn over an hour after the vaccine was administered. ECG was within normal limits.  After observation patient remained asymptomatic.  Did offer steroids, however he wanted to hold off on them as he just got his vaccination which seems appropriate at this time.  He was sent home with a new EpiPen.  We also gave him follow-up in the allergy clinic.  He has any worsening symptoms we do recommend he use the EpiPen as well as call 911.  He is understanding.  At this point he stable for outpatient management.  I did tell him he should expect to feel aches and potentially have inflammatory response to the vaccine, he is understanding of this.  Pt was discharged home/self-care. Pt provided strict return precautions, including but not limited to, any worsening symptoms or any new concerning symptoms. Otherwise, Pt instructed to see PCP on an as needed basis.

Between 5-10 minutes after injection, I just passed out (don&#39;t recall that happening).  Woke to 2 EMT&#39;s by my side asking to check my blood pressure..  I don&#39;t recall the numbers however they stated I &#39;bottomed out&#39;.  shortly after gaining consciousness, I became nausea loosing contents of stomach twice.  Remained under observation for 30&#43; minutes, then wife drove me home.  Slept until 5:00 when I was steady enough to walk unaided, and finally eat some dinner.

He also had a tingling on his left leg.  This tingling started about 24 hours after the shot and is still continuing to occur.  The tingling is only on his left side which is the side of his body that received the shot.

                                                After receiving the first Moderna vaccination in my Left arm, I started feeling pain in the area of the vaccination site on the evening of 03/22/21. As time progressed I started to realize I was losing all motion in my arm and weakness on my entire left side of my body, but assumed this was a side-effect of the vaccination .  I was not concerned until my wife alarmed me in the morning when she looked at me and noticed the left side of my face drooped and had that I had difficulty standing, no balance, little use of my left leg and no use of my left arm and hand.  At that point, 7:00am 03/23/21, my wife drove me to the ER.  I was admitted and an inpatient for 15 days including PT/OT/ST therapies at the hospital for Stroke.

Both times about 7 days into each does I started noticing heart palpitations. I do not have any heart disease except controlled HBP. After the first dose, they started and were happening often and was concerning ? then they stopped after 5 days right before my scheduled second shot. Now after my second dose they have started again a week after the dose.

After resting, laying down, the lowest it would go is 11 -107 BPM. We decided to go to the emergency office. I got an EKG, and by that time everything had slowed down and looked fine. A headache persisted. I&#39;ve never had a resting pulse that high before. It was weird.

Left arm was a little sore, but no other adverse effects of vaccination.   At approx. 01:00 on 4-9 I was awoken by what felt like severe chills with elevated heart rate.  I tried to walk around my house to see if that would ease the symptoms, it did not.  About 01:45 I started drinking a Brisk ice tea.  That helped &amp; allowed me to fall back asleep.  Felt sluggish all day 4-9 with flu-like body aches &amp; pains, so stayed in bed most of day.  On 4-10 I resumed my normal activity level.

                                                Patient woke up the morning of 04/13/21 and explained to his wife that he felt &#34;foggy&#34; mentally. He went about his morning chores on the farm. He came inside to sit in his recliner with his feet elevated for almost an hour.  At approximately 9:40 am, his wife observed that patient suddenly stiffened without warning and cried out. His arms stretched over his head in the chair and his legs stiffened like a board. His body was visibly contracted.  He continued to cry out. His eyes were closed, he was salivating, and his forehead was sweating.  His wife watched him move his arms suddenly to his lap, however, his fists were clenched tight.  She tried to get his attention by calling to him. She noticed his lips were turning blue. She continued shaking him, shouting and then slapped him. Patient did not respond.  She called 911. After 7 minutes, he finally relaxed some and started snoring loudly in the chair. He continued sleeping soundly for about 10 minutes while she waited for EMS to arrive.  The wife did elevate his head , as she was told by 911 to do so.  She was not able to wake him up during this time period. When the EMS arrived, he was just starting to move. They got him up to stand and he was able to verbalize his need to go to the restroom.  They arrived at the hospital at approximately 10:25 am and was released after testing at approximately 2:30 pm.

                                                I had a (first ever) stroke. I was attempting to take Flecainide for atrial fibrillation to reduce palpitations, the week prior and during the day of the stroke. I tried to take Flecainide twice before in the past few months, but I was unable to tolerate it. When I had the stroke, I didn&#39;t realize I was having one since I&#39;m in very good health. I emailed my electro-cardiologist about my symptoms that day and found it difficult to use the appropriate words and reading the email later, I could see a number of mistakes. My ability to comprehend spoken language that day was impaired. I could only keep a few sentences in my head at a time and my attention span was poor as well, like having significant ADHD, which I don&#39;t have. I was unable to retain simple amounts of information the day of the stroke. I didn&#39;t seek treatment on the day of the stroke since I felt it was more of the side effects I had been experiencing from Flecainide. After going to the hospital I felt good and much improved, cognitively. An ER neurologist said that my stroke was a 2 on a scale of 1 to 42. Over the remainder of March and until this day (April 16, 2021), I have made steady and rapid improvement. I attribute my recovery to the lower level of stroke damage and the fact that I worked out every day with physical exercise and I worked out cognitively by doing a series of activities that I chose myself: reading out loud, reciting poetry and tongue twisters, playing logic and puzzle games on the PC, returning to my writing tasks for work, practicing grammar, and speaking at length with family and friends as a way to practice speaking. I had one appointment with an occupational therapist and two appointments with a speech therapist and have completed assessment. I now feel I am nearly completely recovered with an odd sense of some improvement in certain areas such as heightened mood and quicker connections for noticing practical matters.

Slumped in my chair grasping the sides holding on. Informed the person that gave injection that I might pass out, she said that I could sit there until I felt ready to go. Took deep yoga breaths while grasping on the chair hoping I would not pass out fall and crack my head. It slowly subsided. She kept saying I could go when I felt better. Really! I finally left after 30 minutes. Sat in my car with windows open for another half hour.  Felt better as the day went on, slept well and felt better the next day.

                                                Extensive DVT requiring surgery. Received second Moderna vaccine approximately one week prior to admission, presented with acute onset of left leg swelling and pain.  Left lower extremity ultrasound demonstrated an extensive deep venous thrombosis extending from the common femoral vein into the peritoneal and posterior tibial vein with a patent IVC.  He was given a treatment dose of enoxaparin and admitted to the hospitalist service.  Overnight he developed diminished sensation in his toes and vascular surgery was consulted.  On 3/31/2021 he underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the left superficial femoral and common femoral veins as well as stenting of the left common iliac vein stent.  Of note he was noted to have May Thurner physiology with compression of the left common iliac vein by the external iliac artery on the right.  Post procedurally the patient&#39;s swelling and edema was significantly improved.  He did not have any significant pain or difficulty ambulating.  On postoperative day #1 he was evaluated and found to be hemodynamically stable with improvement of his symptoms and stable for discharge home.  Prior to discharge it was discussed with the patient that he will need to be on a loading dose of Eliquis for 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg twice daily. No h/o COVID.

                                                On 3/4/21 noticed my left calf was swollen. I did not think much of it at first. A week later the swelling had progressed to include my ankle. Saw Dr. and ordered an ultrasound on both of my legs. Right leg was normal &amp; left lower leg had a clot(s) in it. Dr. ran blood work then prescribed Eliquis. Saw him in follow-up on April 14. Swelling down but not gone. Renewed the prescription for Eliquis and set a followup visit for Friday June 18. He ordered additional blood work to be drawn on Wednesday June 16 to have results at the next visit.

Does not carry epi pen with him though he has been prescribed one in past.             Vaccine administered 10:02am. Immediately after vaccine patient reported dizziness that persisted for about 60 min. He reports similar if less severe dizziness after flu vaccine one month ago and that he often feels dizzy after taking his morning dose of nortryptiline which he took today.            Symptoms evolved to include mild nausea, feeling that abdomen was &#34;shaking&#34;, and headache. No SOB or chest pain, feeling of throat closing, or rash. Patient AO x 3 throughout evaluation and talking throughout.             Fasting BG 234. Took basalglar 40u this AM and 5 of aspart. Drank 8oz chocolate milk 9:30am which is his typical breakfast.             He notes that his home BP this past week was elevated into SBP 170s though typically is in the 120s/70s without antihypertensive medications. Prolonged dizziness and hyperglycemia (454). Regular insulin 5u SQ administered. Patient symptoms after 60 min. Repeat BG essentially unchanged but patient symptomatically back to prevaccine baseline.   Discussed with ID on call. Plan for transport to SMMC lab for CH50 and tryptase with instructions to patient to repeat in more than 24 hours (to establish a baseline). Patient given strict ED precautions.

                                                Initial presenting symptoms upon awakening four days after his shot were muscle spasms, &#34;felt things in his chest,&#34; and dark urine. Within 48 he was confused and was unable to state his last name, which progressed to unresponsiveness by ~7 days after the vaccine. He has since become comatose and his brain MRI is notable for hyperintensity involving the deep gray nuclei as well as the periventricular and subcortical white matter diffusely, bilaterally. The etiology of his comatose state is still under investigation, but a detailed infectious, autoimmune, and malignancy work up at 2 different medical centers and have since been unrevealing as to alternate causes.

                                                I woke up at 3:10 am feeling cold and chilling. I took by temperature and it was 98.4. I normally have a temperature of 97.1 - 97.7. I take it daily multiple times. My hands were cold. When I got up and started moving around I didn&#39;t have any more chills. When I got up at 6:30 am. I just didn&#39;t feel well in general. Slight feeling of sniffles, congestion.  I would get some aches that went away in a few seconds. They were at various points in my body, knee joints, muscles, and my head. They were simply a nuisance. I felt tired all day. My blood pressure was up 15-20 points on both numbers during the day. I&#39;ve told my doctor when my blood pressure is higher, I&#39;m having more aches and pains as though I&#39;m fighting a virus. I tolerated the symptoms most of the day, letting my immune system try to work it out. My symptoms seemed worse at 5:45 pm, so I took two ibuprofen. My temperature was 98.9 at that point. The highest it&#39;s been. All my symptoms got better until 1:15 am. I woke up feeling like I was chilling, but not as bad as yesterday, so I took two more ibuprofen. I feel 50% better today and haven&#39;t taken any ibuprofen. Here is the really strange part. I had these exact symptoms and similar temperature ranges twic last year. In July and October I think. I didn&#39;t get tested last year because they were minor symptoms. They were just nuisance symptoms. I took ibuprofen right away last year.  I followed the masking guidelines, social distancing, etc. So, is it just coincidence I had similar symptoms last year two times, that I had when I getting the inactive Moderna vaccine? I had no reaction to the first shot.  I just wanted to provide the information in case it is helpful. Very strange. I expect no other symptoms in a couple of days.

No labs were done then.  He returned 3/19 with difficulty walking and talking, was sent to SNF after MRI with diagnosis (probably incorrect) of acute cerebral infarct.  He returned to the ED on 3/29 less alert, and no longer able to speak.  LP showed 10 WBC (mostly lymphs) and protein 70.  MRI was repeated, looked similar to previous scan , but reinterpreted as diffuse cerebritis, worst in basal ganglia.   By 4/02 he was deeply obtunded ... (cont. on next page)

NOTE: Automatic Wrist BP readings (also takes pulse) closely follows manually-taken Stethoscope Sphygmomanometer readings. 4/22/21 Doing active range of motion pre and post injection. 7:45pm Signs &amp; Symptoms (S/S) Mild - arm discomfort w/swelling, fatigue, lightheadedness, and body ache. Ice- alternating periods of 15 minutes on, then off - done several times. Lessen arm discomfort, no redness noted. Slow increase S/S through night. 4/23/21 mid afternoon- marked increase S/S plus start sporadic flush feeling, noted 1 x 1 inch oval red area over site. 8pm- Increased &amp; more constant flushed.

Monitoring temp, hoping peaked. 9:30pm 99.9 F- 9:50pm Felt very dizzy, self-palpated pulse- felt weaker than my normal, noted more distended veins on arms. Asked wife to get pulse oximeter- sat/pulse ranging 93-97, depending on finger, hand, how long on each; noted amplitude lower than my normal; 82-86 range pulse. 9:53pm Obtained BP R wrist supine 105/61 Pulse 82. Felt too dizzy for BP to be done in sitting. BP confirmed by second reading. BP wrist supine sys about 30 -35 &amp; diastolic about 10-20 below baseline. 9:56pm Took 1000mg Acetaminophen. 11pm Temp less than 99, marked decrease head to toe pain, more towards my mild lightheadedness at times due to my mild TB baseline. Able to ambulate. 4/23/21 4-5 am Temp low 98 range (more my normal). 7am BP L wrist supine 135/70 Pulse 69. Sat 98 reading obtained very quickly, pulse amplitude more my normal. Feeling better but not to Pre-vax. Repeated BP &amp; Sat readings twice during the rest of date. Don?t recall time of 1st BP 135/70 Pulse 70 &amp; Sat 96/Pulse 69, noted injection site redness. 9:30pm- started having headaches, pain on L side head (near site of my head wound/mild TBI site), slight increase lightheadedness, injection site red area increased in pain &amp; size to covering almost full deltoid area. BP 125/73 Pulse 65 Sat 97/ Pulse 65. Both Sat numbers obtained very quickly, as per my normal. Ice used. Alleviated pain to tolerable. Monitoring size of red area &amp; intensity/duration of lightheadedness. Recall a strong tingling sensation going down my left arm once. Noted change in sensation afterwards. Slight increase lightheadedness felt due to what usually happens in change in weather, like rain coming. Rain occurred. 4/25/21- Basically the peripheral of deltoid showing redness with some scattered redness centrally. At 8pm redness fully covering deltoid area. Will continue to monitor (&#34;Covid arm&#34;). Other than fatigue thought due to vax, NO S/S of markedly reduce platelets. If need be, will contact Teledoc. Have prior training as a respiratory therapist &amp; occupational therapist.

After a &#34;few&#34; days of feeling unwell despite treatment, presented to ER and was found to have AKI, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia. Over the course of several days rapidly deteriorated and developed MSOF, including liver failure, DIC, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and shock requiring pressors. Workup for VTE, including V/Q scan, LE dopplers, and head CT negative for thrombosis. Ferritin was found to be highly elevated (12,000) suggestive of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Per ER report, marrow positive for hemophagocytosis on smear. At time of report, transferred to Cancer Center for HLH treatment, currently in ICU, intubated, sedated, and on pressors. PF4 antibody pending.

                                                Heart arrhythmia; Blood Pressure went up to as high as 230-220 over 160-130.; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of ARRHYTHMIA (Heart arrhythmia) and HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS (Blood Pressure went up to as high as 230-220 over 160-130.) in a 62-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination.     No relevant medical history reported.  Concomitant products included LOSARTAN, METOPROLOL, SOTALOL, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE (KLOR-CON), APIXABAN (ELIQUIS) and FUROSEMIDE for an unknown indication.   On 13-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 13-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 18-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ARRHYTHMIA (Heart arrhythmia) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS (Blood Pressure went up to as high as 230-220 over 160-130.) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, ARRHYTHMIA (Heart arrhythmia) outcome was unknown and HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS (Blood Pressure went up to as high as 230-220 over 160-130.) had resolved. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 18-Apr-2021, Blood pressure measurement: 220-230 over 130-160 (High) 220-230 over 130-160 and 111/60 (Inconclusive) 111/60. On 18-Apr-2021, Electrocardiogram ambulatory: abnormal (abnormal) showed premature ventricular contractions.         Patient reported that his usual blood pressure was around 140/78-84&#34;. His doctor advised him to go to the hospital. He was given clonidine in the ER and his blood pressure dropped to 111/60. The caller was also hooked to a Holter monitor and it showed PVC. Once the blood pressure went down, he was sent home.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.

He was advised that he could be seen in the office the following Monday, 4/5/21, or may report to the nearest emergency department.  He opted to wait until 4/5/21, and was evaluated in the office.  Dr&#39;s staff reported to the pharmacy that a Doppler was ordered for patient, which revealed an &#34;acute DVT in the left proximal / mid-subclavian vein and axillary vein&#34;, and it was suspected that the Moderna 1st dose may have been related.  Pharmacy was contacted by the County Health Department ( nurse), and staff from  County Office of Epidemiology , and instructed to obtain further information from Dr&#39;s office to file this VAERS report.  Pharmacy was NOT able to successfully contact patient for further clarification on medications/prior conditions/allergies, as calls were not returned prior to completing VAERS report.

                                                On Friday, April 9, 2021 PT received the second Covid shot.  The shot was administered in the right arm. About 6:00 pm  on that same day significant pain started, affecting his right arm, elbow, shoulder , and chest.   By Monday 4/12/2021 the pain was so severe he went to  a local clinic  to get checked.  He was  prescribed Naproxen for pain.  He was still in so much pain on Tuesday 4/13 /2021 he went to the ER .  They took him immediately back to check for possible heart attack and blood clot.  After a stay of 6 hours  the tests came back that there was no heart attack  or a blood clot.  He was prescribed more pain medication.  Still not getting any relief from pain and now PT&#39;s fingers are going numb, PT went to See Dr.   on 4/15/2021. Dr.  determined that the shot had somehow effected  the nerve endings.  He gave him a dose pack of steroids by pill.   He told him to check back if not better in a while.   The week of April 19 the pain eased up through the day to around a level  3,  to only return at night to a level 10, resulting in more loss of sleep.   PT went back to Dr.  on Friday, 4/23/2021 and received a steroid shot in the hip and a prescription of Gabapentin.  The Dr&#39;s opinion was that it could take weeks to get better,  and discussed getting a referral to a neurologist.   Today is Thursday, April 29 and PT&#39;s  pain is still constant through the day at about a level 3-4 , but at night the pain level is severe.

                                                Patient admitted with left sided weakness on 4/21/21. First covid-19 vaccine (Moderna) received on 3/23/21. MRI/MRA shows acute infarcts of the right caudate body and striatum. H/o HTN, hep C with cirrhosis, COPD, tobacco abuse, alcohol use disorder, GTC seizure disorder. ECHO on 4/21/21 which was normal. Patient thought to be actively overusing alcohol at home. Patient was treated for stroke and discharged on medications to help with alcohol withdrawal symptoms (clonidine, gabapentin) as well as aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin for new stroke. Thrombocytopenia noted (platelets 50K), however patient?s platelets have historically been low likely related to alcohol use. Per hospitalist discharge summary, low suspicion for vaccine induced thrombocytopenia. HIT Ab test ordered on 4/21/21, resulted negative. It seems to be coincidental that stroke occurred about a month after patient?s first covid-19 vaccine but reported to VAERS for completeness. Did not add covid-19 vaccine to patient?s allergy list. Patient received second covid-19 vaccine (Moderna) on 4/28/21.

Went to the dentist on 04/24/21 due to having tooth extraction on 03/18/21. Dentist confirmed that had healed completely and recommended getting blood work done. Went to Urgent Care had blood drawn, report showed ZERO platelets. I was sent to ER where they ran a blood test again, platelets were ONE. 2 bags of platelets were infused, that brought platelets to 5.  I was then admitted to the hospital and four hours later platelets were down to 2. They infused another 2 bags of platelets. Blood test showed platelets at 10.  Four hours later the platelets were down to 4. On 04/25/21 I was diagnosed with ITP and was given an infusion of IVIG, on 04/26/21 my platelets were up to 16. They infused another IVIG on 04/26/21 and on 04/27/21 platelets were at 41. I was discharged on 04/27/21. Went to clinic on 04/29/21 and platelets were at 130.

                                                10 hours after the injection, suddenly bad pain at injection site and rising temp. Body started ching so bad that the soles of my feet hurt when walking. Temp increased during the night with sweats and cold chills. My usual body temperature is around 97 so when it went to 102.2, that is a high fever for me. Didn&#39;t sleep much because of all the discomfort. Nose totally clogged up, had to breath trough mouth only. Temp went down to 100.5 by the mroning. Slept all day and untill 5 AM Sunday 5/16. Very sore and took some Advil Saturday late afternoon. Didn&#39;t help. Sunday, now at 5:40pm ET, temp has returned to normal, but I am still sore all over and have no energy.

The patient was fine going to bed the night before, but in the morning about 20 hours after receiving the shot the patient was unresponsive to wake up in the morning. He struggled to open his eyes, but was able to awake with some coaxing. His blood sugar was 175, but came down after taking measures to lower his sugar. He was able to get up and walk around, drive like normal within 2-3 hours after waking up. The patient&#39;s wife states the reaction was abnormal, nothing different occurred the night before, the only change was the vaccine administration.

                                                palpitations; atrial flutter with RVR; This spontaneous case was reported by a physician (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of PALPITATIONS (palpitations) and ATRIAL FLUTTER (atrial flutter with RVR) in a 62-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 046B21A and 037A21B) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Ex-smoker and COVID-19 (was not hospitalized and got recovered at home) in December 2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia and Obesity.   On 19-Apr-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-May-2021, the patient experienced PALPITATIONS (palpitations) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ATRIAL FLUTTER (atrial flutter with RVR) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 17-May-2021 to 18-May-2021 due to ATRIAL FLUTTER and PALPITATIONS. The patient was treated with DILTIAZEM (CARDIZEM [DILTIAZEM]) (oral) ongoing from 17-May-2021 for Palpitations and Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, at a dose of UNK dosage form and DILTIAZEM (CARDIZEM [DILTIAZEM]) (intravenous) ongoing from 17-May-2021 for Palpitations and Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, at a dose of UNK dosage form. On 18-May-2021, PALPITATIONS (palpitations) and ATRIAL FLUTTER (atrial flutter with RVR) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In May 2021, Heart rate: high heart beats per minute (High) &gt; 120 bpm and high heart beats per minute (High) &gt; 100 bpm. On 17-May-2021, Computerised tomogram thorax: negative (Negative) Negative for a pulmonary embolism (PE). On 17-May-2021, Electrocardiogram: inconclusive (Inconclusive) new onset atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR), no ST changes. On 17-May-2021, Full blood count: normal (normal) normal. On 17-May-2021, Heart rate: high heart beats per minute (High) 115-150 bpm. On 17-May-2021, Mean arterial pressure: inconclusive (Inconclusive) &gt; 75.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient denied any history of sleep apnea. He denied fevers, night sweats, shaking, chills recently and denied any other complaints of chest pain, dyspnea or lightheadedness. He was not an alcohol user and had no new prescriptions. He had no history of thyroid disease and had not been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No concomitant medications were reported. Patient was hemostable throughout his emergency department stay. The patient got converted to sinus rhythm overnight and got discharged to home on 18-May-2021.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Patient´s cardiovascular risk factors are an important confounder for the event atrial flutter.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This is my second report on this.  The first report was more about the soreness, tiredness and feelings of lethargy.  But approximately 2 weeks after the shot I suddenly had high BP.  165/110 taken by nurses where I work.   Was taken to doctor. This continued on and off for about 5-7 days.  During this time my blood pressure fluctuated for no reason, and i kept having a rapid pulse even after sitting for long time periods- sometimes reaching 90-100 BPM.   Symptoms finally relaxed after a week and I felt normal again.  I then received the 2nd Covid vaccination on 2/19/21.  About 5 days after this the same symptoms occurred.   It came on faster and lasted longer.  Fluctuating BP again, and high heart rates. Sometimes associated with feelings of anxiety.  I did a follow up Doctors appt. and told them what I thought happened, that it was all from the vaccine.  It took about 2 weeks to get over this episode where my BP stabilized and my heart rate stay normal -around 70&#43; BPM.   To this day I have sharp heart pains.    First lot was Moderna #013L20A.  Second Lot was not specified on my card

Patient monitored by EMS provider x 1hr, no s/s adverse reaction. Patient started walking out of facility on his own and came back reporting he felt dizzy. He was initially hypertensive with a pulse of 70, respiratory rate 12, systolic BP 188.  We had him lay down and about 10 minutes later his blood pressure was 140/70.   After another 10 minutes or so we had him sit and drink water but his dizziness, while improved, did not go away and he started to have chills and was visibly shaking so 911 was called as we did not feel he could drive himself home. Patient was monitored in the emergency department at Hospital x 1hr and released with blood pressure WNL.

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

He is currently admitted at a different hospital.   After vaccine administration on-site, the patient became unconscious for a few minutes. However, this is common for him - he informed us that he almost always &#34;passes out&#34; after vaccine administration. He slowly returned to consciousness without any issues. He was seen by an ED physician prior to leaving the facility. Deemed to be in good health, patient also stated that he felt fine and believed he was okay to leave as these episodes occur frequently following vaccination.

If I do anything at all other then set my oxygen levels would drop into the low 80&#39;s.  I have also been monitoring my sugar levels.  I am not diabetic but did so because in ICU was using steroids which elevated sugar levels.  I continued to monitor it at home because I had to do injections for several weeks after leaving the hospital.  Have not had to use insulin til the other day.  Vision is very blurry.  Had that problem in the hospital but it has gone away but since I had the first vaccine everything is now blurry.  Left leg hurts to put weight on the heel. I have nerve damage to the left leg but this is a unique issue.  I&#39;m running a low grade fever 100.2 - in the morning it is normally 96.5-97.6 and this temperature was in the morning the day after the shot.  Neck is very sore.  I have rods from C3-C6 and the pain is in the muscle glands closer to the surface.  It is almost like it is attacking all areas of the body I previously had issues.  I spent October 25 - November 13 in Hospital, majority of time in ICU.

No heart beat pulse etc... used CPR machines and paddles  Patient had walked 6 1/2 miles that morning no problems did about 50-60 miles weekly outside.

This happened 1 1/2 hours after getting shot.

It almost like little shocks going thru my body. I had a video appointment with my Dr. and he prescribes doxycycline and prednisone.  The next day the fever went away and started to feel better (48 hours later).  I also tested positive for Covid on 12/24/20, I didn&#39;t wait 90 days before I got my vaccine.  I felt awful with the second dose, almost worse than being in the midst of Covid. I&#39;m currently on Workman&#39;s Comp. I&#39;m constantly out of breathe and have no energy, I use to have tons of energy. From my atoms apple to my sternum I have tons of pain. My lungs feel like I&#39;m smoking and have tons of pressure.  My Dr. ran test because I have the worst head aches. I&#39;m like slow motion.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included preexisting conditions of heart failure and kidney failure. No relevant concomitants were reported.   On unk Feb 2021 (during the first week of February), prior to onset of symptoms, the patient received their first dose of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 026L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for the prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.   On unknown date, the patient experienced a rash, but no other reaction. He reported taking no other medication when he had  received his first dose.   On 17 Feb 2021, the patient was hospitalized for his pre-existing conditions of heart failure and kidney failure. He was discharged on 21 Feb 2021. No treatment information was provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, rash, pre-existing heart failure and kidney failure red, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality the serious events kidney failure and heart failure are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 but possibly related to the consumer&#39;s pre-existing conditions of renal failure and cardiac failure, while the non-serious event of rash may be possibly related to mRNA-1273.

Pain is substernal, radiated to the left arm, associated with lightheadedness.  Denies diaphoresis or nausea.  Per EMS there were short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia  3/18: - remains inpatient admission as of 3/18/21 @ 0900 63 y.o. male with a past medical history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He states he was lifting a couch yesterday and his heart started beating fast.  He did not really have any chest pain, but felt a little bit lightheaded.  He called an ambulance and they brought into the ER.  In the emergency room his EKG did show some frequent PVCs.  However, he did not really require any intervention.  He was given 3 nitro, but it really did not make any difference in the way he was feeling.  The patient denies multiple times that he actually had chest pain.  He states he just felt like his heart was beating funny.  The patient&#39;s most recent stress test was a nuclear stress test in May of 2019.  Overnight, the patient has felt very well.  He denies any significant chest pain.  He denies any further heart palpitations.  On the monitor he would occasionally going to bigeminy, which is not abnormal for him.  EKG this morning was unremarkable.   After speaking with the patient&#39;s wife, she told me that he has had a several month history of very limited exertion.  She states every time he exerts he becomes extremely dyspneic and has heart palpitations and sometimes almost passes out.  She states last night he was extremely diaphoretic and very nearly passed out.

The BP settled down after 6 hours to so (took a lot of water and did some breathing). I am not concerned about what happened in the three days or so of the vaccination.  However, I am worried about the continuation of palpitations that seem to happen a few times a week.

                                                I recently received the second Moderna vaccine, April 20. The next day I experienced severe body aches and extreme tenderness to the skin of the arms and upper torso, followed by 1-2 days of malaise. Then, on 29-30 April, I began having extreme pain in the lower back, migrating up the thoracic spine and around the left to the mid-chest area. I took one 500mg Naproxen 3x/day which helped mitigate the pain temporarily. I then discovered a red blister on my side 1 May. Since then my symptoms have been painful back/chest and stabbing pain at the site of the blisters which followed the path of the pain described above. I was diagnosed with Shingles yesterday, 3 May. I have been prescribed 1000mg of Valacyclovir

                                                He got his vaccine, he had no reactions.  The next morning he woke up his arm was sore, and it was that was for 2 days.  Then his breathing starting getting worse.  He started coughing, couldn&#39;t lay down, could not sleep due to that.  He went to the ER and they told him that there was nothing wrong and that it was just allergies.  They told him to go home and take some OTC cold medicine and that everything would be okay.  A week later he went to another ER for the same thing as he continued not to be able to breath, they did a bunch of tests and said that nothing was wrong and that it was just a call.  He then went to Hospital ER and they released him stating it had just a cold.  He then called his cardiologist and they told him to go back to Hospital, was admitted on 5/11/21 and they did more tests and said that he had a blood clot in his left lung and said that it had nothing to do with the vaccine.   He was discharged on 5/13/21.  They put him on Heparin while in the hospital and sent him home as a disgruntled patient.   They also told him that he had fluid around his heart and gave him medicine to get that taken away.  They sent him home on Lasix and Eliquis.  He then went to another hospital on Friday 5/14/21 as he was going crazy about the blood clot and went there and was kept there for 3 days and discharged on 5/16/21 with the same medications, Lasix and Eliquis.   He was also told that he had fluid around his heart again.  Before the vaccine he was very healthy, and was able to jog around his neighborhood and now he&#39;s not able to do so, and they told him that he was now having heart failure and is having trouble breathing because his heart is swelling up.  He went to see his cardiologist last Friday and that&#39;s when she told him about his heart failure.    ADMISSIONS:  ADMITTED 5/11/21 TO 5/13/21; 5/14/21 to 5/16/21.

I met with the Dr, 4 days later for my physical. He indicated my white blood cells were low and platelets were low. I did not have any adverse side effects other than a slightly sore arm. That particular blood test was accomplished, and the white cell count went back to normal and the platelets are improving, and I still feel no side effects. My primary care provider just wanted me to keep your company informed of the situation.

                                                First unusual symptom the day after vaccine - felt as though we were experiencing an earthquake.  Unsteady balance since then.  I had aches common with flu shots, which are now (3/9) gone - these are not a problem.  Yesterday my apple watch said my heart beat was below 40 bpm for ten minutes a few times.  I tend to have a low heart rate so not a major surprise.  But last night when I got up, I lost balance and fell, hitting my head on a chest.  No major damage.  But feeling of dizziness is still a little present.

                                                Eight minutes after the shot, I started felling unwell so I started my Apple Watch to see my heart rate.  It was at 86 and a minute later it was at 116 and a minute after that it peaked at 119.  It fell to mid 90&#39;s a couple minutes later, then went up to 105 fell back to mid 90s, then rose to 117, fell back to 80, and kept rising and falling until about 3pm.      The technician told me before my shot that it would be a few minutes as they had to do something the vaccine.  I don&#39;t recall what she told me.  I think she said they had to switch a vial or something.  You&#39;d have to ask her what happened before I had my shot.  This morning I have tingling in my thumb, forefinger and middle finger in the arm I got the shot.  I did sleep on the arm that had the shot .

                                                High heart rate/panic attack. Patient reported feeling high blood pressure and panic after 10 minutes of administration. Upon talking to patient and monitoring patient for an additional 20 minutes heart rate was at 70 and patient was feeling better and felt good enough to leave with his adult children for lunch. Water, deep breathing, and time were the only treatments administered, no epinephrine or diphenhydramine were administered. Followed up with the patient later that day, approximately 4 hours later and he was felling better. During monitoring patient did mention that he had a similar reaction to Miralax in the past but not Go Litely. Upon looking at the screening form this was not noted in the allergy field. This patient may have a concentration dependent sensitivity to polyethylene glycol, suspending agent or major component in the moderna vaccine is not diluted in any volume. Talked to supervisor to add a potential field of propylene glycol for the screening from.

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

I went to the patient and found him unconscious and unresponsive. I told the technician to call 911 for EMS and I proceeded to remove the Epinephrine emergency pen from the emergency bag. The patient regained consciousness, I did not administer the epinephrine emergency pen. I remained with the patient. The patient complained of feeling hot, nausea and tired. Patient also appeared confused. Patient&#39;s head was cold to the touch. EMS  arrived and took the patient&#39;s vital signs. The patient&#39;s awareness  and tiredness appeared to vary from feeling fine and alert to confusion.  After about 15 minutes with EMS the patient choose to go with EMS to the Hospital Emergency room for observation. The patient walked about 15 steps then chose to go on the gurney with EMS.

Arrived at ER around 12:30 pm est on 4/5 (I walked into both places without assistance). They gave me Eloquis at hospital and I had slightly higher blood pressure than normal. Was discharged late in day on 4/6 around 5pm est. They gave me neuro eval every 2-3 hours and pulled blood constantly. They decided to start me on Crestor at hospital as well - was already on finofibrate, stopped fiofibrate aand fish oil and baby aspirin once I returned home

Body and muscle aches, extreme fatigue, sleepiness, some difficulty moving around, heart seemed to be pounding harder as I moved, so stayed put  in my chair. About 8 o&#39;clock I had a fever of 101. Drank lots of water. Took Tylenol. Fever faded away. In bed by 9pm. Alternately hot, then cold for several hours but did not have chills. Around 1am temperature stabilized and I slept well. Today, the29th, symptoms gone. Arm not even sore.

                                                The next day, I started to feel really weird. I had no energy and my head felt really strange. About a week and a half later, around 5am, the left side of my body started going numb. My wife took me to the ER. My BP was super high. About 6 hours later, the numbness started to go away. They performed various tests, but couldn&#39;t find anything wrong. They think I had a TIA, which is a blood clot that resolves itself. For the following month or so, I was just extremely tired and felt really crappy.

Vaccination prior day incidental to medical findings not suspected to be caused by vaccine.  64 years male with PMH of multiple upper GI bleed secondary, atrial fibrillation, CAD, HTN, HLD, COPD on 2L, morbid obesity, OSA on CPAP who presented to the ED with black stools. Has had multiple endoscopic clips and coils placed in the past. VSS; H/H 7.5/21 on admission. His troponin was elevated and peaked at 1.68. Cath in July 2019 showed 80% proximal LAD, difficult to image secondary to an obese patient, occluded nondominant RCA, moderate disease in a large OM (40% stenosis), large anterior apical wall motion. motion abnormality, EF of 45%. GI and cardiology were consulted in the ED. He was admitted for acute blood loss anemia secondary to GI bleed, likely AVM.   While inpatient, he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He required 6u RBC transfusion total during his admission (transfused for &lt;8.0 given ischemic heart disease). GI performed upper endoscopy x2 and removed large amounts of blood clots and placed 4 additional hemoclips to stop the bleeding. Cardiology was also consulted due to elevated troponin in the setting of ischemia heart disease, and inability to have stent placement/antiplatelet therapy due to GI bleeds - recommended conservative treatment, likely type II demand ischemia. He received IV octreotide 50mcg/hr for 4 days, as well as IV PPI 40mg BID.

He has not seen his doctor for over a year and did not call them (or the pharmacy).  He has high blood pressure.  He  laid down and slept all night and the next day and was well.  Additionally, he experienced a covid  infection 11/2020 and could hardly breathe and could not sleep.  We discussed the risks and benefits and the patient decided to get the second shot because his employer required it.  He was strongly urged to call his doctor or go to the ER urgent care if he experiences severe symptoms of pounding heart or increased blood pressure. He may need to adjust his meds and could be at risk for a vascular event.

I was given Metoprolol through IV to lower my heart rate and they also doubled the Metoprolol prescription that I was taking. They added Eliquis to keep me from having blood clots and a stroke. I was admitted to the hospital overnight. The AFib began about 1:00 am on 6/26 and it went back to normal sinus rhythm about 10:00 pm on 6/26. I was released from the hospital the following day. I have an appointment with my cardiologist (listed above) on 7/9/21. I do not know if the AFib will return or how long I will need to remain on the new prescriptions.

I notified the attending nurse and she said she would reccommend I stay in the lobby for an additional 15 minutes. She checked on me again, 15 minutes later, and my heart palpitations had slightly subsided. We agreed it was probably ok for me to go home.     This also occurred on my later second dose one month later but to a lesser degree.   In both vaccinations I had a fever for a few days and stayed in bed. No further complications continued.

                                                Beginning 1.5 hours after the 2nd Moderna dose, my hands began shaking, and my arm was sore. These symptoms continue today and have not gotten better.  Beginning 2 days after the shot, my left foot from my toes to my ankle turned black and green.  Beginning 1 week after the shot, my toes turned purple; this has continued on and off since May 5, 2021.  Beginning 2 weeks after the shot, the lymph nodes in my neck, roof of my mouth, nose, and ears were swollen and tender. At random times, I would get hot and begin to sweat profusely 2-3 times per day, and my ears would get extremely red. At this time, my temperature would be between 100F and 101F, and my blood pressure was elevated. These symptoms lasted about 4 weeks.  Beginning 3 weeks after the shot, I developed a walnut-sized, squishy knot on the inside of the joint of my left elbow. I also began losing the hair in my armpits and have since completely lost all the hair in my armpits and on my legs.   Beginning 4 weeks after the shot, I developed a golf-ball-sized, squishy knot on the inside of my right knee, similar to the one that appeared on my elbow. I also developed a walnut-sized, squishy knot on my left knee just below the kneecap.  Beginning 5 weeks after the shot, I developed shin splints but had not completed any running or other activities that could explain the tenderness in my shins.  Beginning 6 weeks after the shot, I noticed a loss of muscle mass in my arms and legs.   Beginning 7 weeks after the shot, I have had severe chest pain three times. Each felt like I was having a heart attack; 2 times were in the middle of the night and 1 time was early in the morning.   Beginning 8 weeks after the shot, I began getting lightheaded at random which has caused me to fall multiple times. In addition, I have begun bruising very easily; the bruises take weeks to heal. My left eye is also extremely tender and waters more than normal.   Beginning 9 weeks after the shot, I notice that I have begun drooling even though I have never drooled in the past. My gums occasionally feel tender when I brush my teeth.

Into the evening I started getting beyond normal reaction.  I had a very stiff shoulder joint with pain, beyond that of my existing condition.  It was severe the next day.  Saw my doctor, for the first time meet, and mentioned the reaction I got, but he said it will go away.  During the doctor visit I had elevated BP identified, which wasn&#39;t normal for me either.  That evening I had additional symptoms that included swelling at the proximal points on the thumb and index finger, this also included the wrist.  All symptoms have since subsided to normal.  No other symptoms.

Then proceeded to get a slight noticeable increase in heart rate.   After setting for approximately 15 minutes I was released to leave. I mentioned to them that I just lived down the street and told them if I had any further issues or symptoms I would call them.  Approximately 30 minutes later I was having a slight lightning of the throat or airway and some slight tightness in breathing.  This tightness continued for approximately 2 hrs. I called the clinic and was attempting to get there recommendations but the nurse had left. I was told to get the ambulance personnel. As a prior EMT I felt that an ambulance was not needed at this time. I took 2 ea   Benadryl tablets and those symptoms lessened. Some numbness in lips and face, and felt heart beating in lips. That all subsided as well after taking Benadryl.  Still trying to get with a provider that could give me advise moving forward. The doctor was busy with an Emergency.

Dizziness     multiple times a day   Patient who presents to the emergency department today for evaluation of hypertension, head pain, blurry vision, and neck pain. He states about 6 months ago he had open heart surgery. Since that time he states that he has been having intermittent episodes of blurry vision usually lasts a few minutes and resolve on their own. Today however, he notes that the blurry vision lasted for greater than 5 minutes and he started to become concerned. During that time he also began to experience some pain in his neck and a headache in the back of his head. He took his blood pressure at that time and noted that his systolic blood pressure was in the 190s. This alarmed him and so they called EMS. When EMS arrived they rechecked his blood pressure again and his systolic blood pressure was over 200. Upon arrival here to the ER he states that he is feeling much better and his blood pressure appears to be better as well. At this time he states he still having some right shoulder pain and a little bit of right-sided neck pain but he does state that he had his Covid vaccine yesterday in his right arm. Currently patient states he still has a little bit of a posterior headache but it is much improved. He denies any fevers, body aches, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or swelling of the lower extremities. He has no known drug allergies.       ? ED Course: I discussed physical exam finding with patient. Apparently most of his symptoms have already resolved at this time. His blood pressure is back down to 142/98. I still advise since he was having some weird blurry vision I would like to get a CBC, CMP, troponin, EKG, and a chest x-ray. Patient agreeable to this plan of care. We will also continue to monitor his blood pressure to ensure that it does not spike back up.     Patient&#39;s work-up was unremarkable. His blood pressures down to 123/60 and states he is feeling much better. This point time it sounds like what happened was a hypertensive urgency. I advised him he needs to contact his PCP and schedule close follow-up discuss if anything further needs to be done. At this time though he is safe to be discharged home with strict return precautions.

Began to have a fever which over the 24 hour period went from my normal of 97.6 to 101.2 at 10:30pm the second night. Throughout the period I had a mild headache and significant fatigue. I woke up this morning at 12:30am with the sheets, pillow and pajamas very wet (from sweat). I checked my temperature and for the first time in 24 hours, it had dropped (to 99.2). When I got up at 6 this morning, my temperature was 98.6 (still a little elevated for me). My wife experienced practically the same thing 4 days earlier without the urinary symptoms and temp not quite a elevated. We had the vaccine at the same time(s). I&#39;m still fairly fatigued at this time (and my wife a little).

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

Approximately 25 minutes after receiving the vaccination, I became flush, felt hot and had a red face and neck.  I felt lethargic and a little dizzy.    The redness diminished throughout the rest of the day and for the next day I felt a little lethargic, dizzy, and weak in the knees.  I returned to the facility and EMTs took my vitals.  My blood pressure was slightly elevated but, no other negative indications.  They released me.

                                                Approximately 16 minutes after receiving the vaccination, I began to get quite dizzy.  The staff was notified by my wife; and, a Pharmacist responded immediately to check on me.  As minutes passed, I became more dizzy and was experiencing a mild &#34;out of body&#34; type experience as though I was in some sort of a dream.  Knowing in advance that many people had experienced adverse reactions from these vaccines, my wife and I had brought along an &#34;eppie pen&#34; in the event I might experience something similar.  The problem was that my &#34;pens&#34; had expired in 2015.  My condition improved when I lifted my facemask to get more air.  While the Pharmacy was obtaining a new &#34;Eppie pen&#34; for me, the Pharmacist told me to take the mask off.  This stabilized me until  we left after 45 minutes.  I did not need to use the new Eppie pen.  Still dizzy, my wife helped me to my vehicle.  Enroute, being somewhat weak, I clasped against a parked car and to the pavement.  During the trip home, my muscles began to ache and my joints stiffen and hurt.   A heaviness began to present on my upper chest.

As of 1/8/2021 he was prohibited from donating blood due to a hemoglobin of 12.8. 2 weeks later he presented to donate again on 1/26/2021 and his hemoglobin had dropped to 7.8 without evidence of bleeding. He was subsequently admitted to hospital on 1/29/2021 - where he was found to be severely leukopenic and thrombocytopenic. A bone marrow biopsy revealed a diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia. He remains hospitalized but is now at another location. This has also been reported through VAERS.

Discharged per wheel chair to lobby in alert/stable condition, to wait on bus to take him home. At 18:00 his neighbor heard him fall, could not get patient to answer phone, found him unresponsive. Neighbor called 9-1-1, ambulance personnel could not revive patient.  Coroner&#39;s office ruled his death as Natural Causes due to Hypertension, Cardiac disease, Diabetes, ESRD.  There were no indication of anaphylactic reaction noted when I questioned the coroner&#39;s office. The Coroner&#39;s office/EMS were aware the patient had received the Moderna COVID 19 vaccination that day.

                                                Began feeling very weak with a constant headache that later led to blurry vision on March, 2, 2021.  On the morning of March 4, 2021,  I was still experiencing a right sided headache as well as double vision.  I was no longer able to drive at that point.  I took my blood pressure digitally at the local pharmacy twice where it was 200/104.  I went home to call my physician and also have my wife take my blood pressure manually.  My blood pressure at that time was 214/106.  I went to the hospital where they examined me and then discharged me with a General Headache without a know cause.  I contacted my PCP and he advised me to quadruple my Lisinopril until my BP came down to normal range and see him the morning.  My visit the next day showed an elevated blood pressure, double vision, and a continuing headache.  My meds were adjusted to Lisinopril 10 mg qd and an addition of Norvasc 5 mg qd.  Later that day my blood pressure was down, but still not in the normal range.   The following day, March 6, 2021, I was still having the same issues despite the changes in medication.  I took my blood pressure at 6 pm and it was 199/104.  I immediately went to another hospital where I was admitted as  a &#34;stroke alert&#34; patient in hypertensive emergency.  I am presently being followed as an inpatient in order to get these issues under control.

                                                On 03/11 I received 1st shot of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA,  after about 8 mins I became very light headed and short of breath after about 10 mins.  I felt a rush come over my body followed by rapid heart beat. These symptoms lasted about 2 mins then subsided. I really didn`t want panic everyone  or go to the hospital all I wanted was fresh air so I left, admittedly not my smartest move but I knew my doctors office was right across the street.  After 24 Hrs. still Light Headed, no breathing issues, heart rate normal  sore arm no rash.

                                                65 Y male who is referred for c/f dyspnea and chest pain.  Per clinic notes: &#34;Brief summary covid vaccine 1/21 with side effect within 12 hr lasting 3 d By around 1/26-1/29 had cp w/ exertion and sob TST 2/2 w/  Minor ekg changes and min workload per pt (mod workload per note) nuc study pending.  Cough and sob worse over the last 5 d or so, sleeping in recliner, and having trouble sleeping.  Though no desat on march test, he has freq intermittent coughing and he was tachycardic to 110 on exam this am.&#34;   Pt states symptoms worsening over past week. No symptoms at rest. With exertion has anterior chest tightness and dyspnea. No radiation of pain or migration. He can walk usual distances but much slower. Improved at rest. Cannot lay flat at night. Cannot sleep much at night. Dry cough. No wt changes or LE pain/swelling. No f/c. No ill contacts. No chest pain currently. Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis. Patient got 2nd COVID19 Moderna vaccine as outpatient on 2/27/21.

                                                Prior to the vaccine on 2/13/21, He was a healthy 65 year old active college professor.   32 hours after the vaccination on 2/14/21, He had acute pancreatitis, which led to  septic shock and respiratory failure, and he was placed on a ventilator at  Hospital.   On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

                                                My husband had a stroke one week after his 2nd dose. The blood clot affected his occipital lobe. Ten years ago he had a stroke in the same area below this area. On that Monday around 7 PM, he took our refuse out to the curb in front of our home. When he came in he did not recognize me or his surroundings.  I took him to the hospital by car as I was not sure what happened to him. After testing the doctors said he had a minor infarct. The stroke affected his memory. He was very confused and did not remember anything from the moment of the incident until moments before exiting the MRI machine, approximately 2 hours later. He still cannot recall anything surrounding the incident. We questioned if this was related to his recent vaccination and the doctors stated no, however, we believe it is something that should be reported since it occurred a week after the vaccination.

Unable to lay down as it made his breathing worse.   The next day, he did a nebulizer treatment and that helped his symptoms.   Unfortunately, he has had an acute asthma attacks nearly every day since.  Starting 1 week ago, symptoms have gradually improved.  He is still having to use his nebulizer, but not as often, as his usual inhalers have not been ineffective.

                                                On March 18th I received the Moderna Vaccine #2 at approximately 11 am. A few days later I started to feel tired. Then as time progressed, I lost my libido, sex drive, this vaccine made my vertigo worse...I am dizzy...My heart rate went down 10 bpm and I feel like I have a virus in me. The longer I sleep the worse it feels...If I had to go back and do this again, the way I feel, I WOULD NOT. This vaccine messed up my RNA and the Cytosine&#39;s are making me feel ill and not 100%.

                                                Patient presented to our facility due to progressive swelling of his LLE. Patient is an avid cyclist and reports he began training again for the spring season approx. 1 mo ago.  He had L calf tightness present for a few weeks as well as slightly painful knees which he attributed to his age and mild deconditioning over the winter.  He traveled with infrequent stops on 4/2/2021 to visit family.  He continued to have discomfort and increasing ankle pain, thus presented to ER.  LE ultrasound venous dopplers performed showing extensive DVT: L femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal veins.  CT also demonstrated acute PE w/in distal R and L main pulm artery and w/in bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulm arteries involving all the lobes.  Patient had remote history of LE DVT in 2017 after  mild bumping of leg and placed on Xarelto for 6 mo. Had genetic testing completed at that time which was negative. He has had no clotting issues since. ( Received Moderna COVID-19 vaccines on 2/3/21 and 3/3/21. Reports brain fog and fatigue approx. 20 hours after vaccination followed by the above.) Patient discharged on rivaroxaban.

                                                Pt received dose #1 of Moderna on 1/20/2021 at clinic. On 1/24/2021, developed self reported fatigue and sleep disturbances with pruritis. Sought no medical care. Routine labs were obtained on 2/23 which demonstrated new-onset transaminitis and hyperferritinemia (ALT 2366, AST 1260, alk phos 362, ferritin 32,000) and was admitted to hospital for evaluation. No etiology for acute liver failure identified, including comprehensive evaluation for viral hepatitis and other common causes of hepatitis common after transplant. Concern raised for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) due to extreme hyperferritinemia, although bone marrow biopsy negative. Ultimately transferred to another hospital for further care at patient&#39;s request. No specific treatment was given and transaminitis ultimately resolved. Soluble IL-2 receptor (CD25) level checked on 3/2, at time of admission, markedly elevated at 2338.6, consistent with diagnosis of HLH. Pt discharged on 3/5. Ultimately readmitted on 3/9 and found to have rapidly progressive Legionella pneumonia and died on 3/16. Two events felt to be unrelated and pneumonia not felt to be cause of HLH due to patient&#39;s status at time of initial admission.

                                                I had a syncope event while trimming tree limbs from a platform 8 feet off the ground. I suffered 3 compression fractured vertebrae when I blacked out getting ready to get off onto a ladder to get down. No advance warning, no dizziness, no vision impairment, nothing except a sore knee when I bent over to kneel on the platform in preparation to get on the ladder. It was like someone turned off a light switch and then turned it back on after I was on the ground. Don&#39;t remember even getting down or a fall, but I was down on the ground. When I went to get back on ladder to retrieve my equipment I could not lift my leg due to pain and felt like I had a pulled groin muscle. Laid down and could not get up.

As the evening went on the tightness spread across left arm into chest and neck and over to right arm.  Felt somewhat better in morning but still sore in both upper extremities.  2 days later (3rd day after shot) he went to use the restroom in his home and could not get himself off the toilet - he describes himself as having lost all strength in his legs and when he went to stand he fell right over.  He could not get up and had to be helped to the bedroom.  He rested for several hours and used a walker to ambulate around the house for the next several days.  Now feels back to normal.

                                                I have experienced an increased amount of Afib following my Moderna covid-19 vaccinations. I used to be able to expect at least two weeks Afib free between episodes, but on the evening of my first shot on March 12th I had Afib only four days after a typical episode. Then again on March 22nd and 30th.  On April 8th I had my second Moderna dose. On April 11th I had Afib again and didn&#39;t think that much of it being related to the shot as I had been fever free for over a day at that time. But with episodes on the 13th, 14th, 17th, 18th, 20th(3 episodes) of April that far surpass the frequency of Afib in my history, I have become quite suspicious of the shots as the trigger. The episodes have thankfully been shorter than in the past, some ending within 15 minutes and some as long as four hours. My historical events had often lasted 12 to 18 hours. The arrhythmia events have significantly subsided with only one  three minute arrythmia (likely flutter) in the last 12 days and less short duration palpitations as well.

                                                A few hours after my second shot I got a mild headache, tired, and a bit blurry vision. The next day things got worse with high fever, bad headache, and very tired. The bad side effects went away after 4 days but since then I often feel tired with a mild headache and a little chest pain now and then. Before my vaccination, I played tennis 3 times a week, each time I played  about 2 to 3 hours continuously without feeling tired. But after the vaccination, it takes only 15 to 30 minutes for me to run out of breath so I have to slow down to catch my breaths. My stamina is adversely effected after my vaccination . I&#39;m afraid that I have a case of Myocarditis, a condition similar to Pericarditis, which is an inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart, that caused by the vaccine.

The day of the vaccine I started to have tightness like a Broncho Spasm in my chest 30 minutes after the vaccine.. My co-workers told me I was flushed. I was a little short of breath and my pulse was elevated.  It seemed to improve after a little time. I started to feel worse on 01/12/2021. Ten days after the vaccine I tested positive on 01/14/2021for Covid-19. I had serious symptoms with the Covid-19. After five months I have been unable to work as a Physician and I am still having. I recently got tested for Polyethylene Glycol and I tested positive on a skin test. I am unsure whether to get the second dose. I also have headaches and memory defects muscle aches weakness and a weak left arm. My headaches happen daily and they vary in severity. I am scheduled to have a Bifrontal MRI tomorrow. I started to have problems with concentration within a week of the vaccine and I am still having problems with that. I experience muscle and body aches as well as neck and shoulder problems. My energy level is improved but still very low. I am scheduled to see a Neurologist. My left arm is very weak from the shoulder to the forearm since that time Radiculopathy.

On February 28th I started a very symptomatic AFIB, breathless with little energy and stamina , it lasted 8 days which is double previous events.  It then subsided and recurred about 2 weeks later for 11 days.  Again a severe episode which prompted me to seek out medical help.  I just finished a cardiac ablation because of these episodes.  They were far more severe and  persistent than previous events.

Taken to hospital and was diagnosed with stroke. I asked the physician to report this to VAERS and he wouldn&#39;t because he didn&#39;t believe the vaccine was the cause. CDC states healthcare providers are required by law to report any unplanned hospitalization, disability (no date limit) after covid-19 vaccination, but physician kept refusing to report this to VAERS. My husband was from home independently and is now disabled, unable to move his left side and is going to a facility for long term care.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Atrial fibrillation since 2017.    On 10-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. In January 2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On 28-Jan-2021, the patient experienced LIMB DISCOMFORT (heavy legs) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Not feeling himself). On an unknown date, the patient experienced RHINORRHOEA (runny nose) and BODY TEMPERATURE ABNORMAL (a little temp). The patient was hospitalized from 29-Jan-2021 to 02-Feb-2021 due to CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT and LIMB DISCOMFORT. The patient was treated with Rehabilitation therapy for Cerebrovascular accident and Rehabilitation therapy for Limb discomfort. At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke), LIMB DISCOMFORT (heavy legs), RHINORRHOEA (runny nose), BODY TEMPERATURE ABNORMAL (a little temp) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Not feeling himself) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant medications included blood thinners which patient had reportedly been taking for approximately four years to treat atrial fibrillation.  Treatment included rehabilitation and learning how to ambulate with a walker.  Although a temporal association exists, provided information is not adequate to assess the causal association between the event and mRNA-1273.  The detailed medical history and diagnostic report has not been provided. Causality is also confounded by the patient&#39;s comorbidities.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-008992 (Patient Link).

                                                Patient dob 9/10/1955 walked in for a covid vaccine on 6/26/21.  About 10 minutes after administering the 1st Moderna vaccine at 4:27pm the patient fainted on his chair. A man waiting in line for pickup noticed the patient and luckily supported the patient to prevent him from falling off the seat. We provided the patient with a cold compress, cold bottle of water, and some life saver candies as the wife stated he hadn&#39;t eaten anything since the morning. We instructed patient to lie down on the back with legs elevated, but the patient refused. Patient also refused calling for ambulance.  A member of management was also notified. The blood pressure was monitored at 100/70, 118/78, then 126/84 all taken approximately 10 minutes apart. Patient initially looked pale and felt clammy.  With his BP returning to normal, patient is looking more alert and color back. Patient authorized us to contact Dr. his PCP.  Patient was with his wife who will be driving him home. Patient stayed for at least 45 minutes before leaving pharmacy.

                                                Three months after I received a Covid-19 vaccine, I developed a urinary tract infection. I was admitted to the hospital with a fever and low blood pressure. Urine culture showed presence of E. coli. This was treated with IV fluids  and antibiotics, followed by oral antibiotics. I am still taking Cefuroxime daily to prevent recurrence of the UTI. I had another UTI on March 18, 2021 - this was between my first and second Covid-19 vaccines. The first UTI happened one day after a cystoscopy. There is no evidence that either UTI was related to the Covid-19 vaccination.

                                                Diagnosed with high blood pressure after receiving vaccine, even though I have been treated by a cardiologist for close to 12 years and have never had high blood pressure.  My primary care physician has since played down the idea that my condition is vaccine-related.

                                                After my shot I thought I did really good. I did have soreness and sensitivity but if I touched my arm it was sore. No fever, aches, or pains. I didn&#39;t think anything of it. I&#39;ve had breathing issues for 5 years and I kept telling the Doctor I cant breath and I can&#39;t mow my yard. I did a medical stress test and a nuclear imagining afterwards and I assumed everything was OK because they weren&#39;t worried about anything. I still had the problems though. 05/13/2021 after lunch my chest felt heavy and that afternoon I had a heart attack and went to ER  and it turned out that I had a blockage and the next day on 05/14/2021 Dr.  put in 2 stents. I have to carry a card now. First stents in the OM, second stent in RCA. I don&#39;t feel the shot caused this but you never know. Now I&#39;m feeling really good.   Dose 2 Lot # could be 00821A or 008Z1A

Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

                                                About 2 hours after receiving the COVID shot, while seated in my recliner, watching TV, I began to feel a sickened feeling with tightness in my chest and heart area.  The sensation lasted for about 15 minutes then completely subsided.  About 4 hours later upon retiring to bed before falling asleep, I began to experience a abnormal sound in both my ears.  I covered my ears and the sound remained unchanged.  I do suffer tinnitus and am used to ringing in my ears.  This was more of a rushing metallic sound similar to the rushing water but high pitched and metallic.  This anomaly lasted for around 30 minutes.

Almost an hour later he was still grocery shopping in the store  he stated he very rapidly became dizzy almost like vertigo, began to feel shaky and sought a chair to sit down.  He quickly became  very nauseous and found a nearby trashcan to vomit but states he could only dry heave 3 or 4 times.  He became quite pale and sweaty.  He was observed by his wife accompanying him who is an RN.  After appoximately 15 minutes the patient began to feel somewhat better.  He was given a bottle of water to drink and he could sip it successfully .  He was able to stand successfully and walked back to the pharmacy where I checked his blood pressure (136/86) and pulse (68).  He refused a 911 call and said he felt about 95/100.  Will check on patient again later this afternoon.  Patient will check with his doctor before getting the second vaccine.

Is eye drifted off to the side and he was too dizzy to get up.  He was taken to the hospital.  They did a CT scan which didn&#39;t give a diagnosis, and they were unable to do a MRI scan due to a medical reason,  so they could not determine for sure if he had a stroke.  They are assuming that he did have a stroke and he has oculomotor nerve paralysis on the right side.  The nurse practitioner saw him today and she reports he is doing very well now.  He had been staying in a assisted living type facility when this occurred, but he is expected to return home tomorrow.

By 9:50 AM my temperature had risen to 101.4 and remained above 100 until 6:00 PM.  I experienced body aches, joint aches, and moderate exhaustion.  Walking 30 feet was very tiring and I needed to return to bed.  I took two Acetaminophen at 5:00 PM.  That was the only medication that I took.  By 10:15 PM my temperature was back to normal.  During the day my oxygenation levels were about 93% where my normal level is 97&#43;.  Breathing exercises improved my oxygenation to 95%.  It should be noted that I had COVID 19 in April, 2020.  I never had a positive PCR test but since May, 2020 I have tested positive for COVID 19 antibodies on at least 6 occasions.  Several of these tests were associated with blood donations and others were simply antibody tests done separately.  My most recent antibody positive test was in late January associated with a blood donation.

His blood pessure was very low and he had a fever , so I called paremedics, and they took him to the hosp.  After many tests, they found blood in the urine, and his blood platelets had dropped to 121.( Now he had blood work done in June of 2020 and his platelets were 225.)  After a few days, his platelets began to creep back up, and are now around 165, back to normal range. He is currently at a rehad facility for physical therapy to regain strength.

I spent the entire weekend in Hospital. I had gotten the vaccine in that same hospital earlier that afternoon. I had a similar reaction with the first dose also given at hospital one month before on Feb 5 ,2021. It  was not  severe enough to make me go the emergency room. It happened approximately the same amount of time after the vaccination. approximately 12 hours after the shot.

On Friday 02/26/2021 I had pain in my right ankle and foot and thought it was possibly just another bruise. Saturday evening 02/26/2021 I realised it was a blood vessel popping out. On Tuesday 03/02/2021 I had an ultrasound and it was diagnosed as a &#34;superficial thrombosis&#34;. It goes from the inside of my right foot to the top of the foot. Then it can be seen on the inside of my ankle, skip a spot, and is again visible on the inside of my calf. It ends mid-calf on my right leg.

I was administered aspirin iohexol (OMNIPAQUE) and nitroglycerin (NITROSTAT).  I was given oxygen.  Blood was drawn, an EKG standard was taken, a CTA Chest scan was done and a XR Chest 2 View PA and Lateral were taken. I was released from the hospital at approximately 11:30 p.m.  My blood pressure at the time was 187/107.  My breathing was easier and my chest pain was low.

                                                fatigue, body aches, chills, poor appetite Narrative: Patient is a 65 year-old-male who received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 2/12/21. On 2/23/21, patient contacted his primary care nurse to inform he was having side effects from the vaccine, including headache, fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, rash on top of his feet that extends to his knees, bumps on his chest, bleeding from nose, mouth, and gums, and hyperglycemia. Patient reported took aspirin and Airborne for the symptoms. His primary care provider ordered bloodwork to be done the next day. On 2/24/21, patient had the following labs done: BMP (WNL except for glucose which was 363 mg/dL), CBC with diff (notable for very low platelets of 1 K/mm3), and PT/INR/PTT (all WNL). PCP examined patient and noted no obvious rash on chest, skin fair but not pale, no significant bruising or acute bleeding but petechial rash from the knees down. Patient had been sent home to rest while awaiting lab results. Once lab results returned, patient was contacted and instructed to go to the local ED due to his critically low platelets. Patient went to the local ED, bloodwork showed platelets of 4000 at that time. He was tested for COVID-19 on presentation and was found to be COVID-positive. Patient was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. He was given a total of 4 platelet transfusions as well as IVIG for 2 days and prednisone for 4 days. Platelets reached 78,000 before patient was discharged on 2/26/21. At the time of this reaction, patient&#39;s active medications included: metformin, testosterone cypionate inj, allopurinol, atorvastatin, carvedilol, dulaglutide, empagliflozin, lisinopril, aspirin, calcium/vitamin D, multivitamin. He also received the TDaP vaccine 1/21/21 (22 days prior to the COVID-19 vaccine). Post-discharge follow up with primary care provider on 3/5/21 revealed patient feeling better, no bruising, bleeding, fever, or chills since discharge. Patient finished the course of oral prednisone started in the hospital. Glucose remains elevated. PMD to recheck CBC for platelets once patient is done with his mandatory quarantine for positive COVID-19 test results.

During February, I was experiencing high work stress (writing software).  When I am stressed, I scratch spots of keratosis on my arms.  During February, this behavior remarkably resulted in small lesions blossoming into circular lesions the size of a quarter.  These lesions were many (about 6 on left arm alone), large, wet and open sores, painful, and would not heal.  At one point, I had 6 sores on my left arm, several on my right, a painful sore on my right buttocks, two painful sores behind my ear, a sore at the base of my neck in back, and a very painful sore on my scrotum, plus a huge blood blister on my lower lips.  As I was enduring all of this, I also had severe sores within my nose that bled profusely.  All of this was very painful and very unusual.  Nothing like this had ever happened before to me.  I treated the worst of these sores with Neosporin and bandages.  They have improved, but not healed entirely yet.   All of this was initiated by my stress and scratching behavior.  But I am convinced that the extreme results must be due to the vaccines, which seem to have interfered with the healing, made the sores get very large and infected, and kept my blood from clotting.  There has been significant improvement, but I have not yet recovered from this.

Patient had a syncopal episode on the toilet prior to EMS call. EMS notes they gave patient 4 epinephrine, 1 bicarbonate, and 1 Narcan. Patient arrived with a lucas machine in place and intubated. Patient&#39;s intubation was verified to be a 7.0 ETT and 23 cm at the lip. Cardiac Activity noted in ED at 2150. See nurses notes for times medications were administered. Further history limited due to unstable vital signs. Pt hypotensive, started and maxed on levophed, epinephrine infusions and additional push dose epi given.  Right femoral central line placed.  Pt began to brady down, was given atropine, ultimately again became pulseless and CPR resumed.  After 2 further rounds of ACLS, total down time approached 1 hour without return of pulse.  On echo, there were occasional agonal beats, but no organized cardiac activity.  EKG and case had been discussed with Dr. Friday and decision was to attempt therapeutic hypothermia prior to second cardiac arrest as EKG showed inferolateral STEMI

                                                Patient received Moderna vaccine dose #1 on 3/3/21 at approximately 0900.  In the afternoon of 3/4/21, patient had sudden onset shortness of breath while at home, as well as fatigue and low energy. Patient knew that a potential side effect of vaccine was fatigue, so he assumed this was just a normal side effect to be expected. States that his difficulty breathing and fatigue continued for about a week. After continued urging from wife to seek medical care, patient visited urgent care center on 3/15/21. The urgent care did a D-Dimer lab, and an x-ray of chest. X-ray &#34;showed something abnormal&#34; so they did a CT scan as well, which showed a &#34;huge pulmonary embolism.&#34; D-Dimer lab was elevated. Patient was transported to hospital by ambulance and had immediate surgery to remove blood clot from lungs at approximately 2100 on 3/15/21. Per patient, the surgeon said the clot was about the size of his palm. Surgeon reported that there was &#34;100% blockage to left lung from the aortic artery and 90% blockage to right lung from aortic artery.&#34;  A DVT in popliteal vein was identified, and the surgeon assumes the clot started in the popliteal vein and broke off and traveled to lungs. Patient was admitted and hospitalized until he was discharged home on 3/18/21. During course of hospitalization, genetic testing was done and it was determined that the &#34;genetic marker for clots was negative, so they think the clot is from a one-time event--patient&#39;s family does not need to be concerned that they have clotting issues.&#34; Patient states that he was started on heparin in the hospital, and was discharged home on Eliquis blood thinner, which is being tapered. Patient states that the doctors think he will be on Eliquis for about 6 months and will not need to be on it for life. Doctors say the DVT in leg will dissolve on its own. During hospitalization, an echogram and cardiac cath was performed, which showed &#34;an old heart attack on the left side, but that collateral vessels have built up already.&#34; Right side of heart was weaker from having to work so hard due to blood clots in lung, but prior to discharge from hospital, the right side of heart was already showing improvement. A heart cath was done to check vessels and it was determined no stents were needed, although there was a small clot in left anterior descending artery. Patient was also newly diagnosed during course of hospitalization with Type II Diabetes in a non-obese person, HTN (which patient had never had before), Coronary Artery Disease, Hyperlipidemia, 1st degree AV block. Was discharged home with metformin, losartan, chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, and Aspirin. The chlorthalidone was discontinued, due to &#34;blood pressure dropping too low--they think his high blood pressure was situational&#34; per wife of patient. Medical doctors advised against receiving the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. Patient being followed by Internist at hospital.  Patient&#39;s shortness of breath resolved &#34;immediately after clot was removed&#34; but is continuing to be followed while on new medications and blood thinner dosing.  The above information was provided during telephone interview of patient and his wife.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (10 day hospitalization and administration of oxygen therapy) on 01-Nov-2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension and Diabetes mellitus.    On 02-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). In March 2021, the patient experienced BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to AGEUSIA, CONSTIPATION, DYSSTASIA, GAIT DISTURBANCE and POLLAKIURIA, and then from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to ASTHENIA. On 06-Mar-2021, GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) had resolved. On 24-Mar-2021, ASTHENIA (weakness), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) and AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) had resolved. At the time of the report, POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination), BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant medications were not provided by the reporter. Treatment History includes ER visit, hospitalization, IV fluids, IV medications, &#34;injections for blood sugar&#34;, EKG, scope to check for blood clots, physical therapy.

                                                About 14 hours after receiving my second shot of the vaccine, I awoke being very cold and began to shiver and shake almost violently after getting out of bed to urinate.  Also my back, hips and knee joint were aching when I moved about any at all.  I was able to fall back to sleep and in the few time I awoke during the rest of the night, I didn&#39;t experience the shaking, however, with the aching and feeling cold, it was reminiscent of times when I had a fever.  Unfortunately, I do not have a working thermometer, so I could not check this, but I suspect I did have a fever.  I was also experiencing a sort of mental brain fog of confusion and lack of full consciousness (felt like I could not bring myself awake enough to do much of anything).   The following morning, I was barely able to become awake enough and clear headed enough to send an email to my boss about having to miss work.  Except to get out of bed for a short time to use the bathroom or get something to drink, I slept most of Friday until late afternoon.  Then I was slightly more coherent and was able to get more to drink and eat.  But still sleepy and went back to sleep. I awoke in a sweat (not experienced before this time) and felt a little clearer in my mind and not as achy.  Slept again later through the night, but continued to wake up in a sweat during the night.  Finally this morning when I awoke, I felt more normal again.

Later that evening I was feeling a little better so I went to do a karaoke show.  At 11:00 pm I was on my way home when I blacked out , ended up in a ditch on the side of my vehicle which was totaled.

                                                Possible COVID Vaccine Reaction  Introduction I am writing this because I think all of the issues described under the ?Current Situation? section may somehow be tied to an adverse reaction to my second COVID shot.  Until today, I had thought they were separate incidents with no common thread.  I now can see the possibility that they may be related.  I am asking for competent and engaged medical help to determine whether this is so, and if not, what the causes are for my issues.  I will give a brief medical history to give some current perspective.  Health History Current Vital Statistics ? Age: 66, Gender: Male, Height: 6?3?, Weight: 245  Hemorrhoidectomy ? In 1999 I had a hemorrhoidectomy to stop episodes of severe bleeding.  Heart Attack ? In August 2000 I had a heart attack, diagnosed as unstable angina, while on vacation.  They did further tests, found blockages and inserted stents in two arteries.  I was sent home with instructions to contact a cardiologist.  AICD ? After returning home, my new cardiologist did further tests and found evidence of ventricular tachycardia.  I was sent to a specialist who did an electrophysiology study and immediately implanted an AICD.  I have had it replace twice, with the latest one in April 2012.  It has never gone off.  There are close to five years left on my current battery.  Knee Replacement ? In January 2015 I had a total knee replacement of my right knee.  That was a result of several injuries and four surgeries, which left the knee without cartilage.  The knee replacement has worked flawlessly, and I am able to pursue athletics, especially playing tennis, without limitation.   Current Situation February 23 ? Received my first shot of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm.  Other than minor soreness around the injection site, I had no other reaction.  March 29 ? Received the second shot of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm.  Again, there was minor soreness around the injection site.  April 2 ? Had major pain in my tightness in my chest and major pain starting in my left shoulder and radiating down my left arm.  It caused significant discomfort, and I was awake a large part of the night deciding whether I need to call 911 for a possible heart attack.  I decided against that and instead went to urgent care in the morning (April 3).  My EKG was normal, my blood pressure was elevated (158/96 sitting, 157/91 standing).  Doctor could find nothing to suggest heart attack.  Prescribed a course of Prednisone for the shoulder/arm pain.  Had blood work ordered, which all came back normal.  April 5 ? Played doubles tennis as usual.  Noticed some weakness in my left shoulder and arm but played through it successfully.  The pain level was very low.  April 10 ? Played doubles tennis again.  From the first ball I hit I was aware of major weakness in my shoulder and arm.  They had no power at all, and I was almost unable to get my serve over the net.  I played through it again and played very poorly.  The interesting thing was that the pain and weakness did not worsen during the play or afterwards.  The pain remained after I had finished playing.  April 11 ? Chatted with the athletic trainer while I was officiating their women?s tennis match to look for clues as to what might be wrong.  He suggested in may be a shoulder impingement.  April 15 ? Had a phone consult with my primary care doctor.  I suggested the possibility of the shoulder impingement and he was willing to start there since this was a phone visit.  He referred me to orthopedics and physical therapy and prescribed meloxicam for pain.  The pain has continued unabated during this time.  April 21 ? Pain level was very high to the point where I was unable to work.  Went home and slept most of the day.  Meloxicam was not having much impact on the pain compared to my usual regimen of both acetaminophen and ibuprofen (which I had stopped using when I was taking the meloxicam).  After this I stopped the meloxicam and went back to the other drugs as required.  I had an initial visit with the physical therapist that afternoon.  She did not find anything which would suggest a rotator cuff or labrum injury.  Range of motion was normal.  She noted weakness in my left side compared to my right, which is unusual since I am left-handed.  She gave me three exercises to do daily.  April 23 ? Pain had been back to a more tolerable level.  I had a COVID test in the morning for a treadmill test I have next week, and also got an x-ray of my shoulder as requested by my primary care doctor.  After I went to bed, I had an incident of severe incident of chills which left me freezing and short of breath even with sweats on under my bed covers.  I called my wife in to check my vitals.  My blood pressure was a bit higher than normal but not critical.  My blood oxygen was 98 and my pulse was 70.  My temperature was 99.7 with an oral thermometer.  We called the after-hours nurse hotline and spoke with a nurse.  By that time, it had been about 30 minutes of chills and they were subsiding.  She said she would have a doctor call in the next couple of hours.  The doctor called back, and after going over everything, said to come in if the symptoms reoccurred.  Thankfully they did not.  All the while I am still having the pain in my left shoulder and arm.  April 24 ? Again, slept most of the day due to being worn out from the previous night issues and lack of sleep.  No change in the pain and discomfort.

                                                After the second dose, I had about four intermittent, minor aches in the region of my heart.  They would arise and then fade, lasting about two seconds.  Although they were minor, they were definitely noticeable.  Since then, I have had intermittent heart palpitations.  Again, they are minor but also very noticeable.  Even so, I still did a 5.5 mile walk and didn&#39;t not notice anything unusual during it.  I have not yet contacted my cardiologist about this and may not if the palpitations subside in the near term.

                                                Initially, joint pain and fatigue.  Blood pressure became erratic and unstable, ultimately topping out around 210/130.  Irregular heart beat issue also.  Prior to injection BP had been stable on 50 mg Losartan.  It has now been ten weeks since I got the first vaccine dose and I still have pain in shoulders, elbows, log bones in my arms and joints in my hands.  Also in my hips, knees, ankles and lower back.  This occurs primarily at night.  Blood pressure now requires 100 mg Losartan plus 5mg amlodipine to keep it down.   I have been an endurance athlete (ultra marathon kayak racing) but am still experiencing excessive fatigue after even minor exertion.  I&#39;m probably overlooking some variable in this, but can&#39;t think of what.  Timing is very suspicious.   Was hospitalized for one day when the blood pressure topped out.

About 1.5 weeks later all those side effects reemerged at a much greater amplitude.  Also, I had trouble breathing and was very weak.  I went to PCP and had low O2 at 92%.  He thought I had COVID,  but rapid test came back negative and chest x-ray was normal.  Based on his recommendation and my O2 staying low, I went to emergency room 2 days later.  The doctor there thought symptoms were consistent with COVID. I got another chest x-ray . It was normal.  They performed a lot of blood analysis and found nothing acute and abnormal.  They gave me a PCR test and it came back negative.  I got diarrhea constantly for about a month. I slowly got better with my O2 returning to normal range and diarrhea  over with.

                                                In the evening of 25-Jan-2021, after my dinner I was watching the TV that after 15 minutes my Left arm from shoulder downwards felt suddenly numb with no sensation. I called my wife and sensing that it may be a stroke took 4 tablets of 81 mg of Baby Aspirin. Some sensation seem to come back after some time (may be an hour or so afterwards), but half of my left palm and little finger remained some what numb. Night passed quietly and kids were anxious that I did not call ambulance or go to ER. Next morning I went to the nearest ER and was diagnosed with Transient Ischemic Attack. All the tests were negative CT scan of Head &amp; Trunk did not reveal anything, only D-Dimer was slightly elevated. I was given a tablet of Aspirin 325 mg and prescribed Eliquis 2.5 mg twice daily for use and advised to follow up with a Neurologist. ER did advise for admission in hospital and a MRI work up, but I declined.

Venous duplex done also revealed bilateral DVTs.  Patient was doing well after fibrinolytic with heparin anticoagulation, but had sudden decompensation on 5/21 (hypotension and respiratory failure requiring intubation).  Transferred to current institution for ECMO evaluation due to severe cardiopulmonary compromise.  Patient deemed not ECMO candidate based on co-morbid conditions based on CT findings.  He underwent mechanical thrombectomy with improvement.  He was continued on heparin infusion, then had sudden decrease in platelet on 5/25 with worsening cardiopulmonary status.  HITT was suspected and heparin was transitioned to argatroban.  Results of heparin induced platelet antibodies (PF4 ELISA assay) and Serotonin Release assay was negative.  Repeat imaging revealed increase clot burden and therefore patient underwent catheter directed thrombolysis followed by aspiration suction thrombectomy.  Due to high clinical suspicion of HITT, repeat heparin induced platelet and SRA sent and pending at the time of report. Of note, patient still in hospital at the time of this report

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Electrocardiogram: normal other. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 test negative: negative negative. On an unknown date, Troponin: high (High) high.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Patient is on nebulizer treatment of tiotropium bromide and a lot of simethicone. Patient do not know if using either medication helped or not but that was my immidiate reaction. Now patient is on prednisone and feels like he&#39;s taking it just to breathe. Patient has had to go on 24 hr. oxygen since the first shot.   Patient was negative for Covid-19 over the past 3 months at three different times. He continued to have terrible chest pain where he was grabbing and pulling at his chest, pain creeping up to his chest, could not breath or eat anything for 1 week after his first shot.  Patient was in the ER on 10Mar2021. Caller stated he has chronic pancreatitis and breathing issues for which he was prescribed steroids, his doctor told him to decrease the prednisone to 10mg for 2 days prior and day of vaccination. Caller thinks he had a week long stroke since he had high Troponin level which resulted in visit to the hospital where the doctors thought he had septicemia. Caller stated he has not been able to sleep because he keeps having attacks of chest pains that last approximately 15 minutes in the middle of the sleep which occurs 4&#43; times per night.   Kidney&#39;s have gotten worse since 1st shot vaccine. Doctors said &#34;the kidney&#39;s took a shot&#34; after the first shot of vaccine. Patient was admitted to the Hosp twice after the first shot because his kidneys almost shut down both times. Unexplainable, excruciating pain in chest and very difficult to breathe for approx. 10-15 minutes each attack.  New, unexplainable pain in lower stomach area since 1st shot of vaccine. Doctors cannot explain.  Patient is seeking legal action against Moderna.

On 23-May-2021: follow-up appended, conmeds added, NF added to events, new events added, new allergies coded, generated narrative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a male patient of unknown age who missed second dose due other adverse events experienced post first dose of mRNA-1273. The other events show temporal association with the use of mRNA-1273 and a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, the patient has concurrent history that confounds the reported events to include chronic pancreatitis, COPD, kidney and heart disorder.  Missed dose is assessed as not applicable

                                                Outcome: Patient Death CHIEF COMPLAINT in ER: chest pain, SOB  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 66 yo with PMH of chronic afib on chronic anticoagulation who presented to the ER with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and increased fatigue over the past several weeks that has progressively become worse. Patient denies orthopnea or PND but does have some palpitations and occasional chest pain associated with increased fatigue with exertion. On evaluation emergency room patient was noted to be tachycardic consistent with chronic atrial fib, also acute renal insufficiency likely secondary to dehydration. Patient is admitted to the medical service for further treatment and evaluation. DEATH SUMMARY Date of Admission: 04/07/2021 Time of Death: 04/10/2021 at 0737 Final Diagnoses: 1. Sudden Cardiac Death 2. Acute Renal Impairment Secondary to Hypovolemia, A TN 3. Chronic Atrial Fibrillation w/ RVR, Resolved 4. Atypical Chest Pain, Resolved 5. Hypokalemia, Resolved 6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea 7. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Hospital Course: Patient is a pleasant 66yo admitted for acute renal impairment secondary to significant o hypovolemia resulting in ATN as well as atrial fibrillation w/ RVR after presenting to ER with complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, malaise, and anorexia that began after receiving his second COVID vaccine on 4/01/2021. Please see H&amp;P for full details. Patient reported that on the day after his COVID #2 vaccine, he lost his appetite and was not able to eat or drink. He continued to take his home medications as prescribed including losartan, chlorthalidone, and meloxicam. After experiencing progressive worsening of symptoms for 5 days, patient presented to ER for further evaluation. Upon arrival to ER, patient was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic. EKG showed atrial fibrillation w/ RVR. Routine labs were obtained and were remarkable for elevated creatinine and mild hypokalemia w/ normal BNP and negative cardiac enzymes. CXR showed enlarged cardiac silhouette, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or other acute abnormalities. Patient was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and medical management. He was staited on aggressive IV hydration for his hypotension and hypovolemia w/ PRN IV metoprolol as needed for HR&gt; l lObpm. He was continued on anticoagulation. Serial cardiac enzymes were obtained and were negative. TIE report from Dr&#39;s office that was performed recently was obtained and showed EF of 55-60% with Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient&#39;s wife brought his CPAP from home and patient wore his CPAP while sleeping during his hospital stay. During the course of hospitalization, patient&#39;s blood pressure &amp; HR improved, though he remained in atrial fibrillation. His creatinine continued to trend up consistent with ATN, but patient continued to produce adequate urine and he had no signficant electrolyte derangements. IVF were adjusted based on urine output and volume status. Patient had no recurrence in his presenting complaint of chest pain and he overall reported feeling better throughout his course of hospitalization despite reporting that he continued to have little appetite. Patient was monitored closely on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. On the morning of 4/10/2021, lab tech and nurse walked into the patient&#39;s room to obtain specimen for AM labs. Patient reportedly tried to get out of the bed independently, grabbed at his chest &amp; pulled off his telemetry, and fell to his knees. Staff called Code 99 and patient was placed back in the bed. He was noted to be in asystole. ACLS was performed and despite maximal efforts, patient subsequently expired at 0737. I personally called the patient&#39;s cardiologist &amp; personal friend, to discuss the events leading up to the patient&#39;s death. Upon review of the patient&#39;s course of hospitalization, it was felt that patient most likely experienced sudden cardiac death. Of note, Dr reports that the patient frequently contacts him via text message with concerns or complaints. He states that the patient did not message him during the hospitalization to report any chest pain or other concerns. Disposition: Patient Expired

I could not breathe and my fever was 103 degrees. My wife called an ambulance and sent me to the hospital after breathing treatment. I was on a-fib and the doctors/nurses trying to send me back to life. I spent 7 days in the hospital.

                                                On 1/9/2021,  my son noticed I had symptoms of bells palsy.  I had droopy lips and left eye lid was also droopy.  He rushed me to the ER.  At the ER, they did CT scan and found I had a stroke.  They took me to the OR and tried to do a thrombectomy.  They were unsucessful to do a full thrombectomy . They were able to do a partial thrombectomy.   I was kept in ICU for 1 week. My left side was paralyzed at that time.  After a week, I was discharged to a rehab hospital Sheltering Arms and I was there for 2 months.  I received physical therapy and occupational therapy.   I was prescribed a holster monitor and started a new medication called Plavix.  I am also to continue taking my previous medications prior to the vaccine.  Currently, my left hand is fully paralyzed and my left leg is partially paralyzed.

                                                Irregular heartbeat noticed approximately 36 hours after first Covid19 Moderna vaccination.  Symptoms continued periodically to, and through, the date of the 2nd Covid 19 vaccination.  Subsequently confirmed via EKG and 2-week heart event monitor to be AFIB. Echocardiogram shows Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation and dilated right atrium.  AFIB episodes are paroxysismal and typically last 8-10 hours each.  No previous symptoms or problems prior to the two Covid 19 vaccination doses.

Laid on floor as he was unresponsive. Mask removed and gurgling noise and saliva noticed in his airway. Vitals assessed and it was detected in both his carotid and radial arteries that there was not pulse.  CPR initiated. After only two compressions patient opened his eyes and started breathing on his own. He was awake, not oriented with a weak pulse. Patient provided juice sitting up in case this was diabetic reaction. EMS arrived.  They did an EKG. Patient denied being transported to ER. Patient was released to care of wife at 12:30 who was instructed to bring him to ER if any symptoms reappeared.

                                                Onset of fever (101.3), tachycardia (131), rigors, and myalgias that lasted about 12 hours followed by 24 hours of fatigue and increased need for sleep.  Similar reactions were shared with 6 co-workers who received the vaccination at about the same time. My concern is that if this second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination is making people ill, then it is imperative that CDC and FDA advise the public what to expect and maybe how to ameliorate.  Otherwise people who become ill will tell their friends and family.  This disclosure will make members of the public disinclined to get the shot which would be a public health nightmare.  I have used this adverse report as the forum to ensure that the FDA and CDC are aware of these reactions and will consider their consequences.  Thank you.

They declined to help and blamed Tandum and transferred to them. They said NO NO this is a Dexcom problem and transferred me back! Dexcom identified the problem and offed to send a replacement vis 3-7 days vis ground shipping! A week without a CGM sensor!!! I expressed concern and asked for overnight. One week ago I got the Moderna vaccine and suffered Diabetic Ketoacidosis. Failed sensor has resulted in elevated BG. Last week I had Ketoacidosis following moderna Covid-19 vaccine. Being without continuous BG testing is dangerous. Raised my concerns with Dexcom. Asked for call back and action.

                                                I woke up feeling head ache with pain in my throat and upper section of my chest while breathing. My blood pressure and pulse was unusually high. I went to Hospital . I was checked for Covid, Chest x-ray and blood test.  Covid test results were negative, and X-ray results was normal with no problem.  All blood test results (including those for heart)  were normal. EKG test result was normal. They ruled out any problem with my  heart, but could not say for sure that it was not a reaction to Covid Vaccine .  However they said it might be a sever allergy.

When I arrived at the donor center to give a monthly platelet donation my blood pressure was extremely high, 184/104.  My average blood pressure varies with an average of 135/80.  Never above 150/90.  It has stayed relatively high, though a late-day glass of red wine seems to bring the blood pressure lower.

                                                The day after my second dose ( February 18th) I felt sore at injection site and slight headache/neck ache and fatigue. next day (February 20th) I noticed a tightness in chest and started checking pulse and ECG on my apple watch. Results came back as showing signs of AFib. Never saw this before. I have checked the ECG app on the watch  on and off since getting it in December. Every time  before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine the results came back as normal Sinus rhythm. Since February 18th my ECG on the apple watch has indicated Afib, going on 11 days now.

When I awakened (about a minute later) I was unable to stand so I crawled to from the shower to bedside, but passed out again when I tried to pull myself up from the floor into bed.  My wife called 911 and the local fire department responded.  The EMT took my blood pressure while I was lying on the floor with my feet elevated and it was 78/34.  The EMT called an aid car and I was transported to a local ER.  At the ER, I received 2 liters of fluids over the next 4 hours.  I had an EKG, chest X-ray, blood work, and urine analysis which all were clear.  After 4 hrs, I was released and returned home.

Per wife - patient became clammy, very warm, unresponsive, gurgling at the mouth. I ran out to check on patient Pharm.D.  They asked if they could remove his mask , i told them YES! he had a cloth mask over an n95 mask! Upon inspection, patient was not talking to me like he was prior to vaccine. They said patient gets tired and can become out of it, so they were not sure if this was a rxn to vaccine or just one of his episodes.  Patient has prior hx of 3 times stroke and is on dialysis. He did not appear to be in anaphylaxis and was breathing (when looking at chest). We called code white to pharmacy, and  Manager called EMS 5:44pm. Pharm.D came out to assist me 5:45pm. It was difficult to get a pulse using fingers, so we used BP cuff and got 83/57, with 87 BPM 547pm. I had epi pen ready to go in case we needed to use it but wanted to wait since patient was still breathing. While waiting for EMS, patient became responsive and began to talk. EMS showed up and took over. At this time Patient was talking and joking. 550 pm We decided we wanted patient to be checked out prior to sending him on his way. EMS asked us what we had done, and we discussed the above. EMS took over from there 555pm. Everything turned out ok, EMS left without further intervention. Before they left, I went to speak to family, and they were very happy due to the care they received. Event ending @ 6:15pm

Almost felt like falling.   I didn&#39;t want to move in bed since it would only exacerbate the body aches and make it worse.

After the second dose of covid, we checked his pulse rate and it was  34 beats per minute. Irregular heart pattern  was occurring.  Went to NP, who told him to go back to original dosage.  Still reading in the thirties, so called (Internal  Medicine doctor)  He told him to get off medicine.  It took 10 days to get to 70 beats per minute with no afib. Still not taking the carvedilol.

Pt was found to have elevated BTNP at 2240 pg/ml with fluid overload, and Biofire Respiratory Panel showed Coronavirus PCR positive.  At that time, his COVID markers were also elevated.  CRP 91.4 mg/L,  D-Dimer 2340 ng/mL.  Patient was admitted, diuresed, and started on inpatient COVID protocol which included Ivermectin.  March 9:  EKG was performed and patient was found to have a heart block.  All labs had improved over the past 48 hrs. BTNP reduced to 1530, D-Dimer reduced to  1700, CRP reduced to 47.9.   Due to the heart block, patient was transferred to a care center to a cardiologist.  Just prior to transfer, a follow up Biofire respiratory panel showed Coronavirus PCR NEGATIVE.  PCR positive and negative results were relayed to accepting facility - facility and they were going to refer to epidemiology for follow up.

                                                I suffered a heart attack on March 11, 2021, at approx 145pm, while sitting at my desk - WFH.  My symptoms were sweats, nausea, followed by chest pains beginning on the left side of my chest; sweats and nausea subsided for approx 1 hr, returning again, followed by chest pains radiating  the across the full chest approx.  I left my desk at the onset to wash my face, returning to my desk to talk a scheduled phone call at 2pm, lasting until 3pm.  I left desk to walk outside to take in some fresh air, my wife ask me if I was ok, I said no.  She ask if I was having a heart attack, to which I replied, I don&#39;t know.  shortly there after we left for the ER at arriving approx 4pm.  At that point ER staff did a quick assessment, taking my to an ER patient room where i was advised by the attending Dr that they thought I was having a heart attack.  Shortly thereafter I was taking to the Cath lab where a stent was insert and then taken to ICU.  Where I remained until I was released on 3/12/2021 at 3pm.  There was no detectable heart damage and I was placed a regime of blood thinner, a beta blocker and cholesterol med.  I do not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or history of heart problems.  My last physical was Feb 2021.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

I checked again in minutes to be sure the meter was functioning properly and it was 280.  The meter was accurate enough.  With my meds over the past 2 years it has NEVER been this high!  I did not eat or drink anything that could have caused this spike.  I had a healthy lunch at noon.  I began drinking a LOT of water and went for a 20 minute aerobic walk.  At 6 PM glucose was down to 195.  At 7:30 PM glucose was down to 135.  Dizziness began to subside this whole time period.  I will continue to monitor glucose closely.

                                                I should point out that I donated a pint of blood 2 hours before getting my Moderna shot. I thought it would 27 hours before the shot but after donating the pharmacy called and said they had vaccine available if we wanted to move  up getting our shots right then 24 hours before our appointment.  8 hours later,  at 3:00am I got up to go to the bathroom. I immediately started feeling nauseous and light headed. I ended up collapsing and falling flat on my back. I immediately started shivering and shaking along with the nausea. For the next 12 hours I was extremely weak and my joints severely ached. It was very hard to move.   The total experience lasted roughly 18 hours before I started feeling significantly better.  Before donating blood I asked the if getting the Moderna Covid shot 27 hours (I thought 27 hours at that time) after donating would be a problem .  They said no. We asked the pharmacist before getting the shot if donating blood 2 hours earlier would be a problem. She thought naught and said she had no guidance against it.  I?m a very very healthy 67 year old. I rarely get sick and I have no prescriptions.  Complicating my blood donation was that my pulse was 44 beats per minute but my good health allowed them to proceed.  I?m not complaining about anyone or anything. I just thought you should be advised of my experience.

On 3/8/2021 he went to a care clinic for knee pain but had also developed severe bilateral shoulder, bilateral hand and hip girdle pain with stiffness a few days after receiving the vaccine.  At the time he was told that this pain was likely related to compensating for his knee pain.  He then presented to see me (primary care provider) in my office after having the knee repaired on 4/5/2021.  Reported he was able to bear weight and walk as usual on his knee but was not seeing any improvement in his shoulder, hand and hip girdle pain and stiffness.  Ultimately was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica, started on prednisone and referred to rheumatology.

He received COVID vaccine on 03/26 with Moderna vaccine (second dose) and was doing well until 3 days PTA. In the doctor&#39;s office patient had an EKG that was read as atrial flutter and doctor sent patient to the ED for rule out PE and evaluation of chest pain and shortness of breath. CTA chest showed numerous bilateral pulmonary emboli and evidence of right heart strain. Of note, his father had history of pulmonary embolism as well as rectal cancer. Patient was evaluated by pulmonologist and cardiologist and was started on full-dose anticoagulation for PE treatment. Patient did not report anything different in his life that may have contributed to development of PE (besides COVID vaccine). He denies any prior cardiac history and indicated maintaining an active lifestyle. Patient had symptomatic improvement and was discharged on full-dose rivaroxaban.

The doctors gave him clot-busting drugs in an attempt to save him.  He has never had problems with blood clots in his life.  He was the healthiest one of us all,  and was almost never sick. The doctor said that it was probably no coincidence that he died so soon after receiving his Covid shot. I am convinced that they are connected.  A healthy man suddenly gets blood clots in his heart 24 hours after getting his shot?  Not a coincidence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.       Concurrent medical conditions included Heart transplant (0.58 years from treatment for COVID-19) and Cardiomyopathy (Cause for heart transplant was Nonischemic cardiomyopathy). Concomitant products included TACROLIMUS, MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL and PREDNISONE for Immunosuppression.    On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced COVID-19 (covid-19 infection) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), HYPOXIA (hypoxia) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), LUNG INFILTRATION (Bilateral lung infiltrate) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), COUGH (Cough) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), CHILLS (Chills) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and VACCINE BREAKTHROUGH INFECTION (Covid-19 infection 19 days after COVID-19 vaccine). The patient was hospitalized for 5 days due to ASTHENIA, CHILLS, COUGH, COVID-19, HYPOXIA and LUNG INFILTRATION. At the time of the report, COVID-19 (covid-19 infection), HYPOXIA (hypoxia), LUNG INFILTRATION (Bilateral lung infiltrate), COUGH (Cough), ASTHENIA (weakness) and CHILLS (Chills) outcome was unknown and VACCINE BREAKTHROUGH INFECTION (Covid-19 infection 19 days after COVID-19 vaccine) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Blood creatinine: &gt;0.3 mg/dl milligram per decilitre (abnormal) &gt;0.3 mg/dl. On an unknown date, Lymphopenia: &lt;900/mcl (abnormal) &lt;900/mcL. On an unknown date, Oxygen saturation: &lt;92% (abnormal) Hypoxia. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: negative (Negative) Negative.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patients were comparable to those of solid organ transplant patients (SOTs) who had COVID-19 infection and have not been vaccinated. Antinucleocapside antibody at COVID-19 diagnosis was also negative. Treatment for COVID-19 was with Remdesivir and Convalescent Plasma. Patient was discharged on 2 liters of oxygen.  Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The date of vaccine administration, onset date for the events and the date for the antibody test are required for further evaluation. Based on the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. However, immunocompromised state in solid organ transplant patients may remain as risk factors for reduced immune response and infection.

                                                After being stable for over a year, I went back into AFib the morning after my second dose. I went in and out for 9 days and then stayed back in a normal sinus rhythm since.  I monitored my condition with my Kardia 6L and reported the events to my Electrophysiologist via my on-line chart. They monitored me closely but were pretty sure it would settle out, which it did.  I would still take the vaccine again.

                                                I experienced a seizure.  A family member told me I was &#34;out&#34; for 1 or 2 minutes, got very stiff,  breathed very heavy then seemed as though I stopped breathing, involuntarily urinated.  When I came to, my speech was slurred for a few minutes and my blood pressure was very low.  The EMT&#39;s arrived, took my blood pressure, reported it was 85 / 58.  After a few minutes, drinking some fluids, I began to feel more normal.  I declined to go with the EMT&#39;s.  That afternoon, I was extremely tired and slept most of the afternoon.

His wife did not know what was wrong and urged him to go to the hospital. His son brought him to the hospital, he presented with elevated blood pressure, a slightly asymmetric smile, and black tongue. He was admitted to the hospital and multiple tests (brain scans, electrocardiogram, etc.) were run to try to diagnose what had occurred. On the afternoon of Sunday, May 16, in the midst of being discharged from the hospital, pt had another &#34;episode&#34; which was later categorized by physicians as being a partial complex seizure, where he &#34;froze&#34; and became unresponsive for approximately 1 minute. During the event, he was wearing a heart monitor, which showed no unusual heart activity, but his blood oxygen level dropped during the event. On Sunday, May 16, pt had a second partial complex seizure (third seizure over the 2-day period). This seizure was timed at being approximately one minute in duration. Following the seizures on 5/16, patient was given Ativan and also a 1500mg loading dose of Keppra. On Monday, May 17, patient had a EEG administered, which indicated that there was no unusual activity occurring in the brain during the test. He was advised to continuing taking Keppra at 750mg/day. Pt does not have a family history of epilepsy, never played contact sports, and has not suffered brain injuries such as a concussion.

I checked my blood pressure on the second day and the monitor said I had an irregular heartbeat- my bp is usually 120 over 70- it was slightly elevated my pulse was 85- so I called my doctor- I was experiencing shortness of breath and didn&#39;t feel right- very tired- my doctor- listened to my heart with his stethescope and immediately ordered an EKG- the EKG was normal- he then ordered a Echocardiogram- that came out normal- but I still had an irregular heartbeat- it lasted for 3 weeks- I am feeling better now- and the problem has not happened again- I think it had something to do with the second maderna shot-

                                                Prior to getting my COVID19 vaccination, I was rarely (but occasionally) in A-Fib, most likely caused by my Mitral valve stenosis.  After my 2nd Moderna vaccine, I went into A-Fib, and have not had a normal sinus rhythm recording since then (almost 3 months straight, every day). I have a ECG monitor, so can read my ECGs anytime, and was checking them 3-5 times per day for several weeks after my 2nd shot. I know the vaccination did not CAUSE my A-Fib, but since the vaccine seems to have some metabolic effects beyond just producing protective antibodies (helping folks with long-haul, etc.), I believe it may act as a catalyst which precipitated events leading to &#34;pushing&#34; me into A-Fib 24/7. I just thought you would want to know.

                                                After the first dose,  about 36 hours later I had severe vomiting followed by intense chest pains. About three months later it was determined by cardiologists that I had suffered an SMI at that time and hadn&#39;t realized it. It was also determined that I was 80 - 90% blocked in the main artery which likely was  the culprit and two stents were implanted. I have no idea (nor do the doctors) if the vaccination was in any way related to the cardiac event, but I felt completed to report it due to the closeness in timing. I am currently on different medications and cardiac rehab therapy.

Patient symptoms started on Friday (6/25) with congestion and cough.  This was not able to be remedied by Mucinex.  Patient then went to an urgent care clinic on Saturday and after listening to his lungs was sent to the emergency room.  While in the emergency patient received a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis which showed signs of liver cirrhosis and Covid.  Patient then had a rapid Covid test that came back positive.  They then obtained a confirmatory test but that is still pending.  Patient then had agitation while he was in the hospital to the point where he almost struck a nurse.  Patient&#39;s confusion got a little bit better but was found to have an elevated ammonia which was thought to be the cause of his delirium.

The weakness progressed to the point that he was able to ambulate only with assistance.   He was seen in my neurology clinic on January 28th and his evaluation suggested an ascending, painless weakness of the legs with rapidly progressive symptoms.  He  was admitted to Hospital on the same day.  His evaluation is consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome and he has been started on plasmapheresis to treat the condition.

                                                My symptoms started at 1:15 am. I woke up with chills, shivering. I have an infrared thermometer to check temp,  no fever. I have an oxygen/pulse thing. My pulse was very high for me, it was in the high 90s and then it would occasionally go to 100-105 to 115 but then would go back down into the 90s and it stayed that way for approximately for 60-65 hours after the shot. It was all over the map, I even had some heart rates in the 40s-50s. Finally it broke after about 60-65 hours and it returned to normal. My normal resting heart rate is in the 60s-70s and occasionally in the 80s but never the 90s. On Saturday approximately 9:30 I had no appetite, I didn&#39;t want to eat anything, I felt like I was going to vomit and didn&#39;t eat anything but just felt nauseous.

At about   15 hours post vaccine I had chills, fever. The chills and fever were bad enough that in addition to sleeping under two blankets I had to put on a thick fleece ?hoodie? and pulled the hoodie over my head. I developed about 48 hrs of nasal congestion, and some retrosternal chest pain. I had one episode of nausea with vomiting about 8:00 am the next morning. I had to take two 325 mg Tylenol every 4-6 hrs to deal with the headache and fever. The most severe symptoms of  headache and fever subsided in about 24 to 36 hrs after the vaccine was administered. I had a lot of fatigue for several days, along with aches and pains. It took me about 5 days to really start feeling normal again, but the fatigue lingered for a few more days.

State girlfriend found him sitting in the chair a few minutes before they called her.  The Coroner did not order autopsy.  Did not sent patient to the hospital.  Sent him directly Funeral Home.  Death Certificate Number 123-2021-002593 list cause of death as pending.  I spoke with the patient&#39;s primary doctor who gave me the history of HTN, Diabetes, &amp; High Cholesterol.

Neither the Coroner nor PMD think death was related to COVID Vaccine.    Informed both that MSDH would have to complete VAERS.  Both voiced understanding.

                                                I started feeling fatigued on Sunday Feb 14. I started feeling this way in the afternoon. Next I felt like I had indigestion so I took some tums. At about 1:00am on Monday morning I woke up and felt really bad and thought I had indigestion so I tried to take some more tums and vomited. I was really weak and short of breath. I laid back down and tried to go to sleep but my heart felt like it was racing. Within an hour I was back up vomiting again with shortness of breath, weakness, heart racing. I tried to lay back down but within another hour I vomited again. This went on until 8:30am Monday morning. My pulse was everywhere. 97 to 112bpm. I was having chills all day and weak. I slept a lot Monday and also had diarrhea on Monday morning. I couldn&#39;t eat all of Monday and finally ate some soup on Tuesday. I am feeling much better today but still a little fatigued.

He rested with his head down as he was nauseas and tired from the event. He stood up once he was able and alert.

                                                Patient Statement:  No symptoms until the following morning at about 7:30am when I noticed mild discomfort and subsequently measured my heart rate via iWatch.  The results indicated tachycarida, with rates raning from about 54 to 173 BPM,  The rate would rise slowly to different peaks, remaining at that level for 1 to 3 mins, then return slowly to normal, the periods of change being in the 1 to 3 minute range.  When running a ECG via my iWatch the Sinus Rhythm appeared abnormal only in period, showing changing rates mirroring what my BPM showed.  The distress was more psychological than physiological, feeling about the same as when our grade school PE teacher would make us run every day.  I hated running, as the breathing burned my lungs and gave me discomfort, but I&#39;m sure it was the same for all of us.  I have no allergies, have never had Influenza, was never absent a single day from school for sickness from Kindergarten all the way through 4 years of college.  I had a cardio work-up a few years ago that showed nothing abnormal, and a health screening about 2 years ago for deep vein and extremity circulation without nominal results.  I&#39;ve been nearly vegan for several years, and have lost around 30 lbs within the last year, approaching a BMI withing normal range.  I do have a slightly elevated BP, but that is reducing with weight loss.  I have had kidney stones since about 1996, but they tend to pass withing a few hours.  Nothing else to report.

Symptoms subsided about an hour later. The next day I experienced anticipated fever symptoms and slept all day.

                                                On 1/20 I began to experience sinus congestion and chest congestion which worsened over the next 2 days. I made and attended a telemedicine appointment on Friday, 1/22. Subsequently I was prescribed Mucinex 12 Hour, and Afrin No-Drip which eased the symptoms. I had a Covid test performed by the staff  which returned positive on Monday, 1,/25. After 1/30, my symptoms were improved enough that I was able to resume activity and after 10 days, was advised that I no longer needed to quarantine. I was administered my 2nd vaccination on February 10, 2021.

                                                Blood pressure elevated to stage 2 and hypertensive crisis levels with highest systolic at 202 and highest diastolic at 123. Acebutolol dosage of 200mg daily keeps levels at normal to elevated levels most of the time occasionally with the need for a second daily dose to maintain control in the normal levels. I needed to boost the level of acebutolol to 400mg twice daily to maintain stage two. I was about ready to head to a clinic when the pressure started downward. Monitoring was at about every two hours while awake. The reduction of blood pressure was achieved on day four after receiving the vaccination.

                                                I had the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine shot one on March 16, 2021 and shot two April 13, 2021. I am not sure when the headaches started, but I estimated about two weeks, or about April 9, 2021. The headache on April 23, 2021 was bad enough that my wife called our PCP. My PCP asked me a lot of questions and said for me to get a blood draw and an MRI without contrast STAT. The report dated April 23, 2021 was ?a Large 1.5 cm thick right frontoparietal subdural hematoma with transfalcine right to left herniation measuring 1.0 cm. Tiny parafalcine and left frontoparietal subdural hematomas. Given recent vaccination, consider contrast enhanced MRV to rule out venous sinus thrombosis.? I was ordered to go to the ER where I was admitted the same day. A neurosurgery team performed an operation on April 27 to drain the internal bleeding that had occurred (possibly for over a month). As I was about to be released on April 28, 2021, my heart monitor recorded a ventricular tachycardia (vtac); I exhibited 17 beats of vtac where no Potassium and magnesium levels were present. A cardiology team then got involved. An EKG and ultrasound were taken April 29, 2021. Since there were no recurring issues, I was released on April 29, 2021. I do not know if the spontaneous subdural hematoma or the ventricular tachycardia could have been an adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine, but I thought I should report it.

                                                Although I have heart disease, and had triple bypass surgery three  years ago, I consistently take my blood pressure. My blood pressure has been in a  normal range since the operation, and following receiving the first dose of the vaccine it became elevated and I needed to go back on an old medication. Even then, my blood pressure was erratic.  Two weeks after my 2nd COVID shot I had a heart attack due to a blood clot. This clot was able to be removed by a heart cath-lab.  This could be a coincidental flare up due to an old issue, but the timing aligns with both doses of the vaccine.

                                                After 4-5 hours of the 2nd dose of Moderna I start to get pain in the arms and legs, feel weir at night time like light headache, dizziness and uncomfortable in breathing that wake me up at the middle of the night. Blood pressure elevated higher than normal. After a week the arm&#39;s pain getting better,but the legs&#39; pain gets worse. Since then my legs pain and join pain getting worse and worse, its hurts with activities and no pain at rest while seat or lay down. I&#39;ve been through many doctors visits including the Urgent Care, ER, Neurology and rheumatology doctors and had many kinds of testing and found nothing wrong with my heart, lung, blood clots in the legs, Both of my legs are just progressively getting worse,both legs are getting more pain and weaker, that make me hard to lift them up for walking. I almost can&#39;t work now. I also feel so tired, dizzy and headache for 2-3 days each time that come and go since the 2nd dose of the vaccine. I&#39;ll have the MRI tests on 06/05/2021 and 06/06/2021.

He said I was in a fib. We watched it for a few days, and  then went in to the doctor. They did an EKG and determined I was indeed in afib. They switched my medication which did not really help. I began having intermittent episodes of the arrhythmia. I went back to the doctor and I was still in afib. They scheduled me for a cardioversion. When I went in for the procedure, they ran tests that determined I was not in afib. I was releases and I have been okay since.

She reports that her husband received a 2nd shot on 2/25/2021 and on 3/20/2021 was in so much pain in his leg that she took him to the Emergency Room. Reports he then received an ultrasound where it was found that  he had a blood clot in his upper leg (near groin). She has heard about the issues with COVID vaccine and blood clots and wanted to make sure that this was reported. He is following with his PCP and Vein specialist. Reports he received the shot from Pharmacy. She said she will probably do a VAERS report also. Reports is doing much better now, but thought they should have it reported.

Prior to receiving the vaccine,  I was in excellent health, physically active (long walks, and gym 3-4 days/week), normal BMI, and excellent cholesterol numbers. BP had been &#34;borderline high&#34; for several years, but 3 different doctors agreed that no medical treatment was needed - just stay physically active and reduce fat and sodium in diet, which I did. I am retired with no financial worries, so stress is not a factor. Stroke occurred 5.5 weeks after receiving second Moderna vaccine.

No Medical History information was reported.   On 18-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 18-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (2 weeks after 2nd dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine went into serious atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (2 weeks after 2nd dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine went into serious atrial fibrillation) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Echocardiogram: inconclusive (Inconclusive) Inconclusive.         No treatment medications were provided by the reporter.  The doctors took an echocardiogram and his heart is wonderful and they can not figure out why he went into atrial fibrillation. He now have to take an expensive medication to prevent his heart going into atrial fibrillation and we are wondering if it was possible he got it from  Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.

Since then he has been light headed, dizzy, some peripheral eye issues. He falls asleep in less than two minuets. He was told to give it some time that these were side effects from the Covid shot. He made an appointment with his primary doctor on June 10th, had several blood test done, many came back with extremely abnormal results. He was sent to an oncologist, the bone marrow aspiration revealed PH&#43;Chronic Myloid Leukemia. Patient was very healthy prior to this, had had blood work within the previous year that was 100% normal at that time!!

                                                Within several days of vacine developed an irregular heartbeat. Went to my doctor on March 11th and was referred to a cardiologist. First appointment with cardiologist showed irregular heart beat and made appointment for further tests. On March 28th fitted with a moniter  for 3 days.

                                                Out of know where on 1-13-21 awoke at 3:00 AM with severe anxiety which has continued to date, 1-31-21 but not as severe.  Unable to sleep, no matter what medication given.   At beginning had high blood pressure which is unusual for me and heart palpitations.  Had two trips to the ER , 1-13-21  9:00 PM, released  and  1-15-21 10:00  PM and admitted, kept for one day.   Heart palpitations decreased within the first week and blood pressure came down to normal.    Unable to sleep, after being given Hydroxyzine Hydrochloride-25mg and later Alprazolam-.5 mg.   Tried taking herbs before taking Alprazolam due to the addiction factor.  Took Kava , Deep Sleep and CBD.  Took Alprazolam after herbs didn&#39;t seem to help but it made me feel bad and didn&#39;t help with the sleep so went to over the counter sleep aid.

                                                Five days after my first Moderna COVID vaccine and seven days after  the second dose I had arrhythmia that lasted from around 5PM until after I went to bed.  When I woke up the following morning my heart beat was normal again.  Hence the episodes in both cases lasted more than seven but under fifteen hours.

PT HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS COVID VACCINATION AND WAS PULLING INTO THE OBSERVATION AREA WHEN HE LOST CONTROL OF HIS TRUCK, BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND CRASHED INTO A LIGHT POLE. THIS OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THE STANDBY MEDIC UNIT AND OTHER FIRE DEPT STAFF. PT WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN CARDIAC ARREST. CPR WAS INITIATED WITHIN SECONDS OF BEING REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE. EMS WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DEFIBRILLATED FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SINE WAVE VT/COURSE VF WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF HIS ARREST. PT WAS PLACED ONTO A BACK BOARD AND MOVED TO AMBULANCE IN A PULSED VT AND WAS AWAKE AND RESPONSIVE. ONCE IN THE BACK THE PT WAS WIRED INTO THE FOUR LEAD AND WAS SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERTED AT 100 J WITH A CONVERSION TO A PULSED JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM WITH A RATE OF ABOUT 58. THIS RHYTHM CHANGED INTO A SINUS TACH AT ABOUT 100 BPM. IV ACCESS WAS OBTAINED AND 100 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS ADMINISTERED WITH A 2:1 LIDO DRIP HUNG. AMBULANCE BEGAN TRANSPORT TO ER. OVER NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES PT BEGAN HAVING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY IN THE FORM OF PVCs COUPLETS AND EVENTUALLY 4-5 BEAT RUNS OF VTACH WHILE ON PHONE WITH ER MD. DISCUSSED GIVING ANOTHER BOLUS OF LIDO AND INCREASING DRIP TO 3:1 DUE TO INCREASING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY. THE ER PHYSICIAN CONCURRED AND ANOTHER 75 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS GIVEN FOLLOWED BY INCREASING THE DRIP RATE TO 3MG/MINUTE FOLLOWING THE SECOND LIDO DOSE AND DRIP ADJUSTMENT THE PATIENT&#39;S VENTRICULAR ECTOPY RESOLVED AND THE PATIENT REMAINED IN A SINUS RHYTHM / SLOW SINUS TACH THROUGHOUT TRANSPORT AND TRANSFER OF CARE TO THE ER. A 12 LEAD WAS OBTAINED JUST PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN ED THAT SHOWED SINUS TACH WITHOUT VENTRICULAR ECTOPY BUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE PACs, FLIPPED T WAVES IN a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

Sat down, and next thing I knew I has fainted (approx 7:45-8a).  Police were called, then First Aid Squad.  Very pale, sweaty and nauseous (threw up 2x).  Went to Hospital.  Was evaluated in the ED for approx 6 hrs, then transferred to a room for overnight observation.

Wife heard a loud crash and found me in bathtub.  I don&#39;t recall falling but shower curtain fell down and have minor neck and back discomfort at this time.  Wife assisted me to crawl out of tub and she reported I &#34;passed out&#34; two more times for short durations as I crawled back into bed. Had profuse cold sweating episode for about 15 minutes.  Much less weakness now at 10 am, no dizziness but still a mild headache.

                                                Patient and wife called in to report patient experiencing 7/10 constant stomach pain, uncontrollable shaking, and numbness and tingling bilateral feet. Patient reports receiving his first covid vaccine dose 2-17-21 and experiencing symptoms, today Patient states, &#34;I can&#39;t feel the bottoms of my feet&#34; and &#34;it feels like I&#39;m going to throw up&#34;. Patient denies difficulty breathing. Patient was able to check pulse will on phone with triage nurse with pulse 93 and blood pressure 147/107. Patient requesting to have triage nurse call 911-EMS; HPI  The patient is a 69 year old male who states that he had the 1st dose of COVID vaccine yesterday morning.  The patient states that approximately 24 hours later, he developed stomach cramping.  He has nausea.  He denies any diarrhea.  He has not vomited.  Patient denies any cough or shortness of breath.  He complains of generalized weakness.  The patient also has chronic back pain.  Patient is noted to have a low-grade fever here, however, he does not report any fever. CHIEF COMPLAINT: WEAKNESS (per ems, pt got covid vaccine 24 hours ago, feeling weak and dizzy since 1500, tachycardia); Assessment/Plan DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition: 1. Hepatitis; The patient presents with a low-grade temperature, which isn&#39;t unexpected given that he received his COVID-19 vaccine yesterday.  However, the patient complains of abdominal pain.  Lab work does show elevated bilirubin, alk-phos, AST and ALT.  The patient has no previous history of this.  I did obtain both CT and ultrasound imaging of the gallbladder, which shows no pathology.  Subsequently, the patient was reassessed.  He is ambulated.  He is steady on his feet.  He does not desaturate.  He has no subjective complaints while walking.  I discussed the patient&#39;s lab abnormalities with him.  The patient prefers to go home and follow up for lab retesting on Monday.  Patient was given strict return instructions.  He will return should he develop any new or worsening symptoms.  He is going to have his labs redrawn on Monday and follow shortly with his primary care provider.  Given the normal imaging studies, I do think that these findings are likely related to a reaction to his vaccination.  This was discussed at length with the patient.  Patient is discharged home in stable condition.

                                                patient states that immediately following administration of covid vaccine on 2/5  he began to experience profuse sweating, dizziness and nausea. He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

                                                The patient was admitted for recurrent syncope that began on Friday evening 2/19. He fell twice and struck his head, knocking 2 teeth loose. He continued to feel lightheaded the next day and came to the ED and was admitted for syncope workup. His workup was negative. On discharge, patient recalled that he received his 1st Covid vaccine.  His symptoms resolved after admission. This event was likely related to his vaccination.

                                                Day after first shot, experienced  some arm pain, elevated temperature, chills, very tired.  Of concern, blood pressure spiked to 149/78 (usually 120/70) and stayed elevated all day.  I contacted my cardiologist  late in the afternoon and he advised me to come in if the blood pressure did not return to normal the next day.  The next day, all symtoms disappeared and I felt normal.  When I received my second shot yesterday the doctor giving the injection said the blood pressure spike after the first shot was unusual and asked me to submit a VAERS  report.  My symptoms after the second shot  were a much more significant loss of mobility in the arm, which has returned to near normal.   but no blood pressure issue

Concomitant product use included nifedipine and fenofibrate.  On 20-JAN-2021, approximately a week and a half or two prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 030L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  A week and a half or two later the patient stated feeling unwell, headaches, body aches, chest pain, decreased appetite and diarrhea for which patient was hospitalized on 06-FEB-2021. Since everything seemed to be fine the patient was discharged on an unknown date in FEB-2021 however, patient&#39;s family was not notified that it was a late reaction to the vaccine&#39;s first dose. Later, due to shortness of breath he was hospitalized again on 08-FEB-2021 and was diagnosed for pneumonia and was intubated on the same day. Due to COVID-19 situation patient&#39;s family could not be in the facilities and that there wasn&#39;t any follow up of the patient given to the family, so family did not have much information.  During the first hospitalization(06-FEB-2021) the patient had a blood test which showed a normal result and was tested for COVID-19 and Influenza, both were negative. During second hospitalization (08-FEB-2021) the hospital said that the patient was stable. The patient&#39;s family did not know the results of the tests conducted at the time.   The action taken with the vaccine in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia was fatal. The patient died on 14 Feb 2021  The cause of death was reported as COVID-19 related pneumonia. The autopsy was not done.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The cause of death was reported as COVID-19 related pneumonia. Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the events are assessed as unlikely related. Further information has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: COVID-19 pneumonia

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

                                                He received his vaccine, had a sore arm and that evening around 7 hours later it was as if a switch flipped he was not able to breath, and his wife noticed on his body she could see all his veins like a track on his trunk and everywhere.  He could not talk.   He said that he was burning up, was hot and clammy.  He got in the shower to cool himself down, and was told that the oxygen was not getting to where it was supposed to go.  His wife called 9-1-1 and the EMT&#39;s said that his oxygen had dropped down into the 60&#39;s. He went to the hospital and they said he had pulmonary edema that filled his lungs that quickly.  He was not intubated, and is on a BiPAP.  He was given Lasix, steroids, antibiotics trying to pull the fluid off of his lungs.  He has had so many different scenarios from people at the hospital right now and at one time one of his nurses said that his blood work showed a possible blood clot.  They looked at his lungs and they said that they did not see it in his lungs.  Then they said that he had a heart attack and that he needed a valve replacement.  Today, 3/25/21 they told him that he did not have a heart attack, did not need a valve replacement.  Last night they said that his BP was dangerously high and today, his BP is fine.  He also had an adverse reaction to the steroids and had a ROID rage from that as well giving the nurses and his wife a hard time, hanging up the phone on her, and said that he was leaving the hospital.   He was fine prior to the vaccine, and does not have any other issues for him to have this reaction.  He is in ICU and they keep saying that they are going to put him in a cardiac care unit.  He has a lot of IV lines and his 2nd COVID test came back negative.   He feels like they are just running test to get money out of him.  They said that he may be able to go home tomorrow.

                                                His symptoms began at 9PM of the day of the second dose of Moderna vaccine (gat 10AM 3/11/2021. He was well prior to the vaccine. He had no antecedent infection like the previous events of asthma attacks. He took Zyrtec the night before and the day of the vaccine of both doses of the vaccine.  He has not been any asthma medication for six years except 3-4 uses of albuterol during the fall Wildfire season. Vaccine lot numbers: 1st 041LZ0A, 2nd  003AQ1A. H ehad similar incident in 2012 after Reclast second dose. Had flushing first and then asthma flare. Lasted a couple weeks with just inhalers then had to do prednisone to calm it down. When tapered off he relapsed and had to do three iterations over a couple months.  After the second vaccine on Thursday AM, he was well until about 9PM that night, he developed sore throat and coughing that progressed through the night. On Friday AM he started using his nebulizer with albuterol and budesonide. His symptoms were manageable over the weekend. On Monday he coughed up a large collection of clear mucus and felt much better. On Wednesday 3/17, symptoms returned with cough and shortness of breath. He was started on a single dose of prednisone 40 mg and on Thursday he was seen in clinic. His symptoms seemed to be a mix of laryngeal and chest irritation. He was given an 8-day tapering course of prednisone and albuterol-ipratropium nebs every 6 hours. On follow up 3/25, he was much better except for side effects of the steroids. He is still being followed so I will provide updates if there is some change. He had a very similar reaction to Reclast in 2012 but has tolerated all other vaccines previously.

By about a week and a half out from his vaccine he states he was &#34;sleeping all the time.&#34;  At 2 weeks he had a bad nose bleed that lasted an hour and was extremely hard to stop.  A week later he had another bad nose bleed and couldn&#39;t stop it so went to the ER where they treated it with a &#34;plug.&#34;  The next day the ER removed the plug because it was bothering him so much.  Mid week on the 4th week he had another bad nose bleed and saw an ENT who cauterized it.  ENT advised he not receive dose 2 of the Covid vaccine in case the vaccine contributed to his severe nose bleeds.  No history of nosebleeds.

A new stroke 24 hours after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccination Moderna  On Tuesday April 6, 2021 the patient showered by himself, walked up and down stairs in the home and was able to walk with the assistance of a cane.  He received the Moderna vaccination second dose at 10:00am (I believe this was an adverse event caused by the vaccination)  Wednesday April 7th at approximately 1:30pm I noticed he was unresponsive prompting me to call 911. His MRI at Hospital clearly diagnosed him as having another stroke, causing patient to no longer walk and use the restroom without assistance.  He is still in the hospital. Hospitalization and Physical Therapy is needed to allow patient to continue practicing as an Attorney.

This seemed to stuck in my esophagus causing pain in the chest. I could not swallow even water and the pain (spasm) subsided in 15-20 min. I did not try to anyting else on that day and only rested. Next day (04/08/2021) a similar problem appeared when I tried to swallow the first bite of lunch. It felt as the piece got stuct in the middle of esophagus and I could not move it in any direction. The pain kept increasing for 20 min and a clear flegm came to my mouth probably from stomach and started to interfere with breathing. I managed to wash my mouth and physically remove most of the sticky flegm. I managed to rest

I got out of bed a little woozy and proceeded to kitchen to have a bicarbonate of soda and blacked out and fell to the floor for a few seconds. I crawled to the bathroom for a bowel movement. I then went back to the kitchen for the bicarb walking at this time. Still a little woozy but okay. Went back to bed, realizing the area of the shoulder was very sore. Much more so than 1st shot. Very restless night. No treatment necessary.

On the afternoon at an unknown time, his leg had gotten worse.  He had severe pain on his left leg; it was painful to the touch; it was swollen and was hard as a rock.  He called 911.  He was taken to  Hospital.  Pt wanted me to report that he did not receive any treatment for his blood clot.  He received a Lidocaine patch on his knee and was given a prescription for Voltaren Gel.  (he was expecting to receive TPA to dissolve the clot like a few times before when he had blood clots but this particular time he did not)

                                                I started feeling bad the Sunday afternoon after the Friday afternoon injection.  Slight fatigue.  By Monday afternoon, I was feeling very light headed, very tired and very spaced out. I took my blood pressure at home.  It registered 205/105.  I immediately went to the ER near my home.  There the doctor tried to reduce my blood pressure with oral medication.   The doctor was not successful in reducing my blood pressure. After 6 hours in the ER I was transported and admitted to Hospital, for observation.  I was given an IV blood pressure medication prior to the  ride over to the hospital and it did come down with the top line at 150.  I was observed until 6 pm the next day.  Two hours before release my blood pressure was hovering around 180/95.  I had a number of test in the hospital.  Full blood workup, CT Scan, MRI of my brain and an Echo Cardiogram with a Saline IV solution.  All the test came back with a good result.  I have continued to have problems with balance, memory loss and concentration up to this day, 06/10/2021.  I have made a conscious decision not to take the second due to what I perceive as a dangerous reaction to the first vaccination.

                                                About 1 month after the 2nd dose vaccine, I had swollen right ankle, my right shoulder also felt tense, my right jaw has slight pain when I am opening and closing my mouth.  I also feel the area of my heart, a slight sharp pain that comes and goes. I also have buckling of both my knees.  I went to see my doctor,  They did a X-ray, CT scan,  and Venous duplex- everything came back normal and did not find anything, The doctor suggested I decrease salt intake.  As of now, I am still having intermitten swollen ankles and buckling of my legs, jaw pain and heart symptoms. I am using a air compression massager to increase the blood flow to the legs.

I saw PA who had me do a stress test which I passed easily and a one week heart monitor test which showed the PVCs but no other irregularities. The PVCs are ongoing. They can keep me awake at night I now take Magnesium which help most nights so that I can sleep. Some nights its not too good. I fear that this has no end. It has been going on for 4 months.

                                                After the vaccine, usually has accumulation for mucous in the nose.  Scheduled for surgery in May with ENT to expand passageway.  Has had nose bleeds before.  Woke up blew his nose, felt it running and then had severe nose bleed.  Was clotting up and then blew it out.  Also had used a chemical using his bathtub and the nosebleeds have occurred every morning for the last 3-4 days.  Anytime he gets ready to go to the doctor it stops.  Just first thing in the morning upon wakening and only after he blows his nose.  Which he called the 24-hour nurse line and she instructed him on how to stop the bleeding, and told him not to blow his nose.  He was examined by his ENT in Oct/Nov was told that he was normal other than the balloon procedure.  Is going to FU with his ENT.

Tylenol was finally able to reduce the fever, but the next day it rose to 102,  and the following day also to 102, still having pains in his legs. On day 4, his oxygen level dropped to 80 (he did have congestive heart failure exactly one year ago, but it was corrected in ten days and his oxygen level had been perfect until the vaccine). We are now on day 6 and his oxygen is slowing improving after increasing Lasix. His body had an awful shock with this vaccine which medical people feel contributed to him almost sinking to congestive heart failure again. Even with all his medications he presents as a healthy individual usually.

Then apparently I blacked out for approximately 5 minutes and my wife noticed and tried to rouse me. When I came to, I was still dizzy and went to lie down. Symptoms abated within a half hour or so. After about 2 hours, following phone calls to primary care Dr., we went to hospital ER for examination. Following intake we were seen by ER Dr. after approx. 7 hours.

                                                I was diagnosed with covid 12/1/2020 ended up in hospital 01/03/2021 with low ox level of 83, got it up to 92 by next day, was send home with no ox given steroids, started feeling better and was about 90% by last weekend. got dose one of Moderna vacine on this last Monday, about 7 hours later got a real good cough and had the covid taste in my mouth. Each night since then at night get a real bad cough and fluid in lungs. My blood ox has not been bad, one time as low as 91 but mostly 94 to 98. Is this common to get a real bad cough after vacine?

My primary care phuysician recoemneded that I go to ER on 2/23/21 to have Cat Scan (negative), EKG (normal), blood work (normal except high glucose reading). ER doctor diagnosis was peripheral vertigo not central and discharged me with recomendation to take OTC meclizine twice daily. The spinning side effect has virtually disappeared, still some lightheaded feeling and persistent equilibrium./balance problems exist that prevemt from me driving and performing most daily activities. My Chiropractor has prefromed the  Epley Maneuver twice now but has had very little impact on my equilibrium and balance issues, I have an appointment with a specialist Nuerotologist on March 10, 2021

Dateline and symptoms:  03/01 Received first Moderna Covid Vaccination at 3:45 p.m... 03/02 No symptoms until 6 p.m. When blood pressure started to go up from my normal level of 116/68 to 179/82 by 10 p.m..  During this time I had what felt like mild electric currents from the left side of my chest down my left arm and into my hand.  These systems subsided around 11 p.m. and by midnight my blood pressure was almost back to normal. 03/03 Felt sluggish all day but no blood pressure problems. 03/04 Felt great all day then around 6 p.m. my blood pressure started to rise, by 9:30 p.m. it was 190/90.  At this time I started to feel like my body was shutting down, my face felt flush, and experiencing long distant vision problems, so I had my wife take me to the emergency room. At 10:00 p.m. I went to the emergency room  EKG  showed no heart problems, the blood test showed no heart problems, and after 11:30 p.m. my blood pressure started going down and I was released at 1:30 a.m..  Blood test did show high levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen 26.0, Bun/Creatinine Ratio 33.0, Aspartate Amino Tranf (AST/SGOT) 43, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) 59 and Alkaline Phosphatase 189, all of which are higher than my last blood test on 10/22/20. 03/05  As of 10:30 a.m. my blood pressure is 126/62.  I feel fine except I&#39;m very tired from not much sleep last night.  1p.m. Starting to feel some more chest and arm symptoms as described before, blood pressure now 146/66. Events happened twice, 2 days apart.

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

All over body weak, palpitation short of breath during activity, had to lie down. I&#39;m an acupuncture doctor, already couldn&#39;t work, couldn&#39;t drive.

                                                My father received the first Covid shot 3/2; he woke up 3/3 with severe body aches and weakness, which we thought nothing of.  However, every day, he got weaker and weaker. He has been treated for Liver cancer, he received his first infusion of Opdivo almost 4 weeks before the vaccination.  About 7 days after the shot, he was having trouble swallowing so he went to the ER to get a CT scan. He was found to have greatly elevated troponins, the DR was baffled he wasn?t having any chest pain; they were apparently not trending either., he has never had a heart attack or any other heart problems, takes Nadolol for high blood pressure. The CT scan showed significant growth of his tumors  which had been stable for a year and the last CT scan was the end of January; liver enzymes were also significantly elevated whereas they were stable before.  My father deteriorated rapidly, and died on 3/18/21. The day he got the shot just prior, he was hauling wood, shoveling snow and living a normal life feeling good. The day after the shot he could barely get out of bed he was so weak, until he finally died 16 days later.

Pt states he received his 2nd dose of Moderna SARS-CoV2 immunization 4 days prior to arrival and developed SOB since then. He states that the SOB progressed and included coughing productive of bloody/blood-tinged sputum. The main reason he decided to come to the hospital was because of his shortness of breath and associated chest tightness which he says radiated into his abdomen.    In the ED he was found to have new RBBB and troponin 7.2. He was seen by cardiology d/t concern for NSTEMI, started on heparin gtt, and taken to the cath lab. There he was found to have RCA lesions x2: the more proximal underwent stent placement, the more distal lesion was unable to be stented. Post-procedure pt&#39;s respiratory status was tenuous and therefore CCM was consulted. Patient discharged 9 days after admission after somewhat rocky course of recovery.

Subsequently I began to have difficulty swallowing as well as experiencing some sub sternal pain. Went to get my Epipen and put it beside me in bed. Difficulty swallowing got a bit worse but as I was not experiencing shortness of breath I held off the Epinephrine injection. (What on earth was I thinking?!)The &#34;semi anaphylaxis&#34; was self limiting and by 11:00 PM symptoms had subsided completely. But by approximately 11:30 MP I had severe rigors lasting about 3 - 5 minutes. On 3/25 I developed a severe headache and a low grade T (T-max 99.9). Took Tylenol 825mg with good effect. The following night I had severe night sweats, drenching 3 sets of pajamas. Today, on 3/26 I have been experiencing several cold sweats and I am altogether feeling &#34;strange&#34; (can&#39;t put my finger on it - maybe dehydration?). Have vegan to aggressively hydrate. Notified my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office. Agreed to &#34;ride it out&#34; for now. Shall see my PPP on

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (no medical history provided.).    On 15-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DIZZINESS (dizziness) and NAUSEA (nausea). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body) and RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department), HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure), DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), DIZZINESS (dizziness), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body), RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck) and NAUSEA (nausea) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   A pharmacist suggested the patient take Children&#39;s Benadryl followed by Zyrtec to help with the itching. These medicines have not helped alleviate his intense itching. On 1Apr2021, the patient collapsed and was taken to the emergency department. The patient was treated at the emergency department after he collapsed from low blood pressure. He was prescribed Hydroxyzine HCI 10mg for the itching by the emergency room physician, but the medicine has done nothing to alleviate the patient&#39;s symptoms.  Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Ras and nausea are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                The day after my second shot I got a fever and felt run down through that day, that evening I developed diarrhea which lasted until the following day. All of this I expected from what I had heard that some people have after the second shot. But what I didn&#39;t expect was from then until now which has been approximately 6 weeks I am cramped and my lower abdomen everyday and I&#39;m also experiencing atrial fibrillation almost constantly which I&#39;ve never done before. All my episodes with a fib in the past were due to times when I had been very nauseous or very cramped and would go into a fib which lasted 10 12 hours but for the last 12 years I&#39;ve been on atenolol for that and it has kept me from experiencing those problems. But since the second shot I&#39;m experiencing atrial fibrillation like I said every day with the cramping which I&#39;ve never had before to that extent. I&#39;m reporting this because something isn&#39;t quite right and if this is a coincidence it&#39;s a pretty good one.

On CT of neck, an aortic dissection was partially visualized. A CT of his chest was done and aortic dissection was diagnosed. He was transferred to IMC for surgery. At surgery, it was discovered that the dissection had been chronic. He struggled during recovery and was eventually discharged to a SNF. Unfortunately, he developed a stroke in the SNF and was brought back to the ER on 03/17/2021. His prognosis is poor and on 03/22/2021 he was discharged home on hospice.

Following the injection, and within 24 hours, I began experiencing severe vasovagal, with severe bloating, severe headaches, severe weakness and mental cloudiness.  It is difficult, and at times virtually impossible to urinate and defacate.  Any tissues with columnar linings are severely swollen, from the eustachian tubes to trachea and esophagus, including all intestinal organs.  In fact all organ systems are involved.  It is very painful, and has forced my retirement from practice, as I cannot provide the care that is needed for my patients.  Severe fatigue continues, with severe headaches, cloudiness, inability to concentrate.

He experienced flu like symptons for about 24 hours. This was on Saturday. On Tuesday he died. They said it was a heart attack. He was in excellent health. We had gone to the gym 3 days a week for years. He was doing Cardio on the bike and treadmill for over an hour each time.

I had listlessness, fatigue, cold/flu symptoms, etc.  With the second shot on 3/29/21, I didn&#39;t seem to have as much of a reaction, but then I started getting diarrhea, and a flare in my Crohn&#39;s.  Since then I have had abdominal spasms, bleeding (as if I was on blood thinners), increased bowel urgency, several bowel accidents, stomach pain, and severe fatigue.  I have contacted my doctor for assistance in my treatment but thought I should report this in case it was a response to the vaccine.

Was helped to the bathroom, but was unable to get back to bed on his own.  Fell on his bottom.  I had to call our son to come pick him up and help him back to bed, unable to hold his own weight..  Had trouble sleeping.  Abt 1 pm needed help getting up again, same disorientation, also fell off the toilet and needed help getting back to the bed, unable to hold his own weight.  Finally fell asleep.  Next day seemed fine enough. Tuesday night, became ill again, went to bed.  Got up to go to the bathroom, was wobbly, but able to make it.  Was helped back, wobbly but able to walk. Trouble falling asleep, fever, chills.  Finally fell asleep at 3 am Wed morning.  I had to go to the doctor early, so left him sleeping in bed.  When I came back around 11 am, he was still sleeping, snoring loudly.  Became concerned.  Wouldn&#39;t wake up.  Called Paramedics.  CT scan at the hospital revealed a brain bleed.  Transported to hospital. Put on support for almost 2 weeks.  No progress, no response.  Finally support was discontinued and he died April 19th at 7:52 pm.

                                                Patient became unconscious the evening of 4/14/21.  This event occurred five days after his second Covid vaccination. Patient had just gotten up from a living room chair and was walking over to the stairs to go to the second floor when he became rigid, lost consciousness and fell backward.  911 was called by his girlfriend.  He was unconscious for a couple of minutes.  When EMT&#39;s arrived he was conscious but very groggy.  His blood pressure was 250/157.  He knew his name and year and SSN but did not correctly answer several other questions.  He was taken to ER.  After numerous tests over the course of several days, he was diagnosed as having a stroke.    In the ER, they performed CAT scans, EKG, blood work, urine test and chest xray.  Blood pressure remained high.  Complained of headaches.  Patient was also having trouble voiding urine in the ER so a foley catheter was inserted.  He was admitted to the hospital.  After admission, an MRI, echocardiogram and EEG were performed.  The MRI showed three small blood vessels had burst in his brain.  Echocardiogram showed functions were normal.  The EEG showed some slowing but no signs of seizure.  The conclusion was a stroke.  Physical and occupational therapy examined patient.  No need for further therapy.  Blood pressure remains slightly elevated but he does not appear at this time to have lost any physical or mental functions.  Patient does NOT have a history of high blood pressure or heart issues.  Tests showed his heart was functioning properly.  Per his family doctor, his BP ran approximately 124/64 when tested during the previous 12 months.

                                                Patient presented to the emergency room for evaluation of shortness of breath and chest pain that started two days prior (one day after receiving first Moderna vaccine). Symptoms worse with exertion. Chest pain is described as a heaviness, does not radiate.  EKG in the emergency room that showed ST elevations in III and aVF and his troponin was found to be 40.5 and so code STEMI was activated.  Patient had cardiac cath on an urgent basis and that showed triple-vessel disease, with a very short left main as LAD and left circumflex were almost coming from 2 separate ostia, subtotal occlusion of the LAD and left circumflex and 100% occlusion of the mid RCA.   Evaluated for CABG,  which was declined.  Patient&#39;s echocardiogram showed global hypokinesia with EF of 20 to 25%.  Patient underwent high risk PCI procedure using Impella support with 2 stents to the subtotally occluded LAD and 1 stent to the subtotally occluded left circumflex.  Patient&#39;s symptoms subsided following procedure, however patient suffered mild CHF on initial CXR secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, successfully treated with Lasix as displayed by downtrending BNP. Patient&#39;s labs also displayed shock liver with AST and ALT liver enzymes both above 1000 on arrival; hepatitis and HIV titers came back negative. Patient suffered from AKI on arrival secondary to ischemia, with an elevated BUN and creatinine; CKD suspected due to lab values showing chronic anemia.

He states that his right lower extremity tightened up and the cramping extended all the way into the foot. His leg began shaking uncontrollably. Called EMS and arrived in ED for evaluation. Noted to have labored breathing and confusion. Blood alcohol 170. Elevated D-dimer. The patient was given nebulizer treatments without significant improvement. BP 119/68, HR 76, RR 19. oxygen sat 96% on room air. Speaking in short sentences, audible wheezing. CT angiogram with contrast: findings suspiscious for pulmonary embolism, involving segmental branches of both lungs. No large central embolism identified. Patient started on apixaban. No signs of hemodynamic compromise. Plan 3 months anticoagulation.

He was found to have extensive DVT LLE.   He denies recent travel or prolonged immobilization, he denies injury to the leg, he denies previous blood clots/blood disorder/cancer.   This is sooner than I would expect patient to begin having symptoms after DVT after covid vaccination however I have no other clear etiology at this time.

Patient is afebrile upon arrival with otherwise normal vital signs.  He did desaturate to 88% while at rest and was placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  He has clear breath sounds bilaterally without any focal findings.  Work of breathing is not increased and very stable in my opinion.  He appears clinically euvolemic and denies history of heart failure.  No wheezing warranting treatment beta agonist.  Patient will require admission given his acute respiratory insufficiency, will need to discuss appropriate Campus placement with the Heart Transplant Service and anticipate he will require transfer to Grand Rapids.  Given his reported dyspnea, EKG ordered.  Will obtain routine screening labs, COVID-19 swab.  With his reported fever, although not objectively present during this visit, and current immunocompromised state, will treat via the emergency department sepsis protocol and collect blood cultures.  Fri May 21, 2021 1059 EKG with a normal sinus rhythm, rate of 88 beats per minute, no acute ischemic changes are noted.  Patient has a right bundle-branch block.  EKG is unchanged from that of January 21, 2021. BNP is 404, no chest pain to warrant cardiac biomarkers.   [SR] 1113 COVID-19 is detected.   [SR] 1125 CMP was sodium of 128, chloride 95, glucose 303, creatinine 0.87.  Magnesium is 1.9.  Phosphorus 2.1.  Urinalysis with trace blood, no urinary tract infection.  Urinalysis without urinary tract infection.   [SR] 1147 INR subtherapeutic at 1.2.   [SR] 1149 Received a critical result from lab, white blood cell count is 0.04, patient is by definition therefore neutropenic.  Platelets are 21 K without reported active bleeding.  Hemoglobin is 9.3.  Have a call out to Oncology to discuss need for IV cefepime given the reported fevers at home although etiologies presumably viral with COVID-19 test.  Further, I do not know if IV Decadron is appropriate given his profound neutropenia, especially having recently finished a high-dose course of 100 mg prednisone orally x5 days.   [SR] 1150 CXR: Airspace opacities are seen involving both the lungs, more prominent in the right lung, as described above. These are likely due to consolidation/pneumonia. Viral pneumonia can also have similar appearance. Correlate clinically.    [SR] 1218 Discussed case with Dr. from transplant team who agreed with admission to his service .  He did recommend that I broaden his antibiotic regimen to include both IV vancomycin and IV cefepime.  He recommended that I do provided dose of IV Decadron despite the neutropenia to treat his acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.  Still awaiting call back from Oncology.   [SR] 1454 After multiple pages, I have not been connected to Oncology.  Patient was transported by EMS.  He will need a formal oncology consult upon arrival to admitting facility.   [SR]

                                                Upon EMS arrival on 03/21/2021, I was found to be in ventricular tachycardia with the rate of about 250.  IV amiodarone bolus 150 mg was given with no effect.  I then received cardioversion resulting in normal sinus rhythm and symptoms resolved.  I was taken to  Hospital and on the morning of 03/22/2021 underwent cardiac cath because of elevated troponin that was found to be negative.  That afternoon I underwent AICD placement and I was discharged on 03/23/2021.

                                                On 04/14/2021 patient lost his memory for about 3 - 4 hours starting at 1600.  I called paramedics who suggested that he needed to go to ER due to an abnormal EKG.  At the ER he was tested and Dr. concentrated on his memory loss, no mention about his heart report and he was sent home.  04/15/2021 I spoke with RN regarding the ECG report which I did not understand; she was concerned and suggested that patient return to the ER. The doctor called early on 04/16/2021 and demanded that patient go to the ER, he was having a heart attack and needed to get there immediately; the doctor called the ER and let them know we were on the way.  We arrived at the ER at approximately 0900 and another ECG was performed and it was noted that he was having trouble with his heart and a Cardiologist was assigned to him.  By 1600 the patient was having a pacemaker implanted into his left chest wall. The patient is now living with a pacemaker, but still suffering from dizziness, weakness, short of breath, and is now experiencing muscle or nerve pain on his feet, legs, and arms.  The 3 - 4 hours that the patient suffered memory loss on 04/14/2021 is memory he has not been able to recall up to this date; he continues suffering from short terms of memory loss where he can&#39;t recall where he placed certain objects.

I got worse over the next couple of days. I was having trouble breathing, my chest hurt and I was coughing. I was hospitalized on 06/04/2021 for five days. I was given steroids afterward and I followed up with my doctor on 06/16/2021. I was diagnosed with acute pneumonia. I still have some coughing fits now after five weeks. It is improving.

                                                Pneumonia; coughing up blood; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 71-year old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced pneumonia and coughing up blood.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included COVID-19. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 19 Jan 2021, approximately 1 day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20 Jan 2021, the patient began to cough up blood and was seen and treated by a healthcare professional. A chest x-ray was done and revealed pneumonia. Treatment for the event included doxycycline, prednisone and an inhaler.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pneumonia and coughing up blood, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old male subject, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Pneumonia, and non-serious unexpected event of Hemoptysis. The events occurred one day after the first dose of the mRNA-1273 administration. Treatment for the event included doxycycline, prednisone and an inhaler. Since Pneumonia has insidious onset rather than acute onset, the event was possibly related to underlying condition confounded by elderly age of patient. Very limited information regarding these events have been provided at this time. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event of Pneumonia and Hemoptysis, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Sitting at home talking with my wife ant two friends and started feeling &#34;dizzy&#34;. They said I started shaking and head rolled back and I was out for a minute. I did not know anything had happened when I opened my eyes.  They insisted that I go to the hospital.  EMS came and tested me on the way to hospital- all tests good. Same at the hospital- you may have the results.   Not a seizure, no high blood pressure, maybe vaccine reaction? they weren&#39;t sure what it was, and wanted to keep me overnight and I said no thanks. Home about 5 PM I feel fine.  Please let me know if you want to go over.

                                                felt so bad; severe chest pain; Chest pain and arm pain; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning her husband, a 71-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced abnormal feeling, severe chest pain,  and arm pain.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included the patient had a heart attack on 26 May 2020 and on October 2020 the patient had five bypass, two arteries they took. Since October the patient&#39;s condition was stated to be great. Concomitant medications reported included Insulin Bovine, Multivitamins [vitamins Nos], acetylsalicylic acid and Medication related to patient&#39;s heart attack.  On 12 Feb 2021, unspecified days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:007M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Feb 2021, post receiving mRNA-1273, the patient had no reaction and did not feel bad.  On unspecified day in Feb 2021 one week prior to the reporting the events, the patient experienced chest pain and arm pain, minimum that lasted for 10 minutes. 3 or 4 night prior reporting the event, the patient was feeling abnormal, went to ER and was hospitalized with severe chest pain. The patient was in a regular room and was transferred to ICU. Next day, Cardiac catheterization was performed to see the patient&#39;s heart and found that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing.  Treatment for the event, severe chest pain included morphine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event of arm pain was considered Recovered/Resolved.  The events, abnormal feeling, severe chest pain were considered as unknown. The patient is still hospitalized.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old, male patient, who experienced severe chest pain, feeling abnormal. Cardiac catheterization was performed which showed that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack (May 2020) and bypass (October 2020) confounds the causality. Further information has been requested.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

                                                Approx. 2 hrs after the shot, I felt disturbances in the chest heart area. Taking pulse, felt &#34;skip beats&#34;. These sometimes were occurring at 5 beats or so intervals. I had no prior history of heart palpitations. Went to Emergency room at for evaluation at approx. 11:00 pm. The attending doctor was .  Diagnosis: Premature Ventricular Contractions that the DR stated were likely from the COVID-19 vaccine.   AS of today, 04/01/2021, I am still having occasional episodes of the PVCs.

Ambulance arrived and determined to take me to hospital after having 2nd syncope in their presence.  Remained in hospital overnight.  All vitals, heart and bloodwork were fine as seen by cardiac doctor and  determined it was dehydration.  Followed up with primary physician and told him I was urinating excessively.  He put me on Flomax 0.4 mg.  I had the 2nd Moderna shot on March 23rd and again was taken to the hospital on March 31st with same symptoms and near syncope and again was told it was clinical dehydration.  They told me to drink a combination of pedialite and water which I have been doing and I am still experiencing the dizziness, lightheadedness and weakness.  Woke up on April 4th and felt like my soul was being ripped from my body.  I honestly thought I was going to die. Looked on line and found forums of people experiencing similar symptoms.  Went to pharmacy and they recommended meclizine and have taken a clonipin for anxiety.  I am feeling better now, but worried about how long I will be experiencing these symptons.

They tend to be long in endurance, the first one took 5 hours to stop.  The others tend to last about an hour and have made daily functioning difficult.    The question is, is this a side effect of the vaccine and will he continue this when he receives the 2nd dose?

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

I tried taking supplements from my chiropractor but they were not adequate. Even the Pads I wore were insufficient to stem the flow.  There was bleeding as well.  Then went to an Urgent Care facility and they prescribed an antibiotic which worked. It was both painful and embarrassing ( I have to stand and greet people in my position). I suffered for about 6 weeks through this.

He felt okay for about 2 weeks then on January 29, 2021 he felt intense chest pain. Concerned it was a heart attack, he was brought to the hospital. He stayed one night and the hospital ran several tests like EKG, stress test and others. Found his results to be normal and was released on January 20, 2021. Even the moment he was released, he felt very dizzy but hospital was not concerned and thought maybe side effect of medication. He continued to feel dizzy, fuzzy brain and hard time staying awake during the day and sleeping through the night for the rest of the week. He passed sometime in the early hours of February 6, 2021. Doctor&#39;s suspicion is a blood clot. He has no history of blood clots, heart problems or any health issues.

                                                Several weeks after the 2nd vaccine, I started having slight nose bleeds, this lasted for 2 weeks then stopped. After that I noticed my arms, fingers tingling like when they go to sleep. this was happening throughout the day getting worse. I took my BP and the Diastolic number was in the 60&#39;s sometimes 50&#39;s. I stopped taking my BP medication (been 2 weeks now) and the tingling has stopped, but my Diastolic # is till low, in the 60s. I have an appointment this Thursday, May 6 with the above doctor for a checkup and will make her aware of this reaction. I will see my cardiologist in June, who is the one who placed me on BP medication in 2014 and will ask him what to do.

                                                Began having nausea / upset stomach or stomach ache, and often pain behind and/or below sternum .  The symptoms would come and go daily for about 8 weeks and last for about  one to three hours each time, sometimes before mealtimes.  Would often be gone after a meal.  As of today, 5/21 I still have the stomach ache once in a while.      The morning after the first shot, I awoke with a severe stiff neck all the way around.  I&#39;ve had the stiff neck every day so far.  After 7 weeks I went to a chiropractor for 6 treatments over about 6 weeks with little relief.  As of today the stiff neck is about 60 % better.

                                                My dad started having breathing problems and heart fluttering shortly after getting his first covid vaccination on April 9, 2021. He had contracted Covid back in October 2020. He never told us he was getting the vaccination until we got a call on his cell phone from Public Health the day after he died of a pulmonary embolism. When he started complaining of symptoms, his doctor referred him to a cardiologist at a Clinic. He had an appointment with them a few days before he died. Apparently, they didn&#39;t find any blood cllots, possibly because they were looking for heart issues. Either way, I believe that my dad died from side effects of the Moderna vaccine. My dad died on May 1, 2021 of a pulmonary embolism. The coroner and County Sheriff both said it was one of the biggest blood clots they had ever seen.  Since he had no history of blood clots, I thought it important that I report it.

                                                Two weeks after receiving the final injection, my father was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. He had poor oxygen saturation which prompted a visit to the ER. Upon x-ray he was found to have a large pneumonia in his left lung. After 10 days at the local hospital,  and being placed on a ventilator, he became septic and was air lifted to one of our area&#39;s larger hospitals. There, he was diagnosed with necrotizing pneumonia caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa. He also had heart rate accelerations that would climb into the 150s and they could never figure out why. He was treated aggressively with antibiotics and was successfully weaned off the vent. However, his body was unable to fight off the infection and he ended up passing away from necrotizing pneumonia that caused his respiratory system to fail. My father had underlying COPD that was well-managed at home and he did not require oxygen. I was questioned several times as to whether he&#39;d gotten into or been around anyone or anything different from his usual, but he had not. The only thing out of the ordinary he had was the Moderna injections.

                                                I am filing this on behalf of my sister, who feels it needs to be reported but she is too grief-stricken to do this herself.   The morning after the second shot, my sister texted that her husband was up at least 10 times during the night, and five times the next night. He was agitated and hallucinating (swatting at bugs that weren&#39;t there.) For the next four weeks he had progressively more difficult breathing, and on 4/28 a liter of fluid was drained from his chest. He continued to have difficulty breathing and was taken by ambulance to Hospital on May 2 where they again drained his chest and diagnosed him with pneumonia. A nurse told him they were seeing a number of cases of fluid around the lungs (his fluid was around the lungs, not in them) after COVID vaccines. He was sent home May 4 and commented that it was strange his cardiologist hadn&#39;t visited.   Almost immediately he was experiencing liver and gall bladder pain, even though tests for those showed the two organs were healthy. On May 8 my sister said patient woke up hyperventilating, which also became more frequent. On the 9th his daughter told me the labs were not trending well, and on May 10 he saw his cardiologist. He diagnosed him with congestive heart failure and got him an appointment at the Heart Hospital on May 17 - he explained congestive heart failure is scary but can be managed through programs at the heart hospital. He began sleeping outside because it made it easier to breathe.   On May 15 he was advised to go to the ER/Hospital for tests the heart hospital would need and, once there, they discovered his kidneys weren&#39;t functioning and he was admitted immediately. He spent 17 days at Hospital- if the kidneys improved, the heart got worse. If the heart improved, the kidneys failed. He was released on June 2.   On June 7  my brother took him to get blood work done - Patient was too weak to get in and out of the car by himself. The blood work came back bad, and on June 8 he was admitted to the Heart Hospital. On June 10 he was transferred to the Regional Community Hospital to be closer to his cardiologist. From there he continued to decline, and the doctors wanted to do surgery for a LVAD but couldn&#39;t. To help him get stronger, he had an impeller put in by catheter on June 19 and died that night.   His own cardiologist said congestive heart failure is manageable. The symptoms started the night of the second vaccine and his illness wasn&#39;t gradual - he went off a cliff. With all the heart problems appearing in males, we don&#39;t think this was coincidence.

I thought it was just a reaction to the shot. 5 or 6 days later I ended up in the hospital with a bad infection (Sepsis) and while in the hospital went into fibrillation that would not stop.  They rushed me down to the OR to shock my heart back to a normal rhythm.  I was in the hospital for 8 days. Now I am on blood thinners and a drug to stablize my rhythm so it can&#39;t happen again. I have a new heart doctor who is doing much testing. I have never had a heart problem before I took the shot.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

The next morning, however, I woke up in sinus rhythm and feel normal.

                                                I began feeling feverish about 12 hours after the vaccination.  Fever went above 101 deg, at times for about 24 hours.  I took one 650 mg Acetaminophen at 0330 the following morning to reduce the fever and continued taking this at 6 hour intervals until 1/22 (today).  Also I had a headache, sore muscles and symptoms similar to the flu during this entire period.  During the first night just before taking the Acetaminophen my pulse was up to 104 bpm.  It went down during the following day to about 84 and is now at 72 bpm (9am/Jan22); my normal pulse is usually between 58 and 64 bpm.

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

                                                Patient presented with sharp right lower quadrant abdominal pain with associated nausea and emesis beginning the day he received the COVID vaccine, after vaccine injection. He had decreased appetite and pain was made worse by eating.  He presented to the hospital 3 days (2/6/21) after receiving the vaccine/symptom onset. His vital signs were T 101.5, HR 78, BP 156/67, RR 20, SpO2 94 on RA.   As discussed below, imaging showed acalculous cholecysitis. The day after presentation, pain was more localized to RUQ.  He was treated with IV ceftriaxone and flagyl. He underwent percutaneous cholecystomy tube place on 2/7/21 with plan for delayed cholecystectomy following drain placement x 6 weeks. Bile fluid culture has been no growth. We are attempting to test bile fluid for COVID-19 via PCR.   He tested positive for COVID-19 via nasal swab RT-PCR and developed a 3L oxygen requirement and mild dyspnea. He was treated with remdesivir and dexamathasone 2/6-2/10 with resolution of hypoxia and dyspnea.

I went to the emergency room, and by the time I got there and was examined, my blood pressure was down to about 175/ 90.   After the brief exam and blood draw / EKG, I was left in the waiting room.  After about 3 hours, I felt better, and asked the nurse about leaving.  She took a final blood pressure, which was about 165 / 90, and I left.     I had a similar, slightly less severe episode a week later, Thursday, Feb 11, and went to urgent care.  Additional testing, including thyroid hormone was all normal.

                                                Four days after receiving the Moderna second dose, I had a pulmonary embolism of my right lung. It was diagnosed only on Feb. 19, as I was totally unfamiliar with the symptoms and had another indication of a problem: tachycardia, so went to the clinic. I am not sure this isn&#39;t coincidental, but I have no history of embolisms, and no family history. No one at the time of my diagnosis asked when I gotten vaccine. As I said , this may be entirely coincidental, or it may not.  I am presently on eliquis blood thinners, and have had no further problems.

                                                I?ve been taking blood pressure medicine for approximately 12 years and all has been well, The medication has consistently maintained me in the normal, that is safe, range.  Approximately a day and a half after the injection I experienced a spike in blood pressure. This had never happened before. My BP  then consistently maintained 145/90 or so until now, after the initial spike, which was a little higher.  Believing that this was an auto immune response to the vaccination, I was hoping my blood pressure would  return to normal. Alas it has not. I have notified my primary doctor and expect to hear from her tomorrow. Although there are other factors involved, age, slightly over normal weight, not the best heart healthy food, I don?t believe this is a coincidence. It makes me wonder about the safety of getting a second injection. Since the shot I have also experienced an increase in thirst.

He began falling over in the chair and seemed very pale. His wife was with him and myself and two customers in the store were helping to keep him awake. 911 was called and did arrive. He was barely speaking at first and then when he was given oxygen by 911 he began to come to. His wife was stating that he had not eaten today. Paramedics took him to the hospital, he was awake and conscious when they took him.

                                                this is all per family, 4 to 5 days after 2nd COVID vaccine he was acting unusual and was taken to the hospital. He had a clot in his brain and underwent brain surgery. He experienced seizures after the surgery, but it was ultimately reported the surgery went well. He remained intubated and on a ventilator after surgery. He developed complications of his lungs and kidneys while on the ventilator. Ventilator was removed 3/16/2021 and he passed away that day. The hospital providers thought the clot in the brain may have been from hitting his head over a month ago. From my understanding he was A&amp;O, independent with ADLs, and lived in his private residence prior to these complications.

By late evening, it had gone to skipping only maybe every 6th or 8th beat.    After sleeping well all night, in the morning the heartbeat was fine -- no recurrence in almost 2 weeks since then.     (Because of heart surgery 20&#43; years ago, on other nights I do have occasional skipped beats -- just one &#34;miss&#34; at a time -- but nothing at all like this continuous series.)  Had NO OTHER  after-effects, none like the ones reported in the news and by acquaintances.

                                                Evening of 3 March 2021 around 7 pm started to feel chills with fever and cold sweets. Left arm beginning to feel very sore at injection site. Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

She was fine after about a day.  My father reported  arm soreness and fatigue that lasted about three days after the shot.  He thought he was rebounding from the shot and continued his usual activities.  Though, he started complaining of being &#34;winded&#34; and difficulty breathing.  He slept a lot and continued with fatigue and shallow breathing.  A week after his shot he felt he needed to go to the ER because of difficulty breathing and being exhausted after walking up a flight of stairs (we live in a raised ranch style house).

He was readmitted to hospital for shortness of breath which was evaluated from Feb 19 - Feb 21, 2021 I spoke with his daughter today. She was with him at home when he went to the bathroom and since he had not come out for some time, she knocked on the door and found him collapsed in the bathroom. She called 911, who did CPR, however he had passed away. He was referred to the coroner. He had his first Moderna vaccine on March 15, 2021 after which he had not had any side effects. He received his second dose on April 12, 2021 and had not mentioned any side effects other than mild abdominal discomfort. Daughter said his shortness of breath had been improving after his discharge from the hospital. He had not complained of chest pain, cough, fever, diarrhea, in the last few days. I paid condolences to daughter and told here we would be reviewing the case to see if there was any relationship to him receiving the Covid19 vaccine and that the case had already been referred to the coroners office.

                                                Got 2nd Moderna shot. 8 days later got extremely dizzy, felt pain all over body, threw up. Taken to hospital . Given blood transfusion that worked. Spent  5 days in ICU; 2 days in regular hospital room. NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT VACCINE CAUSED IT. Doctors say unlikely but possible so I felt I should report it since it was so close in time to getting vaccine and I never had those problems before. Blood pressure got so low that doctors say I would have died without the transfusion.      After 1st Moderna shot (Jan. 15,2021) had only slightly dizzy, heart rate increased significantly and blood pressure went very high. All of those 1st shot issues went away in about half an hour. Serious problems only occurred after 2nd shot. Scarred to get booster next year unless doctors find that vaccine was not the cause of problem.

                                                Starting within a couple of weeks, my husband began having nosebleeds.  He has never in our 50 years of marriage had them.  I knew he was taking a blood thinner and Eliquist do I didn?t think much about it.  And once he evident bit his inner lip and got a huge blood blister. On 4/19 he got a nosebleed that we could not stop and ended up going to the ER.  Had to wear a nose pack for 3 days, went to have it removed but it still bleed uncontrollably.  Had to wear a pack for another week.  After the cardiologist reduced his eliquist, it seemed to quit bleeding.

Pt. only has muscle function in the right side of his body due to his stroke damage. His wife immediately approached him in his chair and asked him what was wrong and all he was able to state was &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; before loosing consciousness and stopping breathing. 911 was immediately called and due to his wife being frail herself she was not able to remove him from his wheelchair to perform any CPR. EMS arrived and begin performing CPR until the DNR papers for pt. were located. Medical examiner came to the home and stated she did not feel that an autopsy was needed even though family had told her NUMEROUS times that pt. had received his second Covid vaccine the day prior. He was pronounced dead by the medical examiner and taken directly to the funeral home due to the DNR papers being present.

The next morning on 03/20/2021 around 9:00 AM, I noticed my left arm swelling. I got to feeling real bad.  On 03/25/2021, I was feeling so bad that I went to Family Medicine to see my doctor, MD.  He sent me straight to the Emergency room.  They gave me the clot buster for my left arm. I was in there for 3 or 4 days. I was discharged. I have blood clots in my lungs. I had a follow up appointment.  I also started seeing a new doctor, a pulmonologist,  for the blood clots in my lungs. I lost a lot of weight, 32 pounds.

I approached him and he was losing consciousness and starting turning pale. He was also profusely sweating. I called 911 and EMS soon arrived and took his vitals. His wife gave EMS his history and told them this happens when he has blood drawn. This did not happen after his first dose of Moderna vaccine. He was lying down on his side. EMS took an EKG and said his heart looked good. His blood pressure was 120/90. After 10 minutes patient said he was feeling fine and did not want to go to the hospital. He answered all of EMS&#39;s questions correctly such as &#34;Where are you?&#34; &#34;What year is it?&#34; &#34;Who is the president?&#34; &#34; How many quarters are in a dollar?&#34; Patient went home with his wife and said he will follow up with his doctor. I will call him tomorrow on 6-18-21 to see how he is doing.

I had a change in rhythm again after that and I had to be cardioverted a second time. On 6/8, in the evening, I palpated an irregular pulse associated with atrial fibrillation. This continued until I was cardioverted in the afternoon of 6/14. Since then I have not experienced an irregular pulse. I am scheduled a follow up on 8/5 with my cardiologist. I have had 2 ablations in the hopes they would give a cure, but they have not.

                                                Received shot on Thursday, December 31. Had no side effects other than sore arm until Monday, January 4 when I had a bout of diarrhea followed by a rapid heart beat, which when checked was 146, then went to 149 and few minutes later was 150.  I became worried and called my cardiologist and the clinic was closed.  The cardiologist on call called me back.  After describing my symptoms and that I had received the Covid 19 shot several days earlier.  He advised me to monitor my heart rate and if it continued to go to the ER.  Shortly after, my heart rate returned to normal, so I did not go to the ER.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  I received a Moderna covid-19 vaccination (Lot # 007M20A)  at 10:20 AM on Monday 02-01-2021 at the VA Clinic .  Between 3 and 4 minutes later I began to experience difficulty breathing, sweating and feeling warm, and then I passed out behind the steering wheel of my parked car, while sitting with my wife.  I came to after few minutes as people were attempting to get me out of my car and into a wheelchair, but I had difficulty breathing, couldn?t move, and had to be pulled out.  After being put in the wheelchair, I passed out again and came to after I had been taken out of the wheelchair and laid on my left side on the ground by Fire Dept. EMT?s.  I then began to retch, but did not vomit.   My wife said that one of the EMT?s pumped my chest a couple of times. They lifted me onto a gurney and put me in an ambulance, hit me with an EPI pen, and placed an oxygen mask on my face, as I was having great difficulty breathing.  I was unable to move or lift my arms to help them place a blood pressure cuff on my arm, a pulse monitor on my finger, and lift my shirt to help them attach EKG pads. Atthat point I realized that I had also lost control of my bladder at some point. I continued to have difficulty breathing, and started to experience extreme shivering all the while to emergency Room. Once in the Emergency Room, I could not move myself off the FD gurney, and they had to lift the sheet that I was laying on in order to move me onto the hospital gurney. I had great difficulty helping the technicians remove my shirt so that they could administer another EKG and start an IV (LR 1,000ml bolus).   I continued to have difficulty breathing and kept shivering and sweating for some time.  I was advised that the EKG?s both appeared normal.  After a lengthy period of I gradually reached a point where I stopped shivering and sweating, and returned to almost normal breathing.  I was finally released around 1-1:30 PM.

                                                I had no issues with the first Moderna dose, but 5 days after the 2nd dose I experienced chills, dizziness and slight nausea when up and moving.  This lasted 2 days and started going away on day 3, but the dizziness is still slightly  present.  Also, during this time I?ve continually monitored my BP and pulse.  My BP has been elevated averaging around 165/95 (my normal is close to 145/85).  Pulse has been steady averaging around 66-68 which is normal for me.  Today,  my BP is around 150/90 so it?s slowly getting back to normal on day 9 (post vaccine #2).   Also, I had no other symptoms and my temperature was steady at 97 degrees since the vaccination.

                                                Pain in arm developed after several days. Pain continuing through today 2/24/2021. Soreness in arm not mediated by pain meds, including Tramadol 50 MG that I take for back problems. Injection site was never red nor swollen. Trouble lifting arm without pain. Limited mobility without pain. On scale of 1 to 10 with ten being worst, pain varies between 3 and 7 at times.  Also have developed partially uncontrolled high blood pressure not mediated by heart meds, chiefly losartan. Before first vaccine, I was taking 50 mg daily. Increased to 100 mg daily on 2/1/2021 without stabalizing BP. BP can range during day from 106/60 to 158/86 with Pulse in 60s.

                                                Seizures; Mini stroke; Tired; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 73-year-old male who received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced seizures, mini stroke, confused, agitated, eyes were abnormal, memory impairment, and tired.   The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack and stent placement in 2011. His relevant concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan cilexetil, clopidogrel bisulfate, diltiazem hydrochloride, ezetimibe, adenosine, gabapentin, metoprolol tartrate and rosuvastatin calcium.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 14 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, 30 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot#010M20A) intramuscularly in left deltoid for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Feb 2021, With in 30 minutes of receiving the vaccination, the patient had a seizure. They took him to the hospital, where he had a computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood work and had a consult. After consult, they said, it&#39;s a mini stroke. They released him and told her if it happens again call 911. He felt so tired and went to sleep at home. Around 17:00 dinner time, he woke up looked very blankly, and his wife reported knowing he had another seizure. She reported he ran to his keys saying, &#34;I have to go&#34;, seemed confused, agitated and didn&#39;t know where he was. She called 911 andhe was transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  Around 19:00 the same day, he was admitted to do scans overnight. Around 21:00, patient&#39;s eyes were abnormal, he became agitated again and nurses confirmed he was having another seizure. 30 minutes later, he was talking to his wife and daughter as if he didn&#39;t remember anything. He mentioned some metallic taste in his mouth.  On 11 Feb 2021, they did an electroencephalogram (EEG) and confirmed that he was having seizure. He was prescribed seizure medication and released him from hospital. However, the patient and his wife reported not wanting him to take the medication as they believe the events were due to the vaccine. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with vaccine is not applicable as the patient received both the doses.  The outcomes of the events, seizures, mini stroke, and tired, were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack and concomitant medication use can be confounding factor. Further information has been requested.

                                                Patient called this afternoon to report decreased oxygen levels after agency.   Patient reports to have COPD and remains on oxygen. He reports after the administration his oxygen levels will dip as low as to 70 percent when oxygen is removed. Upon speaking to the patient he did admit to feeling bad several days before the administration in which he had a physician&#39;s office visit due to complaints of chest pain. The patient said the physician preformed x-rays and EKG to evaluate his symptoms. All test reported no abnormal findings. The physician changed his breathing medication and added steroid therapy for a few days to help him recover. This apt occurred on Tuesday 23rd. The administration occurred on Friday 26th. The patient said they experienced the &#34;trouble breathing&#34; during the weekend. He contacted his physician again on Monday the 1st and reported the vaccine had made him worse. Unfortunately he contacted them at 4:15 in the after before the office closed and they told him to report to the ER if he was in discomfort. He called me today the report the issue at 4:30ish. I was able to reach out to his pulmonary physician to confirm his therapy and previous apt and complaints.  They instructed me to tell the patient to make an appointment if needed.   The patient does not fill medication here. On the vaccination form he denied feeling unwell as well as denied the use of steroid therapy.

                                                I am writing this to let you know that two weeks after receiving my first COVID 19 vaccination I developed a   severe blood clot from my right ankle to my right groin.   I am Factor 5 deficient, and believe that the vaccine caused the clot.  I had no symptoms at all until I noticed my right calf was swollen (no pain).  My wife insisted I go to emergency because I am Factor 5 deficient and inclined to thickening of the blood.  I  have not been on a plane or taken a long trip by car.  I walk 3 miles a day, play golf and am very active.  I strongly believe the vaccine caused the clot.  I will be on blood thinners the rest of my life..

Same pattern and gone after 24 hours.    But on 3/22/2021,  it started in the evening and lasted for 36 hours.  This time the additional symptom of non-productive cough appeared for the first time.  COVID test during that same day (in anticipation of angiogram on the 24th) was negative.  Oxygen levels continued to be low while in hospital for angiogram which resulted in two stents being emplaced and the following day for a TEE to get a better look at the valve.  No chills or cough until evening of the 25th.  Chills lasted for 24 hours, but non-productive cough and low oxygen levels persist up through the present time (March 29th).   This is the first time one of these episodes has lasted for more than 24-36 hours.  Without supplemental oxygen, my oxygen levels are 82 (walking) and 85 (resting).  Supplemental oxygen at 2 lpm brings the SpO2 up to 89-90.

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

                                                Patient woke up around 3:30am feeling extremely nauseous, shaking, drenched in sweat but with a normal temperature (97.6, which is normal for him), and feeling overall terrible.  Food had tasted weird to him the day before, but he still ate. At 3:30am, he felt like he was having a major allergy attack - lots of phlegm, runny nose and eyes. He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black &#34;coffee grounds-like&#34; fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE). After getting through with that (about 15 minutes), he wretched up more thick mucus with a few flecks of black cells in it. After awhile, he felt okay enough to go back to sleep.  Around 6am, he had another major allergy-like attack, but did not vomit.  Around 8am, after being awake for awhile, he vomited again with more black liquid, about 50mL this time. He felt weak and horrible and was shaking. At the recommendation of the advice nurse, he was taken to the ER by ambulance. Upon arriving, he waited around an hour for an ER bed.  They put him on an IV, did a physical inspection and did blood work. His sodium was a bit low, but in normal range. Potassium levels were fine. He was mentally clear the whole time, but physically very weak.  He was kept overnight after a hemochrit test in the afternoon showed low levels of hemoglobin. He was stabilized in the morning, but was barely able to eat anything the whole time. He was meant to get an endoscopy, but they decided to allow him to eat and sent him home after noon bc they hadn&#39;t yet been able to schedule him for it and he was in pain and massively hungry.  When he got home, he still barely ate,  and still isn&#39;t eating almost anything a day later. His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).  They believe that he may have bleeding in his stomach or upper GI or esophagus, but we are waiting for an endoscopy later this week.  He is still very weak and frail and fatigued.

                                                My father received the first dose of the moderna vaccine on February 21, 2021. On March 19, 2021 my father exhibited stroke-like symptoms and was admitted into the hospital for a medical emergency. The doctors ran multiple tests and determined that he suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA). His symptoms subsided and he was discharged on March 20, 2021. He received his second dose of the moderna vaccine on March 21, 2021 and, on the same day, suffered the same stroke-like symptoms which the doctors determined was another TIA. My father had no previous history of strokes, seizures or stroke-like symptoms prior to receiving the moderna vaccine. My father was re-admitted into the hospital on March 21, 2021 and over the course of two weeks was subject to a number of tests which revealed that his platelet count had significantly decreased to the point where his blood began to clot. They diagnosed him with a sudden onset of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The doctors explained that TTP was very serious and life-threatening disease if left untreated. Since this discovery, my father has needed to receive multiple plasma exchanges and rituximab treatments. I have written records asking the doctors about the link between the moderna vaccine and his TTP. The doctors recommended that I report this information. I believe it&#39;s critical for others to be made aware about the serious side effects of the moderna vaccine. I am willing to share my father&#39;s medical records which proves the drastic decrease in his platelet count following his receiving the moderna vaccine.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse effect (No relevant medical history reported) and Surgery. Concomitant products included thyroid medication  for an unknown indication, cholesterol medication.    On 13-Feb-2021 at 10:30 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 13-Feb-2021, the patient experienced SMALL INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION (Blocked small intestine) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 13-Mar-2021, the patient experienced INTESTINAL ISCHAEMIA (small intestine got blocked and due to blockage blood supply stopped) (seriousness criterion medically significant), THROMBOSIS (started having blood clot thrombosis both in his right leg as well as left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (Missed the 2nd dose). On 13-Mar-2021, PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (Missed the 2nd dose) had resolved. At the time of the report, SMALL INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION (Blocked small intestine), INTESTINAL ISCHAEMIA (small intestine got blocked and due to blockage blood supply stopped) and THROMBOSIS (started having blood clot thrombosis both in his right leg as well as left leg) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications included thyroid medication and cholesterol medication. Patient called in to report that he received his 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 13Feb2021 in left arm at 10.30 am and his 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine was scheduled on 13Mar2021. On 13Mar2021he went to Emergency Room (ER) and he had major surgery on  small intestine, patient mentioned that his small intestine got blocked and due to blockage the blood supply was stopped and the intestine started to die. On that day, the patient underwent a surgical procedure which the  doctor had to take out 12 inches of small intestine and stapled back. He was hospitalized for five  days. Five to seven days after his surgery,  he developed blood clot thrombosis in his right and left legs. Treatment for the event included blood thinner, which he has been on for 45 days. It was reported that the second dose of Moderna vaccine was missed due to hospitalization for the events and the blood thinner that he was on.

He was airlifted to another Hospital and was there until 3-13-21 while there he received a feeding tube because he couldn&#39;t eat because he lost the ability to swallow without it going to his lungs. he was then sent to a rehab facility till 4-6-21. with a total hospitals and rehab stay of a month and 2 days. he is extremely weak on his right side unable to stand and walk on his own, he has vertigo and severe balance issues, he also still is unable to see having double vision and other issues escalating the dizziness. still on multiple medications for issues from this. he was a very strong independent hard working man, working more then half the people half his age, this has greatly effected his life and we are lucky to still have him because the stroke was bad enough that we know that they saved his life only by the quick action of the hospital

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma.    On 16-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 16-Jan-2021, the patient experienced PAIN IN EXTREMITY (My arm was hurt for a couple of days.) and PYREXIA (Fever). On 17-Jan-2021, the patient experienced HYPERTENSION (blood pressure was 190/110) (seriousness criterion medically significant), TREMOR (I had tremors as if I was in the cold) and HEADACHE (Headache). On an unknown date, the patient experienced CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME (he developed tingling in left arm through fingers  PCP mentioned carpal tunnel syndrome) and LIMB DISCOMFORT (it is hard to move left hand). At the time of the report, HYPERTENSION (blood pressure was 190/110), TREMOR (I had tremors as if I was in the cold), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (My arm was hurt for a couple of days.), CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME (he developed tingling in left arm through fingers  PCP mentioned carpal tunnel syndrome), LIMB DISCOMFORT (it is hard to move left hand), PYREXIA (Fever) and HEADACHE (Headache) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 17-Jan-2021, Blood pressure measurement: 190/110 mmHg abnormal. On an unknown date, Blood pressure measurement: 127/74 mmHg normal and 140/73 mmHg abnormal.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medication was not reported.  This case concerns a 73-year-old male with a serious unexpected event of hypertension, and nonserious unexpected pain in extremity, tremor, carpal tunnel syndrome, limb discomfort, and expected pyrexia, headache. Latency 2 days after first dose mRNA-1273. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Patient received Moderna COVID Vaccinations on January 14, and February 11, 2021. On May 17th patient requested a Telemedicine visit for chest congestion, painful cough, tightness in chest since May 14th - diagnosed with acute bronchitis and provided prescriptions for prednisone BID, Doxycycline BID, and Benzonatate  Q6H prn cough. On May 18th the patient presented to the ED for evaluation of confusion upon waking. Upon arrival patient was febrile (102), CRP was 224. Evaluation was significant for acute respiratory failure with hypoxia secondary to COVID pneumonia. CT scan demonstrated multifocal  pneumonia consistent with COVID. He was started on 2L oxygen via NC, dextamethasone, remdesivir (2 doses given), &amp; Duo Neb treatments. He initially did well on 2L. On the 20th, he began to decompensate. He went from 2L to Airvo 55L 70% at 11am. Procalcitonin went from 0.26 to 0.96. Ceftriaxone &amp; doxycycline was initiated. He maintained saturations on the Airvo, &amp; was even weaned down to 55%. On May 21st, he has decompensated further, with saturations quickly dropping to the upper 80&#39;s with minimal activity. RR has been 28-32. Airvo settings were increased to 60L/95%. Saturations are now 88-93%. ABG was 7.45-38-60-27-92%. He was given an additional IV dextamethasone. Patient will be transferred to Medical center for a higher level of care.

                                                2nd Covid shot (Thursday 2/18 AM) , Sudden pain (Monday 2/22/21 PM) Bad pain in left Leg (Calf) after walking &lt;2minutes or 2 flights of stairs. Started suddenly Monday pm.  I was walking about 1 to  1.5 miles a day and did a big walk that morning. Call to Cardiologist led to test next AM (Tuesday 2/23) for DVT.  US=&gt; NO DVT but reduced blood flow left leg.  UltraSound &amp; PVR on Saturday ( 2/26/21) showed reduced blood flow left leg below knee.  CT-scan and Runoff (3/12/21) showed Left Poplilteal Artery  100 % blocked behind left knee.  All other arteries both leg wide open. Consultation with Vascular Surgeon (04/01/21) suggested blood clot from heart!.  Holter Monitor for two weeks (4/19/21) showed no Afibs. Continuation of what happened. Cardiac Calcium score on 5/24/21 which was a total of 13.  All arteries clear except LAD at 13.  All leg arteries clear and all heart arteries clear &amp; no afibs!!! TEE  (6/4/21)  showed blood clot in Left Atrial Appendage. I was placed on Eliquist 5mg 2x day on Friday 6/5/21. On Friday 6/11/21 I didn&#39;t feel well and went to Emergency Room at Hospital. Was admitted with  high white cell count and low PB, fever 101F  Only visible thing was red area under left armpit. I was placed on IV antibiotics Vancomycin 1gm/bag and Ceftriaxone 1gm/bag, several bags over 4 days.  Next morning Saturday 6/12/21 developed very large red lesions on both side of my trunk each about 10&#34;x8&#34;. No one in hospital knew what it was or how to treat it.  Areas were red, warm, slightly itchy. The Arm pit lesion eventually turned to a target and eventually went away with the IV antibiotic treatments over 4 days in hospital. Dx: Possible Tic bite.   Monday 6/14/21 I was released from hospital, with no one knowing what was going on with rash on body.  One Doctor decided that the newest medicine (Eliquis) might be the cause and changed it to Zoralto. I had an Emergency Apt with Dermatologist (6/15/21) who was stumped and had to consult with 3 other doctors in the group to finally decided it was probably &#34;Fixed-Drug-Eruption&#34; and recommended topical Steroids (Clobetasol 0.05%). I have results of all test and photos etc if interested.  At this point in time, no one knows 1) why the blood clot developed  2) what or why I got these big red areas on my body which I am now actively treating. All or some may have to do with the immune system and possible activation or stimulation or whatever possibly from the Covid shot?   I am still trying to track down the blood clot and may get an implantable Loop monitor to conform never any afibs.  You can call me for any questions. The sudden blood clot 4 days after covid seemed to come out of no where as I don&#39;t have afibs, as far as we know, I don&#39;t have blocked arteries, either in legs or heart.  Big mystery to me and my doctors at this point.  I still have appointment with vascular specialist in Philadelphia on July 1. Please stay in touch with me.

I had an EKG done which showed my irregular heartbeat. I was referred to have a cardioversion done.  I am just waiting to see if the cardioversion works if it doesn&#39;t I will have to have an  ablation done. I have seen a neurologist (Dr.) for my headaches. He ordered an MRI of my head which I had done yesterday (6/29/21). I am on Eliquis 5mg 2xday due to my irregular heartbeat.

By April 7th the dizziness was even more concerning, I checked my blood pressure and it was a little high so I limited my caffeine aspirin etc. I was having brain fog, fatigue, dizziness and blurred vision. On April 29 I went to the doctor. I was examined and was prescribed meclizine. It did not seem to help at all. The headaches and all persisted about 2 months before the dizziness was not so bad. I still have the blurred vision and headache problems. My eyes seem like they cannot focus. I have been dealing with this for 3 months now.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

Patient&#39;s wife reports his death was sudden, he passed away sitting in his chair his heart just stopped she said. They tried to perform CPR, 911 was called and paramedics arrived at the scene and he was given medication but never had any return of vital signs and so his death was called at the scene. Wife reports he was not ill, did not have any symptoms prior to the event. They are not going to be doing a autopsy. She wanted us to know based on timing that there may be some possible correlation with his COVID19 vaccine. He obtained the vaccine on 02/09/2021 - wife reports he had no symptoms, not even arm soreness after the vaccine. Had no fever, shortness of breath. Did not complain of chest pain. We can update chart to reflect the patient is deceased and lets make a card for the family.

                                                Initially I had the pain in the arm which I anticipated.  Several hours later I noticed that I had flu like symptons and my bones seemed to be painful.  Eventually I began having intermittent rapid heart beat.  I thought this may have been induced by tea (caffeine).  This rapid heart beat lasted until Monday (Feb. 15) I think.  As I mentioned it was intermittent.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

Patient had received first COVID vaccination approx. 9 days prior. Patient admitted to ICU for treatment of COVID&#43; PNA. During admission, patient often could not tolerate removal of fluid during HD d/t tachycardia. He received dexamethasone, convalescent plasma for COVID. Patient underwent TTE which was notable for septal wall motion abnormalities and grossly reduced EF. Admission also c/b acute liver injury, possible cholecystitis, thrombocytopenia, SVT, encephalopathy. Patient then developed progressive shock and hemodynamic instability on 3/2 and passed away on 3/2/21.

After increasing basal insulin (Lantus) from 50 units to 65 units (finally settling on an average of 61 units), the next 16 day fasting morning average was 104 mg/dL.  In addition, the non-fasting glucose levels appear to be pretty &#34;brittle&#34; with spikes as high as 334 mg/dL, a level never measured in my 27 years as a type-2 diabetic.  Currently, 26 days after vaccine, using 60-65 units of basal insulin, blood glucose levels seem in control.

Tuesday I felt like I had the virus again-tiredness, slight temperature, chills, intense pain at injection site, slight stomach discomfort. What surprised me and the reason I am reporting this is the symptoms, though gradually better, persisted until Friday-4 days. I was expecting to be down for a day or two, but length of the aftereffects surprised me. I had a strong case of Covid in January 2020.

After starting the infusion he developed sudden onset shortness of breath.  He is noted to be wheezing.  He was given Solu-Medrol and benadryl prior to transfer to ED.   Acute hypoxic respiratory failure in patient with recent Covid diagnosis with sudden worsening during monoclonal antibody infusion.  Differential includes allergic reaction/anaphylaxis, flash pulmonary edema, worsening Covid. Given the wheezing he was given a DuoNeb with no significant improvement but may be slightly decreased wheezing.  Patient was placed on BiPAP given concern for pulmonary edema and increased work of breathing.  We were able to titrate down the FiO2 to 40%.  He was transitioned to high flow nasal cannula.  Will admit to the hospital for further supportive cares given Covid and hypoxic respiratory failure.

                                                Patient received first COVID vaccine on 2/6/2021 and second vaccine on 3/6/2021. Patient presented to Hospital on 4/09/2021 for persistent nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria and jaundice. Patient reported a 1 month history of intermittent nausea and vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, feeling dizzy and weak, poor appetite. Patient had a colonoscopy ~2 weeks prior admission to hospital for cancer screening purposes which was unremarkable and labs done by his primary care at that time were all normal (per admitting physician&#39;s note). At hospital, patient was found to have evidence of hemolytic anemia thought to be autoimmune in nature with a positive direct antiglobulin. Patient was subsequently transferred to hospital on 4/11/2021 for further workup. Patient is still currently admitted to hospital. Oncology was consulted for workup of pancytopenia and suspected warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Throughout admission, the patient&#39;s platelets have ranged between 59-154 k/µL and hemoglobin has ranged 4.5-8.6 g/dL with no documented history of thrombocytopenia or anemia. Patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg x9 doses, prednisone 80 mg daily (1 mg/kg) x5 doses, prednisone 60 mg x1 dose, rituximab 740 mg (375 mg/m2)  x3 doses, and immune globulin 40 g x3 doses. Patient has also received 4 units of packed red blood cells. Given the timing of anemia and thrombocytopenia and unknown etiology, immune response to his COVID vaccine is on the differential.

                                                Awakened around midnight.  Unable to sleep further. at about 4:00 AM got up for bathroom break and      My eyesight was unfocused (and remained so until the afternoon)      I had trouble moving my eyes; stiff; strange      My equilibrium was very poor and unsteady. Had to touch walls, etc      I was generally very weak and had trouble walking and sitting down, and then getting up At about 7-8AM, wrote my new PCP and as I was writing, I started to get intensley hot, sweat like I had malaria (I&#39;ve never had), my heart was REALLY racing, and my skin under my t-shirt became so sensitive I felt like the t was pricking me. Very strange. Started to minimize reactions about 6-8 hours after waking up. I was unable to do my morning PT because of the weakness. I typically go to bed around 23:30, but on the 26th I went to bed at 21:00 and fell right to sleep. Next day (today) was back to 99.9999% normal. Did my morning PT (about 20 minutes plus 10 minutes on the bike). What I have is still soreness in knees. Luckily my pacemaker/defib didn&#39;t get set off by my heart incident. Feel free to call me, if you want.

This helped for about 3 days and then the pain came back.  He went to the doctor.  He had lab work with normal results.  He went to another doctor on 5/13/21.  He prescribed steroids.  This medicine seemed to help but after finishing the medicine his pain returned. On 5/29/2021 he went to Medical ER.  He had blood work and was prescribed more steroids.  He states his blood pressure has gone from 130/78 and now is 191/78.  He says his pain is better at this time while he is still on the steroid medication but thinks the pain will return once he completes it.

My checkup in Feb came back outstanding- no blood pressure medication- no heart medication etc.  I am now under a cardiologist care and being treated with Eliquis &amp; Metoprolol.

The patient felt better for 1-1.5 days, then started to lose his balance, feel low on energy and felt achy and feverish again on May 31st. He kept thinking these symptoms may go away again, and wasn&#39;t sure if they were vaccine side effects or not.  The symptoms continued and the patient fell approximately 10 times the following 5-6 days. His speech also began to slur with a slight facial droop. He went to the ER on June 5th and had a CT, then MRI that confirmed a stroke. Looking back at the course of events, the patient believes his stroke occurred on May 31st. The patient stayed in the hospital for 3 days, then rehabilitation hospital for 14 day receiving inpatient therapy.

Vaccine was administered to right deltoid.  Patient then was asked to sit in the waiting room for 15 minutes for observation.  Patient was sitting in waiting room and developed shortness of breath and dizziness.  Patient vitals signed were obtained blood pressure was elevated 150s/100, heart rate 120s, oxygen level upper 90&#39;s on room air.  Patient was brought to an exam room where he could lay down via wheelchair.  Multiple vital signs were taken during the duration of his time at the clinic.  Blood pressure did come down to 140s/90s, sats remained in  upper 90s, heart rate came down to 70-80.  Patient remained dizzy the entire time.  Patient states that he has a history of idiopathic angioedema as well as a heart stent.  Patient goes on the explain that at different times he can have swelling internally.  He has had this happen several times in the past to his abdomen, saliva glands, tongue, as well as extremities.

After waiting in the clinic for around 45 minutes the patients wife decided it would be best to go to the ER.  EMS was notified. Ambulance responded.  Patient was transported via ambulance to ER.    Patient wife was called the afternoon of the incident.  She states that patient was admitted to the hospital for observation.  He was treated with Benadryl, Pepcid, Decadron; CT of head was normal; blood pressure was still elevated; and they were not sure what was the cause of the episode.  I called the patient&#39;s wife on 1-29-21 to check on patient again.  His wife stated that he was been discharged home.  They were unsure what caused the episode and to follow up with primary physician in one week.  She states that at one week follow up visit they would discuss the need/desire for second COVID vaccine.  .

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

                                                Patient was at clinic to receive his 2nd dose of the Moderna CoVID-19 Vaccine.  Approx 13 minutes after receiving the dose, patient became weak, dizzy, and extremely diaphoretic.  Rapid response was called.  Patient was wheeled into exam room.  BG checked immediately and was 110.  Initial vitals showed HR 39 with BP 83/48.  Patient was transferred to exam table w/o incident.  He did not complain of CP or SOB.  Denies any throat swelling or itching.  He felt very weak and tired.  He continued to be extremely diaphoretic.  An 18G IV was introduced to the left forearm without incident.  He was connected to 1 L bag of 0.9% Normal Saline which was hung to bolus, running well without pressure.  EKG obtained and showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 43.  Possible ST changes in V1 and V2, but not diagnostic of ST elevations or depressions.  There is IVCD noted.  Patient has hx of AFib - not in Afib currently.  Reports on Eliquis instead of Coumadin.  EMS was contacted.    Physical exam performed revealed a bradycardic HR which was regular. No murmurs.  Lungs are clear.  Patient is extremely diaphoretic and pale.  He is alert and oriented x 3.  He is not in respiratory distress and shows no signs of oral swelling. No hives noted on his skin.  Vitals were rechecked at 3 mins and showed SaO2 at 95% and then 92%.  NC O2 applied at 2 L/min continuous and there was improvement to 95%.  He still denies any respiratory distress and was not manifesting any signs of respiratory distress.  Still denied any chest pain.  NS continued to infuse at bolus dose and BP recheck improved to 108/65 - patient was lying supine.  HR remained between 40-42.  At this time, the patient reported improved symptoms and he was not sweating as profusely as previously.  At this time EMS arrived.  Atropine was not administered in the clinic, but was prepared in expectation as a possible next step.  As patient&#39;s symptoms improved, but his vital signs remained altered, he was agreeable to transport to the hospital by EMS.  He was placed on stretcher and care was relinquished to EMS team.  Patient transported out of clinic in guarded condition.

The breakthroughs went mostly away and then began again a few days after the second dose was administered on 2/23/21. This may have nothing to do with the vaccine but may be a recurrence but it seems more than coincidental, timing wise.

He fell and there was a loud thump.  When I ran out he was laying on his back and his eyes were open and looked glazed over.  He started talking as soon as I addressed him.  We called 911 because I was concerned of a head injury.  We elevated his feet and had him wait until help came.  He was able to get up and walk out with the policeman and had the paramedics look at him.  I don&#39;t believe he went with them to the hospital.

Of note, the patient has a pre-existing history of heart attack which is a strong confounder for the reported CVA and speech disorder. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had nothing more than a sore arm after the vaccine and felt fine the next morning so I went to play golf.  On the 4th hole I started feeling light headed and after an hour or so went home and rested.  My resting heart rate after 20 minutes was 88 according to my watch.  It is normally 60-65.  My watch also indicated that my heart rate was 122 while playing golf.  My temperature was 100.5.  After a couple of hours resting my heart rate went down to 75 and temperature lowered to 99.  I felt fine the following morning but my vaccination site turned bright pink and started itching.  This continued for 2 days.  I have had no issues since Friday, March 5th.

My pulse oximeter showed low blood oxygen (between 80 and 85%) and elevated heart rate (high 70&#39;s/low 80&#39;s).  [I took multiple readings to make sure the numbers were accurate.]  By 10 PM my temperature started to increase rapidly.  Max was around 101.5 to 102F.  Sweat profusely.  By about midnight the fever &#34;broke&#34; (dropped back to normal range).  This will sound odd, but I felt like I had been shown what a severe Covid-19 infection/disease would look like if I were to become seriously ill with the disease.  Felt light-headed on Friday (3/12/21).  [I had no reaction, other than some muscle soreness, from the first dose.The same day as and after the second injection I had soreness in my entire left bicep all day.  No other reactions that day.]

After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?

                                                Initially after the second vaccine he had typical myalgias/arthralgias, especially shoulder/neck. On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.

Yesterday, March 30, 2021, I had an even more serious atrial fibrillation episode.  My heart hasn&#39;t felt &#34;right&#34; since that first Moderna injection on Feb. 8, 2021.  I didn&#39;t have any of the more commonly listed side effects, but I&#39;ve begun to wonder if the vaccine has somehow taxed my heart to the point that atrial fibrillation is easily brought about.

No recent hospitalizations before, at time of or following vaccination up to time of death. No illnesses recently around vaccination or time of death. No pre-disposing factors to death.

I believe it the side effect of the Moderna vaccine.   My wife is having the same issue with her blood pressure which started going up after she took the vaccination.

I spoke with wife who stated she was with the patient today, he worked outside shoveling and snow blowing with the winter storm. She saw him minutes before 4pm (she estimated 3:58p) and he was his normal self, then she walked to another room, called out to him, he didn&#39;t respond, so she ran back to where he was and saw him slumped over and weak on the L, she immediately called 911. She has record on her phone of calling a family member (daughter?) about this at 4:01, right after she had called 911, so LKN consider just before 4pm.  Patient states he takes only medications for hypertension at home. Denies being on any blood thinners and no record of blood thinners in his chart. Denies recent surgeries, denies history of ICH, denies bleeding issues in the past, denies ever having had a prior stroke.  BG 122 on arrival. BP initially 121/84 then increased requiring some labetalol.

                                                Patient passed away on 4/30/21. Wife reports that on 4/29/21, she found him in the garage in a &#34;pool of blood, face down&#34; after a fall. Upon finding him on  4/29/21, she took him to the emergency room where he had a CT scan. Patient was diagnosed with a &#34;concussion&#34; and sent back home, and was instructed to follow-up with his primary care provider on 4/30/21. On 4/30/21, patient was &#34;sleepy all day.&#34; On his way out of the house around 3:30, he suddenly put his hand on his wife and proceeded to collapse. The wife also fell, and by the time she gathered herself and went to check on her husband, he had passed away. An ambulance came to the house; CPR was performed for 40 minutes but &#34;they could not get him back.&#34; He was not transported to a medical center. An autopsy was not done, but the coroner informed patient&#39;s wife that he likely died from a &#34;clot, maybe a PE.&#34; Wife wonders how this could be, since he was on Plavix for 5 years. Wife does not feel that the COVID vaccine is to blame, but thought she should report the issue just in case. This writer is assisting wife of patient to fill out electronic report.

He went to the hospital, after he was able to move and breath.  He had x-rays, EKG&#39;s, blood tests and MRI&#39;s.  He saw many doctors and the last was cardiologist.  He was seen from 3/28/21 to recently by specialists.  He saw the cardiologist last week, and at that time he said that he had pericarditis and that the sac around his heart was inflamed.  The medications that he had been given were working but it was still working and he has a 5% chance of the problem coming back.  The pain is beginning to get stronger again and is going to call Dr. and see what else can be done, especially when he breaths in  he has pain and when he bends down it&#39;s painful as well, and he has a headache and other problems as well.  He was put on Colchicine for this.

Fatigue, confusion, headaches and body aches lasted several days requiring 12&#43; hours of sleep per night and 2-3 hour naps during day.  no energy, loss of appetite.  this lasted 3 weeks. then started to feel better just before getting the second vaccine n 4/7/21 and 11:30am at same location.  Severe reaction started at 2am on 4/8/21, with all of the above same symtoms only more severe.  I couldn&#39;t navigate to the restroom without help of my spouse.   Very confused and disorented.  Later that day i had trouble taking in enough air.   As the days progressed, breathing became more difficult and i had trouble walking.   My feet and legs started to ache daily.  I had a CT of the chest on 4/16/21 and and EKG.  A pulmonary embolism was found in the left lung.   I was admitted to the hospital with further testing including a Venous duplex leg bilateral screening.   The results showed a deep vein thrombosis in both lower extremities.    Treatment consisted of shots of Levenox, followed by prescription Xarelto.   It has been over 2 months and I am still fatigued in excess sleeping 4-6 hours more than my usual pattern  per night.   I have no energy as yet.   I have been told this will be a long process of recovery.  This has effected all areas of my life.
