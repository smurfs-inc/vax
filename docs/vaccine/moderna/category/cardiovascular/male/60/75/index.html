                                                I woke up at approximately 4:00 am with an extremely dry mouth. I went into the bathroom and took a drink of water. I returned to bed. I noticed that my breathing was becoming more rapid. I had trouble catching my breath. I sat up on the side of the bed. My heart was pounding and quick. My breathing was difficult. I woke up my wife. After about 5 minutes my symptoms improved. She took my pulse which was now at 62ppm.  I laid back down in a reclined position. My symptoms of difficulty breathing and elevated heart rate quickly returned. My pulse was now up to 98 ppm.  I sat up again. My symptoms gradually improved. Being unsure of what was going on my wife called 911.  The ambulance arrived in about 8 minutes.  I was about 60% better. Vitals were improving other than my blood pressure which was 180/100 Being unsure of what was happening, I was transported to Hospital.   I  had a chest x-ray, a chest CT scan with contrast to rule out a blood clot, blood work including tests to rule out MI x2. All test were negative.  By about 6:30 am I was feeling at least 80% better. My breathing I felt had returned to normal. My pulse was down into the 50&#34;s which is my normal range.

Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the event occurring after receiving the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event of Deep vein thrombosis is possibly related to the product. Of note, the patient&#39;s underlying Factor V Leiden which predispose to developing abnormal blood clots, and prior medical history of DVT with pulmonary embolism are considered risk factors to the occurrence of the event.

It retuned to normal after 6 hours, and then occurred again 1 week later...for 6 hours. I took Bystolic, and about 8 hours later it returned to baseline (about 62/min.  on Sun 1/24/2021, I woke up to bloody diarrhea x several episodes...this continued until Wed 27th, at which time my son (a 4th year graduating MD student) drove me to hospital and I was seen in ER room by MD. I was admitted, and had emergency surgery 1/27/2021 straight from Er Room. I had life saving surgery the next day to stop a lower GI bleed (of unknown origin). I was discharged 3 days later, and I am awaiting more testes, appts, etc.... I have lost time, money, and work from this near death experience... and the tachycardia still needs to be followed up on . I am EXTREMELY upset by these events, as I almost died....was hospitalized, incurred a lot of expense, used up all my sick pay and personal days, and out-of -pocket to my healthcare insurer.

                                                Patient had vaccine and waited the 15 minute waiting period.  He felt well after 15 minutes and left the observation waiting area. He went up front to purchase something 5 minutes later and collapsed face first on the floor as observed by a nearby customer. The customer said he started having convulsing seizures and the customer went to aid in keeping the patient safe. the pharmacy manager (myself) was alerted and I immediately ran upfront to the patient with the emergency bag. 911 was already on the cashiers phone. They dispatched an ambulance. The only treatment was keeping the patient on his side and safe. He was having some labored breathing initially which quickly calmed down. The EMT arrived and they called his Dr office off the VAR. They said he had some hx of seizure. He had selected no to question #6 on VAR (Have you had  History of seizure for which you are on medication for). He became conscious before transport to the hospital. The EMT stated that he seemed to be covering  as expected from seizure.   He was then transported to Hospital Center.

                                                Patient with prior Covid infection Nov 2020, fully recovered, received first dose Moderna vaccine on 3/13/21 and next day developed body aches, fevers, chills, shortness of breath. Admitted 3/17/21 due to hypoxia, had ground glass opacities on CT. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x 2.  Vigorous immune response could have caused lung inflammation and hypoxia, similar to a covid infection, but from the vaccine. 60YM with a history of a chronic inflammatory arthritis on methotrexate, hospitalization in November 2020 with Covid pneumonia, he was discharged on 1 to 2 L of home oxygen, and reports that he was told by his PCP about a month after discharge that he was able to come off the oxygen as his oxygen saturations had normalized.  He returned to his usual state of health and activity with no issues until he received the first dose of his Moderna covid-19 vaccine through his primary care office on 3/13.  The next day he developed arm pain and then progressive body aches, headaches, fevers, chills, and shortness of breath.  He presented to the ER and was found to be febrile with hypoxia and admitted for treatment and evaluation.   Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with ground glass opacities on CT : oxygen 87% on RA in ER, 84% on room air 3/19, resolves with oxygen support of 2lpm.  CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x2 as well as respiratory virus panel, CT shows ground glass opacities, patient was started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline for empiric treatment for possible community-acquired pneumonia, although procalcitonin was negative.  BNP was elevated at 458, so an echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal EF, and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.  Patient was given 2 doses of furosemide during the hospitalization and BNP normalized. Patient was started on prednisone to calm down a possible inflammatory response triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine in a person who likely already has antibodies, causing hypoxia.  With this patient significantly improved and at discharge is on room air at rest, but still requires 2 L/min with exertion.  CRP was markedly elevated, supporting an inflammatory process.  Autoimmune lung disease panel was sent and is in process at time of discharge.  Patient requested discharge home, Discharged on a slow prednisone taper to avoid rebound with abrupt discontinuation of steroids.  Patient will complete 2 additional days of Augmentin and doxycycline at discharge.

I had a moderate case of COVID in May 2020 and had positive IgG AB in August. The symptoms started with heavy shaking chills, lasting 1 1/2 hours , fever and most concerning sustained tachycardia with heart rate of 180&#39; to 200&#39; over hours, which then destabilized into runs of Vtach and complex ventricular dysrythmia, low BP, profound weaklness, head aches and joint and muscle pains ( similar to the experienced COVID symptoms )

                                                I started feeling flush and got a pain in the center of my chest. At first it felt like congestion, but then started radiating into my shoulders, then into my arms and up into my neck. They called an ambulance. They gave me Benadryl and aspirin, which made me feel better.  They missed twice trying to blood, but said I refused, so they couldn&#39;t get blood results.  I don&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction.

My resting heart rate was at 100 for a few hours.  Normally, it&#39;s around 76.    I noticed on deep breaths, I felt the need to cough (no phlegm, just a dry cough.  One or two coughs per attempt).  No medical care sought.    Those symptoms dissipated and I felt good.  Then on January 20 and 21, the chills returned.  They lasted about 8-10 hours, then they were gone.  I also developed a headache during the 20 and 21 episodes.  I checked yes in the below adverse recovery box, but I am uncertain as to what tonight and the rest of the days have in store.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

Due to past history of allergic reactions, gave him diphenhydramine at 3:42pm. He felt okay for a short period of time and then started to have tightness in his chest.  He could still breathe fine, but called 911 due to past anaphylactic reactions.  While on the phone with 911 he stated feeling more tightness in his  and then decided to give epi-pen shot in left upper left thigh at 4:02pm.  The EMT showed up immediately after and took patients vitals.  EMT advised if wanted follow up monitoring could take him to ER. Patient wanted to go to ER for further monitoring.  We followed up with patient&#39;s wife and she said he was still not feeling very good and had follow up appointments with his cardiologist.  He also came in the store on 2-26-21 and all his test were normal, but still was not feeling like himself.

                                                The night of my vaccination I went to bed early. I was tired and a little achey. I woke up about 2:00 AM with significant discomfort in my chest. My chest felt heavy and when I inhaled it felt like someone was squeezing both lobes of my lungs. I got out of bed and went to the bathroom to urinate. I went back to bed and tried to get back to sleep. The discomfort in my chest continued and seemed to get worse. I got back out of bed at about 2:45 AM and went downstairs where I walked around my living room to see if that would help me feel better. I continued to feel severe discomfort in my chest and lungs. I did not otherwise feel bad. I was not congested. I could  still take a deep breath but it hurt to do so.  I took my temperature and I did not have a fever. At about 3:00 AM I woke up my wife and she drove me to the emergency room at Medical Center. On the car ride to the hospital I started to feel much better. By the time I checked into the emergency room most of my discomfort had dissipated and only a very slight feeling of heaviness remained in my chest.

My first vaccination was 12/31/20 and lot number written down but hard to read is (U37K2OA but could be V37K20A) The second shot was 1/27/21 and lot number written down could be (0412OA, or could read O912OA!)  I had symptoms of a Pulmonary embolism while cross country skiing March 18 and officially diagnosed with PE on March 22, 2021.  I was tested for Covid 19 on March 23, 2021 with negative results.  I had been reporting my side effects (which were none) for the previous 6 weeks following the second vaccination. I did have cramping like feeling in my right calf following a x-country ski weekend about 4 weeks prior  to the actual PE (2/22/21) but it appeared to resolve after about 7-10 days

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included COVID-19 (which required hospitalization for five days) and some heart and lung disease. Concomitant medications reported included diltiazem, amiodarone, dulaglutide, empagliflozin, evolocumab, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium, citalopram, pantoprazole, apixaban, glimepiride, and buspirone.   On 03 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 029A21A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date the patient experienced, headache, fever of 102F (Fahrenheit) for 8 hours, chills, diarrhea, muscle pain, pain in the feet, and fatigue.   On 05 Mar 2021, two days after receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, his heart rate went to 280 BPM for 32-33, per the loop recorder that he was wearing. His HCP (Health care professional) got EKG (electrocardiography) and blood work done to see what was going on with his heart. HCP decided to bring patient in for a pacemaker surgery. The event is considered as serious.  On 25 Mar 2021, he coughed up some yellow mucus.  Treatment for the events reported included pacemaker and paracetamol.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, heart rate went to 280 BPM, headache, fever of 102F (Fahrenheit) for 8 hours, chills, diarrhea, muscle pain, pain in the feet and coughed up some yellowmucus are unknown. The outcome of the event fatigue is reported as not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event.    On 23-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MYALGIA (Minor Aches like he was getting a cold). On 25-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and COVID-19 (Tested positive for COVID) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation), COVID-19 (Tested positive for COVID) and MYALGIA (Minor Aches like he was getting a cold) outcome was unknown.   She said they had been very careful, but had met with some friends and 2 of their friends also tested positive.    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: positive (Positive) positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.      The day after he received the vaccine he felt minor aches, like he was coming down with a cold. On that Thursday he went into a fib. She took him to the ER and it took several hours to regulate his heart rate. While making arrangement to transfer him to a new hospital they did a COVID test and it was positive. They were shocked as he had not been showing any symptoms. He spent the night in the hospital.  Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. However the event of Covid 19 and myalgia is unlikely related to vaccine. Covid 19 is  a confounding factor for the event of myalgia and base of the available information, the vaccine is not known cause of Covid 19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.

As time progressed I started to realize I was losing all motion in my arm and weakness on my entire left side of my body, but assumed this was a side-effect of the vaccination .  I was not concerned until my wife alarmed me in the morning when she looked at me and noticed the left side of my face drooped and had that I had difficulty standing, no balance, little use of my left leg and no use of my left arm and hand.  At that point, 7:00am 03/23/21, my wife drove me to the ER.  I was admitted and an inpatient for 15 days including PT/OT/ST therapies at the hospital for Stroke.

                                                Patient was monitored for 1 hour after receiving his vaccine as requested by his primary care provider due to history of reaction to a previous vaccine. Patient monitored by EMS provider x 1hr, no s/s adverse reaction. Patient started walking out of facility on his own and came back reporting he felt dizzy. He was initially hypertensive with a pulse of 70, respiratory rate 12, systolic BP 188.  We had him lay down and about 10 minutes later his blood pressure was 140/70.   After another 10 minutes or so we had him sit and drink water but his dizziness, while improved, did not go away and he started to have chills and was visibly shaking so 911 was called as we did not feel he could drive himself home. Patient was monitored in the emergency department at Hospital x 1hr and released with blood pressure WNL.

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

He is currently admitted at a different hospital.   After vaccine administration on-site, the patient became unconscious for a few minutes. However, this is common for him - he informed us that he almost always &#34;passes out&#34; after vaccine administration. He slowly returned to consciousness without any issues. He was seen by an ED physician prior to leaving the facility. Deemed to be in good health, patient also stated that he felt fine and believed he was okay to leave as these episodes occur frequently following vaccination.

                                                My oxygen levels dropped below what they had been previously as I am recovering from Covid infection  tested positive 20 October 2020.  If I do anything at all other then set my oxygen levels would drop into the low 80&#39;s.  I have also been monitoring my sugar levels.  I am not diabetic but did so because in ICU was using steroids which elevated sugar levels.  I continued to monitor it at home because I had to do injections for several weeks after leaving the hospital.  Have not had to use insulin til the other day.  Vision is very blurry.  Had that problem in the hospital but it has gone away but since I had the first vaccine everything is now blurry.  Left leg hurts to put weight on the heel. I have nerve damage to the left leg but this is a unique issue.  I&#39;m running a low grade fever 100.2 - in the morning it is normally 96.5-97.6 and this temperature was in the morning the day after the shot.  Neck is very sore.  I have rods from C3-C6 and the pain is in the muscle glands closer to the surface.  It is almost like it is attacking all areas of the body I previously had issues.  I spent October 25 - November 13 in Hospital, majority of time in ICU.

                                                Cardiac arrest just stopped breathing fortunately at home wife called 911 within five minutes of noticing not breathing responders there in 3-5 minutes worked on him for 15 minutes at home before transporting to ER hospital. No heart beat pulse etc... used CPR machines and paddles  Patient had walked 6 1/2 miles that morning no problems did about 50-60 miles weekly outside. This was sudden and me, his wife, say it was a reaction to something in shot that contributed to this event- there is absolutely nothing you could say to make believe differently. This happened 1 1/2 hours after getting shot.

It almost like little shocks going thru my body. I had a video appointment with my Dr. and he prescribes doxycycline and prednisone.  The next day the fever went away and started to feel better (48 hours later).  I also tested positive for Covid on 12/24/20, I didn&#39;t wait 90 days before I got my vaccine.  I felt awful with the second dose, almost worse than being in the midst of Covid. I&#39;m currently on Workman&#39;s Comp. I&#39;m constantly out of breathe and have no energy, I use to have tons of energy. From my atoms apple to my sternum I have tons of pain. My lungs feel like I&#39;m smoking and have tons of pressure.  My Dr. ran test because I have the worst head aches. I&#39;m like slow motion.

Pain is substernal, radiated to the left arm, associated with lightheadedness.  Denies diaphoresis or nausea.  Per EMS there were short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia  3/18: - remains inpatient admission as of 3/18/21 @ 0900 63 y.o. male with a past medical history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He states he was lifting a couch yesterday and his heart started beating fast.  He did not really have any chest pain, but felt a little bit lightheaded.  He called an ambulance and they brought into the ER.  In the emergency room his EKG did show some frequent PVCs.  However, he did not really require any intervention.  He was given 3 nitro, but it really did not make any difference in the way he was feeling.  The patient denies multiple times that he actually had chest pain.  He states he just felt like his heart was beating funny.  The patient&#39;s most recent stress test was a nuclear stress test in May of 2019.  Overnight, the patient has felt very well.  He denies any significant chest pain.  He denies any further heart palpitations.  On the monitor he would occasionally going to bigeminy, which is not abnormal for him.  EKG this morning was unremarkable.   After speaking with the patient&#39;s wife, she told me that he has had a several month history of very limited exertion.  She states every time he exerts he becomes extremely dyspneic and has heart palpitations and sometimes almost passes out.  She states last night he was extremely diaphoretic and very nearly passed out.

Into the evening I started getting beyond normal reaction.  I had a very stiff shoulder joint with pain, beyond that of my existing condition.  It was severe the next day.  Saw my doctor, for the first time meet, and mentioned the reaction I got, but he said it will go away.  During the doctor visit I had elevated BP identified, which wasn&#39;t normal for me either.  That evening I had additional symptoms that included swelling at the proximal points on the thumb and index finger, this also included the wrist.  All symptoms have since subsided to normal.  No other symptoms.

Then proceeded to get a slight noticeable increase in heart rate.   After setting for approximately 15 minutes I was released to leave. I mentioned to them that I just lived down the street and told them if I had any further issues or symptoms I would call them.  Approximately 30 minutes later I was having a slight lightning of the throat or airway and some slight tightness in breathing.  This tightness continued for approximately 2 hrs. I called the clinic and was attempting to get there recommendations but the nurse had left. I was told to get the ambulance personnel. As a prior EMT I felt that an ambulance was not needed at this time. I took 2 ea   Benadryl tablets and those symptoms lessened. Some numbness in lips and face, and felt heart beating in lips. That all subsided as well after taking Benadryl.  Still trying to get with a provider that could give me advise moving forward. The doctor was busy with an Emergency.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

Discharged per wheel chair to lobby in alert/stable condition, to wait on bus to take him home. At 18:00 his neighbor heard him fall, could not get patient to answer phone, found him unresponsive. Neighbor called 9-1-1, ambulance personnel could not revive patient.  Coroner&#39;s office ruled his death as Natural Causes due to Hypertension, Cardiac disease, Diabetes, ESRD.  There were no indication of anaphylactic reaction noted when I questioned the coroner&#39;s office. The Coroner&#39;s office/EMS were aware the patient had received the Moderna COVID 19 vaccination that day.

                                                Began feeling very weak with a constant headache that later led to blurry vision on March, 2, 2021.  On the morning of March 4, 2021,  I was still experiencing a right sided headache as well as double vision.  I was no longer able to drive at that point.  I took my blood pressure digitally at the local pharmacy twice where it was 200/104.  I went home to call my physician and also have my wife take my blood pressure manually.  My blood pressure at that time was 214/106.  I went to the hospital where they examined me and then discharged me with a General Headache without a know cause.  I contacted my PCP and he advised me to quadruple my Lisinopril until my BP came down to normal range and see him the morning.  My visit the next day showed an elevated blood pressure, double vision, and a continuing headache.  My meds were adjusted to Lisinopril 10 mg qd and an addition of Norvasc 5 mg qd.  Later that day my blood pressure was down, but still not in the normal range.   The following day, March 6, 2021, I was still having the same issues despite the changes in medication.  I took my blood pressure at 6 pm and it was 199/104.  I immediately went to another hospital where I was admitted as  a &#34;stroke alert&#34; patient in hypertensive emergency.  I am presently being followed as an inpatient in order to get these issues under control.

Per clinic notes: &#34;Brief summary covid vaccine 1/21 with side effect within 12 hr lasting 3 d By around 1/26-1/29 had cp w/ exertion and sob TST 2/2 w/  Minor ekg changes and min workload per pt (mod workload per note) nuc study pending.  Cough and sob worse over the last 5 d or so, sleeping in recliner, and having trouble sleeping.  Though no desat on march test, he has freq intermittent coughing and he was tachycardic to 110 on exam this am.&#34;   Pt states symptoms worsening over past week. No symptoms at rest. With exertion has anterior chest tightness and dyspnea. No radiation of pain or migration. He can walk usual distances but much slower. Improved at rest. Cannot lay flat at night. Cannot sleep much at night. Dry cough. No wt changes or LE pain/swelling. No f/c. No ill contacts. No chest pain currently. Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis. Patient got 2nd COVID19 Moderna vaccine as outpatient on 2/27/21.

On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

He has allergies to bees/egg and a h/o anaphylaxis 2/2 receiving an injection of penicillin in the past. Discussed that prior h/o anaphylaxis to PCN injection was not a contraindication to this vaccination, but is a precaution. Discussed risks of receiving the vaccination vs benefits of the vaccine, which patient states &#34;I already had this discussion with Dr.!&#34; He has multiple comorbidities which place him at a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.

HR in 80s, with lungs CTAB and no stridor - despite increased RR to 20s. Vitals with HR in 70s, SpO2 remained 97% or greater on RA. BP was initially 140/72. A code blue was called and Drs. presented to the area. Patient c/o itchy throat and still p/w confusion/combativeness, loss of orientation, and SOB. No visible swelling noticed. At around 13:58, patient syncopized. HR and SpO2 remained 70-80s and &gt;98% on room air respectively. Pulse remained palpable. At that time, an epipen was administered. Patient woke up. During the entire episode, he was able to recognize a staff member with whom he was previously familiar. EMS arrived, vitals remained stable. EMS transported patient to the ER for further monitoring and f/u. Concern for immediate allergic reaction 2/2 vaccination.

Is eye drifted off to the side and he was too dizzy to get up.  He was taken to the hospital.  They did a CT scan which didn&#39;t give a diagnosis, and they were unable to do a MRI scan due to a medical reason,  so they could not determine for sure if he had a stroke.  They are assuming that he did have a stroke and he has oculomotor nerve paralysis on the right side.  The nurse practitioner saw him today and she reports he is doing very well now.  He had been staying in a assisted living type facility when this occurred, but he is expected to return home tomorrow.

Patient had a syncopal episode on the toilet prior to EMS call. EMS notes they gave patient 4 epinephrine, 1 bicarbonate, and 1 Narcan. Patient arrived with a lucas machine in place and intubated. Patient&#39;s intubation was verified to be a 7.0 ETT and 23 cm at the lip. Cardiac Activity noted in ED at 2150. See nurses notes for times medications were administered. Further history limited due to unstable vital signs. Pt hypotensive, started and maxed on levophed, epinephrine infusions and additional push dose epi given.  Right femoral central line placed.  Pt began to brady down, was given atropine, ultimately again became pulseless and CPR resumed.  After 2 further rounds of ACLS, total down time approached 1 hour without return of pulse.  On echo, there were occasional agonal beats, but no organized cardiac activity.  EKG and case had been discussed with Dr. Friday and decision was to attempt therapeutic hypothermia prior to second cardiac arrest as EKG showed inferolateral STEMI

                                                Patient received Moderna vaccine dose #1 on 3/3/21 at approximately 0900.  In the afternoon of 3/4/21, patient had sudden onset shortness of breath while at home, as well as fatigue and low energy. Patient knew that a potential side effect of vaccine was fatigue, so he assumed this was just a normal side effect to be expected. States that his difficulty breathing and fatigue continued for about a week. After continued urging from wife to seek medical care, patient visited urgent care center on 3/15/21. The urgent care did a D-Dimer lab, and an x-ray of chest. X-ray &#34;showed something abnormal&#34; so they did a CT scan as well, which showed a &#34;huge pulmonary embolism.&#34; D-Dimer lab was elevated. Patient was transported to hospital by ambulance and had immediate surgery to remove blood clot from lungs at approximately 2100 on 3/15/21. Per patient, the surgeon said the clot was about the size of his palm. Surgeon reported that there was &#34;100% blockage to left lung from the aortic artery and 90% blockage to right lung from aortic artery.&#34;  A DVT in popliteal vein was identified, and the surgeon assumes the clot started in the popliteal vein and broke off and traveled to lungs. Patient was admitted and hospitalized until he was discharged home on 3/18/21. During course of hospitalization, genetic testing was done and it was determined that the &#34;genetic marker for clots was negative, so they think the clot is from a one-time event--patient&#39;s family does not need to be concerned that they have clotting issues.&#34; Patient states that he was started on heparin in the hospital, and was discharged home on Eliquis blood thinner, which is being tapered. Patient states that the doctors think he will be on Eliquis for about 6 months and will not need to be on it for life. Doctors say the DVT in leg will dissolve on its own. During hospitalization, an echogram and cardiac cath was performed, which showed &#34;an old heart attack on the left side, but that collateral vessels have built up already.&#34; Right side of heart was weaker from having to work so hard due to blood clots in lung, but prior to discharge from hospital, the right side of heart was already showing improvement. A heart cath was done to check vessels and it was determined no stents were needed, although there was a small clot in left anterior descending artery. Patient was also newly diagnosed during course of hospitalization with Type II Diabetes in a non-obese person, HTN (which patient had never had before), Coronary Artery Disease, Hyperlipidemia, 1st degree AV block. Was discharged home with metformin, losartan, chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, and Aspirin. The chlorthalidone was discontinued, due to &#34;blood pressure dropping too low--they think his high blood pressure was situational&#34; per wife of patient. Medical doctors advised against receiving the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. Patient being followed by Internist at hospital.  Patient&#39;s shortness of breath resolved &#34;immediately after clot was removed&#34; but is continuing to be followed while on new medications and blood thinner dosing.  The above information was provided during telephone interview of patient and his wife.

                                                Onset of fever (101.3), tachycardia (131), rigors, and myalgias that lasted about 12 hours followed by 24 hours of fatigue and increased need for sleep.  Similar reactions were shared with 6 co-workers who received the vaccination at about the same time. My concern is that if this second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination is making people ill, then it is imperative that CDC and FDA advise the public what to expect and maybe how to ameliorate.  Otherwise people who become ill will tell their friends and family.  This disclosure will make members of the public disinclined to get the shot which would be a public health nightmare.  I have used this adverse report as the forum to ensure that the FDA and CDC are aware of these reactions and will consider their consequences.  Thank you.

They declined to help and blamed Tandum and transferred to them. They said NO NO this is a Dexcom problem and transferred me back! Dexcom identified the problem and offed to send a replacement vis 3-7 days vis ground shipping! A week without a CGM sensor!!! I expressed concern and asked for overnight. One week ago I got the Moderna vaccine and suffered Diabetic Ketoacidosis. Failed sensor has resulted in elevated BG. Last week I had Ketoacidosis following moderna Covid-19 vaccine. Being without continuous BG testing is dangerous. Raised my concerns with Dexcom. Asked for call back and action.

My wife called 911 and the local fire department responded.  The EMT took my blood pressure while I was lying on the floor with my feet elevated and it was 78/34.  The EMT called an aid car and I was transported to a local ER.  At the ER, I received 2 liters of fluids over the next 4 hours.  I had an EKG, chest X-ray, blood work, and urine analysis which all were clear.  After 4 hrs, I was released and returned home.

Results came back as showing signs of AFib. Never saw this before. I have checked the ECG app on the watch  on and off since getting it in December. Every time  before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine the results came back as normal Sinus rhythm. Since February 18th my ECG on the apple watch has indicated Afib, going on 11 days now.

Per wife - patient became clammy, very warm, unresponsive, gurgling at the mouth. I ran out to check on patient Pharm.D.  They asked if they could remove his mask , i told them YES! he had a cloth mask over an n95 mask! Upon inspection, patient was not talking to me like he was prior to vaccine. They said patient gets tired and can become out of it, so they were not sure if this was a rxn to vaccine or just one of his episodes.  Patient has prior hx of 3 times stroke and is on dialysis. He did not appear to be in anaphylaxis and was breathing (when looking at chest). We called code white to pharmacy, and  Manager called EMS 5:44pm. Pharm.D came out to assist me 5:45pm. It was difficult to get a pulse using fingers, so we used BP cuff and got 83/57, with 87 BPM 547pm. I had epi pen ready to go in case we needed to use it but wanted to wait since patient was still breathing. While waiting for EMS, patient became responsive and began to talk. EMS showed up and took over. At this time Patient was talking and joking. 550 pm We decided we wanted patient to be checked out prior to sending him on his way. EMS asked us what we had done, and we discussed the above. EMS took over from there 555pm. Everything turned out ok, EMS left without further intervention. Before they left, I went to speak to family, and they were very happy due to the care they received. Event ending @ 6:15pm

Pt was found to have elevated BTNP at 2240 pg/ml with fluid overload, and Biofire Respiratory Panel showed Coronavirus PCR positive.  At that time, his COVID markers were also elevated.  CRP 91.4 mg/L,  D-Dimer 2340 ng/mL.  Patient was admitted, diuresed, and started on inpatient COVID protocol which included Ivermectin.  March 9:  EKG was performed and patient was found to have a heart block.  All labs had improved over the past 48 hrs. BTNP reduced to 1530, D-Dimer reduced to  1700, CRP reduced to 47.9.   Due to the heart block, patient was transferred to a care center to a cardiologist.  Just prior to transfer, a follow up Biofire respiratory panel showed Coronavirus PCR NEGATIVE.  PCR positive and negative results were relayed to accepting facility - facility and they were going to refer to epidemiology for follow up.

She ask if I was having a heart attack, to which I replied, I don&#39;t know.  shortly there after we left for the ER at arriving approx 4pm.  At that point ER staff did a quick assessment, taking my to an ER patient room where i was advised by the attending Dr that they thought I was having a heart attack.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

He received COVID vaccine on 03/26 with Moderna vaccine (second dose) and was doing well until 3 days PTA. In the doctor&#39;s office patient had an EKG that was read as atrial flutter and doctor sent patient to the ED for rule out PE and evaluation of chest pain and shortness of breath. CTA chest showed numerous bilateral pulmonary emboli and evidence of right heart strain. Of note, his father had history of pulmonary embolism as well as rectal cancer. Patient was evaluated by pulmonologist and cardiologist and was started on full-dose anticoagulation for PE treatment. Patient did not report anything different in his life that may have contributed to development of PE (besides COVID vaccine). He denies any prior cardiac history and indicated maintaining an active lifestyle. Patient had symptomatic improvement and was discharged on full-dose rivaroxaban.

                                                DEATH!  About 24 hours after getting his 2nd Moderna Covid-19 shot, patient got deathly ill with explosive vomiting and diarrhea. Not long later he was passing out.  Paramedics were called, and he was taken to the hospital where he passed away from a massive heart attack. The doctors gave him clot-busting drugs in an attempt to save him.  He has never had problems with blood clots in his life.  He was the healthiest one of us all,  and was almost never sick. The doctor said that it was probably no coincidence that he died so soon after receiving his Covid shot. I am convinced that they are connected.  A healthy man suddenly gets blood clots in his heart 24 hours after getting his shot?  Not a coincidence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

                                                Ongoing issues with migrating joint and muscle aches. Initially I took  advil. After 2 weeks my GP prescribed a medrol dose pak that got rid of symptoms immediately and for the duration of the treatment. When the meds were over the symptoms came back to a lesser degree. The symptoms are persistent to this day. I presently take 2 tylenol usually twice a day and I am comfortable but still have slight malaise. I am due for second shot on the 29th. A little worried

                                                The patient noted weakness starting in the legs on January the 19th, 10 days  after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.  The weakness progressed to the point that he was able to ambulate only with assistance.   He was seen in my neurology clinic on January 28th and his evaluation suggested an ascending, painless weakness of the legs with rapidly progressive symptoms.  He  was admitted to Hospital on the same day.  His evaluation is consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome and he has been started on plasmapheresis to treat the condition.

                                                My symptoms started at 1:15 am. I woke up with chills, shivering. I have an infrared thermometer to check temp,  no fever. I have an oxygen/pulse thing. My pulse was very high for me, it was in the high 90s and then it would occasionally go to 100-105 to 115 but then would go back down into the 90s and it stayed that way for approximately for 60-65 hours after the shot. It was all over the map, I even had some heart rates in the 40s-50s. Finally it broke after about 60-65 hours and it returned to normal. My normal resting heart rate is in the 60s-70s and occasionally in the 80s but never the 90s. On Saturday approximately 9:30 I had no appetite, I didn&#39;t want to eat anything, I felt like I was going to vomit and didn&#39;t eat anything but just felt nauseous.

Rash remains intensely pruritic.  It is blanchable.  Spares palms and soles.  No enanthem identified.  No associated fever.  Images are available in EMR  upon HIPPA compliant request.   Of note, patient has several furuncles in various stages of development and resolution and in 2010 had a similar presentation of a skin eruption associated with MRSA infection. As noted above patient is polypharmic with numerous medications although none were recently started on adjusted prior to symptoms aside from receiving the maternal vaccine.

                                                I started feeling fatigued on Sunday Feb 14. I started feeling this way in the afternoon. Next I felt like I had indigestion so I took some tums. At about 1:00am on Monday morning I woke up and felt really bad and thought I had indigestion so I tried to take some more tums and vomited. I was really weak and short of breath. I laid back down and tried to go to sleep but my heart felt like it was racing. Within an hour I was back up vomiting again with shortness of breath, weakness, heart racing. I tried to lay back down but within another hour I vomited again. This went on until 8:30am Monday morning. My pulse was everywhere. 97 to 112bpm. I was having chills all day and weak. I slept a lot Monday and also had diarrhea on Monday morning. I couldn&#39;t eat all of Monday and finally ate some soup on Tuesday. I am feeling much better today but still a little fatigued.

                                                Patient Statement:  No symptoms until the following morning at about 7:30am when I noticed mild discomfort and subsequently measured my heart rate via iWatch.  The results indicated tachycarida, with rates raning from about 54 to 173 BPM,  The rate would rise slowly to different peaks, remaining at that level for 1 to 3 mins, then return slowly to normal, the periods of change being in the 1 to 3 minute range.  When running a ECG via my iWatch the Sinus Rhythm appeared abnormal only in period, showing changing rates mirroring what my BPM showed.  The distress was more psychological than physiological, feeling about the same as when our grade school PE teacher would make us run every day.  I hated running, as the breathing burned my lungs and gave me discomfort, but I&#39;m sure it was the same for all of us.  I have no allergies, have never had Influenza, was never absent a single day from school for sickness from Kindergarten all the way through 4 years of college.  I had a cardio work-up a few years ago that showed nothing abnormal, and a health screening about 2 years ago for deep vein and extremity circulation without nominal results.  I&#39;ve been nearly vegan for several years, and have lost around 30 lbs within the last year, approaching a BMI withing normal range.  I do have a slightly elevated BP, but that is reducing with weight loss.  I have had kidney stones since about 1996, but they tend to pass withing a few hours.  Nothing else to report.

Unable to sleep, no matter what medication given.   At beginning had high blood pressure which is unusual for me and heart palpitations.  Had two trips to the ER , 1-13-21  9:00 PM, released  and  1-15-21 10:00  PM and admitted, kept for one day.   Heart palpitations decreased within the first week and blood pressure came down to normal.    Unable to sleep, after being given Hydroxyzine Hydrochloride-25mg and later Alprazolam-.5 mg.   Tried taking herbs before taking Alprazolam due to the addiction factor.  Took Kava , Deep Sleep and CBD.  Took Alprazolam after herbs didn&#39;t seem to help but it made me feel bad and didn&#39;t help with the sleep so went to over the counter sleep aid.

                                                69 YO M CARDIAC ARREST. PT HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS COVID VACCINATION AND WAS PULLING INTO THE OBSERVATION AREA WHEN HE LOST CONTROL OF HIS TRUCK, BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND CRASHED INTO A LIGHT POLE. THIS OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THE STANDBY MEDIC UNIT AND OTHER FIRE DEPT STAFF. PT WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN CARDIAC ARREST. CPR WAS INITIATED WITHIN SECONDS OF BEING REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE. EMS WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DEFIBRILLATED FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SINE WAVE VT/COURSE VF WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF HIS ARREST. PT WAS PLACED ONTO A BACK BOARD AND MOVED TO AMBULANCE IN A PULSED VT AND WAS AWAKE AND RESPONSIVE. ONCE IN THE BACK THE PT WAS WIRED INTO THE FOUR LEAD AND WAS SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERTED AT 100 J WITH A CONVERSION TO A PULSED JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM WITH A RATE OF ABOUT 58. THIS RHYTHM CHANGED INTO A SINUS TACH AT ABOUT 100 BPM. IV ACCESS WAS OBTAINED AND 100 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS ADMINISTERED WITH A 2:1 LIDO DRIP HUNG. AMBULANCE BEGAN TRANSPORT TO ER. OVER NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES PT BEGAN HAVING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY IN THE FORM OF PVCs COUPLETS AND EVENTUALLY 4-5 BEAT RUNS OF VTACH WHILE ON PHONE WITH ER MD. DISCUSSED GIVING ANOTHER BOLUS OF LIDO AND INCREASING DRIP TO 3:1 DUE TO INCREASING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY. THE ER PHYSICIAN CONCURRED AND ANOTHER 75 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS GIVEN FOLLOWED BY INCREASING THE DRIP RATE TO 3MG/MINUTE FOLLOWING THE SECOND LIDO DOSE AND DRIP ADJUSTMENT THE PATIENT&#39;S VENTRICULAR ECTOPY RESOLVED AND THE PATIENT REMAINED IN A SINUS RHYTHM / SLOW SINUS TACH THROUGHOUT TRANSPORT AND TRANSFER OF CARE TO THE ER. A 12 LEAD WAS OBTAINED JUST PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN ED THAT SHOWED SINUS TACH WITHOUT VENTRICULAR ECTOPY BUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE PACs, FLIPPED T WAVES IN a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

                                                Patient reported hand tingling shortly after his vaccination. Patient has a history of colorectal cancer has has reported previous incidents with this same sensation, mostly after his chemo infusions. He states that the sensations start in his hands and eventually progress to other limbs and even his head. Patient states that currently he is having tingly feeling on both hands and on his head, at the same time. Patient denies tongue swelling, trouble swallowing, trouble speaking or trouble breathing. He has never had a vaccine reaction or an anaphylactic reaction before. Patient appeared diaphoretic upon interview and vasovagal. He was instructed to remove his jacked and denied a cool compress.  Patient waited an extra 15 minutes (30 total) and was still experiencing symptoms. Patient instructed to utilize Benadryl if symptoms continued and to call 911 and/or go to the ER if he experienced any trouble breathing. Patient explained that the tingly feelings progressed to the sides of his tongue, however he still denied trouble speaking, trouble swallowing, trouble breathing, swelling, and salivation.  Patient was offered an ambulance but refused. Wife was accompanying patient and stated that she would continue to monitor him and would be able to drive him to the ER if necessary.

                                                The decedent experienced severe chest pain and dyspnea approximately nine days following the first series of the vaccine. He reported to family members that he was having a &#34;severe reaction&#34; to the vaccine and believed it was acute pericarditis due to the same symptoms he experienced prior. He reported that on 2/1/21 around 0300 hours, the symptoms were the most severe and he was going to seek medical attention, but did not. He waited till the convenient store opened and purchased OTC Tylenol for relief of symptoms. He continued to have dyspnea and chest pain up until 2/9/21, when he called 911 complaining of chest pain and was found to have a STEMI; subsequently died at Hospital in the ER.

                                                patient states that immediately following administration of covid vaccine on 2/5  he began to experience profuse sweating, dizziness and nausea. He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

                                                Day after first shot, experienced  some arm pain, elevated temperature, chills, very tired.  Of concern, blood pressure spiked to 149/78 (usually 120/70) and stayed elevated all day.  I contacted my cardiologist  late in the afternoon and he advised me to come in if the blood pressure did not return to normal the next day.  The next day, all symtoms disappeared and I felt normal.  When I received my second shot yesterday the doctor giving the injection said the blood pressure spike after the first shot was unusual and asked me to submit a VAERS  report.  My symptoms after the second shot  were a much more significant loss of mobility in the arm, which has returned to near normal.   but no blood pressure issue

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

                                                He received his vaccine, had a sore arm and that evening around 7 hours later it was as if a switch flipped he was not able to breath, and his wife noticed on his body she could see all his veins like a track on his trunk and everywhere.  He could not talk.   He said that he was burning up, was hot and clammy.  He got in the shower to cool himself down, and was told that the oxygen was not getting to where it was supposed to go.  His wife called 9-1-1 and the EMT&#39;s said that his oxygen had dropped down into the 60&#39;s. He went to the hospital and they said he had pulmonary edema that filled his lungs that quickly.  He was not intubated, and is on a BiPAP.  He was given Lasix, steroids, antibiotics trying to pull the fluid off of his lungs.  He has had so many different scenarios from people at the hospital right now and at one time one of his nurses said that his blood work showed a possible blood clot.  They looked at his lungs and they said that they did not see it in his lungs.  Then they said that he had a heart attack and that he needed a valve replacement.  Today, 3/25/21 they told him that he did not have a heart attack, did not need a valve replacement.  Last night they said that his BP was dangerously high and today, his BP is fine.  He also had an adverse reaction to the steroids and had a ROID rage from that as well giving the nurses and his wife a hard time, hanging up the phone on her, and said that he was leaving the hospital.   He was fine prior to the vaccine, and does not have any other issues for him to have this reaction.  He is in ICU and they keep saying that they are going to put him in a cardiac care unit.  He has a lot of IV lines and his 2nd COVID test came back negative.   He feels like they are just running test to get money out of him.  They said that he may be able to go home tomorrow.

                                                After the vaccine, usually has accumulation for mucous in the nose.  Scheduled for surgery in May with ENT to expand passageway.  Has had nose bleeds before.  Woke up blew his nose, felt it running and then had severe nose bleed.  Was clotting up and then blew it out.  Also had used a chemical using his bathtub and the nosebleeds have occurred every morning for the last 3-4 days.  Anytime he gets ready to go to the doctor it stops.  Just first thing in the morning upon wakening and only after he blows his nose.  Which he called the 24-hour nurse line and she instructed him on how to stop the bleeding, and told him not to blow his nose.  He was examined by his ENT in Oct/Nov was told that he was normal other than the balloon procedure.  Is going to FU with his ENT.

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

However, every day, he got weaker and weaker. He has been treated for Liver cancer, he received his first infusion of Opdivo almost 4 weeks before the vaccination.  About 7 days after the shot, he was having trouble swallowing so he went to the ER to get a CT scan. He was found to have greatly elevated troponins, the DR was baffled he wasn?t having any chest pain; they were apparently not trending either., he has never had a heart attack or any other heart problems, takes Nadolol for high blood pressure. The CT scan showed significant growth of his tumors  which had been stable for a year and the last CT scan was the end of January; liver enzymes were also significantly elevated whereas they were stable before.  My father deteriorated rapidly, and died on 3/18/21. The day he got the shot just prior, he was hauling wood, shoveling snow and living a normal life feeling good. The day after the shot he could barely get out of bed he was so weak, until he finally died 16 days later.

Pt states he received his 2nd dose of Moderna SARS-CoV2 immunization 4 days prior to arrival and developed SOB since then. He states that the SOB progressed and included coughing productive of bloody/blood-tinged sputum. The main reason he decided to come to the hospital was because of his shortness of breath and associated chest tightness which he says radiated into his abdomen.    In the ED he was found to have new RBBB and troponin 7.2. He was seen by cardiology d/t concern for NSTEMI, started on heparin gtt, and taken to the cath lab. There he was found to have RCA lesions x2: the more proximal underwent stent placement, the more distal lesion was unable to be stented. Post-procedure pt&#39;s respiratory status was tenuous and therefore CCM was consulted. Patient discharged 9 days after admission after somewhat rocky course of recovery.

At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department), HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure), DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), DIZZINESS (dizziness), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body), RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck) and NAUSEA (nausea) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   A pharmacist suggested the patient take Children&#39;s Benadryl followed by Zyrtec to help with the itching. These medicines have not helped alleviate his intense itching. On 1Apr2021, the patient collapsed and was taken to the emergency department. The patient was treated at the emergency department after he collapsed from low blood pressure. He was prescribed Hydroxyzine HCI 10mg for the itching by the emergency room physician, but the medicine has done nothing to alleviate the patient&#39;s symptoms.  Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Ras and nausea are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

No prior medical history and concomitant medications were reported.     On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.     The patient experienced the events like severe COPD, could not breathe, had chest pressure, pressure in the neck, rapid heartrate (have extra heartbeat), premature ventricular contractions and swelling in face on 12 Feb 2021.  The reported case is serious as the events, severe COPD, could not breathe, had chest pressure, pressure in the neck, rapid heartrate (have extra heartbeat), premature ventricular contractions and swelling in face lead to hospitalization and resulted in prolonged hospitalization.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.     The outcome of the events were considered not resolved and the patient is still in.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient with delayed vasovagal likely syncopal episode several hours after vaccine received:  &#34;I wanted to let my Dr know that I had an incident on Friday.  Sitting at home talking with my wife ant two friends and started feeling &#34;dizzy&#34;. They said I started shaking and head rolled back and I was out for a minute. I did not know anything had happened when I opened my eyes.  They insisted that I go to the hospital.  EMS came and tested me on the way to hospital- all tests good. Same at the hospital- you may have the results.   Not a seizure, no high blood pressure, maybe vaccine reaction? they weren&#39;t sure what it was, and wanted to keep me overnight and I said no thanks. Home about 5 PM I feel fine.  Please let me know if you want to go over.

                                                felt so bad; severe chest pain; Chest pain and arm pain; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning her husband, a 71-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced abnormal feeling, severe chest pain,  and arm pain.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included the patient had a heart attack on 26 May 2020 and on October 2020 the patient had five bypass, two arteries they took. Since October the patient&#39;s condition was stated to be great. Concomitant medications reported included Insulin Bovine, Multivitamins [vitamins Nos], acetylsalicylic acid and Medication related to patient&#39;s heart attack.  On 12 Feb 2021, unspecified days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:007M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Feb 2021, post receiving mRNA-1273, the patient had no reaction and did not feel bad.  On unspecified day in Feb 2021 one week prior to the reporting the events, the patient experienced chest pain and arm pain, minimum that lasted for 10 minutes. 3 or 4 night prior reporting the event, the patient was feeling abnormal, went to ER and was hospitalized with severe chest pain. The patient was in a regular room and was transferred to ICU. Next day, Cardiac catheterization was performed to see the patient&#39;s heart and found that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing.  Treatment for the event, severe chest pain included morphine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event of arm pain was considered Recovered/Resolved.  The events, abnormal feeling, severe chest pain were considered as unknown. The patient is still hospitalized.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old, male patient, who experienced severe chest pain, feeling abnormal. Cardiac catheterization was performed which showed that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack (May 2020) and bypass (October 2020) confounds the causality. Further information has been requested.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

Ambulance arrived and determined to take me to hospital after having 2nd syncope in their presence.  Remained in hospital overnight.  All vitals, heart and bloodwork were fine as seen by cardiac doctor and  determined it was dehydration.  Followed up with primary physician and told him I was urinating excessively.  He put me on Flomax 0.4 mg.  I had the 2nd Moderna shot on March 23rd and again was taken to the hospital on March 31st with same symptoms and near syncope and again was told it was clinical dehydration.  They told me to drink a combination of pedialite and water which I have been doing and I am still experiencing the dizziness, lightheadedness and weakness.  Woke up on April 4th and felt like my soul was being ripped from my body.  I honestly thought I was going to die. Looked on line and found forums of people experiencing similar symptoms.  Went to pharmacy and they recommended meclizine and have taken a clonipin for anxiety.  I am feeling better now, but worried about how long I will be experiencing these symptons.

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

                                                about 2 days after the 1st dose of the moderna vaccine, felt very tired and unwell for several days. He felt okay for about 2 weeks then on January 29, 2021 he felt intense chest pain. Concerned it was a heart attack, he was brought to the hospital. He stayed one night and the hospital ran several tests like EKG, stress test and others. Found his results to be normal and was released on January 20, 2021. Even the moment he was released, he felt very dizzy but hospital was not concerned and thought maybe side effect of medication. He continued to feel dizzy, fuzzy brain and hard time staying awake during the day and sleeping through the night for the rest of the week. He passed sometime in the early hours of February 6, 2021. Doctor&#39;s suspicion is a blood clot. He has no history of blood clots, heart problems or any health issues.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

                                                I began feeling feverish about 12 hours after the vaccination.  Fever went above 101 deg, at times for about 24 hours.  I took one 650 mg Acetaminophen at 0330 the following morning to reduce the fever and continued taking this at 6 hour intervals until 1/22 (today).  Also I had a headache, sore muscles and symptoms similar to the flu during this entire period.  During the first night just before taking the Acetaminophen my pulse was up to 104 bpm.  It went down during the following day to about 84 and is now at 72 bpm (9am/Jan22); my normal pulse is usually between 58 and 64 bpm.

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

Day 1, prior to vaccine administration, BP 132/80 mmHg, Pulse 56 bpm, and temp 98.2 F.  1st dose of vaccine was about 7:30 PM on day 1 (January 7, 2021.) On day 2, at 8:40 AM, approximately 12 hours post vaccination, experienced low grade fever (99F), injection site  became very sore and lasted for nearly a week, headache, and myalgias.  SPO2 was 97%.  Pulse was 69 bpm, which is a bit higher than my usual of 50 bpm or so.   Approximately 18 hours post vaccination, fever was up to 101.8F.  Took acetaminophen 1000 mg. While trying to rest I experienced palpitations, with a heart rate of 92-95 bpm.  About 20 hours post-vaccination, fever was 101.5F.  Took acetaminophen 500 mg.  3 hours later, fever was down to 99.1F and pulse was down to 74 bpm. On day 3, at 8:15 AM, BP was 106/61, SPO2 was 96%, pulse 71 bpm, and temperature of 99.5F.

                                                Patient presented with sharp right lower quadrant abdominal pain with associated nausea and emesis beginning the day he received the COVID vaccine, after vaccine injection. He had decreased appetite and pain was made worse by eating.  He presented to the hospital 3 days (2/6/21) after receiving the vaccine/symptom onset. His vital signs were T 101.5, HR 78, BP 156/67, RR 20, SpO2 94 on RA.   As discussed below, imaging showed acalculous cholecysitis. The day after presentation, pain was more localized to RUQ.  He was treated with IV ceftriaxone and flagyl. He underwent percutaneous cholecystomy tube place on 2/7/21 with plan for delayed cholecystectomy following drain placement x 6 weeks. Bile fluid culture has been no growth. We are attempting to test bile fluid for COVID-19 via PCR.   He tested positive for COVID-19 via nasal swab RT-PCR and developed a 3L oxygen requirement and mild dyspnea. He was treated with remdesivir and dexamathasone 2/6-2/10 with resolution of hypoxia and dyspnea.

                                                Syncope; Diarrhea; Low pressure; Flu-like symptoms; A regulatory report  was received from a consumer concerning a 72-years-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine, and who experienced flu-like symptoms, head went back, eyes went white, jaw move left to right, made a last breath, thought he died, diarrhea and low pressure.  The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included Metoprolol succinate.  On 24 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (042L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 25 Jan 2021, the patient reported flu-like symptoms. Treatment information was not provided.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient reported head went back, eyes went white, jaw move left to right, made a last breath, thought he died, diarrhea and low pressure. Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The event, flu-like symptoms was considered recovered/resolved on 25 Jan 2021.  The events, head went back, eyes went white, jaw move left to right, made a last breath, thought he died, and diarrhea was considered recovered/resolved on 26 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the event low pressure was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 72 year old male with medical history of hypertension on metoprolol, who experienced a serious unexpected event of syncope and non-serious unexpected events of flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, and low blood pressure. Event onset was 1 day after first dose of mRNA-1273. Flu-like symptoms resolved. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                On the morning of Friday, Feb 5, I had a shaking chill and headache, and my blood pressure was 206/78, pulse 93.  I did not have a fever.  I went to the emergency room, and by the time I got there and was examined, my blood pressure was down to about 175/ 90.   After the brief exam and blood draw / EKG, I was left in the waiting room.  After about 3 hours, I felt better, and asked the nurse about leaving.  She took a final blood pressure, which was about 165 / 90, and I left.     I had a similar, slightly less severe episode a week later, Thursday, Feb 11, and went to urgent care.  Additional testing, including thyroid hormone was all normal.

It was diagnosed only on Feb. 19, as I was totally unfamiliar with the symptoms and had another indication of a problem: tachycardia, so went to the clinic. I am not sure this isn&#39;t coincidental, but I have no history of embolisms, and no family history. No one at the time of my diagnosis asked when I gotten vaccine. As I said , this may be entirely coincidental, or it may not.  I am presently on eliquis blood thinners, and have had no further problems.

He had a clot in his brain and underwent brain surgery. He experienced seizures after the surgery, but it was ultimately reported the surgery went well. He remained intubated and on a ventilator after surgery. He developed complications of his lungs and kidneys while on the ventilator. Ventilator was removed 3/16/2021 and he passed away that day. The hospital providers thought the clot in the brain may have been from hitting his head over a month ago. From my understanding he was A&amp;O, independent with ADLs, and lived in his private residence prior to these complications.

Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

He was readmitted to hospital for shortness of breath which was evaluated from Feb 19 - Feb 21, 2021 I spoke with his daughter today. She was with him at home when he went to the bathroom and since he had not come out for some time, she knocked on the door and found him collapsed in the bathroom. She called 911, who did CPR, however he had passed away. He was referred to the coroner. He had his first Moderna vaccine on March 15, 2021 after which he had not had any side effects. He received his second dose on April 12, 2021 and had not mentioned any side effects other than mild abdominal discomfort. Daughter said his shortness of breath had been improving after his discharge from the hospital. He had not complained of chest pain, cough, fever, diarrhea, in the last few days. I paid condolences to daughter and told here we would be reviewing the case to see if there was any relationship to him receiving the Covid19 vaccine and that the case had already been referred to the coroners office.

Had no side effects other than sore arm until Monday, January 4 when I had a bout of diarrhea followed by a rapid heart beat, which when checked was 146, then went to 149 and few minutes later was 150.  I became worried and called my cardiologist and the clinic was closed.  The cardiologist on call called me back.  After describing my symptoms and that I had received the Covid 19 shot several days earlier.  He advised me to monitor my heart rate and if it continued to go to the ER.  Shortly after, my heart rate returned to normal, so I did not go to the ER.

                                                I had no issues with the first Moderna dose, but 5 days after the 2nd dose I experienced chills, dizziness and slight nausea when up and moving.  This lasted 2 days and started going away on day 3, but the dizziness is still slightly  present.  Also, during this time I?ve continually monitored my BP and pulse.  My BP has been elevated averaging around 165/95 (my normal is close to 145/85).  Pulse has been steady averaging around 66-68 which is normal for me.  Today,  my BP is around 150/90 so it?s slowly getting back to normal on day 9 (post vaccine #2).   Also, I had no other symptoms and my temperature was steady at 97 degrees since the vaccination.

                                                Pain in arm developed after several days. Pain continuing through today 2/24/2021. Soreness in arm not mediated by pain meds, including Tramadol 50 MG that I take for back problems. Injection site was never red nor swollen. Trouble lifting arm without pain. Limited mobility without pain. On scale of 1 to 10 with ten being worst, pain varies between 3 and 7 at times.  Also have developed partially uncontrolled high blood pressure not mediated by heart meds, chiefly losartan. Before first vaccine, I was taking 50 mg daily. Increased to 100 mg daily on 2/1/2021 without stabalizing BP. BP can range during day from 106/60 to 158/86 with Pulse in 60s.

                                                Seizures; Mini stroke; Tired; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 73-year-old male who received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced seizures, mini stroke, confused, agitated, eyes were abnormal, memory impairment, and tired.   The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack and stent placement in 2011. His relevant concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan cilexetil, clopidogrel bisulfate, diltiazem hydrochloride, ezetimibe, adenosine, gabapentin, metoprolol tartrate and rosuvastatin calcium.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 14 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, 30 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot#010M20A) intramuscularly in left deltoid for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Feb 2021, With in 30 minutes of receiving the vaccination, the patient had a seizure. They took him to the hospital, where he had a computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood work and had a consult. After consult, they said, it&#39;s a mini stroke. They released him and told her if it happens again call 911. He felt so tired and went to sleep at home. Around 17:00 dinner time, he woke up looked very blankly, and his wife reported knowing he had another seizure. She reported he ran to his keys saying, &#34;I have to go&#34;, seemed confused, agitated and didn&#39;t know where he was. She called 911 andhe was transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  Around 19:00 the same day, he was admitted to do scans overnight. Around 21:00, patient&#39;s eyes were abnormal, he became agitated again and nurses confirmed he was having another seizure. 30 minutes later, he was talking to his wife and daughter as if he didn&#39;t remember anything. He mentioned some metallic taste in his mouth.  On 11 Feb 2021, they did an electroencephalogram (EEG) and confirmed that he was having seizure. He was prescribed seizure medication and released him from hospital. However, the patient and his wife reported not wanting him to take the medication as they believe the events were due to the vaccine. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with vaccine is not applicable as the patient received both the doses.  The outcomes of the events, seizures, mini stroke, and tired, were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack and concomitant medication use can be confounding factor. Further information has been requested.

I did some exercise and checked my pulse afterwards, found the pulse elevated and missing beats. That night it returned to normal.  My resting pulse has been steady at 58 beats per minute for the 2 weeks after the first vaccine.  I checked it yesterday afternoon before going for my second vaccine and it was a steady 58 beats per minute.  This morning I have a fever of 100F and resting pulse is 93 beats per minute and skipping 3 to 4 beats per minute. I&#39;ve never had this problem in the past

                                                Patient called this afternoon to report decreased oxygen levels after agency.   Patient reports to have COPD and remains on oxygen. He reports after the administration his oxygen levels will dip as low as to 70 percent when oxygen is removed. Upon speaking to the patient he did admit to feeling bad several days before the administration in which he had a physician&#39;s office visit due to complaints of chest pain. The patient said the physician preformed x-rays and EKG to evaluate his symptoms. All test reported no abnormal findings. The physician changed his breathing medication and added steroid therapy for a few days to help him recover. This apt occurred on Tuesday 23rd. The administration occurred on Friday 26th. The patient said they experienced the &#34;trouble breathing&#34; during the weekend. He contacted his physician again on Monday the 1st and reported the vaccine had made him worse. Unfortunately he contacted them at 4:15 in the after before the office closed and they told him to report to the ER if he was in discomfort. He called me today the report the issue at 4:30ish. I was able to reach out to his pulmonary physician to confirm his therapy and previous apt and complaints.  They instructed me to tell the patient to make an appointment if needed.   The patient does not fill medication here. On the vaccination form he denied feeling unwell as well as denied the use of steroid therapy.

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

                                                Patient woke up around 3:30am feeling extremely nauseous, shaking, drenched in sweat but with a normal temperature (97.6, which is normal for him), and feeling overall terrible.  Food had tasted weird to him the day before, but he still ate. At 3:30am, he felt like he was having a major allergy attack - lots of phlegm, runny nose and eyes. He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black &#34;coffee grounds-like&#34; fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE). After getting through with that (about 15 minutes), he wretched up more thick mucus with a few flecks of black cells in it. After awhile, he felt okay enough to go back to sleep.  Around 6am, he had another major allergy-like attack, but did not vomit.  Around 8am, after being awake for awhile, he vomited again with more black liquid, about 50mL this time. He felt weak and horrible and was shaking. At the recommendation of the advice nurse, he was taken to the ER by ambulance. Upon arriving, he waited around an hour for an ER bed.  They put him on an IV, did a physical inspection and did blood work. His sodium was a bit low, but in normal range. Potassium levels were fine. He was mentally clear the whole time, but physically very weak.  He was kept overnight after a hemochrit test in the afternoon showed low levels of hemoglobin. He was stabilized in the morning, but was barely able to eat anything the whole time. He was meant to get an endoscopy, but they decided to allow him to eat and sent him home after noon bc they hadn&#39;t yet been able to schedule him for it and he was in pain and massively hungry.  When he got home, he still barely ate,  and still isn&#39;t eating almost anything a day later. His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).  They believe that he may have bleeding in his stomach or upper GI or esophagus, but we are waiting for an endoscopy later this week.  He is still very weak and frail and fatigued.

Concomitant products included FLUOXETINE HYDROCHLORIDE (PROZAC) for an unknown indication.   In February 2020, the patient started IBRUTINIB (IMBRUVICA) (unknown route) 420 milligram once a day. On 20-Dec-2020, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 08-Jan-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. In January 2021, the patient experienced DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Deep vein thrombosis) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Deep vein thrombosis) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In January 2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test (610-1600): 347 (Negative) 347.

On 13-Feb-2021, the patient experienced SMALL INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION (Blocked small intestine) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 13-Mar-2021, the patient experienced INTESTINAL ISCHAEMIA (small intestine got blocked and due to blockage blood supply stopped) (seriousness criterion medically significant), THROMBOSIS (started having blood clot thrombosis both in his right leg as well as left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (Missed the 2nd dose). On 13-Mar-2021, PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (Missed the 2nd dose) had resolved. At the time of the report, SMALL INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION (Blocked small intestine), INTESTINAL ISCHAEMIA (small intestine got blocked and due to blockage blood supply stopped) and THROMBOSIS (started having blood clot thrombosis both in his right leg as well as left leg) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications included thyroid medication and cholesterol medication. Patient called in to report that he received his 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 13Feb2021 in left arm at 10.30 am and his 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine was scheduled on 13Mar2021. On 13Mar2021he went to Emergency Room (ER) and he had major surgery on  small intestine, patient mentioned that his small intestine got blocked and due to blockage the blood supply was stopped and the intestine started to die.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

                                                Patient passed away Saturday at 14:04pm. Patient&#39;s wife reports his death was sudden, he passed away sitting in his chair his heart just stopped she said. They tried to perform CPR, 911 was called and paramedics arrived at the scene and he was given medication but never had any return of vital signs and so his death was called at the scene. Wife reports he was not ill, did not have any symptoms prior to the event. They are not going to be doing a autopsy. She wanted us to know based on timing that there may be some possible correlation with his COVID19 vaccine. He obtained the vaccine on 02/09/2021 - wife reports he had no symptoms, not even arm soreness after the vaccine. Had no fever, shortness of breath. Did not complain of chest pain. We can update chart to reflect the patient is deceased and lets make a card for the family.

                                                Initially I had the pain in the arm which I anticipated.  Several hours later I noticed that I had flu like symptons and my bones seemed to be painful.  Eventually I began having intermittent rapid heart beat.  I thought this may have been induced by tea (caffeine).  This rapid heart beat lasted until Monday (Feb. 15) I think.  As I mentioned it was intermittent.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

Note, per patient, he has a history of multiple DVT in the past and was prescribed to be on medication for this, which he stopped years ago.     Patient placed on anticoagulation for acute DVT, seeing specialty to look for possible cause of hypercoagulability.  Patient saw me first for diagnosis of acute DVT, so history prior to this is limited and based on patient&#39;s report.

                                                Patient was into the clinic yesterday for his first COVID vaccine.  Patient had no contraindications for the vaccine.  Vaccine was administered to right deltoid.  Patient then was asked to sit in the waiting room for 15 minutes for observation.  Patient was sitting in waiting room and developed shortness of breath and dizziness.  Patient vitals signed were obtained blood pressure was elevated 150s/100, heart rate 120s, oxygen level upper 90&#39;s on room air.  Patient was brought to an exam room where he could lay down via wheelchair.  Multiple vital signs were taken during the duration of his time at the clinic.  Blood pressure did come down to 140s/90s, sats remained in  upper 90s, heart rate came down to 70-80.  Patient remained dizzy the entire time.  Patient states that he has a history of idiopathic angioedema as well as a heart stent.  Patient goes on the explain that at different times he can have swelling internally.  He has had this happen several times in the past to his abdomen, saliva glands, tongue, as well as extremities.  Patient and his wife called his primary care physician and MD advised if episode did not resolve to go to the ER.  After waiting in the clinic for around 45 minutes the patients wife decided it would be best to go to the ER.  EMS was notified. Ambulance responded.  Patient was transported via ambulance to ER.    Patient wife was called the afternoon of the incident.  She states that patient was admitted to the hospital for observation.  He was treated with Benadryl, Pepcid, Decadron; CT of head was normal; blood pressure was still elevated; and they were not sure what was the cause of the episode.  I called the patient&#39;s wife on 1-29-21 to check on patient again.  His wife stated that he was been discharged home.  They were unsure what caused the episode and to follow up with primary physician in one week.  She states that at one week follow up visit they would discuss the need/desire for second COVID vaccine.  .

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

The breakthroughs went mostly away and then began again a few days after the second dose was administered on 2/23/21. This may have nothing to do with the vaccine but may be a recurrence but it seems more than coincidental, timing wise.

On 04-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 Intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19.  On unknown date, the patient experienced sore arm, lightheadness, lasted for 3-4 days and went away.   On unknown date, the patients vitals were checked and the heart rate was elevated to 148 and was admitted to the hospital. EKG and pulse rate was irregular. The patient was diagnosed with A fib. Treatment included apixaban, metoprolol and fluids.  The patient received both doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome for the events, sore arm, lightheadness and A-fib was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events stroke, unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations and fatigue were considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, a temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Of note, the patient has a pre-existing history of heart attack which is a strong confounder for the reported CVA and speech disorder. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                One week after 2nd Moderna, started coughing periodically in day and night chest conjestion started to build at night. After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?

After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 6 but did not get appointment until March 9  due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs. BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE Blood clots lung and leg ..BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL.

                                                On March 4 patient experienced vomiting. Early morning March 5 he fell and landed on his hip after being disoriented and experienced aches, weakness, and nausea without vomiting throughout the day. On March 6 he experienced excruciating pain in his left hip and went to the local emergency room following guidance from his primary care physician. He was diagnosed with fluid near his hip joint at the hospital and was discharged the same day. The next day, March 7 he was still in pain but able to walk with assistance. On March 8 he got an x-ray from an orthopedic physician and severe arthritis was found. March 10 the severe pain persisted, but he was able to walk with a walker. On March 12 he received a cortisone shot and required emergency medical assistance to get into a personal vehicle with a family member who drove to the appointment. The next few days, the pain persisted, became worse, and spread throughout his body. On March 16 he was transported by emergency medical services to the local emergency room for treatment and was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia. On March 18 he was still being treated when he experienced cardiac arrest while being intubated. He was resuscitated and was on a ventilator being treated for a few more days but ultimately succumbed to sepsis on March 30.
