The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included coronary artery disease.  Concomitant medications included carvedilol.  On 30 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 in the right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 31 Dec 2020, the patient experienced chest pain that got worse when he took a deep breath.  He also felt warm, and his temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  The patient visited the emergency room where an electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal and his COVID-19 test were negative.  Because of his history of coronary artery disease, he stayed in the hospital overnight.  On 01 Jan 2021, the hospital cardiologist called it a reaction the vaccine, and he was discharged.  On 05 Jan 2021, on a follow-up visit with another cardiologist, another EKG was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.  The cardiologist increased his carvedilol dose to 6.25 milligram from 3.125 milligram and added apixaban, 5 milligram, twice daily.  At the time of the report, he felt fine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, chest pain and fever, was considered recovered/resolved on 01 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation, was considered recovering/resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76-year-old male patient with medical history of coronary artery disease, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of chest pain and atrial fibrillation and the non-serious listed event of fever.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. However, the events of chest pain and atrial fibrillation may be explained by the patient&#39;s history of coronary artery disease.

He had a fever of 101F at this time. The facility ordered labs and a rapid COVID test (all of which came back normal) and started IV antibiotics. A few hours later, patient began bleeding from his eyes, nose, and mouth and was sent to the local ER. The patient refused being admitted to the ICU for possible sepsis/hemorrhage and died the following day on 1/3/2021. All healthcare professionals involved agreed that this was not likely due to the vaccine, but needed to be reported nonetheless.

                                                I was diagnozed with borderline type 2 diabetes in early 2020.  I test once or twice a week, and have managed to reduce my average blood sugar level from around 130 to 100.  Beginning approximately 10 days after the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and lasting until approximately 10 days after the 2nd dose, my blood sugar average jumped to over 117.  In the month since, my average blood sugar has dropped to under 98.

After about 45 minutes the blood pressure stabilizes.  Had routine Dr. appt. on 3/22 and Dr. suggested it could be an adverse effect from second dose of vaccine.  Heart check was fine.  It hasn&#39;t been quite as severe the last several days.  Dr. said to report this to you.

                                                Approximately 8 hrs after the second Moderna vaccination I starting having chills. These continued and increased in intensity along with the onset of fever. I did not have an accurate means of taking my temperature at the time. Over the course of the night on the 17th/18th of February the chills and fever never subsided, even with two doses of Tylenol. The day of the 18th, fever and chills continued along with a feeling of intense malaise. My sternum was very sore and it hurt to breathe as a result of the prolonged shivering. I had no appetite and ate absolutely nothing the day of the 18th. In the early morning hours of the 19th my fever broke as did the chills. However, later in the day, a thermometer was obtained and my fever was 101.4 degrees. When taken at bedtime, it was down the 99 degrees and returned to normal later with no future spikes. On the morning of the 20th when I awoke, I noticed a stinging soreness in my mouth and lip area, followed later in the day with my nostrils and inner nose. This turned out to be an intense outbreak of Herpes. The roof of my mouth, gums, upper surface of my tongue, lips, nostrils, and inner nose ultimately became covered and extremely painful. These lesions were not typical blebs, but were tiny, albeit most painful. After five days they resolved and I have had no further issues. As a possible area to investigate - I had had the second Shingles booster 14 days prior to my first Moderna COVID vaccination. I understand Shingles is also a Herpes family virus.

                                                cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient received dose 2 series of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. First dose was received on 1/17/21 and second dose received 2/14/21. After both doses patient was observed for 15 minutes and did not have any adverse reaction per administering RN. No data in database or database as to any other adverse events occurring 15 minutes post-vaccination. On 3/20/21, EMS was called to patient&#39;s home who was discovered on the floor with an unknown breathing status and pulse. AED was attached to the patient. A very weak pulse was found and patient had agonal respirations. Cardiac monitor was attached to patient with a HR of 32. 1mg of atropine was administered and patient&#39;s rhythm changed to PEA with no respirations or pulse. Per patient&#39;s wife and son, he was a DNR, therefore all resuscitation attempts were stopped (patient was never admitted to the hospital). Patient was never known to be previously positive to COVID. PMH that may have predisposed patient to this adverse event leading to death include h/o DVT on chronic anticoagulation, COPD, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is insufficient information to determine the exact cause of death or what led to the cardiac arrest given that the time from last vaccination to the adverse event was almost a month apart.

                                                respiratory and cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient with PMH of esophageal cancer, larynx cancer, liver cancer, PTSD, A. fib, and alcohol abuse. He received his COVID-19 vaccines on 2/14/21 and 3/14/21. Both vaccines were administered without complications and patient was observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination without adverse effects. No other adverse events noted between time of last COVID-19 vaccinations and death. On 4/11/21, patient&#39;s wife called 911 in which EMS found patient unresponsive with abnormal breathing. Wife reported that patient was breathing up until 5 minutes prior to EMA arrival, but had been unresponsive. Wife reports that patient suffered from multiple forms of cancer, PTSD, and alcohol abuse. Wife believed that patient quit smoking and drinking but the morning of death found vodka and cigarettes in his coat. Wife reports that patient asked for help getting up from the stairs and then laid down in the bed, and went unresponsive afterwards. EMS attempted to revive the patient with CPR but were unsuccessful. Per EMS note patient suffered from respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, then cardiac death. Patient was not brought to the hospital prior to death. It is very unlikely that the COVID-19 vaccinations contributed to this patient&#39;s death due to his extensive PMH with substance use disorder and cancer.

Patient developed aggressive behavior of shouting &#34;hey&#34; and grabbing of groin in 2016. This was worked up with CT scans, labs, referral to urology, neurology, and referrals to psychiatry. The exact etiology of this action was never able to be affirmed, but thought to be more psychiatrically related. It improved significantly with addition of antipsychotics, worsened when antipsychotics were reduced, and improved again with addition of injectable antipsychotic on 12-10-2020.Patient suffered from falls on occasion given his significantly impaired physical mobility. His last documented fall was 8-31-2019. Patient began utilizing wheelchair most of time following that fall. No significant injuries noted in documentation of the falls. In the last 3 months, patient would often refuse medications. He would sometimes indicate that they would cause dizziness, and other times he would simply refuse. We attempted to hide medications in his food/fluid (with wife&#39;s blessing) and when he detected this he would occasionally refuse to eat. Patient previously on DOAC. After pharmacy review in 12/2020 it was recommended to discontinue this as no clear indication to continue use. He was high fall risk and would often refuse this medication as well since 10/2020. Noted to be in NSR on EKGs and decision made to discontinue the DOAC. Patient had no evidence of adverse effects noted after vaccination on December 28th. Patient seen by provider on the morning of his death (1/4/2021) with no noticeable significant change in health condition. Temperature 36.8Con January 4th at 19:45. During routine bedtime cares, patient suddenly collapsed and death was pronounced January 4, 2021 at 20:05. Autopsy was requested from next of kin and no autopsy was granted.

                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

Everything  checked out ok, except my blood sugar was slightly low.  I quickly soon felt better, and resumed my volunteer shift. I don&#39;t know if the vaccine was related to this incident, but felt it best to report it to you.

The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 09 Jan 2021, at approximately 14:42, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 09 Jan 2021 at 20:30, the patient experienced severe difficulty breathing and his BP shot up to 200. The patient went to the hospital and they found his troponin levels had jumped up. The patient reported no known heart issues. On 12 Jan 2021, he went to see his primary care physician (PCP).  No treatment information for the event was provided.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, severe difficulty breathing and  troponin level and blood pressure (BP) had shot up, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 77-year-old, male patient, with medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who experienced a serious, unexpected event of dyspnoea, hypertension and raised troponin level. The event occurred 5 hours 48 min after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A).  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I arose at 7, took a shower and felt fine.  Then while making the bed with my wife I suddenly felt vey week, needed to sit on the side of the bed.  My wife said my face was white.  I had some mild intestinal cramping so went to the toilet.  I was doubled over sitting on the toilet and in a cold sweat with diarrhea.  There was no nausea.   I felt weak afterwards and napped most of the morning with one more episode of diarrhea, very mild this time, at 10:45.  I did not seek medical help, was able to eat lunch and dinner with no problem, but was very low on energy for the remainder of the day.  I went to bed early with 2 Acetaminophen and slept 11 hours.  Felt better the next day.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Reported via Nurse Triage / PCP:  Fainted earlier, eyes rolled back, mouth was drooping. Nausea, weakness, and chills. BP was 107/75, HR in the 70s. Currently alert and resting.  States that patient had his 2nd covid vaccine yesterday AM and then develop chills and clammy skin last night.  Symptoms worsened today and patient became weak and fainted.  Was unconscious for about 5 minutes and while unconscious, mouth was open and drooling and became incontinent and eyes rolled back in head.  Is awake and alert now, but still weak and only able to take 1 or 2 steps.  No chest pain or breathing difficulty and no fever.  Feeling very nauseous.  Caller requesting prescription for zofran.      Yesterday AM 2nd vaccine. Last night chills. This AM feeling weak. Today at 11am he felt weak with ambulation. He fainted. Was unconscious for 5 min. Had drooping of the face. He was unresponsive during this time. Had incontinence of urine. Then became awake but very weak still. Only able to walk a few steps. He is communicating. No chest pain. No current fever. No shortness of breath. BP 107/75 with HR 70. He has been very nauseated. He is drinking only small sips of water. Does not seem like a usually COVID-19 vaccine reaction. Given the LOC with urinary incontinence and sustained weakness, I advised ER evaluation to rule out neurological issues. Pt&#39;s daughter in agreement. They will go to ER.  From Emergency Department:  Patient presenting with chief complaint of syncopal episode which was witnessed by his wife.  He reported the got dizzy and lightheaded and then passed out while seated.  The reported duration of his loss of consciousness was somewhat inconsistent, unclear how long he passed out for, there was however no postictal state.  He was not noted have any shaking or seizure activity, he did have an episode of urinary incontinence.  He has not been feeling well ever since receiving his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine.  By the time of my exam patient states that he is completely asymptomatic, he states he is feeling much better after receiving IV fluids.  His lab work is remarkable for a slightly low sodium, compared to his previous levels which were many months ago.  Unclear of the acuity of this, although upon further discussion with the patient he has been drinking large amounts of water since his vaccine trying to stay hydrated.  I advised him to substitute to some electrolyte balanced fluids and to have his sodium rechecked by his PCP to ensure that this is transient.  With negative testing and resolution of his symptoms he is stable for discharge home.  Close return precautions were given.

He tried to stand up and then he passed out on the floor for about 10-15 minutes.  He went to sleep and woke up around 5 hours later.  He then tried it again and urinated on himself and he fell down on the floor, passed out without getting up until the morning.   He did call his doctor who was not available, spoke to the nurse and advised to go to the hospital.  He is weak and cannot drive so he did not go to the hospital.  He slept the rest of that day and the following day.  Then when he saw his doctor about 2 days ago, he described his reaction and told to report the reaction and that he would report it himself.  He was advised not to take the 2nd vaccination.  He is no longer having the heavy reaction, his muscles are aching and his vision is  blurred, especially on his back and the shoulder.   His doctor did do blood work at the office visit.

                                                He had the injection, had the sore arm and approximately 3 hours after the vaccination he began to experience severe chest pain across his entire chest and into his jaw, which was exacerbated upon taking a deep breath.  He called his cardiologist who advised him to go to the ER.  He was worked up, subsequently admitted from 2/8/21 to 2/11/21, a lot was ruled out but no specific diagnosis made at that time.  They did note some pleural effusion and pericardial effusion at that time.  Upon discharge on 2/11/21, starting Thursday evening he continued to have pain in the chest, but not as severe as when he entered into the hospital.  Every evening including last night has began with severe night sweats, low grade fever and the chest pains have continued.  Went to see his PCP,  Cardiologist and his Electrophysiologist several days later the following after discharge, he does have a pacemaker, and was told by all three of them that he has pericarditis and that the reaction could have been related to the vaccination.  It seemed more than coincidental that the symptoms did not appear until 3 hours after the vaccine.  Was put on Colchicine to treat the pericarditis and then received a 2nd opinion and has reinstituted the colchicine.  His low grade fever has finally dissipated.  During the day he feels okay, but still continues with the chest pains and the night sweats.  His hemoglobin dropped in the hospital possibly related to the heparin and then put on Eliquis postop, and now discontinued, and received an iron infusion to boost his hemoglobin.  He is scheduled for another iron infusion this Wednesday.    He  went to see GI physician and feels that he may have a bleed due to the infusion.   He has had an anastomosis due to Crohn&#39;s disease and feels that&#39;s where the bleed may have been coming from as he did have an ulceration at last colonoscopy.  He did have atrial flutter due this and was advised to have an ablation, and trying to reduce the pericarditis and FU later with other heart related problems.

                                                Not sure if covid vaccine caused this, but this is what happened - Received covid vaccine.  two days later had violent shakes in the night.  Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

                                                Low oxygen levels; Breathing was shallow; Breath deeper and faster; This case was received via an unknown source (no reference has been entered for a health authority or license partner) on 01-Mar-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 02-Mar-2021.    This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of HYPOXIA (Low oxygen levels) in a 77-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 014M20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event.   On 25-Feb-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 26-Feb-2021, the patient experienced HYPOXIA (Low oxygen levels) (seriousness criterion medically significant), HYPOPNOEA (Breathing was shallow) and HYPERVENTILATION (Breath deeper and faster). At the time of the report, HYPOXIA (Low oxygen levels), HYPOPNOEA (Breathing was shallow) and HYPERVENTILATION (Breath deeper and faster) outcome was unknown.          Additional information:He does an average of 33 miles on a bicycle every other day. In 2017, he thinks he had scattered pulmonary embolism after a long flight and his oxygen level was lower this time than it did them.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event of hyperpyrexia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event of hyperpyrexia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                On Tuesday, February 16, I received my 1st Moderna Covid vaccine. On Tuesday, March 16, I received my 2nd Moderna Covid vaccine at 11AM and Eylea shots (one in each eye) at 2PM. I have been receiving Eylea every 3 months for about 3 years in one or both eyes.   On Saturday, March 20 at about 11:30AM, while sitting at traffic light, I saw what appeared to be a translucent sheet of plastic cover the left driver&#39;s window and the left half of the windshield. This was only visible in the left eye. Twenty seconds later, a yellow opaqueness developed in the left eye, which eventually cleared, but vision was still blurry. When I got home, I called my retinologist. He recommended I go into a dark room and close my eyes. At this time, I had white translucent vision in the lower left quadrant of vision in both eyes. My retinologist sent me to Eye Hospital Emergency Department, which is part of Hospital. After being assess at Eye Emergency Room, I was admitted to Hospital for a right occipital lobe stroke that was confirmed by multiple MRIs of the head. I was told that I was experiencing an ocular migraine (although I had no pain.) I was discharged on Monday, March 22, on Eliquis. As of April 15, all of the yellow opaque and white translucent visions are gone. However my left eye vision remains blurred and hazy. I have since been diagnosed with age-related cataracts in both eyes and a fast-moving cataract in top portion of left lens. I will also report this occurrence to the reporting system.

                                                Received my 1st Covid shot yesterday at 11:45. No problem. Went home and went for a 4 mile walk. Still no problem. At about 2:00 AM this morning I woke up shivering. Added another blanked and turned up the heat. No improvement. Finally got up and woke up my wife. Temperature was 101.7° F. Blood pressure was 149/90. Took some ibuprofen and sat on the sofa with a heating pad on my chest for about two hours. Blood Pressure dropped back to its normal 125/75 (may have been high because I took it the moment I got up) but temp was the same. However, shivering had stopped, so I went back to bed.  When I woke up this morning (about 8:00) temperature was 99.1° F, blood pressure was normal (125/71) and no other symptoms. My arm isn&#39;t sore either. It appears that the elevated temperature was my only reaction from the shot. It&#39;s interesting because during the entire time I did have COVID symptoms, I never had any elevated temperature.

I asked my wife if my face was  red and she said, ?yes?. I felt somewhat weak and paramedic called the Dr over.  We talked and he determined that I had not eaten.  Walked me around car, put me in the passenger seat.  My wife  then drove.  I was a little disoriented late but didn?t complain. Since then I have felt like I did in July 2019 when I had coronial virus.  Felt bad, 93oxygen, 77 heart beat which is high for me.   Friday I did not get out of bed nor went outside. Sat more of the SamE.  Woke up at midnight sat and felt better.  I?m better but weak.

My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I was &#34;out&#34; for ~2 minutes, according to my MD wife. After 2-3 minutes ,I felt fine and went and played tennis 15 Minutes later. I don&#39;t think that I have never fainted in my life time. I take no prescriptions for anything. I do still have a sore shoulder from the fall, since I was sitting in a &#34;Bar stood&#34; at a counter at the  time  of the fall.

At first, he looked like he was having a vasovagal/ syncopal episode: he became non-responsive, stared straight ahead.  then shortly thereafter he started to take be gasps for air, his lips turned blue.  It soon became clear that he was having an anaphylactic reaction. we called for an ambulance,  we administered one dose of an Epipen, and administered oxygen. His pulse ox was in the low 80&#39;s.   within a minute or two, he started to react and started to moan, breathe more normally, then began to speak to us.  His BP was checked and was 118/83.  His oxygen sat went up to 100%. after a few minutes,  We took the oxygen off and his sats dropped into the 80&#39;s so we restarted the oxygen.  We are rural, so it took the ambulance 30 minutes to arrive. He was very stable at the time that he was  taken to an emergency room for further evaluation.

Was given nitroglyercin paste on chest, Asprin to chew, Heprin and cardiac cautherization.  Cautherization showing no real issues.  Eventually the pain was gone. Cardiac doctor mentioned heart possibly being highly stressed earlier. I have some thoughts that it may have been a temporary blood clot, but not proven. Chest pain was very bad until emergency room starting getting it under control. never had that much pain before with previous heart attacks in 2004-05

I have had onset of hypertension approximately 2 weeks after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, and now again 2 weeks after the second dose. Note that I take losarten daily, and this event reflects sudden, uncontrolled hypertension onset two weeks after vaccination while on medication, with no other identifiable causes (sodium/caffeine intake was reduced after first AE).

                                                78 year old man without prior DVT/PE history, who had first Moderna vaccine dose on 12/29/20 (lot 011J20A) and second Moderna vaccine dose on 02/02/21 (030L20A) (information from patient provided vaccination card) who presented to the ER on 02/20/21 with one week of subjective dyspnea and palpitations. Chest CT with bilateral pulmonary emboli. There were also groundglass opacities in the right upper lobe. Rapid test for COVID 19 on 02/20/21 was negative. Subsequent antibody testing for COVID19 on 03/01/20 (IgG, IgA. IgM) also interpreted as negative. The pulmonary embolus was considered to be unprovoked and an association with prior COVID19 vaccination is interpreted as possible but unproven. The patient was initiated on anticoagulation. Further workup for underlying thrombophilia hematological disorders is pending at this time however the current assessment remains as an unprovoked pulmonary embolus occurring 18 days after second Moderna vaccine dose. Current CT imaging without evidence of recurrent malignancy and there are no identifiable risk factors for pulmonary embolus. The physician submitting this report is a Hematologist Oncologist.

I would have taken him to the ER had I been home.  When I returned home around 11am, he was having a very hard time breathing.  I got him a rescue inhaler to use.  He had a dailysis treatment that day, during the treatment they kept him on oxygen.  I called Dr office to inform them, they ordered a new inhaler and told me if the symptoms did not decrease by 72 hours to inform them.  His breathing did get somewhat better but he did not have his enegry levels that he had previously or his appeatite.  12 days after his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine he went into cardiac arrest in the home with myself and husband present.

Approximately 26 hours after the vaccination extreme dizziness occurred and he lost consciousness for a few  seconds.  He was clay and completely lost his coloring . His son is a retired HCP and we took vitals and within 30 minutes after drinking electrolytes he was back to normal.  We believe he was dehyrated. He has had vertigo in the past and has a pacemaker.  His blood pressure was taken in 3 positions and within less than 30 minutes after having him hydrate all symptoms subsided.  I emailed these symptoms to his Medical Doctor.  We also had him use his pacemaker monitoring system to send a report to his healthcare specialist.

                                                Patient recieved 2nd dose COVID vaccine and had unresponsive episode in car after monitoring period, staff assessed in car and patient had recovered, staff encouraged family to take to ED for evaluation.   From ER MDs note: EKG was normal sinus rhythm, narrow QRS, delayed transition, minimal lateral st depression V4. Patient IV access on arrival, would Brady down to the 40s 1 time as low as 27 but remained alert, blood pressure is not dip.  Troponin was mildly elevated and decision was made to transfer the patient.  Prior to transfer is necessary to rule out pulmonary embolism, intracranial injury Patient wished to proceed with CT angio chest and noncontrast CT of head which were without acute findings.  Patient given aspirin 81 mg to supplement the 81 mg he had earlier today.  Discussed with hospitalist, patient was accepted in transfer. Suspect this is combination of patient&#39;s beta blockade with underlying sinus node dysfunction.  Patient does have prominent lower extremity swelling and suspect pulmonary hypertension despite treatment with CPAP but cannot exclude valvular heart disease.  Patient was went to Hospital.  Symptoms thought to be unlikely from seizure.  Doubt CVA, ongoing cardiac ischemia.

Irritating small pain the full length of my spine.  Laid down and attempted to sleep no luck. I checked my pulse...very week and uneven. Missing beats...3-small beats in a row many times. Very erratic. It was like that till 5:AM in the morning. I must have finally fallen to sleep and by the time I got up at 8:30AM...my heart beat was back to normal again. Small muscle pains now but nothing else.

He was initially tachycardic, febrile and had leukocytosis 18K, with admission labs with creatinine 1.8, lactate 2.4. He had need for supplemental oxygen and was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Respiratory viral panel including SARS COV2 PCR was neg. Blood cultures from 2/24, 2/27, 3/3 were negative. CT chest showed some prominent mediastinal adenopathy which was increased from prior CT 2017. Also had axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2/27 he had a code blue called for bradycardia in context of receiving ativan for a CT study. Antibiotics  were changed to Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, acyclovir on 2/28. Multiple attempts by multiple providers at doing a lumbar puncture have been unsuccessful.  Bronchoscopy 3/2 with left lower lobe secretions. Cultures negative. He has stayed incessantly febrile and working diagnosis is probable underlying lymphoproliferative neoplasm immunostimulated by vaccine. At this time a bone marrow and lymph node excisional biopsy is planned. Patient is unstable to proceed for MRI imaging at this time due to hypotension.

                                                On the fifth day after vaccination I found myself disorganized in routine, everyday activities, such as washing &amp; dressing, preparing meals, etc.; for example, I omitted washing my ears and forgot to put the kettle on.  In the afternoon I was troubled by a headache of a novel sort, not with indefinite perimeter, but more specifically delimited, with ragged edges.  Then that evening after ascending a flight of stairs, I heard a loud thumping, then suddenly realized that it was my own heartbeat that I could hear in my head.  These bizarre effects disappeared by the next day. On the seventh through fourteenth days after the vaccination, I experienced a soreness in my trunk below the rib-cage, at first toward the sides, but then becoming more insistent and less localized; this was accompanied by headache (normal dull sort), along with irritation at the back of my nasal passages, and a feeling of being tired already upon waking.

Was given Tylenol and temp went up to 104.  She called the doctor at 2:00 PM, told her to see the doctor.  Lethargy and weakness.  Tested him for COVID and flu and still had fever.  Was negative for both, told to alternate Tylenol and Ibuprofen, went down to 102.  At 6:30 PM went up to 103.8, at that point she called the doctor, could not speak to him until 6:45 PM instructed to bath down with warm rag, and was told it was probably a reaction to the vaccine.  Was called in a steroid pack.  He went to bed running about 103.6 at 8:30 PM.  Was able to get up, was given more Tylenol/Ibuprofen and his fever finally broke around 101 about 4:00 AM.  Got up this morning and does feel better.  Running around 100-101 temp.  The vaccine is the only thing that has been different in his normal routine.  Still has warmth to the injection site, red.

                                                Around 4:30am on the day after administration of the vaccination, patient went into ventricular tachycardia and his ICD attempted anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). Per electrophysiology note after interrogation of patient&#39;s ICD: &#34;Multiple VT episodes beginning around 4:30 AM, and continuing intermittently through 10:15 AM, approximately. There were 19 treated VT episodes, mostly terminated with ATP therapy. There was a single 24J shock delivered at 9:43 AM after a VT episode lasting 1 min, 4 seconds, with average ventricular rate 171 bpm. This appeared to be an appropriate shock after exhausting 8 ATP attempts. On 5 other occasions the patient required 4 or more ATP sequences to terminate VT. The remainder terminated with 1-2 ATPs. Reviewing the far field electrograms, there appear to be 2 distinct VT morphologies. Average ventricular rates for both are about 170-180 bpm.&#34;  Patient presented to the emergency room, where he received amiodarone IV, and was admitted to an inpatient cardiology service. He was restarted on amiodarone and was noted to be hemodynamically stable and not in VT; however, he opted to leave the hospital AMA on 3/15. As noted previously (item 11), he has a history of VT and had discontinued amiodarone due to side effects about 6 weeks prior to this episode. As amiodarone has a half-life of around 45 days, it is thought that his rhythm control was suboptimal at the time of this vaccination, and there is no evidence that it was the vaccination that caused the VT episodes on 3/14.

                                                Acute pancreatitis; Acute renal failure; Low blood pressure; Weakness; Decreased appetite; Fatigue; Alanine aminotransferase increased; Aspartate aminotransferase increased; Troponin increased; Lipase increased; Blood bilirubin increased; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning an 81-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed an odd presentation of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue.  The patient&#39;s medical history included advanced dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism and possible leukemia. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 08 Jan 2021, three days after vaccination, the patient developed symptoms of weakness, decreased appetite, and fatigue.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted into the hospital with a diagnosis of low blood pressure,acute renal failure,acute pancreatitis,alanine aminotransferase increased,aspartate aminotransferase increased, troponin increased,lipase increased and blood bilirubin increased. Abnormal lab results included &#34;significantly elevated&#34; aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, lipase up to 1900, and &#34;slightly elevated&#34; troponin of 0.079.  On 13 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had improved, and he was discharged. Treatment for the event included two liters of intravenous fluid and supportive care.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.    The events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, were considered resolved on 13 Jan 2021.   The physician assessed the events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, as not related to mRNA-1273. The physician&#39;s rationale was that the patient may have had a gallstone obstructing the pancreatic duct and once the stone passed, the patient got better with supportive care and slow administration of fluids.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 81-year-old male patient with medical history of dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and possible leukemia, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, the non-serious listed event of fatigue, and the non-serious unlisted events of weakness, decreased appetite, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated alanine transaminase, elevated bilirubin, elevated lipase, and elevated troponin.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on the current available information and in agreement with the physician reporter&#39;s assessment, the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273, noting the rapid improvement after administration of IV fluids.

                                                36 hours after vaccination, the patient had increased respiratory distress. He was placed on high flow nasal cannula oxygen with mild improvement. He then continued to be hypotensive requiring IV fluids and subsequently IV vasopressors. Patient&#39;s BP was stabilized with vasopresor, however he continued to deteriorate clinically with altered mental status and lethargy, concerned for bowel peroration based on physical exam by MD. He was then emergency intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He was then transferred to acute care hospital near by.

At home treatment taken on phone advise from Doctorr with Benadryl and Fomantadine with no effect.  Prednisone now prescribed.  Doctor had suggested a visit to ER but this was taken as the patient was more stable at this time.  Potential life threatening event due to the fainiting and low blood pressure/heart rate.  These symptoms have occured on previous occassions  as a result of virus and other infections.

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

Patients&#39; medical history, as provided by patient&#39;s spouse, was emergency room(ER) admission in November 2020 because he had a congested chest (he had fluid around his heart). At that time, they gave him pills for kidney function. Other concomitant medication reported was Coumadin, blood thinner. Two weeks before receiving the vaccine, patient&#39;s EKG was normal.  On 11 Feb 2021, in the morning, patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273(BATCH/LOT # 007M20A) probably in the right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, approximately after 15 minutes of receiving vaccine, they left and patient was immediately very tired, his hands were shaking. So, patient&#39;s spouse made them down sleep for too long. On Friday, 12 Feb 2021 she tried to pick him up, but he was tired, exhausted, and sick.   On Saturday, 13 Feb 2021, she brought him a coffee and he couldn&#39;t hold it because his hands were shaking, so she gave him the coffee and then made him pee on the bed because he couldn&#39;t get up. At lunch time she made him eat something and he fell sleep again. His wife was hanging around him all day and around 7:30pm she realized that he was cold, and his neck was sweating, she couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat. So, she called emergency services and when they arrived, her husband&#39;s blood pressure went down until he died. Treatment for the events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  Patient was pronounced dead on 13 Feb 2021 20:00. The cause of death was not provided. The plans for an autopsy were not provided.  The events of blood pressure went down until he died and couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat were fatal.

                                                Developed soreness in left shoulder and chest area. On Mar 2, 2021 I measured my blood pressure at 5:00AM to be 163 over 99.  My normal blood pressure is 130-135 over 71-75.  Went to the emergency room where an EKG. chest ex-ray and blood work were performed.  Doctor reported that all test were normal but blood pressure was still high at 146 over 89.  I have continually monitored my blood pressure as follows: 3/2 @ 10:00 PM 144/73;  3/3 @ 7:00 AM 147/77;  3/3 @ 10:00PM; 165/83:  3/4 @ 7:00AM 165/83:  3/5 @8:00AM 157/77.

                                                Per neurology consult: &#34;Patient was at his baseline until when he received his 2nd dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.  He complained of dyspnea and fear of impending doom after waking up the following morning with some disorientation.  He was found to be in AFib with RVR after it was brought to ER  the following morning  and the rhythm was converted to normal sinus rhythm.  Patient continues to have confusion after admission yesterday that seem to get worse today to the point where he did not know his own name or birthdate, and seemed to have global amnesia.  Patient has been more drowsy this afternoon after receiving lorazepam 1 mg IV for potential seizure activity so no reliable neurologic exam was obtained.  Patient remains afebrile with pulse ox in the low 90s on 4 L of supplemental nasal oxygen in the hospital.  He had moderate decrease in kidney function upon admission that has improved.  He has baseline anemia with hemoglobin at around 10. Incidentally patient had shingles in the right thoracic dermatome week ago for which he received valacyclovir.

                                                Patient received the Moderna covid vaccine on 3/11/2021. Starting the day after that, the patient&#39;s wife reported that the patient began to display confusion, weakness, and fatigue. The patient also presented to the clinic on 4/2/2021 with complaint of &#34;sinus pressure&#34; and was prescribed an antibiotic. He progressively worsened to the point where he was only able to speak a few words, and presented to hospital on 4/7/2021. Given extremely low platelet count on presentation, a diagnostic workup for TTP vs. ITP was commenced. It was determined by the inpatient hematology/oncology service that the patient was likely experiencing alterations in mental status and weakness and thrombocytopenia due to TTP.  Fresh frozen plasma was administered. Plasma exchange daily x 5 days and corticosteroids were initiated.

Earlier in the day he complained of not feeling well, but non-specific.  He was assessed and given an albuterol nebulizer treatment. In the coming hour, his wheezing resolved, work of breathing improved, heart rate and respirations decreased. He was ambulating around without signs of activity intolerance. It was felt that he was stable and back to baseline, so he was monitored by the nursing staff. A chest x-ray was ordered but not completed.  On 1/1/2021 at approximately 0925, a nursing assistant described loss of consciousness for 20-25 seconds. It appeared that he was not breathing, slumped over in the chair at the breakfast table eating cream of wheat, eyes rolled back in his head. He regained consciousness, breathing normally after coughing. He did not appear to be choking. His heart rate was recorded as irregular, rate 32 by the nursing staff. He was transported to the Emergency Department at Hospital for evaluation. No concerning findings.

                                                My dad got the Moderna Vaccine on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 in his left arm at the Mall injection site for the Health Department. He was told that the side effects could mean his arm hurting, tiredness, headache, and even a low grade fever. Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021. We have no doubt my dad, following the instructions of the injection facility, thought he was just experiencing the side effects of the vaccine. He had no chance. Had this injection been done in the RIGHT arm, perhaps he could have recognized the arm numbness being that of an impending heart attack. We really miss Dad. He served this country with distinction for over 50 years, and we believe his country failed him.

Patient also does not smoke or chew tobacco.   Patient was referred to his dentist who was able to get patient in and felt that lesions and ulcerations were not infectious or cancerous.  The NP ordered lab work and recommend patient follow up with PCP.  Labs came back two hours later and showed patient had a platelet count of 1 (THOUS/uL).  Patient was sent to ER at Hospital 1 and was transferred to Hospital 2 for a hematology work-up.  Patient is currently admitted and receiving IVIG and steroids

Went to ED - &#34;Patient is an 82yo male with a history of chronic Afib on Eliquis, HTN, and bradykinesia (thought to be PD) who presented to the ED with a CC of weakness after receiving 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine. He also had low-grade fever and difficulties ambulating. In the ED he was febrile at 38.5C and HR 159bpm. EKG revealed Afib RVR. BP was stable. He was given Cardizem 10mg IV x1. Basic labs were unremarkable. COVID negative. CXR negative. He was given Tylenol for fever and admitted under observation. He remained afebrile and heart rate remained controlled with home Cardizem dosing. Cardiology was consulted who will refer him to their clinic to establish routine care with their service. PT/OT recommended home with home PT/OT. The patient overall felt much improved compared to admission and felt ready for discharge. He was discharged home in stable condition.

The patient&#39;s medical history included 3 stents in the heart and angina.  Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 03 Feb 2021, approximately 26 hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number unknown) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The reporter stated that 26 hours after receiving the vaccine, he had a stomachache that lasted for 10 hours. The patient also experienced nausea and vomited 1 time.  Early in the week of 08 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing angina, which he stated he had not had for a very long time. The patient reported that no treatment medications were taken for these side effects.  The patient stated that he will follow up with his cardiologist.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the event, angina, was unknown.

Client was ushered up into the bleacher seating at the vaccination site following the dose administration, and upon sitting down was experiencing shortness of breath (reported by the client to be from walking up the stairs). Client pulled out personal inhaler (albuterol) and self-administered a dose. Responder noted pallor and increased difficulty with speaking for the client, but client&#39;s breathing returned to a regular rate and rhythm in the minutes following albuterol administration. Client&#39;s pallor resolved. The client refused emergency medical services twice, and refused having his vitals taken. The client was monitored visually by responder until deemed appropriate for discharge from the observation area. When the client ambulated down the stairs, Responder noted unsteadiness in gait. Once the client was safely at the bottom of the stairs, a wheelchair was retrieved for the client so that the client could safely exit the facility. Client accepted the wheelchair at this time. Client refused a vitals check a second time at the checkout station, per responder.

PTA bowel obstruction led to a syncopal episode following use of laxative, and several episodes of vomiting in the days prior . Upon admission Patient was receiving conservative therapy for a partial obstruction when he developed increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory status and eventually developed significant hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Neurology was consulted for altered mentation in the setting of respiratory failure. Patient with ascending paralysis. MRI of the head and neck as well as CTA were obtained x2. Patient was ultimately diagnosed with Guillain-Barre, variant and received 5 days of Intravenous Immune Globulin therapy.  Patient&#39;s small bowel obstruction resolved and ultimately patient required percutaneous tracheostomy tube and gastrostomy tube placement for prolonged respiratory failure and neurologic compromise.  The patient had uneventful ventilatory requirements and ultimately was performing intermittent spontaneous breathing trials; however, still had episodes of apnea, but improved.  He was tolerating tube feeds at goal with resolution of his small bowel obstruction, which was thought secondary to his Guillain-Barre.  The patient did develop abnormal LFTs which were thought secondary to cholecystitis not requiring operative intervention, with improving LFT findings on antibiotics.  The patient had a nonobstructive cholecystitis.  The patient&#39;s mentation was improving to the point where he was able to communicate and open his eyes upon discharge, as well as was working with Physical Therapy for strengthening.  He was able to move his upper extremities and followed commands and lower extremities were improving in strength as well. Patient was discharged via private air flight to acute care ICU facility.

                                                Blood clots; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) in an 82-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 013A21A and 031L209) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Cancer (The patient was in recovery from cancer).   On 03-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 05-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. In March 2021, the patient experienced THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Computerised tomogram: blood clots (abnormal) Blood clots.         For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.  Concomitant medications were not provided.  Description: The patient developed blood clots (medically significant) two weeks after receiving his second dose of the vaccine . The patient was in recovery from cancer and was required to have computerized tomography (CT) scans. He had a computerized tomography (CT) scan within two weeks of taking his second dose and the blood clots were discovered. The patient had never had blood clots before.  The patient had already been in contact with his oncologist and was prescribed apixaban.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Stroke.  I do not know if the vaccine was related or not, but the patient had a stroke and falls on 2/17/2021 and 2/18/2021 and was found to have two strokes.  He does have atrial fibrillation, but with the proximity to the second vaccine, I cannot tell if they are just related temporally or if there is a true risk.  Another patient at this facility had a stroke within same time frame post second Moderna vaccine, but not my patient, so I do not know if that was reported.  Due to new nature of this vaccine, I felt it important to report this event for further investigation.   Again, I am not sure if it is a true adverse reaction of the vaccine or not.

                                                On day of Wednesday day of Moderna vaccine shot, felt good all day, got ready for bed at 9 PM.  Felt very warm and took my temperature it was 99.7.  Not too bad.  My hands and feet were very cold.  Put socks on my feet and climbed in bed.  Feeling ok.  Woke up around 4 AM my tee shirt is soaking wet, had to pee.  Got out of bed and walked to bathroom no problem.  Sat down and then my wife said she heard a loud noise in bathroom.  She comes to check on me and I?m sitting on toilet passed out, I?m leaning to my right against the shower door.  She?s hollering and talks to me to wake up and shakes me and eventually I wake up, get up and walk to the bed no problem.  Then I feel the urge to vomit.  Go through a series of dry heaves, lay on my back and feel urge to vomit again.  Wife tells me to lay on my side, not on my back, that works and I fall asleep.  Woke up Thursday at 8 AM, wife is in the kitchen, I make the bed get dressed and feel ok.  Walk out to the kitchen and wife is amazed I?m OK.  She proceeds to tell me about my passing out in the bath room.  I have no recollection that occurred.  Had some tea and toast, drinking water to rehydrate and felt better.  Walked outside, got leaves out of the pool.  Feeling better.  No further reaction, just a little tired the rest of the day.  Had light lunch, soup.  Took a nap at 3 PM woke refreshed and had normal dinner with a glass of wine.   Today Friday had normal breakfast and feel completely normal.  All in all not a bad reaction.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 031620A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient experienced little bruising in the arm. On 12 Feb 2021, the patient was a bit off. On Sunday, 28 Feb 2021, in the evening, the patient got cold, and within minutes his entire whole body was in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe were in pain. It felt like it was invaded with COVID. He went to hospital and got tested for COVID, Strep throat and Flu, and all three test results were negative. On an unknown date, the patient experienced tightening in his throat muscle and he went to the hospital where he was admitted.  While there, they did every possible test, chest MRI, Neck MRI, all possible viral tests, and rapid and full COVID test.  The rapid and full COVID tests came back negative.  Results for chest MRI, neck MRI and viral tests were not provided.  The hospital also performed a blood culture for bacteria. Results were not provided.  The patient was unable to move much, his blood pressure and oxygen were a little unstable. On 06 Mar 2021, the hospital did a major blood test which came back negative and the patient was released from a hospital. He stated that he was still weak in terms of walking and coughing. He stated that he recently bled due to taking blood thinner.  Treatment included major antibiotic treatments and steroids for pain during the hospital stay. The patient was still taking prednisone at a tapering dose.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The events of weak in terms of walking, coughing were unresolved, while the outcome of the events of tightening in his throat muscle, unable to move much, unstable blood pressure, unstable oxygen, bled due to blood thinner, Bruising in arm, cold, entire body in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on a strong temporal association between the reported events and administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded.  Myalgia and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine

                                                Acute on chronic hypoxia; diarrhea; headache; nausea; This spontaneous case was reported by a pharmacist (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) in an 83-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Ventricular tachycardia, Arteriosclerosis coronary artery, Hypertensive and COVID-19 virus test positive (Hospitalized with mild hypoxemia at that time) in January 2021. Concurrent medical conditions included Latex allergy, Allergy (pregabalin), Weakness generalised, Dementia, Atrial fibrillation, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Mixed hyperlipidemia, Depressive disorder, Polyneuropathy in diabetes, Peripheral vascular disease NOS and Cognitive impairment. Concomitant products included ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASPIRIN (E.C.)), AMOXICILLIN, FLUOXETINE, FUROSEMIDE (FUROSEMIDE ACCORD [FUROSEMIDE]), GABAPENTIN (GABAPENTIN &#34;PCD&#34;), MEMANTINE HYDROCHLORIDE (MEMANTINE ABDI), METFORMIN, METOPROLOL TARTRATE, PANTOPRAZOLE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, ROSUVASTATIN and ZINC OXIDE for an unknown indication.    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 18-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 18-Mar-2021 to 21-Mar-2021 due to DIARRHOEA, HEADACHE, HYPOXIA and NAUSEA. On 21-Mar-2021, HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) had resolved. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 18-Mar-2021, Angiogram: chest clear with no pneumonia or pe (Inconclusive) chest clear with no pneumonia or PE. On 18-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: chest clear with no pneumonia or pe (Inconclusive) chest clear with no pneumonia or PE. On 18-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram head: negative (Inconclusive) negative. On 18-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: non ischemic (v-paced) (Inconclusive) non ischemic (v-paced). On 18-Mar-2021, N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide: 3620 pg/ml (Inconclusive) 3620 pg/ml. On 19-Mar-2021, Angiogram: chest clear with no pneumonia or pe (Inconclusive) chest clear with no pneumonia or PE. On 19-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: chest clear with no pneumonia or pe (Inconclusive) chest clear with no pneumonia or PE. On 19-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram head: negative (Inconclusive) negative. On 19-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: non ischemic (v-paced) (Inconclusive) non ischemic (v-paced).     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) to be related.    After the patient received the 2nd vaccine dose on 03/17, he became weak and unable to walk. He also experienced headache, nausea, and diarrhea. On 03/18, he was sent to the  emergency department where we received a diagnosis of acute on chronic hypoxia related to the 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine. He required up to 2 L of O2 during the night time. He was given his regular home medications and Lovenox 40 mg SQ QD for DVT prophylaxis.  On 03/21 he was discharged as his SpO2 improved. His hypoxia returned to his baseline level upon discharge.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My grandpa got his second covid vaccine on Thursday. Saturday he complained of stiff neck.

                                                Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted 2 days after having received his COVID-19 vaccine and had SIRS including hypotension.  Was believed to be a possible reaction to the vaccine.  He was admitted to the ICU and briefly he needed vasopressors.  The hypotension resolved and did not recur.  An echocardiogram showed that he had a moderate pericardial effusion, cardiology saw him and does not believe that this contributed to the hypotension.  He also thought his stools were dark however he has had quite dark stools for many years he told me, ever since he was started on iron pills.  He could not confirm whether or not the stools might be a little darker than usual for him and he also had 1 out of 3 stool occult blood test that were positive.  He has chronic anemia with the hemoglobin slightly lower than his baseline, so GI was consulted and an EGD was performed.  He does have Barrett&#39;s esophagus and GI discussed with him how he will need follow-up EGDs, and I reminded him of that as well.  Warning signs and alarm symptoms were discussed.  He was placed back on his Eliquis however he will not be taking the Effient medication.  This was based on recommendation from cardiology.  He will have lab work done and see his primary care provider within several days.  He will also have a video capsule test done and pick this up either today or tomorrow and follow-up in several days with GI.  Discussed going back on his low-dose Eliquis with GI.  Discussed with cardiology and GI and discussed with the patient the risks, benefits and alternatives.  He will watch for any signs of bleeding and stick with a low dose of Eliquis.

About 3:30 PM on 3/16/2021, started gasping for breath again.  Called my daughter and she transported me to  Hospital.  They tested for covid - results negative.  They did a C-Scan of my chest and saw a blood clot in each lung.  While hooked to the monitors, they found I had Afib.  They also did an ultra-sound of my legs and found a small clot in each leg below the knees in a small vein.  I have never had any record of clots or Afib.  They transferred me to  Medical Center early on 3/17/2021.  They started a heparin drip to soften the clots.  In the afternoon of 3/17/2021, they performed a Suction Thrombectomy to remove the clots from my lungs.  On 3/19/2021, they put me on Eliquis Tab.  I was released from the hospital in the evening of 3/20/2021.

En route while in ambulance, he experienced a convulsion with rhythmic shaking in all limbs lasting several seconds.  He had a second episode requiring midazolam and levetiracetam. On arrival to MGH ED, the patient was afebrile, heart rate 133, blood pressure 173/93, oxygen saturation 99% on a nonrebreather.  He was found to be severely encephalopathic, mute, and not answering questions or following commands.  He was admitted to the neuroICU and intubated for airway protection given his poor mental status. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of meningoencephalitis, but these were discontinued after his CSF was not concerning for a bacterial infection herpes simplex encephalitis.  Antibiotics were discontinued. He was extubated on hospital day 2.  After extubation he had persistent mixed receptive-expressive aphasia that was slowly improving over time. At discharge from the hospital, he was able to occasionally say a simple sentence, could repeat simple phrases, and could follow simple commands. He was discharged to Rehab

                                                Patient has long standing COPD and asthma. He has been stable on his home medications for years. No hospitalizations for these issues in the past. During Covid times he has been very restricted to his home with no visitors. Approximately 5 days after receiving the 2nd Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, he started having increased difficulty with breathing. Over the next few weeks he continued to get worse and required home oxygen and an adjustment with his medications. He was started on steroids and antibiotics about 3 weeks after the vaccine and then hospitalized on 3/16/2021 with COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. He tested negative for Covid at that time. He was in the hospital for 9 days and discharged home on steroid taper and home oxygen. A few days after being at home, he had gradual onset of subacute dementia/delirium. All workup has been negative. MRI/MRA normal. He is currently continuing on oxygen and again on steroids and mental status may be starting to improve.     The concern here is that patient was stable and had been stable on his medication regimen for years. He was doing well until approx 5 days after his second Covid vaccine when he started having worsening pulmonary complaints and eventually ended up in the hospital. He continues to be on oxygen at home and was recently started back on steroids. There has been no explanation for his subacute onset of Dementia/Delirium. MRI/MRA normal. This has been discussed with both Pulmonology and Neurology specialists.

                                                My father passed away on February 10th, 2021. On Monday, January 25th 2021, he said he is feeling very uncomfortable in his chest area. He thought it was severe acid reflux. He took Gas X for Acid Reflux and told us that he does not want to go to the hospital. On Tuyesday, January 26th, he felt that his Acid Reflux symptoms got worse, he still did not want to go to the hospital. He took Tums. On that evening, he started having shortness of breath. We took his BP at home and it was very low. We begged him to go to the hospital, he still did not want to go. On Wednesday, January 27th, his shortness of breath got worse and we convinced him that he has to go to the hospital. We took him to ER. Doctor said that he had a heart attack on Monday morning and that is why he was not feeling well since Monday morning. While at the hospital, while the cardiologists were monitoring him, his heart condition got worse.  By Friday, February 5th, cardiologists said that he is very fragile, his heart condition is very fragile and he won&#39;t survive any procedure. They said that something triggered the heart attack. We told them about the vaccination on 1/13/2021. They sent him home on hospice on Friday, Feburary 5th, 2021. He was on supplemental oxygen when he came home. He passed away due to a heart attack on February 10th, 2021 around 9pm.

                                                2 days after receiving the second moderna vaccine my father experienced a stroke. He was transported to the emergency room  medical center where he went thru a procedure to remove a clot in his left side brain. Prior to this vaccine my father was in good health and was very active and still works and owns and operates a restaurant. He has never had any problems like this before the vaccine. One day after the vaccine he was complaining about a pain on the left side of his neck area. He was doing paperwork at approx 7:40pm when he experienced the stroke. I had to call 911.  My father is currently at the medical center recovering from the incident.

                                                death Narrative:  Patient received Moderna covid #1 on 1/9/21 and #2 on 2/8/21. On 2/24/21, he was sent to the ER at a facility from a nursing home where he was admitted for skilled nursing care. He was sent to the ER due to fever, decreased mental status, renal failure, possible UTI and possible pneumonia. He was admitted and received IV fluids, Zosyn and Solu Medrol. On 2/26/21, a consult was placed for hospice care and he was accepted for hospice care at a contract nursing home. Upon review of scanned records, it appears he had a stroke/intercranial hemorrhage on 2/10/21 and that is why he was admitted to the nursing home for skilled nursing services. A date of death of 3/18/21 is recorded. No autopsy results recorded. 38 days from vaccine #2 and date of death.

She states he was &#34;more fatigued than normal&#34; leading up to this event. Labs were drawn and it yielded throbocytapenia. She states the oncologists states he does not believe it was from the medication but feels it was the vaccine that produced this. The patient is in the hospital receiving blood and platelet transfusions.

This has continued, along with general tiredness,  and I have seen my primary care doctor who referred me to a cardiologist. Both reported low heart rate. I am seeing a Electrophysiologist tomorrow and expect to have pacemaker surgery.      I have heard anecdotally now of a relative who developed low heart rate after 2nd Moderna shot . I wonder if there is a relationship between low heart rate and the vaccine.?

The patient&#39;s medical history was not included. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 27 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 06 Feb 2021, approximately 10 days after the patient received the vaccine, he experienced a fast heart rate, dizziness, cold body temperature, and atrial fibrillation. (The wife reports that they purchased an EKG machine, and this is what the machine showed them. Unaware if he had this before the vaccine or not.)  Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was unknown.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cold body temperature, dizziness and atrial fibrillation, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the event occurred 9 days after vaccine administration and very limited information regarding this patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were event is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Further information has been requested.

He was covered in feces.  Patient is confused, and is not able to give a good history.  Apparently his daughter called and was not able to reach him.  She called his neighbor to check on him.  He does not have any complaints but he is confused.  He does have generalized weakness.  Tested for COVID19 on admission per policy and was incidentally found to be positive.  Patient was hydrated and became stronger and discharged.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 027L20A) on 23 Jan 2021. On 20 Feb 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 039K20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Feb 2021, the patient had a stroke. The patient consulted with general practitioner on 22 Feb 2021 who ordered a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patient started to develop shortness of breath on 22 Feb 2021. The MRI on 24 Feb 2021 confirmed that the patient had suffered a stroke. On 05 Mar 2021 the patient went to the emergency room with shortness of breath. The patient was diagnosed to have fluid on the heart and lungs and with congestive heart failure. Treatment for the events included Clopidogrel and aspirin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcomes of the events were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

At 0800am he awoke again with the chest pain and took 2 nitro which again helped the pain.  At that time he did experience shortness of breath and diaphoresis.  He was found to have decreased O2 sats when the EMTs got to him and he was placed on a non-rebreather.  On x-ray the patient was found to have a right pneumothorax, cardiac markers were negative.  A chest tube was placed and the patient was transferred to a hospital.

Didn&#39;t eat all day.  This morning,  March 7, he said he felt better and slept well.  I fixed him a bowl of oatmeal.  He took one bite and said he couldn&#39;t eat anymore.  All of a sudden he appeared to fall into a state of unconsciousness and could not respond to anything I said.  I tried to shake him with no results so I decided to call 911 and when they got here he came around a little and said he didn&#39;t want  to go to the hospital.  Still not eating and just wants to sleep.  He is 88 years old.  I am the same age and had no adverse event (yet).

He has begun to have mild memory changes after suspected COVID illness (covid testing negative) in November, but daughter of patient, with whom he lives, states that his memory and orientation now significantly changed- he seems to have forgotten the last &#34;3 years&#34; of memory.  Presented to ER 1/16/21 as she checked his O2 and found him to be hypoxic in 60s. He is being treated for possible CAP with underlying perviously undiagnosed ILD vs post-covid lung changes (per pulmonology), and his energy and ability to walk have returned but memory is significantly impaired, confabulating and oriented only to self despite good oxygenation on 5L O2 by NC.

Comes to the emergency department today after getting his 1st Monday and a COVID-19 vaccine at 7:30 p.m. and about 5 minutes after while sitting down developing significant diaphoresis, nausea, dizziness and feeling very warm.  The symptoms lasted for about 15 minutes and then resolved.  Since then the patient has felt a little off in his stomach but has not had any difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, chest pain, diarrhea, rash or itchiness.  With this episode the patient did not have any changes to his vision or feel like he was going to pass out.  Patient will be given 25 of Benadryl, 125 of Solu-Medrol, 20 of famotidine of concern for possible allergic reaction.  Additionally the patient will be given a small bolus of normal saline.  Given the patient&#39;s reassuring vitals and reassuring physical exam he will simply be monitored here were sure.  I do not feel any lab workup is necessary this point this is resolved episode seems either like a mild allergic reaction or a vasovagal episode.

                                                I received a Moderna vaccine injection on January 19, 2021 at approximately 3:15 p.m.  Later that evening at about 7:40 p.m, I was suddenly hit with pain in my back like someone had hit me with a board.  The pain continued to surround the midsection in a swath of about 15 inches.  I felt like my muscles were failing me.  I made it to my bed where I started shivering and shaking uncontrollably feeling like I was having a seizure.  The shaking was sporadic, lasting about an hour. I was covered with a blanket and continued with liquids for dehydration and was given an Xanax to calm nerves. Later that night while attempting to sleep, I was perspiring and my heart was beating 90 to 100 beats hindering sleep.  Through the night I attempted to go to the bathroom but with absolutely no control over my arms and legs I was unable to stand.  Rolling off the bed and unable to pull myself back, I lay on the floor and pulled a cover over me.   At about 4:30 a.m. (Wednesday morning.) I was covered with another blanket and a pillow was put under my head.  I slept until awakened at about 11 a.m  My heart rate and oxygen level was chedked and appeared to be within normal range.  I was greatly fatigued, and light-headed. Continuing a regimen of liquids, I was fed a small amount of soup and some fruit. I ate nothing the rest of the day. I slept most of the day.  In the evening, I was fatigued and nauseated and spent 2-3 hours through the night on my knees in the bathroom attempting to vomit.   Thursday morning I was awakened around 11.a.m. and was barely able to lift my head.  I slept more until needing to use the bathroom and receiving more liquids. Two hours later I was able to eat only a half a piece of toast ? the first and only thing I was able to eat that day.  Early evening having no control of  my legs, I attempted to walk. It was difficult getting legs out of the covers, but I got up and walked a few feet with the help of a walker. However, an hour later (about 8:30) I went to the bathroom and was unable to pull myself up from the toilet and fell to the floor and crawl flat on my stomach to my bed.  I had no strength in my legs and arms and needed assistance from two people to put me on my bed. Periodic rapid heartbeat and fatigue caused restless sleep. Some strength began to return on Friday and with caution over the weekend, and support from a loving family, I appear to be making a slow recovery.  Checking with several family medical people working in hospitals, my experience with the serum seemed more extreme than most.  Therefore, it was felt that I should report some information on how the Moderna injection affected me that it may be of help to others. (Some of the above information was related to me as I was not always cognizant of conditions at particular times.) I am still puzzled, as members of my family are, as to what happened to me.  We would be grateful for any information that might be helpful for us to understand my situation as it relates to others that may have had similar experiences with the Moderna serum.
