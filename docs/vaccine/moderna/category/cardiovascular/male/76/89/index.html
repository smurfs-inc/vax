The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included coronary artery disease.  Concomitant medications included carvedilol.  On 30 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 in the right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 31 Dec 2020, the patient experienced chest pain that got worse when he took a deep breath.  He also felt warm, and his temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  The patient visited the emergency room where an electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal and his COVID-19 test were negative.  Because of his history of coronary artery disease, he stayed in the hospital overnight.  On 01 Jan 2021, the hospital cardiologist called it a reaction the vaccine, and he was discharged.  On 05 Jan 2021, on a follow-up visit with another cardiologist, another EKG was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.  The cardiologist increased his carvedilol dose to 6.25 milligram from 3.125 milligram and added apixaban, 5 milligram, twice daily.  At the time of the report, he felt fine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, chest pain and fever, was considered recovered/resolved on 01 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation, was considered recovering/resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76-year-old male patient with medical history of coronary artery disease, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of chest pain and atrial fibrillation and the non-serious listed event of fever.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. However, the events of chest pain and atrial fibrillation may be explained by the patient&#39;s history of coronary artery disease.

                                                Patient received Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/30/2020 at a Pharmacy clinic where he was a resident. Nurses at the facility reported that he was responsive and showed no signs of any adverse effects until 1/2/2021 when he was observed slightly unresponsive and staring at the ceiling and trembling. He had a fever of 101F at this time. The facility ordered labs and a rapid COVID test (all of which came back normal) and started IV antibiotics. A few hours later, patient began bleeding from his eyes, nose, and mouth and was sent to the local ER. The patient refused being admitted to the ICU for possible sepsis/hemorrhage and died the following day on 1/3/2021. All healthcare professionals involved agreed that this was not likely due to the vaccine, but needed to be reported nonetheless.

Patient is consistently in A-Fib post PaceMaker insertion (June 2020). He is paced at 70 bpm when in A-Fib.  His hearth rhythm went into sinus ~2.5 days post vaccine, and has remained so since.  Change is quite unusual and has only occurred once since pacemaker insertion (October 2020) when he had a significant flu/cold event.   More relevant is the increase in systolic blood pressure by over 20 pts.

He was scheduled to receive 2nd dose on March 11 and I was concerned about having a cough at the time of 2nd vaccine.  He went to walk-in clinic and got a covid test was negative, he said his exam was normal, they gave him prescription of Benzonatate 100mg he took one and it did not help so he never took any more.  On March 5 while working in the yard he collapsed, paramedics arrived and he was in cardiac arrest, they started CPR,  they used AED was in vfib, he was taken to Hospital then transferred to second hospital.  I was told he had blood clots in both lungs, one in his leg, and possible clots in the mesenteric area of abdomen.  His heart stopped due to the blood clots in his lungs.   He remains in the hospital in the Intermediate Coronary Care Unit.  He has not yet gained full consciousness.

                                                cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient received dose 2 series of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. First dose was received on 1/17/21 and second dose received 2/14/21. After both doses patient was observed for 15 minutes and did not have any adverse reaction per administering RN. No data in database or database as to any other adverse events occurring 15 minutes post-vaccination. On 3/20/21, EMS was called to patient&#39;s home who was discovered on the floor with an unknown breathing status and pulse. AED was attached to the patient. A very weak pulse was found and patient had agonal respirations. Cardiac monitor was attached to patient with a HR of 32. 1mg of atropine was administered and patient&#39;s rhythm changed to PEA with no respirations or pulse. Per patient&#39;s wife and son, he was a DNR, therefore all resuscitation attempts were stopped (patient was never admitted to the hospital). Patient was never known to be previously positive to COVID. PMH that may have predisposed patient to this adverse event leading to death include h/o DVT on chronic anticoagulation, COPD, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is insufficient information to determine the exact cause of death or what led to the cardiac arrest given that the time from last vaccination to the adverse event was almost a month apart.

He later developed AKI and surgery was consulted for placement of a Trialysis catheter. After placement of this catheter, he developed increasing respiratory distress and confusion and was transferred to the ICU where he received vasopressors, intubation and unsuccessful resuscitation after a code blue. Autopsy reports not available. 22 days from date of vaccine to date of death.

                                                respiratory and cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient with PMH of esophageal cancer, larynx cancer, liver cancer, PTSD, A. fib, and alcohol abuse. He received his COVID-19 vaccines on 2/14/21 and 3/14/21. Both vaccines were administered without complications and patient was observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination without adverse effects. No other adverse events noted between time of last COVID-19 vaccinations and death. On 4/11/21, patient&#39;s wife called 911 in which EMS found patient unresponsive with abnormal breathing. Wife reported that patient was breathing up until 5 minutes prior to EMA arrival, but had been unresponsive. Wife reports that patient suffered from multiple forms of cancer, PTSD, and alcohol abuse. Wife believed that patient quit smoking and drinking but the morning of death found vodka and cigarettes in his coat. Wife reports that patient asked for help getting up from the stairs and then laid down in the bed, and went unresponsive afterwards. EMS attempted to revive the patient with CPR but were unsuccessful. Per EMS note patient suffered from respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, then cardiac death. Patient was not brought to the hospital prior to death. It is very unlikely that the COVID-19 vaccinations contributed to this patient&#39;s death due to his extensive PMH with substance use disorder and cancer.

                                                Narrative: Patient with severe aphasia and only able to say &#34;hey, hey, hey&#34; or &#34;uh huh&#34; or shake his head no as a way to communicate. Patient previously able to ambulate with significant limp and hyperextension of right knee, but mostly wheelchair bound over last several years as he had had a slow and steady decline in overall health and mobility. Patient developed aggressive behavior of shouting &#34;hey&#34; and grabbing of groin in 2016. This was worked up with CT scans, labs, referral to urology, neurology, and referrals to psychiatry. The exact etiology of this action was never able to be affirmed, but thought to be more psychiatrically related. It improved significantly with addition of antipsychotics, worsened when antipsychotics were reduced, and improved again with addition of injectable antipsychotic on 12-10-2020.Patient suffered from falls on occasion given his significantly impaired physical mobility. His last documented fall was 8-31-2019. Patient began utilizing wheelchair most of time following that fall. No significant injuries noted in documentation of the falls. In the last 3 months, patient would often refuse medications. He would sometimes indicate that they would cause dizziness, and other times he would simply refuse. We attempted to hide medications in his food/fluid (with wife&#39;s blessing) and when he detected this he would occasionally refuse to eat. Patient previously on DOAC. After pharmacy review in 12/2020 it was recommended to discontinue this as no clear indication to continue use. He was high fall risk and would often refuse this medication as well since 10/2020. Noted to be in NSR on EKGs and decision made to discontinue the DOAC. Patient had no evidence of adverse effects noted after vaccination on December 28th. Patient seen by provider on the morning of his death (1/4/2021) with no noticeable significant change in health condition. Temperature 36.8Con January 4th at 19:45.

                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

Everything  checked out ok, except my blood sugar was slightly low.  I quickly soon felt better, and resumed my volunteer shift. I don&#39;t know if the vaccine was related to this incident, but felt it best to report it to you.

                                                Severe difficulty breathing; Blood pressure shot up to 200; Troponin level jumped up; A spontaneous report was received from a non-health professional concerning a 77-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced severe difficulty breathing and that his troponin level and blood pressure (BP) had shot up.  The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 09 Jan 2021, at approximately 14:42, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 09 Jan 2021 at 20:30, the patient experienced severe difficulty breathing and his BP shot up to 200. The patient went to the hospital and they found his troponin levels had jumped up. The patient reported no known heart issues. On 12 Jan 2021, he went to see his primary care physician (PCP).  No treatment information for the event was provided.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, severe difficulty breathing and  troponin level and blood pressure (BP) had shot up, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 77-year-old, male patient, with medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who experienced a serious, unexpected event of dyspnoea, hypertension and raised troponin level. The event occurred 5 hours 48 min after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A).  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Currently alert and resting.  States that patient had his 2nd covid vaccine yesterday AM and then develop chills and clammy skin last night.  Symptoms worsened today and patient became weak and fainted.  Was unconscious for about 5 minutes and while unconscious, mouth was open and drooling and became incontinent and eyes rolled back in head.  Is awake and alert now, but still weak and only able to take 1 or 2 steps.  No chest pain or breathing difficulty and no fever.  Feeling very nauseous.  Caller requesting prescription for zofran.      Yesterday AM 2nd vaccine. Last night chills. This AM feeling weak. Today at 11am he felt weak with ambulation. He fainted. Was unconscious for 5 min. Had drooping of the face. He was unresponsive during this time. Had incontinence of urine. Then became awake but very weak still. Only able to walk a few steps. He is communicating. No chest pain. No current fever. No shortness of breath. BP 107/75 with HR 70. He has been very nauseated. He is drinking only small sips of water. Does not seem like a usually COVID-19 vaccine reaction. Given the LOC with urinary incontinence and sustained weakness, I advised ER evaluation to rule out neurological issues. Pt&#39;s daughter in agreement. They will go to ER.  From Emergency Department:  Patient presenting with chief complaint of syncopal episode which was witnessed by his wife.  He reported the got dizzy and lightheaded and then passed out while seated.  The reported duration of his loss of consciousness was somewhat inconsistent, unclear how long he passed out for, there was however no postictal state.  He was not noted have any shaking or seizure activity, he did have an episode of urinary incontinence.  He has not been feeling well ever since receiving his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine.  By the time of my exam patient states that he is completely asymptomatic, he states he is feeling much better after receiving IV fluids.  His lab work is remarkable for a slightly low sodium, compared to his previous levels which were many months ago.  Unclear of the acuity of this, although upon further discussion with the patient he has been drinking large amounts of water since his vaccine trying to stay hydrated.  I advised him to substitute to some electrolyte balanced fluids and to have his sodium rechecked by his PCP to ensure that this is transient.  With negative testing and resolution of his symptoms he is stable for discharge home.  Close return precautions were given.

He tried to stand up and then he passed out on the floor for about 10-15 minutes.  He went to sleep and woke up around 5 hours later.  He then tried it again and urinated on himself and he fell down on the floor, passed out without getting up until the morning.   He did call his doctor who was not available, spoke to the nurse and advised to go to the hospital.  He is weak and cannot drive so he did not go to the hospital.  He slept the rest of that day and the following day.  Then when he saw his doctor about 2 days ago, he described his reaction and told to report the reaction and that he would report it himself.  He was advised not to take the 2nd vaccination.  He is no longer having the heavy reaction, his muscles are aching and his vision is  blurred, especially on his back and the shoulder.   His doctor did do blood work at the office visit.

                                                He had the injection, had the sore arm and approximately 3 hours after the vaccination he began to experience severe chest pain across his entire chest and into his jaw, which was exacerbated upon taking a deep breath.  He called his cardiologist who advised him to go to the ER.  He was worked up, subsequently admitted from 2/8/21 to 2/11/21, a lot was ruled out but no specific diagnosis made at that time.  They did note some pleural effusion and pericardial effusion at that time.  Upon discharge on 2/11/21, starting Thursday evening he continued to have pain in the chest, but not as severe as when he entered into the hospital.  Every evening including last night has began with severe night sweats, low grade fever and the chest pains have continued.  Went to see his PCP,  Cardiologist and his Electrophysiologist several days later the following after discharge, he does have a pacemaker, and was told by all three of them that he has pericarditis and that the reaction could have been related to the vaccination.  It seemed more than coincidental that the symptoms did not appear until 3 hours after the vaccine.  Was put on Colchicine to treat the pericarditis and then received a 2nd opinion and has reinstituted the colchicine.  His low grade fever has finally dissipated.  During the day he feels okay, but still continues with the chest pains and the night sweats.  His hemoglobin dropped in the hospital possibly related to the heparin and then put on Eliquis postop, and now discontinued, and received an iron infusion to boost his hemoglobin.  He is scheduled for another iron infusion this Wednesday.    He  went to see GI physician and feels that he may have a bleed due to the infusion.   He has had an anastomosis due to Crohn&#39;s disease and feels that&#39;s where the bleed may have been coming from as he did have an ulceration at last colonoscopy.  He did have atrial flutter due this and was advised to have an ablation, and trying to reduce the pericarditis and FU later with other heart related problems.

                                                Not sure if covid vaccine caused this, but this is what happened - Received covid vaccine.  two days later had violent shakes in the night.  Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

                                                Received my 1st Covid shot yesterday at 11:45. No problem. Went home and went for a 4 mile walk. Still no problem. At about 2:00 AM this morning I woke up shivering. Added another blanked and turned up the heat. No improvement. Finally got up and woke up my wife. Temperature was 101.7° F. Blood pressure was 149/90. Took some ibuprofen and sat on the sofa with a heating pad on my chest for about two hours. Blood Pressure dropped back to its normal 125/75 (may have been high because I took it the moment I got up) but temp was the same. However, shivering had stopped, so I went back to bed.  When I woke up this morning (about 8:00) temperature was 99.1° F, blood pressure was normal (125/71) and no other symptoms. My arm isn&#39;t sore either. It appears that the elevated temperature was my only reaction from the shot. It&#39;s interesting because during the entire time I did have COVID symptoms, I never had any elevated temperature.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

                                                seizures; small stroke; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (wife of patient) concerning a 78- year-old, male patient who  developed seizure and a small stroke.    The patient&#39;s medical history included seizure 4 years ago, stroke long time ago. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, Cholesterol medicines, Blood pressure medicines and Aspirin.  On 18 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 031M20A) intramuscularly in the Right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 18 Feb 2021, the patient developed seizure, small stroke .  Treatment for the event was not reported. Doctors are not sure about the causality, but want to report it. They spoke to his doctor  about not getting the second vaccine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was unknown.  The outcome of the event&#39;s, seizure, stroke was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events were consistent with increased risk of complications associated with history of seizure confounded by elderly age of patient. Company assessed the events to be unlikely related to company product.

Was given nitroglyercin paste on chest, Asprin to chew, Heprin and cardiac cautherization.  Cautherization showing no real issues.  Eventually the pain was gone. Cardiac doctor mentioned heart possibly being highly stressed earlier. I have some thoughts that it may have been a temporary blood clot, but not proven. Chest pain was very bad until emergency room starting getting it under control. never had that much pain before with previous heart attacks in 2004-05

I would have taken him to the ER had I been home.  When I returned home around 11am, he was having a very hard time breathing.  I got him a rescue inhaler to use.  He had a dailysis treatment that day, during the treatment they kept him on oxygen.  I called Dr office to inform them, they ordered a new inhaler and told me if the symptoms did not decrease by 72 hours to inform them.  His breathing did get somewhat better but he did not have his enegry levels that he had previously or his appeatite.  12 days after his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine he went into cardiac arrest in the home with myself and husband present.

No labs immediately prior to vaccination, so leukopenia may have preceded vaccine. No other new medications to explain neutropenia. Off chemotherapy since 8/2020. Possible relapsed disease though no other evidence in support of this as remainder of CBC stable.

At 2 am patient awoke with severe chest, left arm, back of the head, neck, stomach and shoulder pain and was breathing heavily, in a panic attack.  Said he feared he was having a heart attack.  I gave him an extra strength tylenol, rubbed his neck, back of head, shoulders and suggested he was having a vaccine reaction.  After about an hour, he fell asleep. He awoke around 8:30 am with a slight headache but otherwise feeling fine.

Approximately 26 hours after the vaccination extreme dizziness occurred and he lost consciousness for a few  seconds.  He was clay and completely lost his coloring . His son is a retired HCP and we took vitals and within 30 minutes after drinking electrolytes he was back to normal.  We believe he was dehyrated. He has had vertigo in the past and has a pacemaker.  His blood pressure was taken in 3 positions and within less than 30 minutes after having him hydrate all symptoms subsided.  I emailed these symptoms to his Medical Doctor.  We also had him use his pacemaker monitoring system to send a report to his healthcare specialist.

NO TENGO NINGUNA FUERZA NI MOBILIDAD EN MI BRAZO IZQUIERDO Y UN DOLOR &#34;CANSADO&#34; EN EL CUELLO.

                                                Patient recieved 2nd dose COVID vaccine and had unresponsive episode in car after monitoring period, staff assessed in car and patient had recovered, staff encouraged family to take to ED for evaluation.   From ER MDs note: EKG was normal sinus rhythm, narrow QRS, delayed transition, minimal lateral st depression V4. Patient IV access on arrival, would Brady down to the 40s 1 time as low as 27 but remained alert, blood pressure is not dip.  Troponin was mildly elevated and decision was made to transfer the patient.  Prior to transfer is necessary to rule out pulmonary embolism, intracranial injury Patient wished to proceed with CT angio chest and noncontrast CT of head which were without acute findings.  Patient given aspirin 81 mg to supplement the 81 mg he had earlier today.  Discussed with hospitalist, patient was accepted in transfer. Suspect this is combination of patient&#39;s beta blockade with underlying sinus node dysfunction.  Patient does have prominent lower extremity swelling and suspect pulmonary hypertension despite treatment with CPAP but cannot exclude valvular heart disease.  Patient was went to Hospital.  Symptoms thought to be unlikely from seizure.  Doubt CVA, ongoing cardiac ischemia.

He was initially tachycardic, febrile and had leukocytosis 18K, with admission labs with creatinine 1.8, lactate 2.4. He had need for supplemental oxygen and was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Respiratory viral panel including SARS COV2 PCR was neg. Blood cultures from 2/24, 2/27, 3/3 were negative. CT chest showed some prominent mediastinal adenopathy which was increased from prior CT 2017. Also had axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2/27 he had a code blue called for bradycardia in context of receiving ativan for a CT study. Antibiotics  were changed to Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, acyclovir on 2/28. Multiple attempts by multiple providers at doing a lumbar puncture have been unsuccessful.  Bronchoscopy 3/2 with left lower lobe secretions. Cultures negative. He has stayed incessantly febrile and working diagnosis is probable underlying lymphoproliferative neoplasm immunostimulated by vaccine. At this time a bone marrow and lymph node excisional biopsy is planned. Patient is unstable to proceed for MRI imaging at this time due to hypotension.

Was given Tylenol and temp went up to 104.  She called the doctor at 2:00 PM, told her to see the doctor.  Lethargy and weakness.  Tested him for COVID and flu and still had fever.  Was negative for both, told to alternate Tylenol and Ibuprofen, went down to 102.  At 6:30 PM went up to 103.8, at that point she called the doctor, could not speak to him until 6:45 PM instructed to bath down with warm rag, and was told it was probably a reaction to the vaccine.  Was called in a steroid pack.  He went to bed running about 103.6 at 8:30 PM.  Was able to get up, was given more Tylenol/Ibuprofen and his fever finally broke around 101 about 4:00 AM.  Got up this morning and does feel better.  Running around 100-101 temp.  The vaccine is the only thing that has been different in his normal routine.  Still has warmth to the injection site, red.

                                                Atrial fibrillation for 12 hours and then it disappeared.  I have never before experienced AFIB.  It was all recorded on my Apple Watch. My resting heart rate normally around 60 bpm was elevated to around 75. Around 10 am everything was back to normal.

He was seen in the emergency room this morning at approximately for complaints of posterior head and neck pressure, right arm numbness and tingling as well as a mild blurry vision in his right eye.  Patient states that the symptoms from the right arm and eye blurriness lasted less than 1 hour.  And has completely resolved at this time.  Patient states that he still does have some posterior neck tightness.  But most of this is on the left side at this point.  Patient denies any increase in physical activity that he could attribute to the onset of the neck pain.  Patient states that it does feel tight when he turns his head from side to side.  Patient states that he no longer has a headache.  He does have a history of a possible mini stroke approximately 10 years ago.  He has had no other recent cardiac problems, or any other strokelike symptoms since that time.  Patient takes medications for his cholesterol and a baby aspirin daily.

                                                Around 4:30am on the day after administration of the vaccination, patient went into ventricular tachycardia and his ICD attempted anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). Per electrophysiology note after interrogation of patient&#39;s ICD: &#34;Multiple VT episodes beginning around 4:30 AM, and continuing intermittently through 10:15 AM, approximately. There were 19 treated VT episodes, mostly terminated with ATP therapy. There was a single 24J shock delivered at 9:43 AM after a VT episode lasting 1 min, 4 seconds, with average ventricular rate 171 bpm. This appeared to be an appropriate shock after exhausting 8 ATP attempts. On 5 other occasions the patient required 4 or more ATP sequences to terminate VT. The remainder terminated with 1-2 ATPs. Reviewing the far field electrograms, there appear to be 2 distinct VT morphologies. Average ventricular rates for both are about 170-180 bpm.&#34;  Patient presented to the emergency room, where he received amiodarone IV, and was admitted to an inpatient cardiology service. He was restarted on amiodarone and was noted to be hemodynamically stable and not in VT; however, he opted to leave the hospital AMA on 3/15. As noted previously (item 11), he has a history of VT and had discontinued amiodarone due to side effects about 6 weeks prior to this episode. As amiodarone has a half-life of around 45 days, it is thought that his rhythm control was suboptimal at the time of this vaccination, and there is no evidence that it was the vaccination that caused the VT episodes on 3/14.

                                                36 hours after vaccination, the patient had increased respiratory distress. He was placed on high flow nasal cannula oxygen with mild improvement. He then continued to be hypotensive requiring IV fluids and subsequently IV vasopressors. Patient&#39;s BP was stabilized with vasopresor, however he continued to deteriorate clinically with altered mental status and lethargy, concerned for bowel peroration based on physical exam by MD. He was then emergency intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He was then transferred to acute care hospital near by.

                                                Acute pancreatitis; Acute renal failure; Low blood pressure; Weakness; Decreased appetite; Fatigue; Alanine aminotransferase increased; Aspartate aminotransferase increased; Troponin increased; Lipase increased; Blood bilirubin increased; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning an 81-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed an odd presentation of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue.  The patient&#39;s medical history included advanced dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism and possible leukemia. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 08 Jan 2021, three days after vaccination, the patient developed symptoms of weakness, decreased appetite, and fatigue.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted into the hospital with a diagnosis of low blood pressure,acute renal failure,acute pancreatitis,alanine aminotransferase increased,aspartate aminotransferase increased, troponin increased,lipase increased and blood bilirubin increased. Abnormal lab results included &#34;significantly elevated&#34; aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, lipase up to 1900, and &#34;slightly elevated&#34; troponin of 0.079.  On 13 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had improved, and he was discharged. Treatment for the event included two liters of intravenous fluid and supportive care.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.    The events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, were considered resolved on 13 Jan 2021.   The physician assessed the events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, as not related to mRNA-1273. The physician&#39;s rationale was that the patient may have had a gallstone obstructing the pancreatic duct and once the stone passed, the patient got better with supportive care and slow administration of fluids.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 81-year-old male patient with medical history of dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and possible leukemia, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, the non-serious listed event of fatigue, and the non-serious unlisted events of weakness, decreased appetite, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated alanine transaminase, elevated bilirubin, elevated lipase, and elevated troponin.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on the current available information and in agreement with the physician reporter&#39;s assessment, the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273, noting the rapid improvement after administration of IV fluids.

At home treatment taken on phone advise from Doctorr with Benadryl and Fomantadine with no effect.  Prednisone now prescribed.  Doctor had suggested a visit to ER but this was taken as the patient was more stable at this time.  Potential life threatening event due to the fainiting and low blood pressure/heart rate.  These symptoms have occured on previous occassions  as a result of virus and other infections.

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

Patients&#39; medical history, as provided by patient&#39;s spouse, was emergency room(ER) admission in November 2020 because he had a congested chest (he had fluid around his heart). At that time, they gave him pills for kidney function. Other concomitant medication reported was Coumadin, blood thinner. Two weeks before receiving the vaccine, patient&#39;s EKG was normal.  On 11 Feb 2021, in the morning, patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273(BATCH/LOT # 007M20A) probably in the right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, approximately after 15 minutes of receiving vaccine, they left and patient was immediately very tired, his hands were shaking. So, patient&#39;s spouse made them down sleep for too long. On Friday, 12 Feb 2021 she tried to pick him up, but he was tired, exhausted, and sick.   On Saturday, 13 Feb 2021, she brought him a coffee and he couldn&#39;t hold it because his hands were shaking, so she gave him the coffee and then made him pee on the bed because he couldn&#39;t get up. At lunch time she made him eat something and he fell sleep again. His wife was hanging around him all day and around 7:30pm she realized that he was cold, and his neck was sweating, she couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat. So, she called emergency services and when they arrived, her husband&#39;s blood pressure went down until he died. Treatment for the events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  Patient was pronounced dead on 13 Feb 2021 20:00. The cause of death was not provided. The plans for an autopsy were not provided.  The events of blood pressure went down until he died and couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat were fatal. The outcome for the remaining events were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 81 year old, male patient, who experienced a serious event of death among others, 2 days after receiving mRNA- 1273 (Lot# 007M20A). Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. Further information has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Unknown cause of death

He complained of dyspnea and fear of impending doom after waking up the following morning with some disorientation.  He was found to be in AFib with RVR after it was brought to ER  the following morning  and the rhythm was converted to normal sinus rhythm.  Patient continues to have confusion after admission yesterday that seem to get worse today to the point where he did not know his own name or birthdate, and seemed to have global amnesia.  Patient has been more drowsy this afternoon after receiving lorazepam 1 mg IV for potential seizure activity so no reliable neurologic exam was obtained.  Patient remains afebrile with pulse ox in the low 90s on 4 L of supplemental nasal oxygen in the hospital.  He had moderate decrease in kidney function upon admission that has improved.  He has baseline anemia with hemoglobin at around 10. Incidentally patient had shingles in the right thoracic dermatome week ago for which he received valacyclovir.

Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021. We have no doubt my dad, following the instructions of the injection facility, thought he was just experiencing the side effects of the vaccine. He had no chance. Had this injection been done in the RIGHT arm, perhaps he could have recognized the arm numbness being that of an impending heart attack. We really miss Dad. He served this country with distinction for over 50 years, and we believe his country failed him.

Patient reported that sores started on 2/5/21 and seem to be growing in size.  Patient did not recall any injury and sees dentist regularly for annual cleaning.  Patient also does not smoke or chew tobacco.   Patient was referred to his dentist who was able to get patient in and felt that lesions and ulcerations were not infectious or cancerous.  The NP ordered lab work and recommend patient follow up with PCP.  Labs came back two hours later and showed patient had a platelet count of 1 (THOUS/uL).  Patient was sent to ER at Hospital 1 and was transferred to Hospital 2 for a hematology work-up.  Patient is currently admitted and receiving IVIG and steroids

                                                COVID positive with mild infection; Difficulty breathing; Nose bleed; A spontaneous report was received from an 82-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced nosebleed, difficulty breathing and COVID positive with mild infection.  The patient&#39;s medical history included Pulmonary arterial hypertension and Concomitant medication include TREPROSTINIL SODIUM and TADALAFIL. Lab tests provided for COVID-19 tests positive.  On 26 Jan 2021, patient received first of two planned dose  and on 16 Feb 2021, received second of two planned dose.  On 13 Mar 2021, the patient was hospitalized with nosebleed, difficulty breathing and COVID positive with mild infection and the treatment provided was unknown.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable as the patient received both the planned doses prior to the event  The outcome of events, nosebleed, difficulty breathing and COVID positive with mild infection was reported unknown; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. Based on the known causative agent of COVID-19 infection, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. It is likely that the patient was already infected with the virus but asymptomatic before being administered with the mRNA-1273 vaccine

                                                82YM Admit 3/18/21 to hospital for small bowel obstruction within 1 week of  second vaccine dose. PTA bowel obstruction led to a syncopal episode following use of laxative, and several episodes of vomiting in the days prior . Upon admission Patient was receiving conservative therapy for a partial obstruction when he developed increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory status and eventually developed significant hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Neurology was consulted for altered mentation in the setting of respiratory failure. Patient with ascending paralysis. MRI of the head and neck as well as CTA were obtained x2. Patient was ultimately diagnosed with Guillain-Barre, variant and received 5 days of Intravenous Immune Globulin therapy.  Patient&#39;s small bowel obstruction resolved and ultimately patient required percutaneous tracheostomy tube and gastrostomy tube placement for prolonged respiratory failure and neurologic compromise.  The patient had uneventful ventilatory requirements and ultimately was performing intermittent spontaneous breathing trials; however, still had episodes of apnea, but improved.  He was tolerating tube feeds at goal with resolution of his small bowel obstruction, which was thought secondary to his Guillain-Barre.  The patient did develop abnormal LFTs which were thought secondary to cholecystitis not requiring operative intervention, with improving LFT findings on antibiotics.  The patient had a nonobstructive cholecystitis.  The patient&#39;s mentation was improving to the point where he was able to communicate and open his eyes upon discharge, as well as was working with Physical Therapy for strengthening.  He was able to move his upper extremities and followed commands and lower extremities were improving in strength as well. Patient was discharged via private air flight to acute care ICU facility.

I do not know if the vaccine was related or not, but the patient had a stroke and falls on 2/17/2021 and 2/18/2021 and was found to have two strokes.  He does have atrial fibrillation, but with the proximity to the second vaccine, I cannot tell if they are just related temporally or if there is a true risk.  Another patient at this facility had a stroke within same time frame post second Moderna vaccine, but not my patient, so I do not know if that was reported.  Due to new nature of this vaccine, I felt it important to report this event for further investigation.   Again, I am not sure if it is a true adverse reaction of the vaccine or not.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 031620A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient experienced little bruising in the arm. On 12 Feb 2021, the patient was a bit off. On Sunday, 28 Feb 2021, in the evening, the patient got cold, and within minutes his entire whole body was in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe were in pain. It felt like it was invaded with COVID. He went to hospital and got tested for COVID, Strep throat and Flu, and all three test results were negative. On an unknown date, the patient experienced tightening in his throat muscle and he went to the hospital where he was admitted.  While there, they did every possible test, chest MRI, Neck MRI, all possible viral tests, and rapid and full COVID test.  The rapid and full COVID tests came back negative.  Results for chest MRI, neck MRI and viral tests were not provided.  The hospital also performed a blood culture for bacteria. Results were not provided.  The patient was unable to move much, his blood pressure and oxygen were a little unstable. On 06 Mar 2021, the hospital did a major blood test which came back negative and the patient was released from a hospital. He stated that he was still weak in terms of walking and coughing. He stated that he recently bled due to taking blood thinner.  Treatment included major antibiotic treatments and steroids for pain during the hospital stay. The patient was still taking prednisone at a tapering dose.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The events of weak in terms of walking, coughing were unresolved, while the outcome of the events of tightening in his throat muscle, unable to move much, unstable blood pressure, unstable oxygen, bled due to blood thinner, Bruising in arm, cold, entire body in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on a strong temporal association between the reported events and administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded.  Myalgia and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Ventricular tachycardia, Arteriosclerosis coronary artery, Hypertensive and COVID-19 virus test positive (Hospitalized with mild hypoxemia at that time) in January 2021. Concurrent medical conditions included Latex allergy, Allergy (pregabalin), Weakness generalised, Dementia, Atrial fibrillation, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Mixed hyperlipidemia, Depressive disorder, Polyneuropathy in diabetes, Peripheral vascular disease NOS and Cognitive impairment. Concomitant products included ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASPIRIN (E.C.)), AMOXICILLIN, FLUOXETINE, FUROSEMIDE (FUROSEMIDE ACCORD [FUROSEMIDE]), GABAPENTIN (GABAPENTIN &#34;PCD&#34;), MEMANTINE HYDROCHLORIDE (MEMANTINE ABDI), METFORMIN, METOPROLOL TARTRATE, PANTOPRAZOLE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, ROSUVASTATIN and ZINC OXIDE for an unknown indication.    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 18-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 18-Mar-2021 to 21-Mar-2021 due to DIARRHOEA, HEADACHE, HYPOXIA and NAUSEA. On 21-Mar-2021, HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) had resolved. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 18-Mar-2021, Angiogram: chest clear with no pneumonia or pe (Inconclusive) chest clear with no pneumonia or PE. On 18-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: chest clear with no pneumonia or pe (Inconclusive) chest clear with no pneumonia or PE. On 18-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram head: negative (Inconclusive) negative.

On 19-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: non ischemic (v-paced) (Inconclusive) non ischemic (v-paced).     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) to be related.    After the patient received the 2nd vaccine dose on 03/17, he became weak and unable to walk. He also experienced headache, nausea, and diarrhea. On 03/18, he was sent to the  emergency department where we received a diagnosis of acute on chronic hypoxia related to the 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine. He required up to 2 L of O2 during the night time. He was given his regular home medications and Lovenox 40 mg SQ QD for DVT prophylaxis.  On 03/21 he was discharged as his SpO2 improved. His hypoxia returned to his baseline level upon discharge.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted 2 days after having received his COVID-19 vaccine and had SIRS including hypotension.  Was believed to be a possible reaction to the vaccine.  He was admitted to the ICU and briefly he needed vasopressors.  The hypotension resolved and did not recur.  An echocardiogram showed that he had a moderate pericardial effusion, cardiology saw him and does not believe that this contributed to the hypotension.  He also thought his stools were dark however he has had quite dark stools for many years he told me, ever since he was started on iron pills.  He could not confirm whether or not the stools might be a little darker than usual for him and he also had 1 out of 3 stool occult blood test that were positive.  He has chronic anemia with the hemoglobin slightly lower than his baseline, so GI was consulted and an EGD was performed.  He does have Barrett&#39;s esophagus and GI discussed with him how he will need follow-up EGDs, and I reminded him of that as well.  Warning signs and alarm symptoms were discussed.  He was placed back on his Eliquis however he will not be taking the Effient medication.  This was based on recommendation from cardiology.  He will have lab work done and see his primary care provider within several days.  He will also have a video capsule test done and pick this up either today or tomorrow and follow-up in several days with GI.  Discussed going back on his low-dose Eliquis with GI.  Discussed with cardiology and GI and discussed with the patient the risks, benefits and alternatives.  He will watch for any signs of bleeding and stick with a low dose of Eliquis.

About 3:30 PM on 3/16/2021, started gasping for breath again.  Called my daughter and she transported me to  Hospital.  They tested for covid - results negative.  They did a C-Scan of my chest and saw a blood clot in each lung.  While hooked to the monitors, they found I had Afib.  They also did an ultra-sound of my legs and found a small clot in each leg below the knees in a small vein.  I have never had any record of clots or Afib.  They transferred me to  Medical Center early on 3/17/2021.  They started a heparin drip to soften the clots.  In the afternoon of 3/17/2021, they performed a Suction Thrombectomy to remove the clots from my lungs.  On 3/19/2021, they put me on Eliquis Tab.  I was released from the hospital in the evening of 3/20/2021.

En route while in ambulance, he experienced a convulsion with rhythmic shaking in all limbs lasting several seconds.  He had a second episode requiring midazolam and levetiracetam. On arrival to MGH ED, the patient was afebrile, heart rate 133, blood pressure 173/93, oxygen saturation 99% on a nonrebreather.  He was found to be severely encephalopathic, mute, and not answering questions or following commands.  He was admitted to the neuroICU and intubated for airway protection given his poor mental status. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of meningoencephalitis, but these were discontinued after his CSF was not concerning for a bacterial infection herpes simplex encephalitis.  Antibiotics were discontinued. He was extubated on hospital day 2.  After extubation he had persistent mixed receptive-expressive aphasia that was slowly improving over time. At discharge from the hospital, he was able to occasionally say a simple sentence, could repeat simple phrases, and could follow simple commands. He was discharged to Rehab

                                                Patient has long standing COPD and asthma. He has been stable on his home medications for years. No hospitalizations for these issues in the past. During Covid times he has been very restricted to his home with no visitors. Approximately 5 days after receiving the 2nd Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, he started having increased difficulty with breathing. Over the next few weeks he continued to get worse and required home oxygen and an adjustment with his medications. He was started on steroids and antibiotics about 3 weeks after the vaccine and then hospitalized on 3/16/2021 with COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. He tested negative for Covid at that time. He was in the hospital for 9 days and discharged home on steroid taper and home oxygen. A few days after being at home, he had gradual onset of subacute dementia/delirium. All workup has been negative. MRI/MRA normal. He is currently continuing on oxygen and again on steroids and mental status may be starting to improve.     The concern here is that patient was stable and had been stable on his medication regimen for years. He was doing well until approx 5 days after his second Covid vaccine when he started having worsening pulmonary complaints and eventually ended up in the hospital. He continues to be on oxygen at home and was recently started back on steroids. There has been no explanation for his subacute onset of Dementia/Delirium. MRI/MRA normal. This has been discussed with both Pulmonology and Neurology specialists.

                                                Upon awakening at 07:00 began an uncomfortable feeding in chest. Over the next few hours, the feeling became painful. The pain was radiating from the center of my middle chest  outward. It became more painful to breath deeply. At about Noon I began feeling worse all over my body. Joint aches, sensitive skin and just feeling  not well. It is now 1:48 and I feel no better, but no worse. A nurse from the facility, is going to give me and my wife a Covid-19 test momentarily.

                                                My father passed away on February 10th, 2021. On Monday, January 25th 2021, he said he is feeling very uncomfortable in his chest area. He thought it was severe acid reflux. He took Gas X for Acid Reflux and told us that he does not want to go to the hospital. On Tuyesday, January 26th, he felt that his Acid Reflux symptoms got worse, he still did not want to go to the hospital. He took Tums. On that evening, he started having shortness of breath. We took his BP at home and it was very low. We begged him to go to the hospital, he still did not want to go. On Wednesday, January 27th, his shortness of breath got worse and we convinced him that he has to go to the hospital. We took him to ER. Doctor said that he had a heart attack on Monday morning and that is why he was not feeling well since Monday morning. While at the hospital, while the cardiologists were monitoring him, his heart condition got worse.  By Friday, February 5th, cardiologists said that he is very fragile, his heart condition is very fragile and he won&#39;t survive any procedure. They said that something triggered the heart attack. We told them about the vaccination on 1/13/2021. They sent him home on hospice on Friday, Feburary 5th, 2021. He was on supplemental oxygen when he came home. He passed away due to a heart attack on February 10th, 2021 around 9pm.

                                                2 days after receiving the second moderna vaccine my father experienced a stroke. He was transported to the emergency room  medical center where he went thru a procedure to remove a clot in his left side brain. Prior to this vaccine my father was in good health and was very active and still works and owns and operates a restaurant. He has never had any problems like this before the vaccine. One day after the vaccine he was complaining about a pain on the left side of his neck area. He was doing paperwork at approx 7:40pm when he experienced the stroke. I had to call 911.  My father is currently at the medical center recovering from the incident.

On 2/24/21, he was sent to the ER at a facility from a nursing home where he was admitted for skilled nursing care. He was sent to the ER due to fever, decreased mental status, renal failure, possible UTI and possible pneumonia. He was admitted and received IV fluids, Zosyn and Solu Medrol. On 2/26/21, a consult was placed for hospice care and he was accepted for hospice care at a contract nursing home. Upon review of scanned records, it appears he had a stroke/intercranial hemorrhage on 2/10/21 and that is why he was admitted to the nursing home for skilled nursing services. A date of death of 3/18/21 is recorded. No autopsy results recorded. 38 days from vaccine #2 and date of death.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not included. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 27 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 06 Feb 2021, approximately 10 days after the patient received the vaccine, he experienced a fast heart rate, dizziness, cold body temperature, and atrial fibrillation. (The wife reports that they purchased an EKG machine, and this is what the machine showed them. Unaware if he had this before the vaccine or not.)  Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was unknown.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cold body temperature, dizziness and atrial fibrillation, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the event occurred 9 days after vaccine administration and very limited information regarding this patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were event is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Further information has been requested.

                                                Patient awoke at 0600am with chest pain.  He took two nitro and tried to go back to sleep.  At 0800am he awoke again with the chest pain and took 2 nitro which again helped the pain.  At that time he did experience shortness of breath and diaphoresis.  He was found to have decreased O2 sats when the EMTs got to him and he was placed on a non-rebreather.  On x-ray the patient was found to have a right pneumothorax, cardiac markers were negative.  A chest tube was placed and the patient was transferred to a hospital.

He has begun to have mild memory changes after suspected COVID illness (covid testing negative) in November, but daughter of patient, with whom he lives, states that his memory and orientation now significantly changed- he seems to have forgotten the last &#34;3 years&#34; of memory.  Presented to ER 1/16/21 as she checked his O2 and found him to be hypoxic in 60s. He is being treated for possible CAP with underlying perviously undiagnosed ILD vs post-covid lung changes (per pulmonology), and his energy and ability to walk have returned but memory is significantly impaired, confabulating and oriented only to self despite good oxygenation on 5L O2 by NC.

Comes to the emergency department today after getting his 1st Monday and a COVID-19 vaccine at 7:30 p.m. and about 5 minutes after while sitting down developing significant diaphoresis, nausea, dizziness and feeling very warm.  The symptoms lasted for about 15 minutes and then resolved.  Since then the patient has felt a little off in his stomach but has not had any difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, chest pain, diarrhea, rash or itchiness.  With this episode the patient did not have any changes to his vision or feel like he was going to pass out.  Patient will be given 25 of Benadryl, 125 of Solu-Medrol, 20 of famotidine of concern for possible allergic reaction.  Additionally the patient will be given a small bolus of normal saline.  Given the patient&#39;s reassuring vitals and reassuring physical exam he will simply be monitored here were sure.  I do not feel any lab workup is necessary this point this is resolved episode seems either like a mild allergic reaction or a vasovagal episode.

                                                I received a Moderna vaccine injection on January 19, 2021 at approximately 3:15 p.m.  Later that evening at about 7:40 p.m, I was suddenly hit with pain in my back like someone had hit me with a board.  The pain continued to surround the midsection in a swath of about 15 inches.  I felt like my muscles were failing me.  I made it to my bed where I started shivering and shaking uncontrollably feeling like I was having a seizure.  The shaking was sporadic, lasting about an hour. I was covered with a blanket and continued with liquids for dehydration and was given an Xanax to calm nerves. Later that night while attempting to sleep, I was perspiring and my heart was beating 90 to 100 beats hindering sleep.  Through the night I attempted to go to the bathroom but with absolutely no control over my arms and legs I was unable to stand.  Rolling off the bed and unable to pull myself back, I lay on the floor and pulled a cover over me.   At about 4:30 a.m. (Wednesday morning.) I was covered with another blanket and a pillow was put under my head.  I slept until awakened at about 11 a.m  My heart rate and oxygen level was chedked and appeared to be within normal range.  I was greatly fatigued, and light-headed. Continuing a regimen of liquids, I was fed a small amount of soup and some fruit. I ate nothing the rest of the day. I slept most of the day.  In the evening, I was fatigued and nauseated and spent 2-3 hours through the night on my knees in the bathroom attempting to vomit.   Thursday morning I was awakened around 11.a.m. and was barely able to lift my head.  I slept more until needing to use the bathroom and receiving more liquids. Two hours later I was able to eat only a half a piece of toast ? the first and only thing I was able to eat that day.  Early evening having no control of  my legs, I attempted to walk. It was difficult getting legs out of the covers, but I got up and walked a few feet with the help of a walker. However, an hour later (about 8:30) I went to the bathroom and was unable to pull myself up from the toilet and fell to the floor and crawl flat on my stomach to my bed.  I had no strength in my legs and arms and needed assistance from two people to put me on my bed. Periodic rapid heartbeat and fatigue caused restless sleep. Some strength began to return on Friday and with caution over the weekend, and support from a loving family, I appear to be making a slow recovery.  Checking with several family medical people working in hospitals, my experience with the serum seemed more extreme than most.  Therefore, it was felt that I should report some information on how the Moderna injection affected me that it may be of help to others. (Some of the above information was related to me as I was not always cognizant of conditions at particular times.) I am still puzzled, as members of my family are, as to what happened to me.  We would be grateful for any information that might be helpful for us to understand my situation as it relates to others that may have had similar experiences with the Moderna serum.
