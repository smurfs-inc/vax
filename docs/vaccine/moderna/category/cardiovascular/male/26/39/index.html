                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

He was transferred from a chair to a nearby cot with feet elevated. The ER was notified and an EpiPen was on standby. Vital signs were: BP 155/69, O2 saturation 100%, and HR 125. Vitals were rechecked 5 min later and HR came down to 76. Dizziness still persisted and he complained of his hands feeling weak but grip strength was noted to be equal bilaterally. There was no indication for EpiPen so it was not used. Patient preference was to be transported to the ER for additional follow-up. In the ER vital signs continued to be monitored and patient was given 1 liter sodium chloride 0.9% fluid bolus after which the patient reported feeling much better. Patient was discharged from the ER.

                                                So later that evening around 9:30pm I started with Chills, and a low grade fever lots of body ache and head ache, to the point I did not get much sleep the night of. It lasted the whole next day. But later in the evening of the next day I think to me the most concerning side effect was I started getting some chest pain as if I pulled a muscle around my chest or what not. And it has continued into the next day as well which is now 2 days after second dose of vaccine.

On 2/12/2021 and into the morning of 2/13/2021 I developed a persistent aching chest pain - Saturday morning (2/13/2021) I went to convenient urgent care in for a quick once-over including vitals and an EKG. The EKG showed ST elevations, and I was taken via ambulance to the hospital emergency room. With blood lab value analysis and an echocardiogram performed, the hospitalist and cardiologist determined the diagnosis to be peri myocarditis. I was admitted to the hospital for 24 hours of observation and was released on 2/14/2021.

                                                Beginning 3/19/21, experienced over 16 significant nose bleeds (right nostril only) until 3/22/21. Blood flow out of nose was extremely pronounced; looked as if something had cut an artery. The blood was not slowly trickling down, it was pouring out of the nose.  does have Severe Hemophilia B (which was check marked on the registration form) so he is very prone to nosebleeds. However, the severity of rate of bleeding and the significant number of bleeds in a 4 day period was extremely unusual.  Also, it took a very long time to stop the bleeds. I had to pinch the nose extremely hard for 35 minutes to stop each bleed.

                                                I woke up at 3 A.M. the following morning with a bad migraine and dry mouth. I was also very nauseous so I went to my kitchen to have a glass of water. On the way back to the bedroom I felt my blood pressure bottom out and lost consciousness briefly and regained consciousness lying on the floor and my wife helping me up. I was able to make it to the bathroom and lay against the toilet because I thought I was going to throw up. I had that same feeling of my blood pressure dropping and again lost consciousness and regained consciousness with my head laying on the toilet seat. I also had sever chills and body aches, particularly in the neck area. I also struggled talking and communicating with my wife. She tells me I wasn?t making sense and my words were slurred.

                                                Patient reported to immunizing technician before administration of vaccine that he had a history of fainting post-vaccination due to anxiety and nerve about needles. Pt stated that previously he had fainted immediately post-vaccination. After discussing patient&#39;s medical history the supervising pharmacist advised pt to stay in vaccination seat for direct observation for 10-15min. After about 10 minutes post-vaccination in observation period the pt alerted immunizing tech, &#34;oh, its happening.&#34; The tech brought a wet paper towel and placed it on the back of patient&#39;s neck and pt replied, &#34;oh, that feels good&#34;, then patient&#39;s head immediately dropped and he went out of consciousness. Pharmacist witnessed event and rushed over to support patient from falling off chair. Pharmacist was rubbing and patting patients back and chest, yelling his name to arouse him. Pharmacist directed tech to call code white and alert store manager. In total, the patient was approximately in and out of consciousness about 20 seconds. Pt responded to stimulus and recovered without other effects or injury. Patient was fully responsive and aware of event went he became conscious again. We offered him a cold water bottle and encouraged him to remove mask if it helped him to breath better. Pt was able to communicate with pharmacist about the sensations he had leading to the event where he described first tingling in his feet, than dissociation from body, where he felt like he was having a dream but could hear someone yelling at him. EMS arrived at the scene and performed vital check. Based on patient abnormal hypertension at scene and higher BMI, EMS offered to transport patient to the ED for further tests and observation but patient declined. Patient was accompanied by his emergency contact, his father (who also witnessed the events unfold).

Patient admits that approximately a month and a half ago, he was drinking a significant amount of alcohol with a 24-pack of beer daily and 5 drinks at night.  He quit this approximately 2 weeks ago when he got back together with his girlfriend.  He has had stress in his life with the death of a cousin approximately 2 weeks ago.  The patient had been feeling well over the last week or so and received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/28 Sunday.  This was his first dose.  Approximately an hour and a half after receiving the vaccine, he had symptoms of feeling dizzy with position change.  He went home from work.  He developed fevers, chills, rigors, diaphoresis, and headaches.  He slept a lot due to these symptoms.  On 3/30 Tuesday, he woke with mild chest discomfort that he described as a pressure sensation in his anterior chest.  He states that it was bothersome, but not too significant.  He woke up 3/31 at approximately 0200 hours with a stabbing left anterior chest discomfort.  He notes that it felt like a hot knife stabbing him.  He admits that over the last couple of days, he had a cough when he would lay back in bed.  He admits to feeling more short of breath when flat and feeling like he had to put pillows behind his head.  He came to the emergency department due to these symptoms.  He was given a dose of acetaminophen and promptly had nausea and vomiting.  He received a dose of aspirin 325 mg and states that his symptoms resolved shortly after that.  3/31 He now feels well and denies any further chest discomfort.  He denies any dyspnea.

                                                Pruritic body rash starting approx 24 hours after the second dose of the COVID Moderna vaccine. Rash started in chest/upper torso and progressed to bilateral arms, back, upper buttocks, and thighs. Rash feels like a sunburn in that it makes the subject feel warm. Rash is blanchable and fully pinpoint-macular, no papules or plaques.   At approx. 36 hours post-vaccine, the rash had spread down both arms and up the neck, sparing the face. The rash gets intensely pruritic when scratched or itched. There is no pain, shortness of breath, altered mental status, or other compromise of the subject&#39;s health or well-being.

                                                Patient was given a covid vaccine on 3/4/21 at approximately 5:40pm.  The administration went well according to the patient.  After approximately 10 minutes, while the patient was sitting in the post vaccination area, he appeared to be pale looking to the imx RPh.  The pharmacist asked him how he was doing, he replied &#34;I am doing so-so&#34;.  The RPh got up to check on him further when the patient fell to the floor.  The RPh rolled him on his back, got him in a comfortable position,  and elevated his legs.  RPh applied gauze to a cut in his lip, and with the immediate assistance of the health screener, applied cold compress to his neck and forehead.  Patient experienced faintness and sweaty skin only.  Patient did not show any other symptoms.  After about15 minutes, patient said he felt like himself again, and wanted to sit up in a chair.  The RPh assisted him into a chair, where he sat for 5 minutes.  At the request of the patient, he wanted to go home.  RPh escorted patient to his car and watched him get inside safely.  1 hour later, RPh followed up with a phone call to the patient and he was on his way to an urgent care clinic to get a possible stitch for his lip.

                                                I administered the Moderna vaccine and had the patient sit down for 15 minutes for observation.  5 minutes later the patient complained of flushing in the chest and face.  His face was slightly red on one side.  The patient stated he was breathing normally, but wasn&#39;t sure if it was an allergic reaction.  As a precaution I offered 50 mg of diphenhydramine to the patient, and he accepted and took it by mouth.  I offered to call paramedics, patient refused.  I observed the patient for 20 min more, and at the end of the 20 min the patient felt better and went home.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Vaccine administered 3/11/21 at public health pop-up clinic. Sore arm from night of vaccine through day 5. Beginning on day two, extreme muscle twitching, spasms, and involuntary movements. This lasted until day 8. Starting on day 3, daily persistent cranial pressure, right eye pressure, and ear pressure. This persists today (day 26). On day 4, heart rate noticeable heart rate increases, palpitations, and chest tightness. This persists today (day 26).   On day 7, I woke up early AM and upon trying to fall back asleep, had what felt like 4-5 seizures before finally falling back to sleep. Upon waking up, right side of body was weak, tingling; right eye vision was blurry and right ear was muffled. Decided to go to ER after 2-3 hours of consistent symptoms. Admitted for observation, routine labs completed, normal. Brain CT w/o contrast, unremarkable. Symptoms persisted into next day, brain MRI WWC performed, unremarkable. ER docs and specialists (neurologist/cardiologist) implied that it could be related to vaccine, as no history of any such symptoms or disease and the temporal association with vaccine administer. Was discharged and told to follow up with PCP, neurologist, cardiologist.   Have since been in and out of doctors appointments(PCP, neurologist, cardiologist), labs drawn weekly, and several follow up imaging/labs. No doctor so far can figure out a clinical problem, but several symptoms persist or worsen as time goes on. As of now, right side weakness/tingling considered RESOLVED. Cranial/ear/eye pressure considered UNRESOLVED. Chest tightness, heart rate increases considered UNRESOLVED.

                                                Patient has history of passing out when getting blood drawn. As patient was standing to get vaccination card filled out, he told associate to call RPH that he wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ran out to give my attention and patient was sweating and looked dizzy. His eyes started to shut while he was standing and as I was holding his arm and back to support him he started to fall to the ground. Patient gently went to the ground, I pushed him over to one side and he was out for about 3 seconds and woke back up. Patient was very hot and sweaty. He wanted to move to a more private area so I made an area with a privacy panel available to him. Patient stated to me that he has no history of seizure, but suffers from mild anxiety. Myself or one of the associates was with him for approximately 45 minutes just to make sure he was ok. His blood pressure was taken (twice) and water was given. His BP readings were normal. Patient was on his way. Moderna series completed.

Loss of vision lasted for 1 minute.  Loss of vision occurred while standing.  Referral to primary care and ophthalmology specialist found normal eye exam and MRI of orbits but  presence of tachycardia especially while standing (fluctuations between 60 beats at rest/laying down to 130 beats per minute standing).   Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)  is suspected.  Currently pursuing cardiac workup with cardiologist and Covid POTS specialist.  POTS specialist believes autoantibody development after vaccination could be suspected as recovering covid patients similarly present to clinic with POTS like symptoms.

His pupils got large and he then passed out. Code white was called, 911 was called, we got an ice pack and placed on his chest and a cold rag on his head. After about 10 seconds, he regained alertness. EMT arrived and accessed the patient. His blood pressure was normal and pulse was normal. He was given a cold drink and sat in the chair until he felt better.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

                                                Have been dealing with significant nosebleeds since the day of the 2nd vaccination and the accompanied fever - reported via VSAFE and to PCP nursing team but no follow up opportunities given yet. Seems to occur 1-2x a day without any ostensible trigger.

I believe these side-effects were pretty mild from my perspective and only lasted about 1-2 minutes if memory serves me. Wanted to report due to notifications of more pronounced side effects on second dose, if I proceed with that.   I was only advised to report to see what advice I would receive.

                                                During the first day after taking vaccine, started having a fever, headache, and sore throat. By the evening, fever was severe and 102&#43;, with severe headache and sore throat. After sleeping on that nigh (had disruption of sleep from 2 - 4 in the morning), it was looking normal., just had usual fatigue after a fever. But on Thursday (Took vaccine on Tuesday morning, March 02, 2021), I suddenly started having a seizure, my whole body was shaking, legs were cramping. I thought it was going to go away, but after 10 minutes it was getting worse and I had to call the emergency services. The fire service members first came, they measured my blood oxygen level, it was 98%, but my blood pressure was high (140). I was still shaking and having the seizure. They tried to calm me down by talking, after some time, my blood pressure came to normal and I started getting normal (no seizure at that point). I declined the ambulance service as it is expensive and I was getting normal. I had a 101 fever just after that and went to visit the health care facilities .

When I came to about 10 seconds later, there was a public health official there rubbing my chest asking me if I knew where I was.  It took me a second to fully come to my senses but then I realized where I was and what had happened.  I was very pale, felt chills, was sweating, and it took effort to open my hands.  The EMTs ran a bunch of tests, my Blood pressure was low (I think the number I remember was 104/33), but the rest of the measurements like blood sugar or the number of ekg like tests they did all came back normal.  The EMTs in the field said they think it was a response to the vaccine.  After about 20 minutes of the EMTs monitoring me, my numbers came back up and I was feeling relatively normal.  I waited another 30 minutes before leaving just to make sure.  It has been almost a week and I haven&#39;t felt any symptoms close to that since then.

Patient was given a cold cloth around the back of his neck and his blood pressure was taken and it was 82/58.  Patients O2 sat was 98 and pulse was 78. Patient stated that he was allergic to nuts. We asked if he had eaten breakfast this morning and he stated that he had a bowl of cereal. I instructed for someone to have him sit on the ground and to get him some candy  and a sugary drink.  A package of skittles was presented along with a Mountain Dew.  After finishing both the candy and Mountain Dew  (aprox 4 mins) the patient started to get a little color back and he stated he was feeling much better.  A second set of vitals was then taken which were  BP: 106/78 the O2 sat 98 and Heart rate was again at 78.  We instructed the patient to please hang around for 30 more minutes and after that time left with the person he was with.

                                                This patient felt fine with the injection and for the 15 min following. He was dismissed to check out and make a follow up appt. While waiting in line to make his appt, he stated to his mother (who had given him a ride and stayed with him) that he felt faint. His mother shouted to staff nearby that he was going to pass out, so a staff person grabbed a chair for him. He sat in the chair, but did not fully lose consciousness. I ran to him with , told someone to get an ice pack, and asked his mother to sit in a chair next to him and place her hand on his right arm. I checked his bp at this time and it was 58/30. He was shaking all over, diaphoretic, pale,  and his muscles were weak.  He asked for water, so one was given to him, and he promptly drank the whole 16 oz bottle.  Over approximately 5 min, he came back to his normal LOC, stopped shaking and sweating, and stated that he was feeling better.  He was given a small bag of crackers and another bottle of water, which he quickly consumed before standing up. At this point, he stated that he was feeling hung over after staying out late the evening before drinking and celebrating St. Patrick&#39;s Day. Instructed him to make sure he is well hydrated before he comes for his second dose vaccination.

I called to notify his doctor.

                                                syncopal episode- 1:33 pm individual fell head-first off from chair in observation area and hit her head. I was called over by the observation person that someone needed attention right away. I ran over the individual was lying on the floor and her husband was sitting on a chair right next to her. He said she fainted and fell forward. The individual appeared to be unconscious when I arrived and was very diaphoretic. I loudly asked if she was okay and then tapped her chest. She looked up at me and said ?oh snap.? She was oriented to person and place and her pupils were equal, round, and reactive. She denied that she had any tingling in her arms or legs. She said she heard everyone talking to her, but thought she was dreaming. She said that she has a history of passing out with finger-pricks (she cannot donate blood anymore because of this), shots, and she passed out when she got a piercing in the past. She said she felt her HR slowly starting to climb, but she felt she would be okay. She said she then started feeling lightheaded and passed out. I took HR BP at  1:35 128/74, 62 and again 5 minutes later 128/80, 62. Individual was given an ice pack for her head. She had a bump on the upper right side of forehead. She said she had not eaten or drank much before her shot. She said her stomach was a little upset. She was given water and granola bars and sat up for a while before standing up. She asked if I thought she should get her head checked out. I said it is never a bad idea to get checked and since she did hit her head hard enough for a bump to happen right away. Individual was feeling better before she left, stating just her head hurt. We told her to ice and ibuprofen or Tylenol to treat discomfort.

                                                After receiving the COVID vaccine, the patient was instructed to have a sit in the clinic for 15 minutes in order to be monitored for any adverse reactions. Within that time period, the other patients in the waiting area reported to the staff that the patient has fainted. The patient woke up shortly after fainting. He was visibly pale but he confirmed that he is okay and not in distress (no difficulty breathing, etc). He reported that he&#39;s fainted before after a vaccination due to nerves. We gave him some water to drink and had him stay for another 30 minutes so we can monitor him closely. After 30 minutes, we determined that he&#39;s well enough to leave the store and no other further care was needed at the time.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient  is a 29 y.o.  with a history that includes # Asthma # Diabetes, recently diagnosed # Obstructive sleep apnea # Remote pulmonary embolism, no longer on anticoagulation who presented to the ED with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of known COVID-19, since admitted to Hospital for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 viral pneumonia. History herein is derived from patient interview and review of the electronic medical record. patient developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath approximately one week ago. These symptoms developed very shortly after he received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He initially attributed these symptoms to side effects of the vaccine. When they persisted, however, he called his primary care physician who recommended that he seek evaluation. He was evaluated at an urgent care on 3/30 where he tested positive for COVID-19. His shortness of breath progressed, and he presented to the ED on 3/31 for evaluation. CTPE was negative for PE but did demonstrate viral pneumonia. Ambulatory pulse oximetry was negative for desaturation. He was discharged home. Since discharge, his symptoms have continued to progress. He was planned to receive monoclonal antibody earlier today, 4/2, however when he presented for his infusion he was found to be hypoxic to 89% and tachycardic to 130s. He was sent to the ED for evaluation. He continues to have diaphoresis and chills although believes his fever has improved. He has some chest tightness with deep inspiration. He otherwise denies unusual headache, sore throat, productive cough, chest pressure, abdominal pain, flank pain, dysuria, and diarrhea. He reports that his PE was provoked by obesity and a lengthy plane flight in 2017. He was on anticoagulation for 8 months and has since been off.  On arrival to ED, VS AF, HR 122, RR 30s, BP 120/90, SpO2 97% on RA. He was in significant respiratory distress and was therefore placed on HHFNC with improvement. VBG 7.42/39 and lactate 3.9. CMP w/ AST 40, ALT 40, AG 15. Serum creatinine elevated at 1.13 from baseline 1.0. CBC w/ WBC 5.6, HGB 17.7, PLT 257. HS troponin 10 -&gt; 8. Given his hypoxemia and history of pulmonary embolism, CTPE was performed and negative for PE however did demonstrate bilateral consolidations consistent with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Procalcitonin was negative. He was given dexamethasone. He was also given 500 mL LR with clearance of lactate. He was admitted to Hospital in stable condition.

                                                Around 11:15 am, Jan 17, 2021, while standing at the toilet, my son either lost his balance or fainted and fell to the floor.  He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

I woke up around 2:00 am and I had a high fever and I was having trouble breathing. My fingertips had turned blue. My oxygen level was about 92%. I took ibuprofen and that brought the fever back down. I had body aches the next day. My cough had gotten worse (that I had at time of vaccination).  I went to Urgent Care on January 6, 2021.  They did the COVID test that day. I had a sinus infection - antibiotics were prescribed.  It took about two weeks for symptoms to resolve.

                                                30 yo man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED for chest pressure and SOB that started this morning when he woke up. It was a constant 8/10 pressure squeezing at the sides of his sternum with the sensation of a plate pushing down on his sternum, that worsened by taking deep breaths. He had never experienced anything like it before. The pain was neither worsened with exertion nor relieved by rest. It did not change with position, and it did not radiate to his arm/neck. He denies any tenderness to palpation of his chest. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not provide any relief. At time of interview denies SOB and reports decrease in chest tightness to 2/10. CP was significantly relieved with a bolus of normal saline in the ED. Tylenol also effectively reduced his pain. Of note, the patient received the second Moderna COVID vaccine shot 3 days ago. For 2 days after receiving the second shot he experienced fevers, chills, nausea, and intermittent vomiting (10 bouts of non-bloody emesis).

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

                                                During the 15 minute observation period after injection, patient returned to the check-in desk complaining of dizziness. He was brought immediately to exam room where he became pale, diaphoretic, and stated he &#34;felt like he was in a dream.&#34; Seated BP was 74/palp. He was placed in supine position on exam table, cool compresses placed on forehead and back of neck. He complained of some nausea, which quickly improved. He never lost consciousness. His color and alertness improved steadily over the next 10 minutes. Repeat BP (lying) was 100/50. After a few minutes he sat up on exam table, dangling legs. BP remained stable at 110/60, HR 84. He continued to improve and stated that he felt better, drank some water and ate some goldfish crackers. Reported that he just remembered he had not eaten since lunch. After another 5-10 minutes he was alert, oriented, able to walk unassisted. Final BP 114/70, HR 80. His wife remained with him and confirmed she could drive him home. Discussed that although I feel confident this was a vasovagal near-syncope, if symptoms recur or worsen, he should go to ER for evaluation. Understanding verbalized.

                                                After I was administered the shot. I was directed to a space designated for observation for patients after they receive the  vaccine. Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

After removing the needle the patient straightened his posture and I could tell that the injection was too high and more in the shoulder area. Patient said that he felt okay and no pain but then returned 3 hours later complaining of shoulder pain and limited range of motion. I instructed him to ice the area 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off and to take Ibuprofen. Area was not swollen. Upon follow up later that evening he said he was having a hard time laying on that side and was more comfortable sleeping in a recliner. He said he was still having pain the following morning and was going to go to an urgent care for further testing.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included allergy to cefaclor and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Concomitant medications reported included desvenlafaxine succinate, gabapentin and dexlansoprazole.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 11:30 am, approximately six hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the morning of 23 Dec 2020, prior to receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt &#34;achy&#34;.  At 5:30 pm, the patient experienced chills, fever to 102, GI upset and diarrhea. At 11:00 pm, the patient reported difficulty sleeping, GI upset, LOC x 2 and pallor. The patient was transported to the emergency room via ambulance.  A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test and routine labs were collected; however, results were not provided. Treatment for the events included paracetamol, unspecified intravenous (IV) medications, ondansetron and ketorolac tromethamine. The emergency room discharge diagnosis was stomach flu.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, GI upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever, were considered resolved on 24 Dec 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 31-year-old, male subject with a medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, who experienced the unexpected events of loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, and stomach flu, and the expected events of chills and fever. The events of chills, fever occurred approximately 6 hrs. and the events of GI upset, loss of consciousness, difficulty sleeping occurred after 12 hrs. after the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The time to onset for the events of GI upset and diarrhea were unknown. The reporter did not provide the causality assessment for the events. Due to the temporal association between the LOC and the administration of the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however, the subject&#39;s medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and other concurrent conditions of GI upset, diarrhea, and stomach flu remain as confounders.

I haven?t been able to sleep since then and my fever has spiked as high as 104.5. I?m also experiencing headache, ear aches, mild sore throat, nausea, and chest tightness/pain during deep breathing. No shortness of breath symptoms though. Aleve and Tylenol do not appear to be helping. I feel worse than when I had Covid back in November.

Saturdays diarrhea slowed down - and I went to ER - muscles were pushing - I felt my electrolytes were out of whack. I02 degree fever so they gave me Tylenol. They gave me two bags of fluids. My heartrate was in mid 120s when I went in and after fluids it went down to the 70&#39;s. I was discharged after that. I was swabbed for COVID - negative. Sunday I was still lethargic and fatigue; diarrhea slowed down quite a bit and I was able to eat some food. Monday I came back to work - not 100% in health but felt better.

In the recovery/observation area, he became pale and lightheaded.  His companion asked for help from EMTs stationed in the room.  After I spoke with the patient and at my suggestion, the EMTs helped the patient onto a gurney so he could recline and recover.  The patient was fine after 15 minutes, declined further care, and walked out of the room in the company of his companion.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was asked to move to observation area.  Shortly after sitting down the patient came back to pharmacy counter and stated he was feeling dizzy.  Just as the pharmacist was telling him to sit back down he fainted and fell on the floor.  He recovered rather quickly (matter of seconds?) and tried to sit up right away.  Pharmacist asked him to stay on the floor for a moment, the store&#39;s first responder (MIC) was called over to pharmacy.  After a minute of sitting on floor the patient got up on his own accord and transferred to a nearby chair.  His BP was taken twice per emergency protocol of pharmacy.  Patient initially appeared calmmy and BP  was 132/81, pulse 44, respirations 18 at 12:25p.   BP was 142/89, pulse 48, respirations 16 at 12:35.  Patient was given both a water and a Gatorade while he was seated.  Patient stated he had not eaten anything yet for the day.  Patient was repeatedly offered medical services (i.e. &#34;Do you want a medic? Do we need to call an ambulance?&#34;) The patient repeatedly refused any further medical treatment.  After further observation patient was able to stand, check out at the pharmacy and left the store on his own accord.

I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

Patient was instructed to rest and increase fluid intake and Ibuprofen as this was likely a known adverse reaction to COVID vaccination. At 72hrs from vaccination patient began to have fevers Tmax 101.9 orally. Continued rest, hydration and ibuprofen, started Tylenol. At 96hrs from vaccination patient began to have a dry cough, diarrhea, severe fatigue and inspiratory chest pain. Patients myalgias and arthralgias continued, and Tmax increased to 104.5 orally. At this time bedside ECHO, iSTAT chemistry, COVID antigen, COVID antibody and COVID PCR, Rapid Flu, and Viral Respiratory Panel were obtained. Administered 1.5 liters of lactated ringers, Toradol 15mg and Tylenol 975mg  and patient was isolated.  EKG, troponin and Chest Xray were obtained 12 hours later (108 hours from vaccination) at which time the patient reported improvement  by 95%. Patient was afebrile and chest pain free. Only symptom at that time was fatigue. After  another 12 hours of rest/sleep (hour 120 post vaccination)  patient reports no symptoms and 100% well.  See below for lab/rad/test details.

I had a sharp and persistent headache that lasted most of the night. I felt a little pain in my chest, and even when I took deep breaths it never felt like I had enough air. I&#39;m wondering in the breathing difficulties might have been due to heartburn/indigestion. I had to stop taking my heartburn medicine because it&#39;s not good for my kidneys (I also have kidney disease). On rare occasions I have had symptoms from heartburn that feel almost like asthma. The fever-symptoms and chills subsided a few hours later after I took a Tylenol, but I continue to feel fatigued and I have a bad headache.

While sitting down his eye rolled back and he passed out.  His spouse said his body was shaking.  She lowered him to the floor and he awoke.  Paramedics were called and determined his blood pressure was very low. They tried to stand the patient up to take another blood pressure reading, but the patient had to sit down as he became dizzy and lightheaded again.  The paramedics took him to the ER where the doctor said he was fine and discharged him.

                                                Felt a bit odd on the couch, little shiver and what felt like adrenaline. I got up and went into the bathroom where the incident occurred. I used to be on 10mg of Ramipril years ago and moved to 5 due to light headedness when standing up. Yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly. Getting up too fast with heart pressure meds prescribed for albumin /T1D and not for heart pressure. The secondary use of Ramipril is normal for type 1 diabetes after 20&#43; years. So I went to 5mg and haven?t had that issue since. I should also mention that when this used to happen to me I would lay down and recover with no problem.  Back to the incident it felt exactly like that but on steroids. I was in the bathroom looking for Tylenol and I got light headed, yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly, ringing in the ears, dizzy, and confused. I remember thinking I should probably get down on the tile floor and lay down like I?m used to from the episodes years ago with 10mg Ramipril causing the same symptoms but never anything so extreme. Next thing I know I?m on the ground waking up where I fainted and hit my head pretty hard on the way down. I probably have a minor concussion. Iced my head in the back where I hit it last night and this morning. Surprisingly 0 bumps, etc other than a little bit sore.  Trying to remember going down is impossible. There is a strange, I guess it?s not strange as I fainted, but to me being 1 moment thinking what I should do then the next moment still thinking that same exact thing but coming to on the bathroom floor with parents yelling over top of me as I was at their house is strange. I recall what almost felt like a dream while I was out but I was wondering why everyone was asking if I was ok, of course I?m ok I thought. Then I realized what happened and crawled around on the floor the rest of the night if I needed anything and was checked every hour through the night which was horrible but necessary.  Also my blood glucose was a 220 at the time of the incident according to my CGM so it didn?t have to do with low blood sugar.  In any case I feel better today but in a fog with a slight headache.

Measured blood pressure twice &amp;, average ~90/55. Offered patient ambulance, patient declined.

                                                Patient symptoms of chills, headache, and body aches began on Sunday 3/28, 6 days after vaccination.   One day later, on 3/29, patient started experiencing pain in the right armpit, the same shoulder where the vaccine was received.  That pain built up until Wednesday 3/31, when the arm was very swollen, purple, and rapidly loosing sensation.  The patient went to the ER.  In the ER, via ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis of the right subclavian and axillary veins.  From 4/1 to 4/2 the patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure, thrombo lysis, using tPA directed by catheter to the site of the 12 cm long clot.  On 4/2, it was determined that the flow was not restored to the vein, and the radiologist informed the patient that right first rib removal would be necessary.  On 4/9, right first rib resection surgery was performed to alleviate pressure on the subclavian vein.  Patient is currently recovering on the blood thinner Eliquis.  Additional procedures for thrombo ectomy and angioplasty will follow in approximately two weeks to clear the subclavian and axillary veins.

                                                Pt. was very sick the day after the shot, then Friday morning his heart was going into atrial fibrillation and jumping between 110 heart rate and 160&#43;. He was out golfing when he noticed this. He rested later that day but was extremely tired and felt sick. Saturday morning (2.5 days after vaccine) he needed to go to the emergency room because his heart rate was back over 160. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia and gave him a message for it but it made it worse and the rate was over 200. They had to stop and start his heart then put on beta blocker which brought it to 180, then another beta blocker brought to 150. Following EKGs showed atrial fibrillation, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and super ventricular tachycardia. Pt. had this about a year ago but was fine after a few days. This was the first time he was hospitalized for it and is now on daily medications. He fears the Moderna vaccine triggered it and is very worried about the second dose.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

For then next couple days just felt rundown. Then three days post vaccine I began having some chest discomfort and shortness of breath. That night around one thirteen the morning I went to Emergency Department. they took a ECG and drew labs. the ECG showed normal rhythm just a little elevated and my Blood pressure was elevated. Upon the attending physician getting my lab work back i was admitted for my triponin levels being elevated. I was taken for chest X-rays and a Cat Scan per their pulmonary embolism protocols. Both of which showed nothing.  The next day i had a Echocardiogram, and Cardiac Catheterization, and a Cardiac MRI.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused.

                                                I have not felt the same since I received the vaccine. Initially, I felt tingling in my fingers after receiving the injection. I also got chest and throat tightness. I felt very slightly shaky and just a bit off.  After that subsided a bit, I left the facility and started heading home. Ten miles from the store, I went back as I got another wave of feeling pretty terrible. I waited outside there for another hour until I felt better again. The next few days I had terrible fatigue and constant headaches, and the obvious sore arm. I had a couple days where I was a little better but then it would come surging back again.  For three weeks I&#39;ve had on and off migraines, extreme and dreadful fatigue like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before (feels like I&#39;m dying of cancer or something), and feeling out of it and spacey. It&#39;s been awful and I&#39;m terrified to get the second dose if the first one did all this to me. I was feeling great in the weeks leading up to the vaccine so I am certain that my reaction is to the vaccine. I hope this gets better soon. I&#39;m not sure what to do about dose 2.

Chills, dizziness, and body aches continued mildly through Sunday.   I also passed out/blacked out the night of getting the vaccine while using the bathroom. Unclear if this was simply due to standing too quickly while experiencing the above mentioned symptoms and blood rushing to my head or a true side effect of the vaccine.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

I asked my pharmacy staff to call 911 and attend the patient.  I was attending a patient who was feeling faint after her vaccination.  Staff was in contact with 911 and were attending patient.   His initial blood pressure reading was 138/92. He was sweating profusely.  He was no longer talking.  his next blood pressure reading was higher in the 160&#39;s according to our other pharmacist who was attending him.  The paramedics were here very quickly and took the patient to a local hospital.  I believe the attending pharmacist will also be reporting this.

Within seconds I was unresponsive for what appears to have been just over 1 minute. My wife called 911 and I was starting to come to while she was wrapping up the call with the dispatcher. I remained seated upright, did not fall over, but was completely unresponsive.  When the EMT&#39;s checked vitals (within 5 minutes of me coming back to awareness), all was normal. Simply a full body cold sweat. It&#39;s now 10pm and I feel no other symptoms. Completely &#34;normal&#34;.

He went to the waiting room and all of a sudden he told his wife he thought he was going to faint. He did and she got on his lap immediately so he wouldn&#39;t fall. She was tapping his face and talking to him. Others in the waiting room were helping. He punched his wife in the stomach (she is pregnant) but she seemed to be ok as she was trying to get him back to normal. I called 911 and  manager gave him water and ice. The paramedics came and checked him out to make sure he was ok. He was very alert by the time they got here and then they left. He continued to sit for awhile and I asked if his wife would be driving. She said yes. I told him if they needed anything to call us.d

Went to Emergency Room on 3/31/21  and diagnosed with Erythema Multiforme. Doctor could not confirm vaccination related, but ruled out all other possibilities and told my son NOT to take the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. He gave him stronger prednisone

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history reported).    On 29-Mar-2021 at 8:45 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 29-Mar-2021, the patient experienced PRESYNCOPE (felt like he was about to pass out) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (felt dizzy), PALPITATIONS (felt like his heart was racing), NASOPHARYNGITIS (felt like he had a cold), SOMNOLENCE (felt like he wanted to sleep) and NAUSEA (felt nauseous). On 29-Mar-2021, PRESYNCOPE (felt like he was about to pass out), DIZZINESS (felt dizzy), PALPITATIONS (felt like his heart was racing), NASOPHARYNGITIS (felt like he had a cold), SOMNOLENCE (felt like he wanted to sleep) and NAUSEA (felt nauseous) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant drugs were reported.  On 29 Mar 2021, the patient went to emergency room and was monitored for a couple hours, not medical treatment was provided for side effect relief.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 34-year-old male with a serious unexpected event of presyncope, palpitations, and nonserious unexpected dizziness, somnolence, palpitations, nasopharyngitis and expected nausea. Event onset Day1 after first dose. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                The patient received his 2nd dose of Moderna (LOT#, site, time unavailable) at an outside clinic the morning of 2/10/21 and presented to the ED with coughing and hypoxia (sp02 occasionally dropping into 70&#39;s) at 8 PM that day.  He had quadriplegic spinal paralysis as a result of a remote MVA and has been hospitalized and critically ill in the past due to recurrent UTI&#39;s and pneumonia with associated sepsis.   CT negative for pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral infiltrates.  Clinical presentation consistent with bilateral pneumonia and started on Rocephin/azithromycin.  He was initially stable in the hospital on 1-2 LPM 02.  The following evening he became febrile and acutely developed asystole without any pre-existing arrhythmia.  Resuscitation was attempted for 45 minutes but unsuccessful.  Overall, I suspect his death was related to bacterial pneumonia and resulting acute respiratory failure, complicated by his quadriplegia and autonomic dysreflexia but reported this event as it did occur within 2 days of receiving his 2nd Moderna vaccination.

                                                I began to have a fever with chills and very severe body aches that lasted 3 days after the shot and developed the day after the shot was administered. In addition, I developed a rash on my arm and was bedridden. I took a small walk that day and proceeded to swell up on the left side of my body but it subsided within a few hours. The next day, I suffered a stroke due to blot clotting and the clot flowing to my brain. I had to go to the hospital and was there for a few days.

I gave him some cool water and instructed him to remove his sweater. It was warm in the store so I placed a fan so he could cool off.  He waited about an additional 15 minutes in our consultation room after which time he said he was feeling better and was able to leave the store under his own volition. I tried calling about an hour later but received no response.

                                                Had an emergency appendectomy on May 9th, 2021. Woke up on Friday the 7th with mild stomach pain from my chest to my belly button. It felt like indigestion. Pain stayed mild until Saturday evening when I started vomiting and had diarrhea and by 11:00 pm I went to the ER where they did bloodwork and a ct scan. Bloodwork showed high white blood cell count, scan showed appendicitis. After 4.5 hours there, I had to leave to go to another hospital and wait for a bed. After being in intense pain for a few more hours, I finally had the emergency surgery at 11:00 am Sunday the 9th.

Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                Maybe 1 minute after receiving the vaccine I began to have a syncopal episode, the nurse practitioner thought that since I was heavy I began to have a vasovagal reaction.  From there they asked me to sit with the others waiting 15 minutes to make sure they were ok to leave. As I sat the symptoms would come and go, as if in a pattern, and then return.  The longer I sat there the more the symptoms began to grow, after sitting for an hour they decided to send me to the ER. At this time I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, sweating, I was itchy, I could not stop coughing, it was difficult to breath, and I had the worse headache.  When I got to the ER they gave me drugs to reverse the allergic reaction and told me they would watch me for a while. In the next 4 hours all of the symptoms started again and I had to get another round of the reaction drugs, I ended up going through this process 4 times before I was safe enough to go home the next day.  The provider that saw me and admitted me did not do any blood work or labs, they simply provided me with the reaction drugs when needed and my home medications.

He then performed some-what of a self physical and was suspicious of pericarditis. Had an EKG pointing to pericarditis.  He then had an ECHO performed at the hospital that confirmed the diagnosis. Was then started on a course of colchicine to treat the pericarditis. It is important to know he contracted COVID earlier in the fall with a confirmed laboratory diagnosis on 11/13/20 which he was fully recovered from.  He was never hospitalized for the infection.

My right side of my face around the cheek, eye, and ear area began to tingle and feel numb around 20 to 30 min. After the shot was administered. It was only on the side of my face that Moderna covid vaccine was given. It ended up going away after 4 hours or so. The next day I had normal reactions to the shot for someone that had covid such as low fever, muscle inflammation, aches, and this brain fog, chills in my sleep.

A few minutes after administration pt reported throat tightness and acid reflux similar to his peanut allergy.  Administered 25mg of diphenhydramine (10 mL of 12.5mg/5 mL solution).  After 5 minutes pt reported tongue thickening, chest tightness, and increased throat tightness.  Administered epinephrine 0.15mg auto-injector and called 911.  Continued to monitor pt.  He reported that his throat tightness subsided, his tongue felt better, and he no longer had chest tightness after epinephrine.  EMS arrived and transported patient.

A few minutes later he tells me he is dizzy and his vision is blurry so I bring him back into the vaccination room, give him some water and tell him to relax. 10 minutes later I check his BP which is elevated along with his pulse. I check again another 10 minutes later and it has lowered (pulse 80). BP still elevated so I mentioned it could be due to the nervousness to the reaction or just that he has hypertension and he should get it checked out. After a while his spouse came into the vaccination room and he said he was better and they left.

                                                On Friday April 16th, 2021, at around 12:10 AM, I had responded to an email for work that I forgot to respond to in the afternoon because I was receiving my first Moderna vaccine at that time. The email induced a lot of stress and shortly thereafter I felt my chest feeling heavy and started wondering whether I had trouble breathing. It is currently Friday April 16th at 1:32 AM, I woke up my housemate and we took a walk around the block for about 30 minutes and I am feeling better. Since receiving the Moderna injection, the area that received the injection has felt sore.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

No treatment Body aches, fatigue, abdominal cramps, dry lips, dry mouth and throat, sinus pressure, nasal passage closed on one side and closing on the other, pale white skin on back of throat on the right side, chest tightness while laying face-down,  minor nausea, and very tired but unable to stay asleep all night.  Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

I took my temperature with a digital forehead thermometer and no increase in temperature was noted. This could be a false reading given my symptoms. I took Tylenol around 10pm the evening before to prevent possible fever and aches. Now around 8:20am I still have described above symptoms. I?m continuing to rest and drink plenty of water.

Patient was seated  approximately 6 feet in front of pharmacy counter and I went out to check on him.  Patient was sweating profusely and again complained of feeling disoriented.  I asked if he was feeling nauseous and he said no.  I placed a cold compress on the back of his neck and had him try to relax and breath evenly.   I then  got a ice pack for him and wrapped it in towels to protect the patient from the cold.  Offered patient some water which he denied.  Offered to call an ambulance and patient denied.  I took the patients blood pressure and it was 140/84. Patient states this is slightly higher than normal for him.  After 5 more minutes patient began to recover quickly.  Sweating stopped and his color returned to normal.  Patient stated he felt much better.  I took patients blood pressure again and it was 133/94.  Patient stayed under observation for another 15 minutes and said he felt fine and left the pharmacy.

                                                I am unable to regulate my body temperature. I fluctuate between shivering from chills to sweating profusely. I have a mild headache and joint pain. I am heavily fatigued to the point that walking to my kitchen is laborious. My temperature is only slightly elevated to 98.8 degrees F. My normal temperature is 98.1 degrees F.  I have been drinking Gatorade when I?m able to make it to my kitchen and taking acetaminophen.  The events started approximately 7 hours after vaccination and have been constant to this point.

                                                Felt fine until about nine hours after the shot. Had been sitting at computer for at least six hours straight (and probably smoking more pot than I should have), felt dizzy and short of breath, got up, ended up losing consciousness on the living room floor. Woke up a few minutes later and put myself to bed; felt fatigue, aches, chills, and like I might have been running a mild fever. Slept unusually well; woke up this morning feeling perfectly fine. Not particularly concerned but felt like I should report it.

                                                Sinus pressure started the same night as the vaccine. The symptoms gradually worsened throughout the night. He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses. Then suddenly had a significant flow of blood from his RIGHT nostril. As of this evening he still has congestion in his sinuses, and intermittent tightness in his chest.

I came to check on him and gave him water and orange juice to drink.  I checked his blood pressure twice, approximately 2 minutes apart.  The first blood pressure reading was 73/46mmHg and a heart rate or 46bpm.  The second reading was 110/74mmHg and HR 66bpm.  After the second BP reading, patient stated that he was feeling better.  This was just likely vasovagal syncope.

                                                Patient had flu-like symptoms while deployed at start of pandemic (approx. Jan/Feb 2020), but testing was unavailable. His symptoms (URI-like) completely resolved. He received Moderna dose 1 on 02 Feb 2021 without incident, and Moderna dose 2 on 02 Mar 2021. Approximately one week later, he developed mild, dull, diffuse chest pain and shortness of breath which has persisted since.   He was seen in clinic for chest pain and dyspnea on 15 Mar 2021. Patient noted his chest hurt ?all over? especially with deep or with normal inspiration. Reclining, laying down, and sleeping on his right side increased his pain (he did not trial sleeping on his left). Leaning forward decreased pain. He endorsed feeling short of breath, and stated he felt light headed twice while going up stairs, without passing out. He denied recent illnesses and other symptoms. He is a very physically fit Active Duty Marine, who has continued running despite his symptoms. During this encounter and later f/u encounter, he expressed he did not believe running made his symptoms significantly worse.  Vital signs were within normal range and he did not appear in distress. Cardiac and lung exam were normal, and no friction rub or murmur was appreciated. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, with HR consistent with his known, athletic-type normal variant heart rate. No other abnormalities were detected. Due to limited ancillary services within clinic, he was sent to USNHO ED for evaluation. There, he had basic labs (including Trop I) drawn, which were normal. EKG and portable chest xray were also unremarkable, and he was discharged with Motrin 800mg PO TID.  He was seen in clinic again 29 Mar 2021 for continued, unchanged symptoms, and reported he had been taking his Motrin only in the mornings and afternoons. Vital signs were unchanged (normal limits). Exam, including heart and lung, were normal. EKG again demonstrated sinus bradycardia, consistent with his normal resting heart rate. He was started on empiric therapy for pericarditis. He was released from clinic and will follow up in several weeks.

                                                There is blue discoloration at the center of my tongue. It is painless, I would not even know it was there were it not for sticking my tongue out to brush it in the mornings. It only happens overnight, now 2 consecutive mornings since the 2nd dose of moderna. No edema, sore throat, or swelling. I have photos that I can send. It looks like I ate a blue colored candy, but I didn?t. I wake up like this from sleep.

Neck stiffness and soreness began Thursday evening.  Severe chest pains early Saturday morning (3am).  Taken to urgent care - EKG showed irregularity and high level of troponin. Transported from there to the hospital.  They did angiogram, and diagnosed me with pericarditis. The on call physician believes this was most likely caused by the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                The week of getting my second vaccine I noticed my heart rate was at times up to 115 bpm. The day after I received the vaccine I was very tired feeling, my left arm very sore, and I noticed my heart rate was staying higher. At one point at work my heart rate went up to 140 bpm. I went to the doctor after work and was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia. I was prescribed metoprolol for tachycardia. I do not know what caused my heart rate to increase, but the metoprolol has my rate controlled now. I felt the fatigue lasted about 3-4 days and then I was back to normal.

I got right on Cepra - Urgent Care visit like I was given for last vaccine. The symptoms subsided after four days.  I am having heart palpitations about two weeks - I notice it a lot - I notice it intermittently but often; Varies in intensity and I was woken up where my heart was beating very loudly - I tried to calm myself down because my heart rate wouldn&#39;t go down. That&#39;s never happened to me before. Even right now I can feel my heart palpate more than I should be able to feel it. Today at 01:00 PM I am going in for an EKG and have my heart monitored. I am gong to clinic where my Dr practices. I saw a PA for a work injury - for worker&#39;s comp from the vaccine -  so I have had an EKG already- result was normal rhythm acutely at the time.

The rest of his vital signs were normal.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and his heart was regular rate and rhythm. EKG was normal. Patient reports he has had previous syncopal episode when having blood drawn.  Patient likely suffered an episode of vasovagal response syncope.

At 5 pm I had fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain, as well as dizziness. By 5:30 my condition worsened, and I have a fast heartbeat, significant dizziness, and chills. At 5:40 I contacted my wife to leave work to drive me to the hospital. We arrived at the hospital around 6:15; by 8 pm most symptoms except dizziness had disappeared. By 9 pm the dizziness had abated. It is 10:40 pm and I am still a little dizzy, but able to move and operate fine.

                                                patient received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. After receiving in our immunization room, he left the room and then shortly walked over to the pharmacy in-window and told the pharmacy tech that he did not feel well and felt dizzy. Tech had him go sit down in the waiting room and went and got the nurse, who went out to check on patient. Patient was slumped in the waiting room chair with eyes closed and very sweaty. Patient said he wanted water, so staff quickly got him water. After a few sips, patient&#39;s head rolled back and he lost consciousness for roughly 10 seconds before waking up startled and confused. Ambulance was already called and when the arrived they triaged the patient for around 15 minutes. After about 15 minutes the patient seemed much better and the paramedics decided it was OK for him to leave and drive himself home.

A shopper alerted our staff and when I came to check on him, he was just rousing but had his eyes closed due to blurred vision. He was able to speak and look directly at me. He said this reaction had never happened to him before. He seemed jittery probably due to the reaction. Asked for water and was able to drink. He said that he most likely hit his head and compressed his finger during the fall but feels okay. We are not sure how long he was out for.

                                                Fainted 10 minutes following administration of vaccine. Patient fell from chair, unconscious. I aroused him and he regained consciousness after about 1 to 2 minutes. Blood pressure check at that time was 89/43, pulse 59. Patient was able to speak, said he passed out, bumped his forehead and lip. I gave ice pack for head. EMS arrived after less than 10 minutes, check vital signs and forehead and lip condition. Blood pressure was too low, so EMS transported him to local hospital. Hospital gave 1 liter IV fluid, advised him to get second dose on time and discharged him same day.

                                                Patient noted he had no adverse reactions with his first dose of the Covid vaccine or other vaccines he has had in the past.  He was informed that  there are more chances of side effects experienced with the second dose ( such as headaches, flu like symptoms, nausea).  He was directed to stay in the store for at least 15 minutes and to inform the pharmacy immediately if he felt anything  out of the ordinary.  He said he walked down several aisles then started feeling light headed and having tunnel vision.  He was on his way back to the pharmacy when he ended up on the ground.  He does not remember how he ended up laying on the ground.  He said his head did not hurt but does not know if he hit it.  When started regaining conscience, his right arm and leg jerked somewhat then calmed down.  When he came to, he said he didn&#39;t feel dizzy when he tried to sit up.  The ambulance was called so he was instructed to remain laying on the floor.  The EMT personnel asked him his name, the date, and where he was while he was laying down and after sitting up on the floor.  He answered correctly both times.  He was then asked to sit down on a chair to take his blood pressure.  The EMT personnel were having trouble   getting a good reading so he was transported to Hospital.

Received 1st Moderna COVID19 vaccine on 2/3/2021.  Developed a rash, biopsy showed lichenoid dermatitis, but no other symptoms after that first shot.  Received 2nd Moderna COVID19 vaccine on 3/12/21 and rash persisted (may or may not have worsened, hard to know from patient report) and the patient presented to medical attention on 3/23/21 acutely short of breath and hypoxic, after being able to exercise (walk 2 miles every other day, etc) prior.  Found to have biopsy proven lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis with diffuse alveolar damage/ARDS requiring supplemental oxygen.  Started on systemic steroids without response.  Also with concurrent mild transaminitis.  From prior recent labs, LFTs were normal prior to presentation with hypoxia.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) in a 37-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 045A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).    On 19-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 21-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and THYROID HORMONES DECREASED (Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) and THYROID HORMONES DECREASED (Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 21-Mar-2021, Blood thyroid stimulating hormone: low (Low) Low. On 21-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation (abnormal) Atrial fibrillation. On 21-Mar-2021, Stress echocardiogram: atrial fibrillation (abnormal) Atrial fibrillation.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications were not provided.

                                                I received the Vaccine on Wednesday 1/6/2021 . Later that evening, my right deltoid was slightly swollen and painful. I would rate the pain 5/10. The next day Thursday 1/7/21, I noticed intermittent heart flutter/palpitations. I had my routine morning coffee and I thought the combination of the vaccine and the coffee might be the caused.  The flutter/palpitations continue to the present. I don&#39;t have shortness of breath. The left deltoid pain and swelling subsided. The flutter is intermittent and last 10 to 15 seconds.

I breathe through my nose mostly and I&#39;m in very good pulmonary and cardiovascular condition.  I went for a run and 1 mile in I started drooling a lot! Spitting out mouthfuls every 15-30 seconds and I never spit.  Then my chest got tight and hurt and got irritated.  The feeling was identical to Bronchitis.  I started walking home and my breathing rate increased with wheezing. I got nauseous and was bent over with saliva poring out of my mouth.  Walking up one flight of stairs was difficult.  I have a finger pulse oximeter and it was at 84!  Breathing was very rapid and difficult. After 5 minutes it went up to 94 and then up to 98-99 after 1 more minute (when my pulse fell back under 100bpm.  Chest tightness continued for about 1 hour before I was back to normal for the most part. by today I feel 100% again.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

I began to feel ill. Arm hurt, headache, weight on chest. Body hurt. I went to bed early. I woke up on 13 JAN and felt worse. I stayed in bed until around 1300. I got up and went and sat in my office to work. At around 1700, I went to go get my children from a neighbors yard to bring them for supper. I made it to my back yard before feeling to tired to continue. I went inside and laid down. At around 1900 or 1930, I was putting my kids to bed. I then fainted once more. I don&#39;t know how long I was out each time. I don&#39;t think I hit anything with my head. I got up and went to my bed and texted a Doc.

                                                Eleven days after the vaccination the patient developed 2 days of heartburn followed by a worsening nonproductive cough, substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, palpitations, and an episode of near syncope. These worsened over about 6 days and then slowly decreased. During this time he was referred to the ED and then admitted to a civilian host nation hospital. Echocardiogram and CT scan were performed and a paericardial cyst was discovered measuring 7.4 cm. He was then referred to another facility for evasluation. The pericardial cyst was confirmed, now 6.5 cm and laboratory tests were performed on 4 FEB, but there was at that time no elevation in inflammatory markers. Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery consultations were obtained, but the consultants and the attending physician (who is an infectious disease physician by training) did not think that the crescendo-decrescendo symptoms could be explained by the pericardial cyst, which was likely an incidental finding. A milder cough may have preceded these events by up to a year, and this may possibly be related to the cyst. The heartburn, chest pain, tachycardia, diaphoresis, palpitations, and near syncope may well be adverse reactions of the vaccine.

Patient declined referral, leaning towards not getting the second dose.

I moved on to the next two cars and on the third car and about three minutes after his female partener called out for help and said that the Pt. passed out. Thats when the other nurse ran to the car to check on him and told me he was having a seizure. I ran to the lead to explain what happend and to call the medical team right away. The other nure was stablizing the patient. The patient was going in and out of consciousness for about ten seconds. The medical team arrived and took vitals.

                                                Patient became syncopal approximately 2 minutes after vaccine.  Emergency services staff flagged down to assist patient.  The event I am recording this from states patient had &#34;seizure activity&#34;, but given the short duration and quick resolution, suspect this was muscular activity and not neurologic.  Patient refused any sort of follow-up care afterwards.

The patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement. The patient was out of it for 15-30 seconds. The reporter stated that she called 911. The patient came to, his eyes were huge, but he was aware to self and surroundings. The emergency team came, took the patient&#39;s vitals which were stable and stated the patient likely experienced a vasovagal effect from the needle. However, the reporter thinks it was a potential seizure; more than a vasovagal response. Emergency team offered no treatment. The emergency team had encouraged the patient to follow up with a doctor but the patient did not want to make a big scene.  Emergency team offered no treatment for the patient.

EVERYTHING WAS FINE, PATIENT DIDN&#39;T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS/CONCERNS. I SAID I WILL CHECK ON HIM IN A FEW MINUTES. WITHIN MAYBE 1-2 MINUTES, HIS WIFE CAME TO THE COUNTER AND SAID HE IS OUT, PASSED OUT.  I WENT TO CHECK ON HIM. YELLED TO MY TECH TO CALL 911. PATIENT WAS SLUMPED OVER IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS BREATHING AND HAD A PULSE, BUT NOT AWAKE. TRIED TO AROUSE HIM BE CALLING HIS NAME AND SHAKING HIS ARM TO WAKE HIM. HIS WIFE THEN WAS TAPPING THE SIDE OF HIS FACE TO WAKE HIM UP. SKIN WAS GRAY IN COLOR. SHE STATED HE IS GOING TO VOMIT AS HE WAKES UP AND NEEDED A GARBAGE CAN. I WENT TO GRAB CAN FROM PHARMACY AND RETURNED. SHE PUT CAN IN BETWEEN HIS LEGS AS HE CAME TO AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO VOMIT. HE WAS AWAKE BUT OUT OF SORTS.  AT THAT TIME THE EMT ARRIVED AND WENT TO WORK. PATIENT BP WAS LOW AND THEY STARTED IV FLUIDS. THE PATIENT WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO EMT AND ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS. THEY PREPPED HIM FOR TRANSPORT TO THE EMERGENCY DEPT FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. BY THE TIME THE PATIENT WAS BEING TRANSPORTED, HIS BP WAS BACK UP CLOSE TO NORMAL.  I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PATIENT AND HIS WIFE AROUND 5PM THAT DAY. THEY WERE LEAVING THE HOSPITAL AT THAT TIME. THE PATIENT WAS FEELING MUCH BETTER. HIS BP WAS BACK TO NORMAL, HIS COLOR WAS BACK, AND HIS VOICE WAS STRONG. THEY BOTH PLAN ON RETURNING FOR THE COVID 19 DOSE #2.

Immediately that evening I began to feel symptoms of fatigue. This grew into an overall feeling of sickness and 3 days later, I had major brain fog. This then developed into high anxiety.  However after about day 6 I felt normal again. Then 20 days later, I am feeling the same symptoms again. My armpit is swollen and having brain fog and anxiety.

                                                Severe middle back pain beginning February 21. Initially thought it was a kidney stone, but a visit to a urologist on February 25, determined it wasn&#39;t a kidney stone. The urologist ordered some blood work and that indicated that I most likely had blood clots. Went to the ER on the 25th and had further tests that determined that I indeed did have blood clots in my lungs.

                                                @ 3-5 min... arm started feeling a little sore, like a dead arm. That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

                                                6 hours  after, I started experiencing  persistent traveling muscle aches?from my chest, to abs, to left arm.  12 hours after, I had extreme fatigue, headache, mild nausea, along with full-body muscle soreness. 36 hours after, the initial symptoms eased and eventually disappeared, but then I started having shortness of breath/chest tightness whenever I would become mildly active (casual walk for less than 10 mins) or if I was wearing a mask or taking a shower. The chest tightness would persist after these events for roughly 30 mins. This activity-related chest tightness  continued to occur until the 5th day after the shot.
