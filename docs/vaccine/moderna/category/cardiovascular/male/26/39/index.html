                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

He was transferred from a chair to a nearby cot with feet elevated. The ER was notified and an EpiPen was on standby. Vital signs were: BP 155/69, O2 saturation 100%, and HR 125. Vitals were rechecked 5 min later and HR came down to 76. Dizziness still persisted and he complained of his hands feeling weak but grip strength was noted to be equal bilaterally. There was no indication for EpiPen so it was not used. Patient preference was to be transported to the ER for additional follow-up. In the ER vital signs continued to be monitored and patient was given 1 liter sodium chloride 0.9% fluid bolus after which the patient reported feeling much better. Patient was discharged from the ER.

                                                So later that evening around 9:30pm I started with Chills, and a low grade fever lots of body ache and head ache, to the point I did not get much sleep the night of. It lasted the whole next day. But later in the evening of the next day I think to me the most concerning side effect was I started getting some chest pain as if I pulled a muscle around my chest or what not. And it has continued into the next day as well which is now 2 days after second dose of vaccine.

On 2/12/2021 and into the morning of 2/13/2021 I developed a persistent aching chest pain - Saturday morning (2/13/2021) I went to convenient urgent care in for a quick once-over including vitals and an EKG. The EKG showed ST elevations, and I was taken via ambulance to the hospital emergency room. With blood lab value analysis and an echocardiogram performed, the hospitalist and cardiologist determined the diagnosis to be peri myocarditis. I was admitted to the hospital for 24 hours of observation and was released on 2/14/2021.

                                                Beginning 3/19/21, experienced over 16 significant nose bleeds (right nostril only) until 3/22/21. Blood flow out of nose was extremely pronounced; looked as if something had cut an artery. The blood was not slowly trickling down, it was pouring out of the nose.  does have Severe Hemophilia B (which was check marked on the registration form) so he is very prone to nosebleeds. However, the severity of rate of bleeding and the significant number of bleeds in a 4 day period was extremely unusual.  Also, it took a very long time to stop the bleeds. I had to pinch the nose extremely hard for 35 minutes to stop each bleed.

                                                I woke up at 3 A.M. the following morning with a bad migraine and dry mouth. I was also very nauseous so I went to my kitchen to have a glass of water. On the way back to the bedroom I felt my blood pressure bottom out and lost consciousness briefly and regained consciousness lying on the floor and my wife helping me up. I was able to make it to the bathroom and lay against the toilet because I thought I was going to throw up. I had that same feeling of my blood pressure dropping and again lost consciousness and regained consciousness with my head laying on the toilet seat. I also had sever chills and body aches, particularly in the neck area. I also struggled talking and communicating with my wife. She tells me I wasn?t making sense and my words were slurred.

                                                Patient reported to immunizing technician before administration of vaccine that he had a history of fainting post-vaccination due to anxiety and nerve about needles. Pt stated that previously he had fainted immediately post-vaccination. After discussing patient&#39;s medical history the supervising pharmacist advised pt to stay in vaccination seat for direct observation for 10-15min. After about 10 minutes post-vaccination in observation period the pt alerted immunizing tech, &#34;oh, its happening.&#34; The tech brought a wet paper towel and placed it on the back of patient&#39;s neck and pt replied, &#34;oh, that feels good&#34;, then patient&#39;s head immediately dropped and he went out of consciousness. Pharmacist witnessed event and rushed over to support patient from falling off chair. Pharmacist was rubbing and patting patients back and chest, yelling his name to arouse him. Pharmacist directed tech to call code white and alert store manager. In total, the patient was approximately in and out of consciousness about 20 seconds. Pt responded to stimulus and recovered without other effects or injury. Patient was fully responsive and aware of event went he became conscious again. We offered him a cold water bottle and encouraged him to remove mask if it helped him to breath better. Pt was able to communicate with pharmacist about the sensations he had leading to the event where he described first tingling in his feet, than dissociation from body, where he felt like he was having a dream but could hear someone yelling at him. EMS arrived at the scene and performed vital check. Based on patient abnormal hypertension at scene and higher BMI, EMS offered to transport patient to the ED for further tests and observation but patient declined. Patient was accompanied by his emergency contact, his father (who also witnessed the events unfold).

                                                Written by Doctor: April 7, 2021 2:09 p.m. DOB 2/07/1995, male, received his second dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot 019B21A) at 1:13 p.m.  He stood up and walked to the usher?s table to have his vaccine card completed.  Approximately one minute after receiving his vaccine, he had a syncopal episode falling directly backwards striking his head on the floor.  I, MD did not directly witness the fall, but everyone who witnessed the fall said that he fell completely unimpeded to the floor.  I was notified and immediately assisted the patient who was with his girlfriend.  Patient initially appeared ?out?, but almost immediately opened his eyes and asked what happened.  His skin was cool and clammy.  A pulse oximeter was placed on his finger registering 98% o2 and a pulse of 53.  I kept him lying on the floor until he was completely awake and aware of his surroundings.  At the time he said his neck was not sore, but his head was sore.  Approximately 2-3 minutes later, we were able to assist him in standing to immediately sit down in a wheelchair.  He was taken to the cot in the hallway just outside the Medical Observation where I was able to help him to stand and then lie down.  An icepack was provided to put on the back of his head, he was provided water, Gatorade, and two cookies.  Patient said that he hadn?t eaten all day and had been feeling slightly hungry prior to his vaccination.  I had patient move all extremities and asked his questions to verify that he was full awake and oriented to person, place, and time.  Patient girlfriend  stayed with patient while he ate his cookies.  I addressed my concerns about patient striking his head on the floor and the possibility of a closed head injury.  Girlfriend felt that patient was now completely back to his normal state of mind.  I had patient remain lying down for 20 minutes.  When I returned to check on him, he was sitting up and wanted to leave.  I told him that he needed to be able to walk up and down the hallway before I would feel comfortable letting him leave.  He stood up and walked halfway down the hallway before saying he was lightheaded.  I immediately went to him to lead him back to the cot, but he insisted that he needed to use the bathroom to urinate.  Both girlfriend and I stood in the doorway to assist patient if he needed, but he was able to finish urinating, then returned and sat in the wheelchair.  I spoke to both Doctors via a phone call and had spoken to someone earlier.  After letting them know that patient did not want an ambulance called, but I was going to strongly recommend he go to the nearest ER before returning home, I returned to the patient.  Vital signs at 1:53 were Pulse Ox of 98%, pulse 78, and blood pressure sitting of 140/75.  Again, I strongly recommended that girlfriend drive him to an ED for an evaluation and possible cat scan.  Patient also now had some paracervical neck pain which I also said should be evaluated.  Patient and girlfriend both insisted they didn?t want an ambulance called and girlfriend felt comfortable taking patient out of the clinic.  Patient said he was hungry, and they were going to get food first.  Girlfriend gave me her phone number (xxx)xxx-xxxx and I gave her my phone number (xxx-xxx-xxxx).  I told her I was going to call her every hour to check on patient and told her to call me at any time.  I recommended acetaminophen for the headache and other vaccine symptoms but no ibuprofen because of the possible head injury.  I recommended to immediately call an ambulance or go to an ED for nausea, worsening headache, confusion, or drowsiness.  Girlfriend is not to let patient sleep longer than 30 minutes at a time.  Patient was able to walk out of the clinic easily under his own power without any assistance.  He stated he was feeling much better.

                                                Patient noted on form that he had a severe reaction to peanuts which causes him to have anaphylaxis.  He stated that he does carry an EpiPen and any time anything with peanuts touches his mouth/lips he immediately notices his throat starting to close.  He also is allergic to cats.  Before administering the vaccine, the patient noted that he does not like needles and was not going to look.  I administered the vaccine and the patient and I exited the vaccination room.  I explained that he should sit in the waiting area for about 30 minutes due to his severe allergic reaction in the past.  By the time that I walked back into the pharmacy, the patient&#39;s wife shouted &#34;He&#39;s not breathing!&#34;.  My technicians called 911 while I grabbed an EpiPen and rushed to the patient.  I immediately administered a 0.3 mg dose of epinephrine and observed that the patient had passed out, was not breathing, but had a pulse.  A few seconds later he regained consciousness and his breathing was erratic.  I gave him water and he stated that he felt very lightheaded and dizzy.  I instructed him to remain seated.  He also noted that his vision was blurry and he saw a black dot.  His wife was fanning him to cool him down while I tried to obtain the patient&#39;s blood pressure, but could not get a reading.  The paramedics came and evaluated him thoroughly.  His blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, and blood sugar were all within normal limits.  They determined that the syncope was most likely due to the patient not eating during the day and not liking needles.  The patient was feeling much better and declined further medical treatment, including going to the hospital.  He was instructed to go home and relax.

                                                Patient received dose 1 of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately 5-10 minutes after administration, the patient&#39;s mother alerted me that the patient was feeling faint and sweaty. I came to check on the patient. He appeared pale and diaphoretic. Patient said his vision was narrowing and he subsequently lost consciousness for approximately 10-20 seconds. I checked the patient&#39;s blood pressure and initial result was 88/64. Upon regaining consciousness, patient reported immediately feeling better. His blood pressure was still low at 94/70. He remained seated and drank some cold water and a cool compress was applied to his forehead. I questioned the patient to determine if he was experiencing any other symptoms that may indicate anaphylaxis (skin itchiness, tight throat, stomach upset) and he denied any other symptoms. I continued to monitor the patient for approximately 30 minutes. During monitoring, the patient told me he is nervous of needles, and has fainted trying to give blood in the past. After 30 minutes of monitoring, diaphoresis had resolved, color returned to patient&#39;s face, blood pressure recheck was 116/84, and patient self-reported feeling fine. He was escorted home by his mother.

Once the father notified me and I arrived to check on the patient he was conscious, breathing normally and stood right back up to sit back down on his designated seat.  His father explained that this does occur when he receives vaccinations.  After 20 minutes the patient did leave the pharmacy with no complications.  We called 911 but they did not arrive since the patient was able to get off the ground with no complications.  Patient recieved the shot at 12:47pm and fainted on 12:49pm.  No treatment was administered

His wife called for the nurse practitioner in the office closest to their chairs.  The patient was cool and clammy, pale in color. The nurse checked his vital signs, applied a cool compress to the back of his neck, and fanned him with cool air. After a few minutes the patient&#39;s skin color returned to normal, his temperature improved and he was back to himself. He was advised to sit for an additional 30 minutes since the event so that the nurse and pharmacist could monitor him.

They immediately put me into a wheel chair but I wasn?t getting better until they laid me down in the stretcher. My lips turned blue and I think I was having an allergic reaction to the shot. It was hard for me to breathe before laying down on the stretcher my heart rate dropped and my blood pressure. It took me 30-40 min to come back to stand up and slowly walk out. My arm was super sore afterwards and I would have little shocking pain flashes in my chest. I felt tired and run down/ sensitive the rest of the night. The next day my arm was still super sore and I still feel very tired and run down.  The doctor on site took care of me and they put the stickers on me just in case they needed to revive me. I was sinking quickly but luckily when I laid down I got better.

                                                Starting the night after vaccination, had a rapid heartbeat, sweating, and anxiety that I have never experienced before. I did not sleep at all for about 7 days. After day 3 of no sleep, I sought treatment for the issue. I was prescribed Ambien to try to help me sleep. It did not help at all. Day 4 of no sleep I went to the ER where they ran blood tests and performed an EKG. All tests were normal. Day 7 of no sleep I was admitted to a behavioral health inpatient facility to help me sleep. I finally was able to sleep with the help of an antipsychotic drug. I was there for 4 days and then discharged. I left with a script for Remeron to help me sleep. Some days I have slept well and others not so much.

But then yesterday started to have similar symptoms, as well as chest pressure, hurts to breathe all the way in, feels a twinge feeling on the inside. Also noticed a muscular pain as well in the same area, hurts to move down the middle of his chest. Also having pain on the right side. Symptoms are persistent, will wax and wane slightly but doesn&#39;t go away completely. Feels better when he is standing if feels better, has not noticed food triggers, no difficulty eating or swallowing. A few weeks ago also started a higher fat intake diet. No fevers or chills, no diarrhea, no rash, no sore throat, no runny nose. No known muscular injury that he can think of.&#34; May 20, 2021-- &#34;Today is feeling some decrease in symptoms, but still feels like he needs to take deep breaths. Feels like &#34;something is erratic&#34; once in a while. Not feeling increased improvement. Laying down does seem to make it worse. One time he was leaning forward and then sitting up made it worse.&#34; May 26, 2021 -- &#34;he reports that he is still feeling some chest pain, but overall is feeling better, symptoms are up and down. Feels like a &#34;tiredness&#34; in the chest wall area. The most pain is from twisting. Not worsening with acidic or greasy foods. Feels like pain is mostly in the muscle now. No SOB at all with increased exertion.&#34;

We rushed to him and called out for him.  He opened his eyes and slowly told us that he thinks he fainted.  I helped him elevated both legs on the chair and talked to him if he&#39;s hurt or any other weird feeling.  He told me he&#39;s feeling fine again.   I have him lay down with his legs elevated for another 5 minutes and helped him sit up.  He was able to get up by himself and sat back on the chair.  A couple minutes later, I took his blood pressure and it was 129/85 and pulse was 61.

Patient states that he was at the ER for approximately 2 hours, and then discharged. While at the ER, he received IV fluids and blood work was performed. He has not had any other complications besides a sore arm at the site of injection.

After 5-7 minutes patient lifted his arm getting our attention. Came out to patient were he said his vision was getting very blurry. Said he could not read the sign 6 feet in front of him. I touched his shoulder as a precaution and asked if he could see me. He stated yes and proceeded to put his head back and take down his mask and close his eyes. I asked pharmacy staff to call a code. His forehead and back of his neck were visibly wet from sweating. He moved his head forward and hung it down for 3 seconds before lifting it saying his vision was back. I asked if he had any blurriness or faintness still and he verbally said no. I asked if I could get some water for him and he said yes. I also gave him a granola bar and he said that it helped a lot. We also brought paper towel for his forehead and neck. He then stated that he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. He felt embarrassed that we had to call a code and get more people involved. His color came back 3-5 minutes after he initially lifted his head and said his vision was back. Pharmacy made pt sit another 15 minutes after his color came back. Watched patient stand up after the 15 minutes and pt said he felt good. Told patient we would be sending reports about what happened and if it was okay with him to provide his information to be contacted if needed, he agreed.

The last thing I remember was the feeling of falling forward. I woke up sometime between 10 seconds to 2 minutes later feeling exceptionally dizzy and tired. I?ve never had any event happen like this before and was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Today I am still feeling slightly dizzy and not quite right.

                                                What feels like anxiety attacks (Heart racing, Throat feels closed up) happen everyday usually. sometimes occur multiple times a day usually at night or late afternoon. After the first dose they started small and got bigger and more frequent after the second shot they have become smaller and a little less frequent but still occur. I should note that I used to have anxiety attacks 5 or so years ago just like this but have since stopped having attacks all together up until my first shot

CT pulmonary embolus protocol showed subsegmental pulmonary embolus with evidence of pulmonary infarcts for which the patient was started on an anticoagulant. An echocardiogram showed a mild to moderate decrease in LV systolic function with global hypokinesis.  Cardiac MRI findings were consistent with acute myopericarditis with underlying non-ischemic cardiomyopathy disproportionate to the degree of myocarditis. The patient was discharged on a beta-blocker.

                                                I woke up feeling a slight pain on my left side of my chest near my heart. When I breathed in too heavily, I experienced that pain. Throughout the day, it continued and slowly got worse. As of now, I can feel that there is a slight discomfort at rest and I am unable to inhale too deeply or laugh without having that pain return. I don&#39;t think it could be a result from anything else, as I wasn&#39;t sick recently and do not have any conditions or take any medications. I&#39;m waiting to see if it continues through the night into tomorrow to schedule a doctor&#39;s appointment.

Heart rate reached 170 bpm, tracked by my apple watch. Went to the ER. I was diagnosed with sepsis. Fever was 102.7, HR wouldn&#39;t drop below 105bpm. Procalcitonin and lactic acid were all elevated. I was given 5 liters of fluids that night. Was then started on Vancomycin and cefepime the following morning. I was in the hospital for 2 nights.

                                                The flu like symptoms dissipated very quickly. I was sent to the Foot Hill Presbyterian ER after a trip to urgent care. They took an X-ray and blood work. They ruled out myocarditis. I think my heart was elevated for 2 days after that. It would skyrocket for 120-130bpm. My heart rate would respond oddly depending on sitting down or laying down. No stimuli and it would still be odd numbers. I was getting weird readings each time I looked up my heart rate. I thought it was normalizing. I have been getting these tachycardia heartbeats as I am sitting down. It will be up to 120bpm after 2 hours. Now it stays at 90-100 bpm and palpitations keep happening. Sometimes when I get up, it will start skyrocketing. My BP jumped to 150/120 and my ER doctor prescribed me beta blockers (metoprolol 25mg). I am scheduled to see a cardiologist on Monday. I have had multiple EKG readings. I have noticed a strange cycle pattern for the past few days and no reason for it. It&#39;s almost like its playing its own beat.

Symptoms included dizziness, near syncope, palpitations, and shortness of breath. After 2 ED visits, I was referred to a cardiologist who ran tests to include a Holter monitor, and echocardiogram. I followed up with a Cardiac Electrophysiology Doctor who prescribed Flecainide to control the PVC&#39;s. I have been on Flecainide since early March, which has controlled the PVC&#39;s to a tolerable level (roughly 100/day). Before the Flecainide use, I was having roughly 1,000 PVC&#39;s a day, and had multiple episodes of Bigeminy.

                                                Following administration of the vaccine, the patient and his wife were seated and I requested they remain seated for 15 min after because I had recently had someone with a fear of needles collapse after their shot, at which point I had already counseled on the things to expect afterward but the patient stopped responding and slumped over. I was unsure if he was breathing as his wife was cradling his head, so I shouted for a technician to call 911. I heard a sound that I perceived to be wheezing and administered an epipen at which point the patients limbs began to contract so I then suspected it was a seizure. We lowered the patient to the ground and shortly after he became responsive. He was able to state his name and date of birth and breathing was unlabored. Pulse ox was 98 and HR was 88 BPM before  EMS arrived. They examined the patient and determined it was &#34;anxiety induced response&#34; but also noted that the bloodpressure was &#34;very low&#34; which is consistent with anaphylaxis, but I did not examine the patient at that time. He was sent home afterward.

Rash started in chest/upper torso and progressed to bilateral arms, back, upper buttocks, and thighs. Rash feels like a sunburn in that it makes the subject feel warm. Rash is blanchable and fully pinpoint-macular, no papules or plaques.   At approx. 36 hours post-vaccine, the rash had spread down both arms and up the neck, sparing the face. The rash gets intensely pruritic when scratched or itched. There is no pain, shortness of breath, altered mental status, or other compromise of the subject&#39;s health or well-being.

                                                Patient was given a covid vaccine on 3/4/21 at approximately 5:40pm.  The administration went well according to the patient.  After approximately 10 minutes, while the patient was sitting in the post vaccination area, he appeared to be pale looking to the imx RPh.  The pharmacist asked him how he was doing, he replied &#34;I am doing so-so&#34;.  The RPh got up to check on him further when the patient fell to the floor.  The RPh rolled him on his back, got him in a comfortable position,  and elevated his legs.  RPh applied gauze to a cut in his lip, and with the immediate assistance of the health screener, applied cold compress to his neck and forehead.  Patient experienced faintness and sweaty skin only.  Patient did not show any other symptoms.  After about15 minutes, patient said he felt like himself again, and wanted to sit up in a chair.  The RPh assisted him into a chair, where he sat for 5 minutes.  At the request of the patient, he wanted to go home.  RPh escorted patient to his car and watched him get inside safely.  1 hour later, RPh followed up with a phone call to the patient and he was on his way to an urgent care clinic to get a possible stitch for his lip.

His face was slightly red on one side.  The patient stated he was breathing normally, but wasn&#39;t sure if it was an allergic reaction.  As a precaution I offered 50 mg of diphenhydramine to the patient, and he accepted and took it by mouth.  I offered to call paramedics, patient refused.  I observed the patient for 20 min more, and at the end of the 20 min the patient felt better and went home.

He as sweating profusely and had vision loss. He was sitting while this all happened which I think prevented him from fainting. I got him water, an ice pack and called ems. By the time EMS arrived the patient was starting to feel better. EMS did their evaluation on site and the patient was able to go home 20 minutes later.

                                                1 minute after administration of vaccine, patient lost consciousness and fell from chair striking the right side of head on pavement. He was rolled from prone, assessed and had a pulse but initially was not breathing. 911 called Within 10 second, had spontaneous return of respirations, consciousness and was oriented to person, place, time. Sustained an abrasion to his head, complaints of mild HA, no neck pain or signs of cervical injury or other trauma. Vitals monitored. Given fluids, juice. Assessed by paramedics and refused transport to ED for further evaluation. Given ice and called a friend for a ride home. Observed for nearly 1 hour after LOC and had returned to baseline mentation. Advised to call 911 or go to ED if worsening of HA, vision changes, confusion, falls, nausea, vomiting due to concerns for head trauma. Assessment is that this was likely a vasovagal episode and patient reported similar experience with immunization in past, in retrospect. Discussed that this is not a contraindication for 2nd dose but that he should be sure he is well hydrated and advise healthcare providers of history of vasovagal with first dose. The county will work with him to schedule 2nd dose at a health clinic attended by EMS (on site).

I also noticed a sudden pain in my chest around noon on 5/1/21 that felt like someone had punched my sternum and bruised it. That has also not gone away yet. It hurts to put any pressure on my palms or lift anything heavy.

                                                Patient has history of passing out when getting blood drawn. As patient was standing to get vaccination card filled out, he told associate to call RPH that he wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ran out to give my attention and patient was sweating and looked dizzy. His eyes started to shut while he was standing and as I was holding his arm and back to support him he started to fall to the ground. Patient gently went to the ground, I pushed him over to one side and he was out for about 3 seconds and woke back up. Patient was very hot and sweaty. He wanted to move to a more private area so I made an area with a privacy panel available to him. Patient stated to me that he has no history of seizure, but suffers from mild anxiety. Myself or one of the associates was with him for approximately 45 minutes just to make sure he was ok. His blood pressure was taken (twice) and water was given. His BP readings were normal. Patient was on his way. Moderna series completed.

                                                Patient called out reporting that he had fainted/blacked out while sitting in chair across from the pharmacy counter. The patient was sitting with legs were stretched out and his head was laying back on a shelf that was immediately behind the chair he was in.  I immediately went out to converse with the patient. I called for someone to bring him a cool drink and gave him a cool compress for his forehead. He pulled his mask down below is nose to breathe more freely. While he was drinking the pineapple drink I asked if this had ever happened before while receiving a vaccine or during a blood draw. He said never as an adult but as a child he did have fainting spells. When asked if he had eaten at all during the morning or afternoon he reported he had not but had only drank water and coffee. After about 10-15 minutes he started to feel better. I asked if I could call someone to drive him home, he said he was fine and when he went to get up to go he reported that his arms were tingling. I asked his permission to call 911 so he could be evaluated in the ER. He agreed. 911 was dispatched. Paramedics took his blood pressure and found his diastolic pressure to be 100. He was asked if he had been diagnosed with HTN or if he was taking any medications to treat it. He denied. They suggested that he be taken to the ER to which he declined to go. The paramedics escorted him out of the store at approximately 2:15pm.

I was able to stop the bleed without medication but it continued into the night. I woke up choking on blood. Went to the ER, they could not find the source of the bleed. There was a total of 7 nosebleeds within approximately a 10-hour window. I do not have any history, or suffer from nosebleeds, high blood pressure, etc. At the ER, I ended-up with a rocket pack in the left nostril, which stopped the bleeding. I was referred to a specialist. Upon seeing a specialist the following day (or day after receiving the vaccine), the specialist was also unable to find the bleed and cauterized a small bleed they believe was due to the trauma of the rocket pack. I was given medical nasal spray. I was told to see what happened and respond as necessary.

                                                Starting at about 5pm on the day of vaccination, I experienced intense but expected side effects including full body muscle ache, fever, drowsiness, cold sweats, joint pain. These symptoms lasted for about 24hrs before subsiding completely by that Tuesday evening. On Thursday, 5/13, I woke up with moderate tightness in my chest that progressed over the course of 45 minutes to be severe chest pain. At that point, my wife drove me to the ER in  where I was checked in at about 8:30am. By the time I was checked in the chest pain had subsided to be just a slight discomfort, overall the chest pain had lasted for approximately 2 hours. At the ER my bloodwork was done and the initial blood samples returned an elevated Troponin I level of 5.04 ng/ml. While at the ER at the  I experienced one more incident of chest pain which lasted roughly 30 minutes and was moderately low on the pain scale. I was given multiple EKGs, X-rays, and Echocardiograms, all of which showed no abnormalities. Repeated troponin tests however showed an increase in my levels over the course of the day from 5 up to 12.6 and 13. I was placed on a heparin drip in the afternoon. By doctor recommendation I was air-lifted to later that night at 10:30pm so that further scans and a possible cardiac catheterization and CT scans. The following day, Friday, at 1am at my bloodwork was taken and troponin levels had increased to 14. I was scheduled for a CT scan, cardiac MRI, and echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis of Myocarditis. By Saturday afternoon I was taken off of the heparin drip and told that they would not be able to perform any of the scheduled tests until Monday at the earliest. My most recent troponin level came back as a 9. At this point I decided to check myself out of  against medical advice since they were not able to run the necessary scans and my wife and I do not live in . I returned home to and followed up on 5/19 with a doctor at the ER at  since I was unable to find any available appointments with any cardiologists in the area for the next few weeks. My troponin levels and EKG taken at came back as normal, so I continue to follow doctor advice of bedrest and no alcohol for the next 4-6 weeks. My pulse is still elevated (roughly 85 bpm resting when it used to be at &lt;65 bpm resting) and seems to easily increase with even moderate activity such as walking in the house up to over 100 bpm.

                                                Woke up at 3:00 AM Friday 5/24 having chest pain near my heart and issues breathing. I sat up on the corner of my bed feeling dizzy. Every time I would take anything more than a light breath, I would get a tight pain on the left side of my chest, which specifically felt like I had blockage in my heart. As I sat on the corner of my bed I tried to control my breathing and started to rub the area as I was taking breaths. The sharp pain in my chest while taking normal / deep breaths lasted for a few minutes and I feared I was having a heart attack. After going away initially that night, I felt the sensation  in a less intense fashion again later on Friday night and once more got a slight tight feeling in my chest while breathing on Saturday. During the initial episode on Friday night, I also got a deafened noise in my ears as if they had to pop as if I was gaining altitude in a plane or something. I got up off my bed to go to the bathroom and sat to urinate in case I was going to faint. The deafened noise went away after about a minute or so and turned into a static / fizzy noise for another minute or two while I was in the bathroom.  (The static fizz sounds got louder as I put my chin to my chest for some reason.) I was also sweating profusely throughout this entire process.

It felt like I could only breath in for about a second and a half without a lot of strain or coughing. It is now 10:41 AM and I still have a heavy chest and shortness of breath but it is much more manageable than before. I still can&#39;t take a full breath, but I can breath in for about 5 seconds before it feels like something is blocking me from going further. No current pain.

He went to purchase a water about 5 minutes after vaccine in a different register and was feeling lightheaded. After the transaction he fainted with the back of his head fell on the hard floor. He was being assisted by the store staff as well as a pedestrian who claimed to be a health care professional. He was given an orange juice, one water and a battery powered fan to provide cool air. He also requested to lay down on the floor, and he ended up laying on the floor for about 30 minutes. After that he stood up and regained color on his face. He then walked out of the store. Staff asked him if he wanted the ambulance to be called and he declined.   Pharmacist called patient the next day to check on patient, and was unable to reach the patient.

I chalked it up to the side effects, until i went mountain biking and had to turn around after there was so much resistance and pressure in my chest. I&#39;m glad I turned around when I did. It continued to be a deep constant pressure for over a week after the shot. Eventually the pressure subsided but I also didn&#39;t do any physical activities after the mountain biking experience.  As i tld the Dr.s this same story they told me I should have gone to the emergency room... Of course I didn&#39;t know, so I went about my life just reducing physical activity. I went in for my second shot today and was informed of the new possible linkage between myocarditis and vaccines. What the Dr.&#39;s described (I had two in the room this time because of the way I reacted to the first shot) was exactly what I felt after the first shot. If I was having the same symptoms, as recently discovered, but only after the first one, I wasn&#39;t going to try and find out if I would die from this second one or how much worse the inflammation would be.  I will disclose, pertinent or not, that I am a small individual at 5&#39;7, 120.

                                                From May 14, 2021, I have started experience dizziness and weakness in my body. There has been slight fever during the initial days but the weakness and mild headache is still there till today i.e. June 9 2021. I do experience a little shortness of breath and chest pain (on both sides) sometimes but that is not continuous and remains normal most of the time. I have got stomach infection and constipation too during these times and I have taken a pill of Prilosec upon prescription of doctor. Stomach looks good and bowel movement is fine as of now. I have been monitoring my blood pressure and body temp during these days and they all were normal.    Apart from that I experience chills more than anyone around me and don&#39;t know if that is related to vaccine effect.  Currently, my main concerns are - mild headache, weakness in body and dizziness which is happening for almost a month now.

On the night of May 20, I started feeling chest pains, difficulty breathing, and an elevated heart rate (around 100 bpm) in bed. These symptoms remained and I went to the emergency room around midnight. I did a chest xray and electrocardiogram and waited to see a doctor over the next few hours; ultimately the symptoms decreased in severity on their own.

Went back to work on 6/22/21 and felt fine until around 12AM when chest started hurting again. Have not taken second dose of vaccine due to symptoms. Went to 3 doctors and only one believes me when i say it is because of the vaccine. Have not been able to help or give advice with symptoms aside from the medication I am currently taking.

                                                Patient is a 27 year old male with history of allergic rhinitis.  He moved to the area in April 2021 and had some initial problems with pollen allergies, but had improved and doing well with Singulair.  He had COVID19 in November 2020, recovered fairly quickly and did not have much in the way of breathing difficulties.  Last month he received both doses of Moderna COVID19 vaccination, second dose administered on 5/25/2021.  After his second dose, he has become progressively more ill.  He did have a fever up to 105F for 24 hours afterwards, but this resolved. He has gone to several urgent cares due to progressively worsening SOB, cough, and malaise.  Coworkers have commented to him that he is just not himself and is slow to get around.  He has gotten to the point he cannot take the trash out without having to stop to catch his breath.

I lost tolerance to caffeine and alcohol, and the symptoms got worse. I ended up in the er on June 7th and tested positive for blood troponin. I was diagnosed with myopericarditis secondary to covid vaccine or a viral infection after further tests and an echocardiogram. I am receiving 600mg of ibuprofen three times per day along with  .6mg of colchinine twice a day for the next few months.

Loss of vision lasted for 1 minute.  Loss of vision occurred while standing.  Referral to primary care and ophthalmology specialist found normal eye exam and MRI of orbits but  presence of tachycardia especially while standing (fluctuations between 60 beats at rest/laying down to 130 beats per minute standing).   Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)  is suspected.  Currently pursuing cardiac workup with cardiologist and Covid POTS specialist.  POTS specialist believes autoantibody development after vaccination could be suspected as recovering covid patients similarly present to clinic with POTS like symptoms.

He did drink some water and felt better. He thought he may have been dehydrated , anxious about the shot, and concerned when reading the shot info.  He has had flu shots in the past but  has not been  to a doctor in recent memory. The paramedics checked him and offered him a ride to the hospital . His vitals were fine so they released him to his girlfriend who was able to drive.

While at the register, he stopped talking and went flat back hitting the back of his head.  He was twitching slightly on the ground while unconscious for no more than 30 seconds.  911 was called, the AED was being retrieved and management on-site was notified.  The patient quickly regained consciousness as RPH was assessing for anaphylaxis protocol.  He was responsive, aware and coherent but groggy and repeatedly rubbed the back of his head.  At this point store manager stayed with patient while waiting on EMS.  Blood pressure was normal but low per EMS.  Patient did admit to recreational marijuana use prior to shot.  He denied further medical assistance.

I offered him water and he accepted stated he was ok. 15 minutes after receiving  his vaccine the patient started to feel dizzy and raised his arm to alert me. I went to his side and asked if he was ok and he stated that &#34;it&#39;s happening&#34;. His head started to fall back and body started to slump to the side. I supported his head and called for the other pharmacist who came over and we were able successfully  get the patient to the floor in the  supine position. I left the patient with the other pharmacist and called 911. By the time I came back he was awake and talking . He remained in the supine position until the medic came and took vitals. We had him sit up and within a few minutes back into his chair where I remained with him until his wife arrived.  I gave him a water and approximately 1 hour after the incident the patient left with his wife.

                                                Just after midnight, I was watching TV with my brother after smoking a medical pre-roll (I&#39;m a medical marijuana patient). Shortly after, I began feeling dizzy. I finished my glass of water and the dizziness subsided for roughly ten minutes, before returning even worse than before.  I went to get more water and after filling my glass and closing the refrigerator, I was barely able to walk the few steps from my kitchen to the living room to lie down on the couch.  At this time, my chest started feeling tight, and I had a light tingling sensation in my feet and lower body.  When I closed my eyes, the dizziness got worse, and laying in certain positions made the tightness in my upper chest become painful. I continued to drink water and ate a little, but the episode lasted between 30-60 minutes of mild discomfort ranging to a decent amount of pain. There was a moment when I had considered going to the hospital, but after eating, drinking, and doing some controlled breathing, the pain lessened I ended up falling asleep on the couch.  I woke up feeling considerably better, but decided to call out of work so I wouldn&#39;t do any strenuous activity. On occassion I still feel like there&#39;s a little bit of pressure or tightness in my upper chest,  but nothing painful or debilitating like the night of the incident

By that evening, I felt the usual symptoms of fever, body ache and chills, which continued for the next 48 hours. By Sunday, 05/23, I was feeling back to normal and in good health. The next morning, Monday, 05/24, I woke up with chest pain, a crushing pain by my heart and I went to the ER. An EKG was taken, and the cardiologist mentioned that it was abnormal and that a catheter angiogram needed to be done to check the arteries. That was followed by and ECG and a MRI and a stay at the hospital overnight. Next morning, the cardiologist told me that I have myocarditis caused by the vaccine and the inflammation is at the tip of the heart. I am currently on medication over the course of the next month, till my follow up visit with the cardiologist.

                                                Started the day great and went and got the 2nd dose of Moderna on 6/12/21 at 940am. I felt fine throughout the day and I started getting a little dizzy and disoriented around 5pm  and as it was explained to me it would be expected to get side effects. Later in the evening around 8pm I started to get extremely dizzy, tired, and having a low grade fever of 100.5F. I Later developed a headache and I had to go lie down for the rest of the night. As I was sleeping throughout the night and waking up multiple times shivering and being extremely cold, I was taking my temperature throughout the night and It would be climbing up from 100.5F and it reached 103.7F. At that point I wanted to get up and take some fever reducer medicines but I was unable to get out of the bed as I was very dizzy and disoriented and I was having extreme muscle and joint pains that I wasnt unable to move at all. I needed to go to the restroom and get a drink and I was unable to do that.  I had considered going to the ER but I waited it out and wouldnt go unless my temperature kept rising. I eventually tried going to the bathroom but at that point I had passed out and woke up in the morning between my bedroom and bathroom. On sunday 6/13 I was continuing to have symptoms and felt extremely ill throughout the day.  I woke up and the fever had gone away but I still had the symptoms mentioned above and also had ringing in my ears. Throughout the day I was trying to do stuff around the house but I was unable to do that and go to work. I would randomly pass out at times either on my desk or just sitting on the couch. That was throughout sunday then on monday I was feeling a lot better almost all symptoms had gone away but I was still a bit dizzy and had body aches and was unable to go to work and do basic stuff around the house. Tuesday I was mostly feeling fine but still felt a bit dizzy and disoriented and extremely fatigued but I was able to go to work. Wednesday I am feeling almost 100% normal but I do get dizzy at times and I am still extremely fatigued.

The warning signs before passing out was an extreme headache the likes of which I?ve never experienced before.  I was then taken to Hospital where I stayed getting fluids, blood drawn, and other test to figure out what cause the incident.   Since my time at the hospital my chest (heart area) is always in pain. I can barely make down one city block before running completely out of breathe.   Yes I am overweight! However the only time I ever became out of breath before was when exercising . Now I feel that shortness of breathe all the time even when relaxing on a chair.

                                                On May 11 2021, I went to the gym to workout my back muscles in after work (around 3pm). After completing a heavy set of rack pulls I got light headed. After removing the weight to put it away, I accidentally dropped 25 pounds weight which was abnormal because I lost grip while light headed. I tried to walk off the pain by walking to the other side of the gym and within the next 10 minutes my face started turning pale and my lips dark blue/purple. I was sitting down as I progressively grew more light headed and started blacking out. My brother called over several people to help me maintain consciousness and an employee noted my lip and face color, low pulse and high rate of breathing. I fainted for a couple minutes then took a sip of gatorade and bounced back. I felt like that was a near death experience. Possibly related to some heart issue. A few weeks after I got a physical checkup at my doctor&#39;s office and the bloodwork came back clean. I have nothing to show why this episode occurred and feel like I should have some heart tests as a follow up.  Before this incident I have been going to the gym without ever having experienced this kind of issue. What was notably odd though is I started having some chest pains not too long after my 2nd vaccination that I originally attributed to a bad sleeping position (I sleep on my side). I would have tightness that at times were consistent. Overtime the pain got weaker as I stopped doing intensive workouts. I thought it could&#39;ve been a muscle tear but a tear would&#39;ve healed by now. I still experience a bit of tightness when I do heavy chest exercise or if I compress my chest muscles and squeeze in the middle.  I&#39;m submitting this report because its been recently identified myocarditis is a possible side affect of the vaccine.

After 5 to 10 minutes of waiting in the pharmacy the patient was lightheaded and dizziness. The patient passed out and fell over, hitting his head on the wall of the pharmacy. The patient was briefly shaking/convulsing per the mother for a few seconds until the patient woke up. The pharmacy staff rushed out to the patient&#39;s aid. The patient was confused when he woke up . We had him lay on the floor for a few minutes then helped him up to a chair to sit when he felt better.

The patient explained how he did not take any medications or has any health conditions. The patient refused medical attention and said he felt ok as we waited with him for 5 minutes. We recommended the patient to see a doctor if he as any symptoms. The patient waited for an extra 30 minutes and said he felt fine. The patient&#39;s mother and the patient left with the mother driving him home.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

I called 911 to ask for paramedics while the nurses from MinuteClinic checked up on the patient. After a few minutes, the patient&#39;s  alertness came back, his color returned to normal. When paramedics arrived, patient could verify his infomation and whereabout. He denied help from the paramedics.  Immunization pharmacist recommended him to be obsereved for at least 30 mins, and check in with the ER or primary care physician for check-up for any delayed response. Patient said he will follow up with his primary care physician.  After 30 mins, his wife came to get him.

By the evening, fever was severe and 102&#43;, with severe headache and sore throat. After sleeping on that nigh (had disruption of sleep from 2 - 4 in the morning), it was looking normal., just had usual fatigue after a fever. But on Thursday (Took vaccine on Tuesday morning, March 02, 2021), I suddenly started having a seizure, my whole body was shaking, legs were cramping. I thought it was going to go away, but after 10 minutes it was getting worse and I had to call the emergency services. The fire service members first came, they measured my blood oxygen level, it was 98%, but my blood pressure was high (140). I was still shaking and having the seizure. They tried to calm me down by talking, after some time, my blood pressure came to normal and I started getting normal (no seizure at that point). I declined the ambulance service as it is expensive and I was getting normal. I had a 101 fever just after that and went to visit the health care facilities .

Patient was given a cold cloth around the back of his neck and his blood pressure was taken and it was 82/58.  Patients O2 sat was 98 and pulse was 78. Patient stated that he was allergic to nuts. We asked if he had eaten breakfast this morning and he stated that he had a bowl of cereal. I instructed for someone to have him sit on the ground and to get him some candy  and a sugary drink.  A package of skittles was presented along with a Mountain Dew.  After finishing both the candy and Mountain Dew  (aprox 4 mins) the patient started to get a little color back and he stated he was feeling much better.  A second set of vitals was then taken which were  BP: 106/78 the O2 sat 98 and Heart rate was again at 78.  We instructed the patient to please hang around for 30 more minutes and after that time left with the person he was with.

When I came to about 10 seconds later, there was a public health official there rubbing my chest asking me if I knew where I was.  It took me a second to fully come to my senses but then I realized where I was and what had happened.  I was very pale, felt chills, was sweating, and it took effort to open my hands.  The EMTs ran a bunch of tests, my Blood pressure was low (I think the number I remember was 104/33), but the rest of the measurements like blood sugar or the number of ekg like tests they did all came back normal.  The EMTs in the field said they think it was a response to the vaccine.  After about 20 minutes of the EMTs monitoring me, my numbers came back up and I was feeling relatively normal.  I waited another 30 minutes before leaving just to make sure.  It has been almost a week and I haven&#39;t felt any symptoms close to that since then.

While waiting in line to make his appt, he stated to his mother (who had given him a ride and stayed with him) that he felt faint. His mother shouted to staff nearby that he was going to pass out, so a staff person grabbed a chair for him. He sat in the chair, but did not fully lose consciousness. I ran to him with , told someone to get an ice pack, and asked his mother to sit in a chair next to him and place her hand on his right arm. I checked his bp at this time and it was 58/30. He was shaking all over, diaphoretic, pale,  and his muscles were weak.  He asked for water, so one was given to him, and he promptly drank the whole 16 oz bottle.  Over approximately 5 min, he came back to his normal LOC, stopped shaking and sweating, and stated that he was feeling better.  He was given a small bag of crackers and another bottle of water, which he quickly consumed before standing up. At this point, he stated that he was feeling hung over after staying out late the evening before drinking and celebrating St. Patrick&#39;s Day. Instructed him to make sure he is well hydrated before he comes for his second dose vaccination.

He  states he was fine yesterday, but this morning has noticed body aches (not unusual with an immunization) and also labored breathing, vision changes, and a rapid heartrate (which could be related to allergy).  He states this has been going on intermittently this morning, and I recommended either getting in to his doctor, or discussing with a nurse.  I did let him know that Benadryl may help as well.  I called to notify his doctor.

                                                syncopal episode- 1:33 pm individual fell head-first off from chair in observation area and hit her head. I was called over by the observation person that someone needed attention right away. I ran over the individual was lying on the floor and her husband was sitting on a chair right next to her. He said she fainted and fell forward. The individual appeared to be unconscious when I arrived and was very diaphoretic. I loudly asked if she was okay and then tapped her chest. She looked up at me and said ?oh snap.? She was oriented to person and place and her pupils were equal, round, and reactive. She denied that she had any tingling in her arms or legs. She said she heard everyone talking to her, but thought she was dreaming. She said that she has a history of passing out with finger-pricks (she cannot donate blood anymore because of this), shots, and she passed out when she got a piercing in the past. She said she felt her HR slowly starting to climb, but she felt she would be okay. She said she then started feeling lightheaded and passed out. I took HR BP at  1:35 128/74, 62 and again 5 minutes later 128/80, 62. Individual was given an ice pack for her head. She had a bump on the upper right side of forehead. She said she had not eaten or drank much before her shot. She said her stomach was a little upset. She was given water and granola bars and sat up for a while before standing up. She asked if I thought she should get her head checked out. I said it is never a bad idea to get checked and since she did hit her head hard enough for a bump to happen right away. Individual was feeling better before she left, stating just her head hurt. We told her to ice and ibuprofen or Tylenol to treat discomfort.

                                                After receiving the COVID vaccine, the patient was instructed to have a sit in the clinic for 15 minutes in order to be monitored for any adverse reactions. Within that time period, the other patients in the waiting area reported to the staff that the patient has fainted. The patient woke up shortly after fainting. He was visibly pale but he confirmed that he is okay and not in distress (no difficulty breathing, etc). He reported that he&#39;s fainted before after a vaccination due to nerves. We gave him some water to drink and had him stay for another 30 minutes so we can monitor him closely. After 30 minutes, we determined that he&#39;s well enough to leave the store and no other further care was needed at the time.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient  is a 29 y.o.  with a history that includes # Asthma # Diabetes, recently diagnosed # Obstructive sleep apnea # Remote pulmonary embolism, no longer on anticoagulation who presented to the ED with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of known COVID-19, since admitted to Hospital for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 viral pneumonia. History herein is derived from patient interview and review of the electronic medical record. patient developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath approximately one week ago. These symptoms developed very shortly after he received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He initially attributed these symptoms to side effects of the vaccine. When they persisted, however, he called his primary care physician who recommended that he seek evaluation. He was evaluated at an urgent care on 3/30 where he tested positive for COVID-19. His shortness of breath progressed, and he presented to the ED on 3/31 for evaluation. CTPE was negative for PE but did demonstrate viral pneumonia. Ambulatory pulse oximetry was negative for desaturation. He was discharged home. Since discharge, his symptoms have continued to progress. He was planned to receive monoclonal antibody earlier today, 4/2, however when he presented for his infusion he was found to be hypoxic to 89% and tachycardic to 130s. He was sent to the ED for evaluation. He continues to have diaphoresis and chills although believes his fever has improved. He has some chest tightness with deep inspiration. He otherwise denies unusual headache, sore throat, productive cough, chest pressure, abdominal pain, flank pain, dysuria, and diarrhea. He reports that his PE was provoked by obesity and a lengthy plane flight in 2017. He was on anticoagulation for 8 months and has since been off.  On arrival to ED, VS AF, HR 122, RR 30s, BP 120/90, SpO2 97% on RA. He was in significant respiratory distress and was therefore placed on HHFNC with improvement. VBG 7.42/39 and lactate 3.9. CMP w/ AST 40, ALT 40, AG 15. Serum creatinine elevated at 1.13 from baseline 1.0. CBC w/ WBC 5.6, HGB 17.7, PLT 257. HS troponin 10 -&gt; 8. Given his hypoxemia and history of pulmonary embolism, CTPE was performed and negative for PE however did demonstrate bilateral consolidations consistent with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Procalcitonin was negative. He was given dexamethasone. He was also given 500 mL LR with clearance of lactate. He was admitted to Hospital in stable condition.

When the pharmacist came out to the patient, to assure their safety, moments after getting his safety assured. Pt informed the staff that he had not eaten anything in 12 hours before getting the shot. Pt was given Orange juice, to get his sugar back up. The Pharmacist check his blood pressure and it was 117/78. Pulse was 53 so it was low as expected post- syncope episode. Pt waited for his mother before leaving allowing him to be safe afterwards.

I asked patient if he felt ok to move to observation area. patient said yes and stood up and walked to observation area. he sat down and I told him I would be right back. I turned around and was walking back into the pharmacy when I heard a loud crash. I turned around and patient was slumped side ways about to fall out of chair. He had fainted or had a seizure (he was very stiff, redness to face, eyes open and fixed). I ran over to him and a pharm tech and I got him to the floor immediately. He regained consciousness within 5-10 seconds after placing him on floor. he asked how long was he out. he stated he had this seizure happen before but never after a vaccine. he said he has had multiple vaccines like hepatitis b and this never happened. he states it happens when he has something done to him that causes intense pain. he said it happened after hurting his ankle or when he hit his hand in a fan. checked his BP-172/100 pulse-65.  paramedics came to check him out. BP still elevated. he walked out with paramedics.

Felt zero symptoms beside soreness at the injection site, until about 10pm, when I became extremely overheated quite suddenly. I was trying to exit the building to get into cold air when I fainted twice. I was unconscious for 5 seconds or fewer each time. I did not hit my head or sustain any injury from the falls.  Paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later, by which time I had regained consciousness and felt fine aside from weakness, dehydration, and some temperature fluctuation. They said my vitals were perfect and I went home from there. I was feeling completely fine and back to normal by 6pm the next day.

I checked my heart rate with my pulse oximeter and it was at 130 as I laid down and it suddenly started beating faster and faster until my heart rate went as high as 200bpm. I immediately called 911 and they checked my vitals upon arrival. My heart rate was consistently at 150 during their arrival and blood pressure was at 180/*** (unsure of second #). I refused that they take me to ER, and got a ride to urgent care where they took X-rays of me and gave me IVs and Tylenol. X-rays were normal and their diagnosis was adverse effect to COVID19 vaccine. My heart rate started to normalize the day after I went to urgent care, but took me 3-4 days to feel back to normal.

Patient was given water and time to recover which brought his vital signs back within normal limits. EMTs eventually cleared patient to drive home and advised him to pull over and call 911 if he became dizzy on his way home.

About 2 or 3 minutes after vaccination the patient got up and walked to the pharmacy counter and fainted in front of the counter.  He may have hit his head.  He was conscious and remembered walking over but lost vision and fainted.  He sat up on his own in front of the counter and was given an ice pack.  He said he would feel better laying down so we  had him lay down in the IMZ area on a mat.  Paramedics arrived shortly after.  Paramedics assisted the patient and determined no medical care was necessary but recommended the patient not drive himself home.  The patient waited in the IMZ area until his dad arrived.  He said he did not eat today so he was given a powerade and a protein bar at no charge.  The patient then left with his dad.

                                                PT was given the Moderna vaccine around 12:15pm. Pt did not seem in any distress at time of injection. After injection, he moved to an observation area chair with armrests. He appeared to have a vaso-vagal response around 12:20pm causing him to pass out and fall out of chair. He hit his head on the floor causing a minor laceration on left eyebrow and some bleeding. He appeared to have some swelling around eyebrow and forehead area. His mother accompanied him and informed us post-injection that this has happened in the past, that he had syncope related events from vaccine. The paramedics were called and the PT was taken to the local hospital for further evaluation.

About 5 minutes into waiting outside the pharmacy sitting in a chair I heard a loud thud outside the clinical services room. I was alerted by pharmacy technician that the patient had fainted. We called 9-1-1 immediately. Patient was face down and unconscious for about 7-10 minutes. Patient also had some convulsions during this period. Patient regained consciousness but was very disoriented and did not know where he was. He then went in and out of consciousness for about another 7-10 minutes until EMTs arrived and began caring for patient.

I administered the patient with his second shot of the moderna, then he sat on the chair in the waiting area after his vaccine. I then gave his fiancé her 2nd shot of the moderna.

He regained conscience after 20 seconds or more. He was extremely hot so I got him a water.  I had him wait 10 minutes after so I can monitor him.

He was vaccinated with the Moderna COVID vaccine on May 5th which caused fevers and sore throat that resolved. His pleuritic left sided chest pain began 11 days from vaccination. Given the symptoms, the PCP ordered a CXR and d-dimer. Because of the elevated d-dimer and tachycardia while in the office, she ordered a CT chest for PE protocol. This showed bilateral pulmonary emboli so the patient was directed to the ER. He was admitted and started on anticoagulation therapy. Given the CT chest findings of adenopathy, Hemotalogy-Oncology service was consulted and ordered labs.

Since then I&#39;ve been having recurring panic attacks at unusual times early afternoon which is very uncharacteristic and abnormal. Along with this I&#39;ve had an unusual uptick in heart palpitations they&#39;re very random and have happened in the past but have become more frequent and more intense. Ive been told in the past I do have a left  ventricle branch block that has shown up on multiple ekgs however they have become abnormally frequent since the vaccine. I&#39;m often discredited due to my panic disorder on medical conditions without any sort of investigation however all of the above things are very unusual and I do not have medical insurance to have them investigated and have been trying to shrug them off but they&#39;re increasing in frequency and intensity and this is not just in my head.

                                                Chest pain with exertion beginning night of Sunday (4/25). Increased chest pain with exertion through Monday morning and afternoon. Went to ER to get checked Monday evening. Admitted due to elevated troponins. Stayed in hospital for 2 nights. During stay had echocardiogram and heart cath done due to troponins continuing to elevate. These showed clear and ruled out anything serious like a blockage. Discharged Wednesday afternoon to rest at home with MRI scheduled for Friday morning.  Appointment with cardiologist Monday after the MRI and given the diagnosis of myopericarditis. Still resting at home and avoiding strenuous activity to recover fully.

I?ve also had lingering chest pain that comes and goes and radiates into my arm and back. Enough to take me to the emergency room.  I am otherwise a completely healthy person and have not had issues like this until after the vaccine.

                                                The first day after I received the vaccine I experienced symptoms in guidance with all available resources. I was fatigued, my arm was sore at the sight of injection. I remember sleeping at least 12 hours.  A few days later I began to experience severe intermittent chest pain. The area under my arm was extremely tender, as were the area behind my left knee. The adverse event as stated in the report was a sudden jolt of searing pain on my left side. It lasted only a few moments and felt like it traveled from my left shoulder down to my left thigh and behind my knee. It nearly knocked me off my feet. I remained with a lingering pain in my leg and upper left back until today.  I reached out the pharmacist  who administered the vaccine about the side effects and she advised me to immediately contact my doctor&#39;s office. I visited my doctor&#39;s office yesterday (6/3/21) and he assured me I didn&#39;t have any blood clots. He advised me to use a heating pad for the pain in my leg. He also said that sometimes the lingering side effects from the vaccine may last weeks in rare cases. Those discomforts are finally starting to subside. I had no treatment outside of elevated levels of hydration, taking Tylenol and resting.

                                                Late March 2021: chest pain emerged a few days after 2nd Moderna vaccine; lasted ~ 1 week. I think mostly or entirely on non-heart side. Mid-May 2021: came back on heart side (when laid down to sleep, couldn?t sleep on heart side without grimacing in pain). Besides that, most of the time was mild to moderate. Chest pain would switch between left and right sides.  5/18/21: Saw Dr. (primary care). You forgot to mention you first felt the pain after your second COVID dose. Dr. thought it was muscular (EKG came back normal) and said to pause weightlifting to be safe. During this, probably had a cold for 2 full weeks (bad congestion, sore throat for part of it, body and head aches). You were advised to try Ibuprofen ? tried it for a day or so and it didn?t help, so you stopped. 5/20/21: Messaged Dr. about vaccine timing (right when reports started to come out that there could be link between Pfizer/Moderna and rare heart inflammation in men under 30), who suggested seeing a cardiologist to be safe

Am now on Eliquis blood thinners to ease the pain and reduce my blood clot. Seeing a hematologist in a few days

                                                I got the 2nd dose on 06/06/2021 and then for a couple days after my heart was pounding and I was just tired. I felt tightening in my chest, intermittent pain in upper back. Periodically this would come in waves. My hands felt like pins and needles kind of flushed over my body. It was mainly hands and feet but I would feel it in my face and sometimes arms and legs. I did go to the ER about a week after 2nd dose (around 06/13/2021). They told me it could&#39;ve been anxiety and stress. They did an EKG, blood work, and x-ray and didn&#39;t find anything abnormal. I did f/u with PCP and I just went last week and explained symptoms there as well and they&#39;re looking into my issues. They told me today I had a high white blood cell count and that my liver has elevated enzymes. They want me to come in the middle of July to do more fasting blood work. No fever, no malaise, but I did feel tired and fatigued and nauseous. I had bad brain fog and my body felt like it wasn&#39;t mine. It was like someone took my brain and put inside someone else&#39;s body. 1 week after 2nd dose I had bad sinus pressure behind eyes like my eyes were going to burst out of skull.

He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

                                                During afternoon, my left arm felt sore. At 10:00 pm started having body aches. I woke up around 2:00 am and I had a high fever and I was having trouble breathing. My fingertips had turned blue. My oxygen level was about 92%. I took ibuprofen and that brought the fever back down. I had body aches the next day. My cough had gotten worse (that I had at time of vaccination).  I went to Urgent Care on January 6, 2021.  They did the COVID test that day. I had a sinus infection - antibiotics were prescribed.  It took about two weeks for symptoms to resolve.

He was then rolled to his side for prevention. Approximately 5 minutes later, the patient came to as EMS arrived on scene.

It was a constant 8/10 pressure squeezing at the sides of his sternum with the sensation of a plate pushing down on his sternum, that worsened by taking deep breaths. He had never experienced anything like it before. The pain was neither worsened with exertion nor relieved by rest. It did not change with position, and it did not radiate to his arm/neck. He denies any tenderness to palpation of his chest. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not provide any relief. At time of interview denies SOB and reports decrease in chest tightness to 2/10. CP was significantly relieved with a bolus of normal saline in the ED. Tylenol also effectively reduced his pain. Of note, the patient received the second Moderna COVID vaccine shot 3 days ago. For 2 days after receiving the second shot he experienced fevers, chills, nausea, and intermittent vomiting (10 bouts of non-bloody emesis).

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

                                                During the 15 minute observation period after injection, patient returned to the check-in desk complaining of dizziness. He was brought immediately to exam room where he became pale, diaphoretic, and stated he &#34;felt like he was in a dream.&#34; Seated BP was 74/palp. He was placed in supine position on exam table, cool compresses placed on forehead and back of neck. He complained of some nausea, which quickly improved. He never lost consciousness. His color and alertness improved steadily over the next 10 minutes. Repeat BP (lying) was 100/50. After a few minutes he sat up on exam table, dangling legs. BP remained stable at 110/60, HR 84. He continued to improve and stated that he felt better, drank some water and ate some goldfish crackers. Reported that he just remembered he had not eaten since lunch. After another 5-10 minutes he was alert, oriented, able to walk unassisted. Final BP 114/70, HR 80. His wife remained with him and confirmed she could drive him home. Discussed that although I feel confident this was a vasovagal near-syncope, if symptoms recur or worsen, he should go to ER for evaluation. Understanding verbalized.

                                                After I was administered the shot. I was directed to a space designated for observation for patients after they receive the  vaccine. Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

After removing the needle the patient straightened his posture and I could tell that the injection was too high and more in the shoulder area. Patient said that he felt okay and no pain but then returned 3 hours later complaining of shoulder pain and limited range of motion. I instructed him to ice the area 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off and to take Ibuprofen. Area was not swollen. Upon follow up later that evening he said he was having a hard time laying on that side and was more comfortable sleeping in a recliner. He said he was still having pain the following morning and was going to go to an urgent care for further testing.

                                                Because of my celiac condition, I avoid eating products with wheat and gluten in them. However, occasionally it is unavoidable, such as with traveling. Typical reactions include fatigue, headache, mild brain fog, irritability, and watery bowel movements for up to 3 days following ingestion. However, since receiving the Moderna vaccine I have encountered wheat products 3 times; in all three cases the reaction was much more severe and included whole-body ache for 5-7 days, insomnia for 2-3 days, dry heaving for 24 hours, extreme sensitivity to motion/motion sickness for up to 3 days, intense gastrointestinal discomfort for up to 7 days, constipation and diarrhea, severe congestion, shortness of breath, elevated heart rate, confusion or disorientation, and an overall elevated level of symptoms lasting from 4-7 days depending on the amount ingested.

                                                Pt reported dizziness, tightness in chest and mild difficulty breathing about 2 minutes after receiving shot.  No other signs of allergic reaction upon examination.  Laid patient down and checked blood pressure which was normal (127/85). Patient stated that he still felt the same after several minutes of observation and felt little to no improvement.  Because he stated that he felt some tightness in his chest he was given 50 mg of diphenhydramine orally and EMS was called.  Patient stated that he began to feel better after the diphenhydramine.  EMS arrived and took vitals, patient refused going to hospital and left the pharmacy.

I didn&#39;t think I needed to report if it&#39;s under 72 hours since injection since it is all &#34;known&#34; but my mother pressured me to file a report :)  Spo2 levels 95-100, elevated heartrate (90-100), taste and smell are fine, no cough so far

I had uncontrollable shakes, chills &amp; hot flashes. Tylenol wouldn&#39;t reduce my fever. I was taken to the ER where I was given fluids, potassium and magnesium which eventually calmed my fever. My blood pressure was very low as well. I tested negative for COVID-19 and Mono. No clear indication of cause resulted from chest xray and CT scan. Later small nodules were detected in my lung. Doctor&#39;s referred this as a viral reaction but couldn&#39;t determine a cause. I was discharged from the hospital after being there about 6hrs. The next day I was lethargic but felt almost back to normal. Within 36 hours I felt 100% and like nothing ever happened.

He walked over to the blood pressure machine and took his blood pressure. He then said He was starting to feel funny. Pharmacist took his blood pressure. Initially it was156/94 pulse 114. She gave him a water. She checked on him again a few minutes later and it was 166/76 pulse 103. I check on him. He said he felt tingly and his throat was still scratchy. But he was not having any problem breathing. He said he thought he was having a panic attack. I recommended Benadryl. I gave him 50mg Benadryl orally at 10:15. He was still feeling funny after and we called a manager to get paramedics ( he wanted paramedics called). He was a little shaky and still felt bad. Paramedics arrived a little after 10:30. They ran some tests and also said they thought it was a panic attack. They did not administer any meds to him that I saw, but did take his BG, BP, and check his heart. They went ahead and wheeled him to the ER. Patient apologized, I think he felt embarrassed.

                                                Patient received his first Moderna COVID vaccine. While he was waiting the 15 minutes he started to feel pressure behind his eyes, started sweating profusely, felt dizzy, and nauseous.  I had the patient go into the IMZ room where I had him sit down.  I took his blood pressure. His heart rate was 55 bpm and his blood pressure was around 110/70.  He was not having any trouble breathing or had any signs of anaphylaxis (swelling of throat, tongue, lipps, etc). I had him remain seated and talked to him for 5 minutes. He felt like he was starting to come out of it and we took his blood pressure again.  His heart rate and gone back up to 65 and his blood pressure was around 135/75.  I had the patient remain seated for another 5-10 minutes.  Took his bp again and the numbers were similar to the second one that was previously mentioned.  He wanted to stand up and see how he was feeling.  He stood up right outside the pharmacy for another 15 minutes and said that he felt back to normal.  I explained that in the previous case where this happened to a woman they recommended she have someone drive her home and I recommended he do the same.  He seemed to think he was fine and I believe he was planning to drive himself home.

The pharmacy intern was able to catch him and after about 20 seconds the patient did regain consciousness and was okay.

EMS was called and the patient was alert and awake while we waited for EMS to arrive. EMS checked patient&#39;s blood sugar as he stated having fainting issues when getting his blood drawn in the past. The patient and partner were able to leave on their own.

The pharmacist was able to get patient safely to the ground, elevate his feet, and apply a cold compress. When consciousness was regained, he was able to drink water and eat some apple slices within about 10 minutes of initial incident. Patient was kept for additional observations and was able to verbally attest to feeling stable before leaving.

Sunday morning (6:00 am) presented with chest pain for about ten minutes that subsided. Sunday night/ Monday morning at approximately midnight (12:00 am) presented again with chest pain that continued as we sought medical attention from local fire department, to which an ambulance was called, meds were given and diagnosis was heart attack from labs drawn at hospital. Took him back for a heart cath and there was no blockage. From everything I was told they couldn&#39;t figure out what caused the chest pain.  He spent 2 days in CCU. He discharged Wednesday the 12th of May. He is now on Plavix, Coreg, a low dose aspirin, and Atorvastatin.

I CHECKED THE HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE, ASKED THE PATIENT TO SIT ON THE GROUND AGAINST A WALL, GAVE THEM WATER AND SNACKS TO HELP BRING BLOOD PRESSURE AND BLOOD GLUCOSE UP THEN CONTINUED TO MONITOR FOR 45 MIN WITH FREQUENT CHECKING OF BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE. THEIR BREATHING WAS NORMAL AND TALKING JUST FINE.

Pain was described as burning sensation that is somewhat improved with leaning forward. Notably patient had received his second dose of the COVID 19 vaccine series (moderna) 3 days prior to presentation. He also noted generalized weakness with hot and cold chills after the vaccination that resolved within 24 hours. ECG in the emergency department with concerning for ST-segment elevations in anterolateral leads and cardiac enzymes were positive. Patient then underwent cardiac MRI which found evidence of perimyocarditis believed to be due to acute inflammatory response to second dose of COVID-19 vaccine series as all other tests were negative and patient had no previous viral illness prodrome. The patient was treated with colchicine and later discharged home after a 3 day hospitalization.

                                                Reporting primary symptoms: headache, fever, lightheadedness, elevated heart rate, arm soreness, muscle soreness, back pain, nausea, suppressed appetite, anxiety, and panic attacks. (see below for more information) Initially, felt faint and lightheaded. Stood up and the feeling worsened. Within five minutes, felt nauseated and clammy. Also, appeared pale in the face. Was given instructions to sit, close eyes, and take deep breaths. Applied a cool, wet rag to the face and neck as needed. Was anxious and may have had a panic attack triggered by the experience. Heart rate had elevated, but not to a concerning level. Within 30 minutes of initial vaccine administration, face was no longer pale and heart rate was lowering. Other symptoms mostly subsided within 90 minutes of the vaccine administration. The next morning (5/19/21), woke with a mild headache, low grade fever, some fatigue, slight nasal congestion, and very sore arm. Took Tylenol for fever and it was mostly gone by the next day (5/20/21). Felt well enough Saturday (5/22/21) morning for lots of physical activity (push-mowed lawn in humid conditions) and only had a mild headache and mild fatigue afterward. No notable symptoms on Sunday (5/23/21) morning, but had indigestion, gas pain, and some soreness (back muscle) late that night. Stayed up a little later than normal. Woke a few hours early (around 4:30 am) on Monday (5/24/21) with throbbing low-to-mid, left-side back pain and worsened indigestion and gas pain. Had anxiety that led to a panic attack. Did not feel well and tried stretching, taking Tums, deep breathing, used the bathroom, and walked around. This was helpful enough to return to sleep. Woke up again at 8:45 am and had a mild headache, some soreness in neck/shoulders, and anxiety about the situation. Took a shower, did some deep breathing, and tried to relax. Drank some caffeine at noon, but the headache was not relieved. Appetite was somewhat suppressed and was mildly lightheaded. Stomach became more unsettle by night. Stopped all caffeine intake and NSAID usage (and still no intake/usage at the time of this report). At night, anxiety over the situation worsened, so tried deep breathing, talking to others about the situation, and stretching. Panic attack occurred, but was able to manage with the aforementioned techniques. Woke the next day (5/25/21) with mild headache, muscle soreness in mid-to-upper back, shoulders, and neck, suppressed appetite, and anxiety. Was able to manage most symptoms with breathing, stretching, relaxing,  and talking through the situation. No panic attack on 5/25/21. Went to bed earlier than normal (around 9:30 pm) and woke on 5/26/21 around 9:30 am. Had similar symptoms, but appetite was more decreased and worsened anxiety. Decided to see doctor that afternoon (see item 19 for more information on testing from that visit) and was told to give more time to recover from vaccine side effects. Did not give doctor information about anxiety or panic attacks at that time.  Had a panic attack (less severe than previous) Wednesday night and managed with the aforementioned techniques. Thursday (5/27/21) morning woke with no headache and no fever, but still some soreness in neck/shoulder area, suppressed appetite, mild fatigue, and mild anxiety about the situation. No panic attack on 5/27/21. Friday (5/28/21) woke with similar symptoms and decided to visit doctor again about anxiety. Was prescribed Buspar and Zoloft. After taking Buspar (first time ever) at 2:30 pm, experienced an increased heart rate up to 160bpm and a low fever up to 100.2F. Experienced another panic attack during this time. Sought medical assistance from local ER around 3:30 pm. Was seen and monitored until discharge at about 11:45 pm. During stay, tests and levels were mostly normal except during a panic attack that was triggered after blood was drawn. Treated with Vistaril around 11:20 pm and monitored for about 20 minutes before being discharged. Anxiety was relieved after deep breathing and relaxing. Did not take Zoloft. Slept and woke on 5/29/21 with mild headache, unsettled stomach, and mild anxiety. Anxiety is more manageable so far and other symptoms were somewhat improved after eating breakfast. Currently, no plans to continue taking Buspar, but will consult doctor.

                                                Patient fainted after about 10 seconds of Covid-19 Moderna (2nd dose) administration. Patient reported to lose consciousness for about 10 seconds. Patient was then helped getting back to his chair staying that he was feeling fine. I sat with patient for about 2 minutes and noticed that he was a little pale and sweating. I asked patient if he wanted to lie down and he refused. I told patient to remain still while I was getting help and called 911. I again fainted and I put patient down on the floor and monitored his breathing, heart rate. I gained consciousness back after 10 to 15 seconds. Store manager arrived. Patient drank some water. Patient seems to be aware of surroundings. EMTs arrived soon after. During the time that EMTs were monitoring patient. Patient fainted again and was taken to hospital.

Racing heart, felt like I was passing out, mental fogging, trouble swallowing lasted about 1.5 - 2 hours. After 2nd dose I had the normal side effects, headache, chills, body aches fatigue.. After about 2 days of common side effects I noticed I was having trouble swallowing and it felt like I was being choked pulse food regurgitation and diarrhea.  It kept getting worse and worse after a week or so of hell I get an emergency endoscopy showing I have  eosinophilic esophagitis.  I?ve been put on all sorts of meds that are supposed to be treating this but nothing is working.  It?s been near a month now and 2 weeks have been on a hard core elimination diet  symptoms are persistent and discomfort it spreading to what feels like intestines, kidneys and possibly other locations I now have to go in for a colonoscopy soon as the meds should be working and discomfort is spreading.  Loads of headaches can?t sleep with all the discomfort.  Never hungry.  Possible permanent esophagus damage maybe more everything is still being diagnosed and no one is really finding any answers why.  For the last 6 years I?ve been on a health kick working out almost daily and eating very healthy.  No symptoms no warning  signs these one or more diseases it has all just started out of the blue post vaccine nothing else in my life has changed.

                                                Immediately after injection patient stated he did not feel well and passed out. He was extremely diaphoretic and once he woke up began dry heaving and vomiting. He stated he was too dizzy to stand and just wanted to lie down. We called an ambulance to come and treat him. He explained to the paramedics he had been out drinking and partying late the night before and did not eat or drink anything before he came to get his vaccine. We determined that he was more dehydrated and hungover than having an actual reaction to the vaccine itself.

THE pain started to get worse and decided to visit a local urgent care who then referred  me to the ER. I was admitted to the ER June 15th.  After multiple blood tests, X-Rays,  EKG?s, and ultra sound, swelling of the heart (pericarditis) was  the diagnosis. I was given colchicine to take for 90 days.

                                                Roughly 20 minutes after injection I quickly started to feel nauseous and light headed. I made me way back to the pharmacy (barely) which was around 50&#39; or less away. On my way there my vision started to fade away and go white then would come back. I made it to the counter, said I was sick, and collapsed on the ground as I could no longer stand. I quickly became more sick, became very hot, and started sweating badly. I needed to vomit but since I had not ate that day (not uncommon for me and the pharmacist was aware before I received the shot) I could not. At the same time as I was in the floor I had to put all of my concentration into not shitting my pants in front if everyone staring at me. I remember them asking me if I needed an ambulance and I don&#39;t remember responding or being able to process what was going on. They did call and ambulance and by the time they arrived I was feeling better. After collapsing they took my blood pressure while waiting for the ambulance and they told me afterward it was 81/61. When the EMT&#39;s were there they tested it several times and said it was normal. They also tested my blood sugar which was 111. They ran an EKG and said everything looked fine. They recommended I go to the hospital but I declined as I was afraid to get billed for it as well as not having a way back to my vehicle or most importantly someone to watch my dog. Though I probably should of gone. As an added possible beneficial piece of information, I went through a similar experience years ago when donating plasma.

I periodically used and ice pack and I took some advil.  2 days later, I woke up several times in the middle of the night with chest pain and shortness of breath. I felt paralyzed and just went back to sleep a few times. Around 6am,  I woke up and changed to sleeping in a chair in a sitting position as I felt a little less pressure on my chest while doing so. After I finally woke up a couple of hours later, my symptoms were more bearable although I did still feel chest pressure and slight shortness of breath, it did not seem like an emergency any more. These symptoms continued on into the next couple of days and started to go away with time.

Pt. had a hard to describe reaction that resulted in a mixture between syncope/seizure type reaction with some symptoms of both.   Upon further communication it was conveyed to me that the patients ekg was abnormal and they believe he had a undiagnosed cardiac condition that was brought to light from the stress of recieving the vaccine.

My resting heart beat when I&#39;m falling asleep is pretty low, 50s and 60s, and my heart was pounding. I have a fitbit and checked it, wondering why it felt like I had just drank a pot of coffee, and my heartbeat reached 108 at several points, including while lying in bed trying to sleep. This happened several times that day and I recall calling my doctor&#39;s office for advice. I think I was advised to come in if I felt worse or if new symptoms arose.   I also experienced: fever (99.2), aches, chills, headache, poor sleep (awake early), fatigue, arm pain and diarrhea. I took Tylenol extra strength and had to go to work as we were shortstaffed and I wasn&#39;t given much of a choice. I took some Benadryl to help me sleep and by the 30th, I was a bit tired, but my fever and the other symptoms were gone. I had some arm pain but it wasn&#39;t nearly as painful as it was on the 29th. By the 31st I believe all symptoms had resolved

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included allergy to cefaclor and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Concomitant medications reported included desvenlafaxine succinate, gabapentin and dexlansoprazole.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 11:30 am, approximately six hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the morning of 23 Dec 2020, prior to receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt &#34;achy&#34;.  At 5:30 pm, the patient experienced chills, fever to 102, GI upset and diarrhea. At 11:00 pm, the patient reported difficulty sleeping, GI upset, LOC x 2 and pallor. The patient was transported to the emergency room via ambulance.  A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test and routine labs were collected; however, results were not provided. Treatment for the events included paracetamol, unspecified intravenous (IV) medications, ondansetron and ketorolac tromethamine. The emergency room discharge diagnosis was stomach flu.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, GI upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever, were considered resolved on 24 Dec 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 31-year-old, male subject with a medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, who experienced the unexpected events of loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, and stomach flu, and the expected events of chills and fever. The events of chills, fever occurred approximately 6 hrs. and the events of GI upset, loss of consciousness, difficulty sleeping occurred after 12 hrs. after the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The time to onset for the events of GI upset and diarrhea were unknown. The reporter did not provide the causality assessment for the events. Due to the temporal association between the LOC and the administration of the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however, the subject&#39;s medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and other concurrent conditions of GI upset, diarrhea, and stomach flu remain as confounders.

                                                Shortly after midnight I woke up due to severe body aches, chills, and a fever of 101. I haven?t been able to sleep since then and my fever has spiked as high as 104.5. I?m also experiencing headache, ear aches, mild sore throat, nausea, and chest tightness/pain during deep breathing. No shortness of breath symptoms though. Aleve and Tylenol do not appear to be helping. I feel worse than when I had Covid back in November.

Saturdays diarrhea slowed down - and I went to ER - muscles were pushing - I felt my electrolytes were out of whack. I02 degree fever so they gave me Tylenol. They gave me two bags of fluids. My heartrate was in mid 120s when I went in and after fluids it went down to the 70&#39;s. I was discharged after that. I was swabbed for COVID - negative. Sunday I was still lethargic and fatigue; diarrhea slowed down quite a bit and I was able to eat some food. Monday I came back to work - not 100% in health but felt better.

In the recovery/observation area, he became pale and lightheaded.  His companion asked for help from EMTs stationed in the room.  After I spoke with the patient and at my suggestion, the EMTs helped the patient onto a gurney so he could recline and recover.  The patient was fine after 15 minutes, declined further care, and walked out of the room in the company of his companion.

                                                At approximately 9:00 PM (roughly 11.5 hours after vaccination)  I became extremely light headed with slurred speech. I experienced tunnel vision and dizziness. My face turned white, and my lips were a blue color. I sat down immediately, which improved my condition temporarily.   But, within 2 minutes I began experiencing tunnel vision and dizziness again while sitting upright. I laid down on my back and elevated my legs.  My vision returned and but I remained dizzy and pale. I experienced some numbness and tingling in my extremities.  My wife attached a fingertip pulse oximeter to my finger at this time (we did not have a tool to check blood pressure on hand). My blood %SpO2 read between  95 and 98% and pulse ranged from 95 to 101 bpm.  I did NOT experience: difficulty breathing, swelling of the airway, nor itching.   Since I was not having difficulty breathing, and my symptoms seemed to indicate low blood pressure or potentially low blood sugar I decided to wait it out and see if my symptoms worsened.    While laying on the floor, I consumed a glass of milk and a few oreo cookies, hoping to counter hypoglycemia (if that&#39;s what was going on).  After approximately 15 minutes my condition began to improve - I could sit up slightly with only mild dizziness and color began returning to my face. After approximately 30 minutes, I was able to stand and walk to my couch and lay down. After around an hour, I was feeling almost back to normal with only a slight dizziness and tiredness remaining.  12 hours after the adverse event (24 hours post vaccination) I feel okay, slightly lightheaded but generally fine. I intend to call a doctor and discuss if any further tests are necessary.

                                                So I got the vaccine on January 23rd and the Sunday following I started noticing I was getting very dizzy I went to the ear doctor they said it was not my inner ear so I went to a heart doctor and they did a tilt table test and the tilt table suggested orthostatic hypotension. The heart doctor did alot of heart tests and the heart is good. My vision was blurry with constant headaches went to an eye doctor and I have onset strabismus in my right eye and then I went to a neurologist because the tips of my toes were numb . The heart doctor has me on fludrocortisone and metropolol because my heart rate was very high all the time ever since the vaccine it was stuck at 130 to 150 beats per minute no matter if I was resting or sitting. My pupils oscillate and ever since the adverse reaction started I have had pupillary athetosis or hippus. Horrible brain fog can&#39;t think clearly or sleep well insomnia came with all of this as well. I go to the mayoclinic, because dysautonomia is expected.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was asked to move to observation area.  Shortly after sitting down the patient came back to pharmacy counter and stated he was feeling dizzy.  Just as the pharmacist was telling him to sit back down he fainted and fell on the floor.  He recovered rather quickly (matter of seconds?) and tried to sit up right away.  Pharmacist asked him to stay on the floor for a moment, the store&#39;s first responder (MIC) was called over to pharmacy.  After a minute of sitting on floor the patient got up on his own accord and transferred to a nearby chair.  His BP was taken twice per emergency protocol of pharmacy.  Patient initially appeared calmmy and BP  was 132/81, pulse 44, respirations 18 at 12:25p.   BP was 142/89, pulse 48, respirations 16 at 12:35.  Patient was given both a water and a Gatorade while he was seated.  Patient stated he had not eaten anything yet for the day.  Patient was repeatedly offered medical services (i.e. &#34;Do you want a medic? Do we need to call an ambulance?&#34;) The patient repeatedly refused any further medical treatment.  After further observation patient was able to stand, check out at the pharmacy and left the store on his own accord.

After a couple of mins the pt stood up and began to pace the room, at which time I asked the pt if he was ok and he responded that he was fine, but just a few moments later the pt got light headed and fell against the wall. He caught himself, but still hit the side of his head against the wall and this caused a small cut. The pt was immediately moved to sit on the floor with his back against the wall and at this point he seemed to lose conciousness and was moved to lying down. Pts BP was low for several mins, but improved to normal by the time EMS arrived. Pts vitals were checked by EMS and he was cleared to go home with his wife.

He was not responding when asked questions but was still breathing.  His hands had little tremors. Then after a few minutes patient was responding and talking to the staff. We still called 911 because patient was unresponsive again (second time). Shortly after patient was responsive again. Patient&#39;s spouse also came to the scene in a short time. His wife said patient had same problem previously when he had his blood drawn. Paramedics assessed that patient was stable and did not need further medical help. Patient left the store with his wife.  We recommended him to have second shot with primary care provider or at a facility with more medical assistance.

                                                Initial signs of shingles occured around 13 days after the first Moderna shot. April 13 at 8pm, thoracic back pain started. It was localized to a small region next to the spin on the right side. April 16-17 a small rash started to develop which looked similar to a bug bite. Back pain has been continuous during this time. April 21, the rash has since developed in a strip wrapping around from my back to my lower chest. Visited a  doctor who then confirmed it to be a &#34;text book&#34; example shingles. Since the 72 hour window was missed for antivirals to be used, pain killers and steroids were prescribed to treat symptoms.

He blackout but I quickly got him to lay flat on floor. During that time (about a minute) he had some jerking and wet himself a bit. I elevated his feet and called my technician just in case needed to call 911 and perform CPR/Epi but we didn&#39;t need to go that route. He loss his consciousness and quickly regained it after about a minute. I had him continue to remain laying down for 15 mins and then after patient felt comfortable I helped him back into seat inside vaccine room to monitor patient for another 20 minutes. After monitoring he was fine and left thanking me that I stayed calm to help him.

Patient regained consciousness right away and was place on the floor lying down with legs raised. Paramedics were called to check on the patient. While waiting for the paramedics, was asked if he has any chronic conditions or had any breakfast in the morning prior to getting the vaccination. Pulse was checked and was 90 bpm. After couple minutes of lying down was moved to a chair to sit. He appeared to be shaking and nervous. Paramedics came and checked his glucose, blood pressure, pulse and asked few questions before clearing him. Patient refused to go to the hospital and sat down for 10-15 minutes before returning to his home.

Was diagnosed with myocarditis and released from the hospital 3 days later with a prescription for colchicine and metoprolol.

After taking a nap, around 2 pm my heart rate increased to 130 bpm and didn&#39;t come down for an hour. So I went to emergency room. Heart rate ranged from 110 bpm - 130 bpm for 5-6 hours. Then it reduced down close to 100.  No medication was given

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 31-year-old white male who previously healthy, he works with a maintenance crew, he was in his usual state of health last week, he did receive his 2nd dose of the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on Thursday.  Over the next 24-48 hours he began experiencing myalgias malaise and fatigue, he self treated with ibuprofen and Tylenol as needed.  He felt a little bit better on Sunday and went to assist in picking up a brush more.  During the process he became  short of breath as well as midsternal chest discomfort. He presented to the ED.    Evaluation found a CRP of 112, elevated troponins and a  leukocytosis of approximately 20,000 along with elevated neutrophils.  His influenza a and influenza B testing have been negative and his SARS COVID the PCR was negative.  Given his elevated troponins, he was started on IV heparin and admitted for further evaluation.   On admission to the floor, he was chest pain free. We were concerned for potential myo/pericarditis given his history and laboratory study findings. Cardiac MRI was performed which suggested active myocarditis with biventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 34%, RVEF 37%). Given his new LV dysfunction he was started on low dose lisinopril and metoprolol succinate.  It is unclear whether this is atypical viral myocarditis or whether it potentially could be vaccine related, the MRI is consistent with that of myocarditis. We did not proceed with cardiac biopsy unless since there was no evidence for clinical decompensation, unstable heart rhythm or other worrisome features. He will plan to follow up with Dr. 1 week post hospitalization with repeat echocardiography and blood work.  If at that time there are any signs of instability we would proceed with more aggressive workup at that time.    Infectious disease was consulted who recommended infectious work up including serology testing for: parvovirus IgG and IgM was positive, Herpes Virus type 6, EBV, CMV (undetected) adenovirus, enterovirus (negative) and HIV (negative) .    He does not have any family history of cardiomyopathy.  There is no family history of sudden cardiac death, he states that his family has been quite healthy from a cardiac standpoint he was previously healthy before this episode.

I woke up on 05/26/21 at approximately 0120h feeling the need to urinate and was very sweaty, hot and thirsty. I sat down to urinate, and I felt dizzy standing back up. I was feeling very thirsty so proceeded to walk to get some water. I fainted after walking about 10 feet. I regained consciousness, and I drank water and ingested an Advil with the help of my wife. I felt a lot better after drinking the water, but still had a mild throbbing headache. I went back to sleep, and the fever symptoms came and went which affected my sleep quality. I drank more water any time I woke up. I took 2 more Advil as well at one time waking up. I woke up around 1300h on 05/26/21 feeling a lot better and a little more well rested. My fever symptoms are gone, but I am still a little sensitive to cold and feeling a little weak.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  About 10 minutes after I got the shot I felt a small pain in the left side of my chest. It lasted about two minutes before passing so I wasn&#39;t very concerned, I thought it was just part of the shot. About an hour after the shot the pain in my chest came back much worse. Ten minutes after the chest pain my arms felt numb. I struggled with opening and closing my hands. I have terrible insurance, no primary care physician and don&#39;t have the money for hospital bills so i didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. I slept a couple hours hoping I&#39;d feel better when I woke. It didn&#39;t help. The pain and numbness lasted about two days, most of which I tried to sleep through. I still have a off feeling in my chest that I don&#39;t know how to describe. My family tried to getting me to go to the ER but I resisted for the reasons mentioned. I&#39;m supposed to get my second shot on the eleventh but I&#39;m scared of what will happen.

I had trouble sleeping from my heart beata for 2 weeks and I thought it was stress or anxiety. I went to see a doctor, they drew blood and then called me after 2 days and said I had to go to the ER because Troponin level was so high. I went to the ER and they kelt me at the hospital for 30 hours to monitor my Troponin level and they did and ECG and Echocardiogram. They said it was Pericardial effusion and Pericarditis. They prescribed me Ibuprofen 400 tid and my doctor have me Propranolol 20mg qd.

                                                First Dose:   I took Moderna COVID19 vaccine and passed out immediately onsite. One of the nurse have to call in ambulance services , they checked ECG and transported me to nearby hospital&#39;s emergency department. Where I received 3-4 hours of emergency treatment ( a bed, re-do ECG, an emergency doctor&#39;s visit and Benadryl I.V. injection). All this life threatening events occured to me because of Moderna COVID19 vaccine. I was very excited and walk on my feet to clinic to take vaccine but I have to go in ambulance and face all this difficulties at the cost of my job day off and all other related inconvenience.    Both ambulatory services and hospital sent a huge bills, which upon my request, they submitted to my health insurance plan. Insurance company paid some amount but not in full. Insurance company said there is no government mandate for insurance companies to pay COVID-19 vaccine related emergiencies. so, they are not liable.     Second Dose:   Despite all this challenges, I decided to go for second dose to protect myself and the people of the from COVID-19. Again the same above story repeated even during the second dose. and they send bills to me.    Now there are close to $3000 bills on me due to above circumstances, which I don&#39;t think appropriate for me to pay. I was simply aiming for safety for myself and other general public by getting myself vaccinated without any prior knowledge of this could cost me financially and dangerous to my own health. I was simply following CDC guideline and suggestion.  In this situation, could you help me financial assistant or request ambulatory services and health to waive my financial obligations? Also, I request you to ask Moderna to reimburse for the cost of adverse effects of their vaccines.

                                                Patient received 1st Moderna COVID vaccination, and had been sitting in the post-vaccine waiting area. He walked up to the consultation window and asked for a place to lay down because he wasn&#39;t feeling well. Person 1 asked the patient to be seated and told the patient she would come out and help him put his feet in a chair for elevation. The patient then began to kneel on the floor. Person 2 ran out to the patient, Person 1 retrieved the emergency supplies, and Person 3 called 911. Patient ended up laying flat on the ground, experiencing syncope, but did not lose consciousness. A cloth was placed under the patient&#39;s head, a cold pack was applied to his forehead, and his blood pressure and heart rate was checked. His first reading at 11:30am was 129/72 and HR was 53. Patient was pale and sweaty, but could answer questions. Before a next reading could be taken at 11:35, EMT&#39;s arrived and begun their care. They repeated his blood pressure check and checked his blood glucose. All readings were WNL. Patient did say that he had not eaten since early morning (eggs) and his just come from working out. Patient declined to seek further medical treatment and was released on his own recognizance.

I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

Patient was instructed to rest and increase fluid intake and Ibuprofen as this was likely a known adverse reaction to COVID vaccination. At 72hrs from vaccination patient began to have fevers Tmax 101.9 orally. Continued rest, hydration and ibuprofen, started Tylenol. At 96hrs from vaccination patient began to have a dry cough, diarrhea, severe fatigue and inspiratory chest pain. Patients myalgias and arthralgias continued, and Tmax increased to 104.5 orally. At this time bedside ECHO, iSTAT chemistry, COVID antigen, COVID antibody and COVID PCR, Rapid Flu, and Viral Respiratory Panel were obtained. Administered 1.5 liters of lactated ringers, Toradol 15mg and Tylenol 975mg  and patient was isolated.  EKG, troponin and Chest Xray were obtained 12 hours later (108 hours from vaccination) at which time the patient reported improvement  by 95%. Patient was afebrile and chest pain free. Only symptom at that time was fatigue. After  another 12 hours of rest/sleep (hour 120 post vaccination)  patient reports no symptoms and 100% well.  See below for lab/rad/test details.

I had a sharp and persistent headache that lasted most of the night. I felt a little pain in my chest, and even when I took deep breaths it never felt like I had enough air. I&#39;m wondering in the breathing difficulties might have been due to heartburn/indigestion. I had to stop taking my heartburn medicine because it&#39;s not good for my kidneys (I also have kidney disease). On rare occasions I have had symptoms from heartburn that feel almost like asthma. The fever-symptoms and chills subsided a few hours later after I took a Tylenol, but I continue to feel fatigued and I have a bad headache.

                                                Felt a bit odd on the couch, little shiver and what felt like adrenaline. I got up and went into the bathroom where the incident occurred. I used to be on 10mg of Ramipril years ago and moved to 5 due to light headedness when standing up. Yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly. Getting up too fast with heart pressure meds prescribed for albumin /T1D and not for heart pressure. The secondary use of Ramipril is normal for type 1 diabetes after 20&#43; years. So I went to 5mg and haven?t had that issue since. I should also mention that when this used to happen to me I would lay down and recover with no problem.  Back to the incident it felt exactly like that but on steroids. I was in the bathroom looking for Tylenol and I got light headed, yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly, ringing in the ears, dizzy, and confused. I remember thinking I should probably get down on the tile floor and lay down like I?m used to from the episodes years ago with 10mg Ramipril causing the same symptoms but never anything so extreme. Next thing I know I?m on the ground waking up where I fainted and hit my head pretty hard on the way down. I probably have a minor concussion. Iced my head in the back where I hit it last night and this morning. Surprisingly 0 bumps, etc other than a little bit sore.  Trying to remember going down is impossible. There is a strange, I guess it?s not strange as I fainted, but to me being 1 moment thinking what I should do then the next moment still thinking that same exact thing but coming to on the bathroom floor with parents yelling over top of me as I was at their house is strange. I recall what almost felt like a dream while I was out but I was wondering why everyone was asking if I was ok, of course I?m ok I thought. Then I realized what happened and crawled around on the floor the rest of the night if I needed anything and was checked every hour through the night which was horrible but necessary.  Also my blood glucose was a 220 at the time of the incident according to my CGM so it didn?t have to do with low blood sugar.  In any case I feel better today but in a fog with a slight headache.

Talked with the patient and he was not very responsive then went unconscious where he was kept him from hitting the ground. I grabbed the patient to prevent them from falling, his eyes appeared to roll slightly and his leg twitched. He was unconscious  and unresponsive for approximately 10 seconds or less while making some grunts/groans. He came to consciousness and sat upright and began drinking water. He says he remembers immediately before but couldn&#39;t remember the exact event. The ambulance was called at initial event and arrived and took him at that point to continue checking on him. Blood pressure was approximately 117/76 with a pulse of 55 form blood pressure cuff over his shirt.

                                                Pt. was very sick the day after the shot, then Friday morning his heart was going into atrial fibrillation and jumping between 110 heart rate and 160&#43;. He was out golfing when he noticed this. He rested later that day but was extremely tired and felt sick. Saturday morning (2.5 days after vaccine) he needed to go to the emergency room because his heart rate was back over 160. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia and gave him a message for it but it made it worse and the rate was over 200. They had to stop and start his heart then put on beta blocker which brought it to 180, then another beta blocker brought to 150. Following EKGs showed atrial fibrillation, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and super ventricular tachycardia. Pt. had this about a year ago but was fine after a few days. This was the first time he was hospitalized for it and is now on daily medications. He fears the Moderna vaccine triggered it and is very worried about the second dose.

He began to fall forward several minutes after the shot and another customer pointed out that he needed assistance.  As I hung up quickly and went to the patient he was coming to and recovered.  I wasn&#39;t sure if he bumped his head but did not see any lacerations or signs of obvious severe injury. Store manager was contacted to help assess reporting through Incident reporting process.  His BP was 118/82 after spending a few minutes with him and giving him water.  He had a sweaty forehead and sat with us for a bit. I did offer to call an ambulance and administer Benadryl.  Patient declined.  He mentioned fainting with blood donations in the past, never with vaccines.  We discussed for second shot we will stand nearby ready for fainting again, or receiving the shot at an MD office in prone (lying down) position.  There was no answer to a follow-up phone call the next morning.

My right cheekbone is also sensitive to touch. I have no physical rash or reaction on my skin. It?s all nerve feeling. The right side of my upper chest feels more tight than normal. With my history of spontaneous pneumothoraxes I usually have a good feeling on my lungs and chest. This feels tighter than normal and came on about 12 hours post vaccine shot. Otherwise I feel much better today than yesterday. This nerve feeling is still there however.

                                                I began to feel nauseous and lightheaded while brushing my teeth around 10:30 pm several hours after I received the first injection of the Moderna COVID vaccination. I sat down and started feeling very hot. I passed out a few moments later. I woke a few minutes or seconds after passing out and was evaluated by EMTs. They said my vitals looked good, but strongly recommended I go to the emergency room for further evaluation. The ER performed and EKG and bloodwork, both of which were normal. I was told this was most likely vasovagal syncope and sent home. I have had a previous history of fainting from injury or injections. This was different because the fainting has previously occurred minutes or seconds after the triggering event versus hours. Since that night, I&#39;ve  been tired and experienced occasional lightheadedness. I saw my primary care doctor today (4/21) and he advised me to fill out this report.

Since i had no idea what to expect if something &#34;did go wrong&#34;, i picked up my packet of information i received prior to my shot and started browsing through. i saw the possible serious side effects column and started to go through the list. At the time, about 5-6 mins now afterwards of my shot, i had no difficulty breathing, i did have a little tingling in my tongue, i read &#34;a fast heartbeat&#34;, and put my hand on my chest and asked myself, IS MY HEART GOING FASTER? i looked at the paper again and put my hand back on my chest, and that was the last thing i remember until i was brought back to conscious by the nurses and doctors. i was told the guy in the waiting room ran after i passed out. when i came back to they walked me into the back, i was dizzy and profusively sweating and was drenched from head to toe , shirt and pants were SOAKED in sweat, they took my vitals for the next 40 minutes (3 or 4 times) i dont remember it too clearly until i started coming back to. Blood pressure was up and down and i was white as a ghost, they gave me fluids and i hung out until i felt superbly better about 40 minutes later. Then on my drive home, i had to pull over again, because i was getting light headed and felt like i was going to vomit. made it home, 90 minutes later, took a baby aspirin and slept the rest of the afternoon for about 5/6 hours before waking back up to eat some dinner.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine at 10:00am on 4/13, 28 days after my first one. On Fri, 4/16 at 4:00am, I woke up to use the restroom and voided my bladder. Shortly thereafter, I felt very nauseous and cold clammy. I had a sip of water, than sat down next the toilet since I thought I had food poisoning and needed to throw up. Instead, I passed out and fell from a sitting position against the wall. I woke up a few seconds later, to find my right ear cut and with quite a bit of blood (not sure what I cut it on, maybe my own thumb nail?). I stood up and walked to the sink, so I could bleed over it while apply pressure so I wouldn&#39;t make a mess. My wife had woken up at this point, and shortly after I got to the sink, I passed out again while standing (fortunately she caught me) and started twitching for a few seconds before coming to (I came to while still standing up). At this point, my wife drove me to the emergency room and we were admitted. In the ER from 4:15am-7am, they did a CT scan on my head without contracts, blood work, and an EKG. All three tests came back normal and I was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope. I have no history of any prior vasovagal event. At the ER they also sewed my ear up with 6 dissolvable stitches, gave me a big of IV fluids, a tetanus shot, and then sent me on my way, discharging me at 7:00am on 4/16. I then saw my primary care doctor that afternoon at 1:00pm on 4/16 who reviewed by medical records/test results from the ER, concurred with their vasovagal syncope diagnosis, checked my stitches, and said I could go back to normal activity largely unrestricted. I haven&#39;t had any issues since; so not overly concerned (other than the &gt;$2,500 of ER hospital bills that are piling up), but just reporting this so you have the data.

                                                I arrived at the ER complaining of tightness in the chest and nausea, having vomited an hour earlier. At triage, the EKG showed a weak heart rate. This was two and a half days after receiving the shot, and having had other symptoms including fever, chills, general soreness, all of which may have obscured an earlier onset of tightness in the chest. Eventually I was diagnosed with acute Pericarditis and prescribed Colchicine by mouth 2 times a day. I&#39;ll need to have follow-ups with a cardiologist, continue taking the Colchicine, and go easy on the heart for 6 weeks to 3 months. Long-term, it&#39;s expected I&#39;ll make a full recovery.

                                                The evening of Wednesday I began feeling chest pressure/discomfort and slight difficulty breathing. The same on Thursday, but a little worse. Friday morning at 4:30am I awoke from intense pain and pressure in my chest, difficulty breathing, and back/shoulder/neck pain. I went to the ER at 7:30 in the morning. Had tests taken, was given colchicine to help with the pain, and it did help lower the pain level a little bit. By Noon the pain was tolerable enough that I could go home. I was told to take ibuprofen to manage the pain. I took a nap but awoke at 2:30pm, this time with even more intense pain, my back/neck/shoulder muscles convulsing/twitching from pain and from being in a state of involuntary clenching as well as chest pain/pressure and difficulty breathing. I went back to the ER and after several more tests, an ECG gave the doctors cause to worry about the health of my heart (they were concerned I may be having a heart attack or heart failure). They kept me overnight and after taking more blood tests and ECG tests were able to diagnose me with Pericarditis on Saturday morning. I was prescribed colchicine, which I am to take twice a day for three months and ibuprofen to manage the pain.

                                                Moderna EUA - Patient who is nonverbal and  received his second COVID vaccine today reportedly developed evidence of discomfort by closing his eyes, gritting his teeth and trying to lay down within 15 minutes of his injection.  This had not occurred w/ his first injection on 4/19/2021.   A medical assistant reported seeing distended right neck and right arm veins, and his family member reported seeing urticaria.  Vitals per MA were bp 97/59, pulse 102, pulse ox 96% on room air.  Upon my arrival, there were no visible distended neck or arm veins, and patient was seated comfortably, upright in the backseat of his family member&#39;s vehicle.  There were horizontal linear indentations across his right neck, as though he had been resting his head against the back of his seat, or a seat belt may have been rubbing on it (but seat belt would have been on wrong side).  He was in no respiratory distress.  There were no visible urticaria.  BP was 115/69, pulse 92.  Lungs were clear to auscultation and cardiovascular exam revealed mild tachycardia, regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  He had received 10 mg of Benadryl through his G tube just as I arrived.    I recommended that patient be observed for 15 more minutes and patient went home without further incident, to go to ER if developed respiratory distress.

Then on 4/30/21 developed acute onset of shortness of breath and chest pain. Seen at ED. Exam and work-up revealed elevated troponin, unremarkable CTA of chest, EKG with diffuse slight ST changes. Patient was subsequently admitted to hospital for possible myocarditis. Per consult - Differential diagnosis includes pericarditis, myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome. Later in the day (~1530), had worsening chest pain and ST elevated noted on EKG. Pt did disclose at that time that he used cocaine about 8 days earlier. Pt transferred to Hospital for treatment of STEMI. Note: covid-19 vaccine info is pt reported, unable to access any Immunization records for this patient. Place where pt received vaccine is also unknown.

This was the first time I passed out though (usually I am already laying down, or able to without getting up.   I was in a chair and could not).

Patient developed cardiac arrest in the field with witnessed arrest and bystander CPR, received defibrillation for VF in the field via medics. After presenting to hospital, underwent angiogram with normal coronaries, severely reduced ejection fraction with biventricular failure. Transferred to a different hospital to limit risk of ventricular arrhythmia recurrence and currently on ECMO.

                                                Within 30 minutes I felt confused and light headed and it reminded me of feeling like I had a concussion. I had dark spots in my vision and intense pressure in my head. As I had been told to expect random side effects I went home and went to sleep early. The next day I had a lack of motor function with continued intracranial pressure and confusion. I called my doctor and went to the Emergency Room where my Blood Pressure was recorded to be Hypertensive and then retaken. I was given a CT scan and sent home. I was unable to work  the rest of the week and was out of work after being sent home sick the following week. I continued to experience intense intracranial pressure and an inability to form short term memories for three weeks after vaccination. I still continue to experience intracranial pressure and episodes of hypertension but have more ease in forming short term memories. Intracranial pressure has nonetheless decreased significantly compared to the immediate onset following inoculation. My medical testing is ongoing.

Troponin was significantly elevated on presentation at 16.3, and 12-lead EKG showed an abnormal rhythm concerning for STEMI vs perimyocarditis.  After negative cardiac/embolic work-up in cath lab &amp; CT imaging, myocarditis was felt to be the most likely cause of this patient&#39;s symptoms.  On the following day, patient was noted to have brief bursts of Vtach, for which metoprolol was initiated.  The patient was subsequently discharged home in stable condition on 6/13/2021.

Continued to get worse throughout day until rubbed skin raw. Went to urgent care, steroid shot and started coarse of steroids day three AM. Chest was tight and prescribed inhaler. Would need to use multiple times a day and several through night. Day 6: Went back to urgent care. Highest dose of steroids. Didn?t help. Day 7 went to allergist, gave me different dose of allergy medicine and to take acid controller to help with itching. Helped slightly. Continued to be itchy through steroids and was not only on highest dose but longest period possible. Skin reacts to just about anything it touches.  While not itchy, uncomfortable she still happens to this day almost 2 months later. Allergist is convinced it is a result of the vaccine. Breathing is better but I had significant trouble for first 10 days.

                                                I noticed later in the evening on the day of the vaccine that my heart rate was racing. The next morning I felt tightness in my chest and my resting heart rate was averaging 130-155. If I walked from the living room to the bathroom it would increase to 155 BPM. After several hours with no change I had to go to the ER for treatment. I was given an EKG and they found that my hear rate was elevated. I was eventually discharged after a series of tests and told to monitor for increases in heart rate.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

For then next couple days just felt rundown. Then three days post vaccine I began having some chest discomfort and shortness of breath. That night around one thirteen the morning I went to Emergency Department. they took a ECG and drew labs. the ECG showed normal rhythm just a little elevated and my Blood pressure was elevated. Upon the attending physician getting my lab work back i was admitted for my triponin levels being elevated. I was taken for chest X-rays and a Cat Scan per their pulmonary embolism protocols. Both of which showed nothing.  The next day i had a Echocardiogram, and Cardiac Catheterization, and a Cardiac MRI.

These were not the typical &#34;shivering&#34; symptoms typically experienced by patients with high fever.  All other symptoms experienced following severe symptoms more closely resembling flu-like symptoms that are to be expected following second vaccine.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused. One of the pharmacy technicians called 911 immediately and started the emergency response. he was able to regain his composure and move himself back the chair. The EMTs arrived and took his vitals, and discussed what happened. They eventually determined that he was ok and was free to go. The patient did not go to the hospital.

                                                I have not felt the same since I received the vaccine. Initially, I felt tingling in my fingers after receiving the injection. I also got chest and throat tightness. I felt very slightly shaky and just a bit off.  After that subsided a bit, I left the facility and started heading home. Ten miles from the store, I went back as I got another wave of feeling pretty terrible. I waited outside there for another hour until I felt better again. The next few days I had terrible fatigue and constant headaches, and the obvious sore arm. I had a couple days where I was a little better but then it would come surging back again.  For three weeks I&#39;ve had on and off migraines, extreme and dreadful fatigue like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before (feels like I&#39;m dying of cancer or something), and feeling out of it and spacey. It&#39;s been awful and I&#39;m terrified to get the second dose if the first one did all this to me. I was feeling great in the weeks leading up to the vaccine so I am certain that my reaction is to the vaccine. I hope this gets better soon. I&#39;m not sure what to do about dose 2.

It appeared as if he may vomit and I repositioned to ensure he would not slide off of the chair.  The movements lasted about a minute and then he started to come to.  He described feeling dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, and sweaty.  During the event his pupils were non responsive. At 11:17 he went pale and started feeling as if he was spinning and experiencing tingling.  He was still reclined in the chair and sitting up aided with the tingling.  He was given a cold pack to help regulate and given ice water at 11:18.  He stated he had not eaten yet today as he usually doesn&#39;t eat until 11. His temperature had dropped to 96.1 vs 97.5 prior to the vaccination.  BP was checked at 11:25 and was 120/72 which is lower than usual for him and to be expected with the LOC.  After drinking his water, I had him attempt to stand while grasping the wall/table for 2 minutes to assess his steadiness, then standing unassisted for 2 minutes.  After he felt steady enough we had him walk 10-15 feet and stand for another 2 minutes.  Patient was feeling tired and instructed not to drive home.  The situation was conveyed to his wife and they were instructed to seek ER/Urgent care if any of his symptoms reappeared. They stayed in the area to eat lunch and I checked in again at 12:12pm with the patient and he is feeling better after eating but still tired.  I also recommended following up with his primary as I will be sending her a copy of this report.

                                                I had the vaccine that month 3 weeks earlier, and had a 24 hour fever and 48 hour cough. Heart palpitations followed after the vaccine.   The main issue of me reporting this is that I had leg pain when I had the 2nd vaccine shot including the above fever, cough, and heart palpitations. I didn&#39;t report this to a doctor because I took aspirin for a week and it went away. Plus i&#39;m a man so I am stubborn as hell. But seeing the need to report if symptoms arise from what I saw in a article, I thought I should do so.

                                                Patient received first dose of COVID vaccine at 1:10pm without issue. During his 15 minute waiting period post vaccination, at approx 1:15pm, patient experienced a syncopal event, &#43; for striking his head. He never lost vitals, and promptly woke up. at 1:22pm, his vitals were initially BP 90/42, HR 45, pulse ox 100% on room air, and RR 16. He complained of dizziness and blurred vision, but was AOX3 with all cranial nerves intact. 911 was called for patient to be assessed. Vitals were then checked again at 1:29 pm, BP 110/62, HR 62, pulse ox 100%, RR 16.  At this time, all of patient&#39;s symptoms had resolved. EMS arrived at 1:39pm and checked his BS which was 114. At this point patient no longer wanted to go to ER. EMS spoke with on call provider who gave verbal okey for patient to no go to the ER, but gave strict ER precautions such as headaches, vomitting, vision changes, etc. Patient was able to teach back. Patient reports that this (passing out) frequently occurs to him anytime he has to get shots or blood work done and he has seeked medical attention afterwards before with no resolution. Patient left at 1:46pm. He walked home.

                                                Patient complained of dizziness and nausea following second covid moderna vaccination. We supplied water and chair and monitored him. While interviewing patient it was announced that he had consumed several beers during lunch 1-2 hours previously. He later told another front end associate following up with him that he actually had consumed whiskey. It is strongly believed that this played a large roll in his adverse reaction. It is believed that he experienced a mild syncopal reaction that was potentiated by the alcohol consumption.

                                                03/28: At 9 PM (9 hours after shot), I rapidly experienced fatigue, fever (101 degrees), chills, aches, and slight nausea. I took my vitals during this time: SPo2 of 98-99%, BP was 123/80, and heart rate was in the mid-to-high 80s. By midnight, I felt much better and assumed everything was over.   03/29: Woke up feeling fairly tired. As I was trying to do my normal morning routine of cleaning up, taking out trash, etc. I noticed a shortness of breath. No fever or other symptoms from the night before. I checked my SPo2 levels with 3 different oximeters, and all gave readings in the 93%-94% range. My heart rate, which is usually in the 80s and 90s when moving about, was in the low 70s, bottoming at 72. This was nerve racking. This along with intermittent dizziness persisted for 24 hours. I got COVID tested and it came back negative. Flu came back negative, too. A consult with a doctor inferred that &#34;everyone has different vaccine side effects.&#34; Not helpful.   This shortness of breath/fatigue/low blood oxygen saturation continued persistently for the next 48 hours. I was essentially advised to stay home and rest. I noticed some lymph node swelling, too.   By day 4, I was feeling much better. My heart rate had gone back up into the 80s, and my blood oxygen sat. had increased to 96-97%. I was still somewhat tired and got winded very, very easily.   It&#39;s been over two weeks since my second shot upon writing this. I didn&#39;t want to report, but I can&#39;t make heads or tails as to why this happened. The only change in my health was taking the vaccine. I don&#39;t have any blood clots, asthma, or underlying issues. However, these side effects, if they are as such, need to be discussed. I know others who got the Moderna vaccine with similar anecdotes. The difference is, living with a clinician, I monitor my vitals all the time and knew enough to take measurements.

Five minutes after vaccination, mother noticed the patient was pale on forehead, followed by &#34;overall paleness&#34; a minute later. Patient reports feeling slightly light-headed five minutes post-vaccination. He said he also felt warm and slightly sweaty. Eight minutes post-vaccination, his mother said his earlobe &#34;lost color&#34;. The patient reported feeling cool and sweaty around this time and still light-headed. 19 minutes post vaccination (at 10:06 AM), patient informed me of how he was feeling, and I checked his blood pressure. It was 93/47, with a pulse of 55. He felt very hot to the touch, but his temp was 96.8 degrees. He brought a water bottle to sip water as needed, and he was given a cool cloth for his neck/forehead. At 10:10 AM, patient reported feeling weak and didn&#39;t want to talk. At 10:13 AM (~25 min post vaccination), patient reported feeling a &#34;bit better&#34;, and his BP was 104/57 (checked by other RPh). 34 minutes post-vaccination he reported feeling much better and was much less light-headed/able to talk. At 10:26 AM (~39 min post-vaccination), BP was 137/75, and his pulse was 60. 42 minutes post-vaccination, he said he was &#34;mostly back to normal; ~90%&#34;. Then, 46 minutes post-vaccination, he said he was 95% better, and he said he was &#34;good to go&#34; 51 minutes post-vaccination.

His face/lips were pale and after a few minutes of sitting on the floor he felt good enough to get up and sit back on the chair. I gave him a cold bottle of water. He was able to drink the water. It was hard to get specifically what the patient was feeling or experiencing because he did not speak English and also was mentally challenged. The paramedics were called and when they came they took the patient&#39;s blood pressure and pulse ox and everything was normal. After about 15-20 minutes they helped him to the car to make sure he was feeling better. We called later in the afternoon to see how he was doing and the sister said he was doing much better.

When I tried to speak with him he wasn&#39;t answering. I then ran to his side and by the time I was there he had passed out (eyes were open and rolling to the back of his head and he was not responsive). I told my technician to call 911 and went to grab the epinephrine and emergency kit while a customer stayed next to him. He came to within a minute and I did not need to administer epinephrine, etc. He said he was okay but we called EMS, who then took over and patient decided to go with them to ambulance/ER.

Went to the ER on 5/23/21 was given blood transfusion and IV because hemoglobin dropped from 9.1 to 7.1 after one bowel movement. He had endoscopy and colonoscopy on 5/25/21 and was diagnosed with a colon ulcer which they cauterized and he was discharged in the afternoon due to hemoglobin being stable at 8. The next morning on 5/26/21 he woke up to use the restroom, defecated brownish-black-red stool and almost fainted and couldn?t get up from the floor. I called Dr. (gastroenterologist) who told me to take him to the ER immediately. My husband, is currently back at hospital getting evaluated.

                                                I woke up the morning after my second dose experiencing  the common symptoms related to the vaccine -- persistent headache, body ache, fever, cold shivers, and fatigue. These symptoms lasted for approximately 24 hours, and I continued to have a headache for a total of approximately 48 hours.   However, I then developed pain in my left calf approximately 10 days after the second dose and on three consecutive evenings at approximately 9pm I developed an all-body itchy rash (big red raised welts) that would disappear by the time I woke up the next morning. The rash only occurred on these three evenings, but the pain in my calf persisted. I went to see my primary care doctor the following Monday (05/17/21) who gave me a referral for an ultrasound to rule out a DVT, although he said that it was not urgent that I go as I didn&#39;t have the other regular symptoms of a DVT (swelling, redness, warm to the touch) and I was too young and healthy to be at risk for one. My doctor said that if the pain didn&#39;t subside by the end of the week I should go for the ultrasound. The pain got worse and so I went for an ultrasound on Saturday (05/22/2021). I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH A BLOOD CLOT (DVT), and sent to the emergency department.

                                                After the individual received his vaccine he went to the medical monitoring area with two additional members of his party.  At approximately 1412 the individuals friends alerted me that he needs help. I walked approximately 40 feet to find a 33 year old male patient that was unconscious and seizing.  The seizure lasted about 20-30 seconds with the patient waking up confused. I instructed someone from my team to call 911 and request an  ambulance.  Another team member and myself assisted the patient to a wheelchair and moved him to our treatment area approximately 50 feet away.  The patient was somewhat confused, hot &amp; sweaty and fatigued.  I took a basic set of vital signs and got: BP 90/70 Pulse 56 Respirations 22 LOC x 4 No CBG  The ambulance arrived within 10 minuets and another round of vitals were taken.  The patients blood pressure and pulse were still low.  A CBG of 120 was achieved.  The patient was still hot / sweaty and fatigued.  The patient lied down on a cot and soon started feeling better.  He stopped sweating and his BP / Pulse started rising to within normal limits.  The two paramedics on site conducted a 12 lead ECG and didn&#39;t notice any amoralities.  Due to this incident being the first of its kind for the patient and without being a able to find a definitive known cause it was recommended that the patient be transported to the local hospital for further evaluation.  The patient declined and stated that he would have his friends take him if he starting feeling really bad.   It was strongly advised that he be transported via medics to the hospital but in the end the patient refused.

Two weeks after receiving the second Modern vaccine he developed chest pain with significantly elevated cardiac markers/troponin. Angiogram at the time was unremarkable. Symptoms were attributed to myocarditis at the time. I don?t have the patients name but could find it if needed. At the time this was not a common adverse reaction seen after Covid vaccine. Now that there?s been an increase in cases of myocarditis following the Covid vaccine I feel I should report it.

Patient was sitting in a chair in the designated waiting area and decided to look at the vitamins. Next thing I knew, patient fainted and hit the floor. Patient was taken back to the chair where he was sitting and instructed to wait another 20 minutes. I watched the patient very closely. Patient was given water and OJ. Pt told me that he put nicotine gum in his mouth a minute before I injected him.

                                                Patient complained about feeling dizzy about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Before that time, he and I had been talking, and he said he had felt fine. He was put in a reclining chair and continued to feel dizzy, experienced a mild headache, slightly scratchy throat and skin and nausea. For a minute or so, he stopped answering my questions. At that point, I was becoming concerned this could be an allergic reaction, versus vasovagal episode. His vital signs were done, essentially normal with exception of elevated BP.  he was given diphenhydramine 50 mg IM and stated about 5 minutes after that, that his symptoms were slightly better. 911 was called when he seemed to be getting worse, not lucid. . EMTs assessment was same as mine, allergic reaction versus vasovagal.  His EKG NSR, vitals remained  the same. BP still high, not dropping. EMS staff suggested he go to ED, which patient declined. He was feeling better about 1 hour later.

Chills, dizziness, and body aches continued mildly through Sunday.   I also passed out/blacked out the night of getting the vaccine while using the bathroom. Unclear if this was simply due to standing too quickly while experiencing the above mentioned symptoms and blood rushing to my head or a true side effect of the vaccine.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

I asked my pharmacy staff to call 911 and attend the patient.  I was attending a patient who was feeling faint after her vaccination.  Staff was in contact with 911 and were attending patient.   His initial blood pressure reading was 138/92. He was sweating profusely.  He was no longer talking.  his next blood pressure reading was higher in the 160&#39;s according to our other pharmacist who was attending him.  The paramedics were here very quickly and took the patient to a local hospital.  I believe the attending pharmacist will also be reporting this.

Within seconds I was unresponsive for what appears to have been just over 1 minute. My wife called 911 and I was starting to come to while she was wrapping up the call with the dispatcher. I remained seated upright, did not fall over, but was completely unresponsive.  When the EMT&#39;s checked vitals (within 5 minutes of me coming back to awareness), all was normal. Simply a full body cold sweat. It&#39;s now 10pm and I feel no other symptoms. Completely &#34;normal&#34;.

He went to the waiting room and all of a sudden he told his wife he thought he was going to faint. He did and she got on his lap immediately so he wouldn&#39;t fall. She was tapping his face and talking to him. Others in the waiting room were helping. He punched his wife in the stomach (she is pregnant) but she seemed to be ok as she was trying to get him back to normal. I called 911 and  manager gave him water and ice. The paramedics came and checked him out to make sure he was ok. He was very alert by the time they got here and then they left. He continued to sit for awhile and I asked if his wife would be driving. She said yes. I told him if they needed anything to call us.d

He was noted at 10:36 to be unresponsive in the chair as well as pale and limp. He was moved to the floor where he had agonal breathing and HR &gt;100. His neck was tilted to facilitate respirations. He was clammy and continued to be unresponsive for 90 seconds. EMS called. He had a period of postictal agitation with bilateral lower extremity failing for approximately 20 seconds. He then became responsive but still pale and clammy. He moved to a sitting position after 4 minutes of being awake and alert. EMS arrived, assessed him and left without transport. He left with his cousin who is driving him home. Instructed him to seek medical care for evaluation of this and prior episodes. Instructed him to seek clearance before next vaccination.

Within a couple more hours the chills subsided and replaced by elevated temperature by about 7pm (around 102 degrees).  Along with the elevated temperature my heart rate increased significantly to about 160 bpm.  With the current state of my hyperthyroidism I experience somewhere between 100-120 bpm normally.  At around 9pm my temperature reached 102.8 degrees, the heart rate was not decreasing, and a headache started coming in.  I took NyQuil to subside the pain and eventually was able to fall asleep despite the elevated heart rate. The following morning the temperature went down to 101 degrees; my whole body was experiencing soreness.  My heart rate decreased to around 140 bpm.  As the day went on the adverse effects starting wearing off; by the evening everything was back to normal levels.

                                                The patient received his 2nd dose of Moderna (LOT#, site, time unavailable) at an outside clinic the morning of 2/10/21 and presented to the ED with coughing and hypoxia (sp02 occasionally dropping into 70&#39;s) at 8 PM that day.  He had quadriplegic spinal paralysis as a result of a remote MVA and has been hospitalized and critically ill in the past due to recurrent UTI&#39;s and pneumonia with associated sepsis.   CT negative for pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral infiltrates.  Clinical presentation consistent with bilateral pneumonia and started on Rocephin/azithromycin.  He was initially stable in the hospital on 1-2 LPM 02.  The following evening he became febrile and acutely developed asystole without any pre-existing arrhythmia.  Resuscitation was attempted for 45 minutes but unsuccessful.  Overall, I suspect his death was related to bacterial pneumonia and resulting acute respiratory failure, complicated by his quadriplegia and autonomic dysreflexia but reported this event as it did occur within 2 days of receiving his 2nd Moderna vaccination.

                                                Patient was given a timer and asked to stay in the area.  He felt fine, so he walked to the bakery area and spoke with another pt, at the muffins display. He said his arm felt &#34;weird&#34; and said that happened to her, too.  He said he started feeling lightheaded and was leaning against the case.  He said, &#34; I blinked, fell to the ground and next he saw people standing around him.&#34;  He said, no nausea, just lightheaded and he hit the side of his head lightly. Staff helped him into a wheelchair and took him to the office.  I spoke with him in the office and asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital.  I received this information from the patient when I asked him if he could tell me what happened.  He was sweating and pale, but no nausea, no disturbance in his vision and his blood pressure wasn&#39;t elevated.   He told me again that he took no regular medication,  but a couple of years ago he had been dizzy after a tetanus shot.  I asked again if he had any discomfort or pain anywhere and he said only his arm felt sore near the shot.   I asked again if he felt like he would like to go to the hospital and he said no.  His family came and picked him up.

                                                On 04/25/21 at 12:30pm, patient received first dose of Moderna Vaccine. Patient was clear-headed and alert, but appeared anxious at the time of receiving the vaccine. 15 minutespost vaccination, patient suddenly fainted to ground within pharmacist?s sight. RPh on duty immediately ran to patient and called for help. Patient remained laying down, until he was able to open his eyes and safely sit up.   RPh on duty and front end managers were at the scene, patient was provided with water and offered 911/ambulance for help. Patient denied, stating he &#34;is fine&#34; and wanted to sit down before deciding before calling 911. Per pt, he didn?t think he hit his head when he fainted, but he fell on the side of his temple. RPH on duty observed patient for another 30 minutes until 1:15PM. Per patient, he only had a small breakfast and a kombucha in the morning. He also has history of fainting/anxiousness from vaccine about 20 years ago, and another fainting history while he was taking an exam. Patient mentioned he was very anxious prior to receiving the shot. Patient doesn&#39;t have any medical history and is not taking any medications or other illicit drugs. Patient lives by himself so he doesn&#39;t have anyone to watch over him when he goes home and at 1:15PM. Patient stated he still feels dizzy, nausea, and arm tingling. Front end manager called 911/Ambulance, medics arrived around 1:20PM. blood glucose, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen were checked. Medics also checked patient?s memory (asked what day it was, what year, who the president is, etc). Medics told patient that he can decide the following options:   1: to have family/friend to come pick him up and take him home OR 2: they can take him to nearby hospital for checkup. Patient lives alone so he decided to go to the hospital to have check up to &#34;make him feel better&#34;.  Patient was transported to the hospital around 1:37 PM. Both RPh on duty and front end managers were at the scene the whole time. Patient seemed to be in full command of his faculties and was following instructions at time of departure. Prior to leaving the premise, patient was advised to have someone accompany him at next dose appointment by RPh on duty.  Caring call was made around 9:20AM the next day 4/26/2021. LM was left and wait for patient response. Store Director and Pharmacy Manager were notified. Pharmacy District Manager was called for alternative administration options for second dose.

                                                34 YO male patient with no past medical history presents with sudden stroke-like symptoms including right sided arm and leg weakness, numbness, slurred speech and facial droop.  Symptoms lasted for roughly 45 minutes.  Suspected CVA.  MRI done in hospital was found to be consistent with microinfarcts in the left hemisphere of the brain, mostly along the cortical ribbon with a single lesion in the left parasagittal/lateral pons.  Full neuro and cardio workup is currently being done. ECHO w/ bubble study was weakly positive and plans are for TEE today.  Otherwise, no exact cause identified and few risk factors. Found out that the patent was taking no medications prior and had no past medical history and was otherwise a 34 YO healthy male, who received their first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 4/22.  3 days later the patient had this event.  The timing of everything makes me report this as the potential is there that this is a  vaccine ADE and plausible reason for this thrombotic event.

He received immediate follow up care by an RN onsite who took his vitals--pulse low (40bpm and 42bpm respectively at 9:41 am and 9:45 am). His blood pressure was 88/48 at 9:48 am. 911 was called immediately. They arrived within five minutes. They treated him but determined he did not need to be taken to a hospital. They took his glucose which was 87.  His vitals were stable by the time they made the decision to leave. They told him to continue sitting and monitoring for 15 minutes and have someone assist him in walking around some. Once he felt good to leave, he would be allowed to go home. A volunteer walked this gentleman out to his car when he felt well and was ready to leave. Client had no injuries from his fall.

                                                Patient came out of the immunization room (~12:29pm), and sat down in the waiting room, as he was told to do for 15 minutes following his vaccine.  At 12:30pm, the patient hit his head on the wall in the waiting room, slumped down in his chair, and began seizing for approximately 30 seconds. He, then, woke up, sat up in the chair and did not know what happened.  The last thing he remembered was getting his shot.  The medics arrived and finished the discussion with the patient.  He remained in the waiting  room for a bit, and felt better in about 30 minutes.

Each bout of pain would last to a maximum of 30 seconds, with varying lengths of time per bout. The pain radiating to the foot was pulsating per patient. Patient stated very sensitive chest feeling when the urge to urinate came. Through the emptying of the bladder, the sensitivity continues, and is gone after urination is finished. There can be some radiating pain from kidneys to the bladder at this point too.

I was told I was having a heart attack based off the high levels of an enzyme that&#39;s present when the heart is under stress. I was given a catheter through the artery in my wrist and my heart was clear. I was then diagnosed with Pericarditis. I am currently on medication and still having severe chest pains.

He was found to have an inferior STEMI with a thrombotic lesion in the proximal circumflex artery that was stented. He was also found to have a chronic right gastrocnemius deep vein thrombosis on a lower extremity ultrasound on 5/3/21. He is currently undergoing a hypercoagulable workup. There is potential concern that the thromboses may have been related to his COVID vaccine, as he received the second dose on 4/25/21.

                                                Patient said he felt warm and lightheaded. He was pale. I observed the patient and directed him to remain seating while monitoring him. I gave him some cool water and instructed him to remove his sweater. It was warm in the store so I placed a fan so he could cool off.  He waited about an additional 15 minutes in our consultation room after which time he said he was feeling better and was able to leave the store under his own volition. I tried calling about an hour later but received no response.

                                                Had an emergency appendectomy on May 9th, 2021. Woke up on Friday the 7th with mild stomach pain from my chest to my belly button. It felt like indigestion. Pain stayed mild until Saturday evening when I started vomiting and had diarrhea and by 11:00 pm I went to the ER where they did bloodwork and a ct scan. Bloodwork showed high white blood cell count, scan showed appendicitis. After 4.5 hours there, I had to leave to go to another hospital and wait for a bed. After being in intense pain for a few more hours, I finally had the emergency surgery at 11:00 am Sunday the 9th.

About a minute after administering the COVID-19 vaccine the patient reported feeling dizzy. He then passed out in the chair. We safely moved the patient to the floor. Then within approximately 15 seconds the patient sat up and then stood up on his own. We asked the patient to then be seated in the chair while he recovered. We called 911 as soon as he passed out. Patient was somewhat confused initially but quickly regained his bearings. He began sweating and said he was very hot. We checked his blood pressure and it was 100/80. Patient continued to recover and said he was feeling better. We had him wait until EMTs arrived. He told them he did not need any care. We took his blood pressure again and it was now 110/75. He said he felt well to go to the EMTs and pharmacist.

I went to be around 11pm.  Upon laying down I began to get dizzy and my heart began to pound rapidly.  This strong heart pounding would last 5 hours straight. An hour later my throat started to get a tight feeling with tingling under the chin area and my saliva production began to slow drying out my mouth.  Breathing became more labored and difficult.  At this time my heart was still beating strong.  I had intense Insomnia.  The one time that I tried to lay down; when my body would try to doze off for a second; my body would suddenly jolt me awake with an intense shaking and heart pounding.

Pain comes and goes, no connection to activity from what I can tell. Can feel sharp but is dulled. Lessens with mid-day rest. Symptoms come and go, and are either beginning to fade or I?m just getting used to it. Started taking aspirin just in case. Have not seen healthcare provider yet but have considered emergency and urgent treatment.

He said about 45 minutes after he received the vaccination, he started experiencing chest pains. He went to the  emergency room. He said they did 2 E.K.G&#39;s, 2 chest X-rays, and blood work.  He said they could not find the cause. He said the day after the vaccination he started experiencing shortness of breath and 1 week after the vaccination he started having swelling of the extremities.  He said his doctor doesn&#39;t know if the vaccination is the cause but warned him not to get the 2nd dose. He says to this day he still experiences a dull ache in his chest, shortness of breath and swelling of the extremities.  He said he is seeking treatment from a cardiologist. He said he is concerned about myocarditis.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine first dose. Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, i became dizzy, tachycardic and experiencing hot flashes. Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                Maybe 1 minute after receiving the vaccine I began to have a syncopal episode, the nurse practitioner thought that since I was heavy I began to have a vasovagal reaction.  From there they asked me to sit with the others waiting 15 minutes to make sure they were ok to leave. As I sat the symptoms would come and go, as if in a pattern, and then return.  The longer I sat there the more the symptoms began to grow, after sitting for an hour they decided to send me to the ER. At this time I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, sweating, I was itchy, I could not stop coughing, it was difficult to breath, and I had the worse headache.  When I got to the ER they gave me drugs to reverse the allergic reaction and told me they would watch me for a while. In the next 4 hours all of the symptoms started again and I had to get another round of the reaction drugs, I ended up going through this process 4 times before I was safe enough to go home the next day.  The provider that saw me and admitted me did not do any blood work or labs, they simply provided me with the reaction drugs when needed and my home medications.

A few minutes later he tells me he is dizzy and his vision is blurry so I bring him back into the vaccination room, give him some water and tell him to relax. 10 minutes later I check his BP which is elevated along with his pulse. I check again another 10 minutes later and it has lowered (pulse 80). BP still elevated so I mentioned it could be due to the nervousness to the reaction or just that he has hypertension and he should get it checked out. After a while his spouse came into the vaccination room and he said he was better and they left.

Since receiving the Moderna injection, the area that received the injection has felt sore.

                                                Patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  After 5 minutes of sitting, he decided to walk around the store to shop.  The patient experienced syncope and fell face first to the floor, cutting his lip.  The patient was bleeding from his lips.  Customers and pharmacy technicians tended to the patient.  He was alert and responsive the entire time.  The pharmacist called 911 and an EMS team was dispatched.  The patient rose and sat in a chair.  He was given water.  He stated that he just felt overheated and that the store was very warm.  EMS arrived, evaluated the patient, and stated that the patient just experienced a bout of syncope.  They asked if the patient would like to go to the hospital and the patient declined.  EMS left and the patient remained seated, resting for an additional 20 minutes.  The patient left the pharmacy.  The pharmacist spoke with the patient several hours later and the patient reported he was doing fine at home resting.  The pharmacist counseled the patient to contact his primary care provider regarding the incident.

                                                I had received my first Moderna vaccination into my left arm on April 15, 2021.  On April 27, 2021, from 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm, I engaged in light athletic exercises at a local park. In the evening, at around 9:30 pm, I started experiencing symptoms that I thought were similar to allergies (some occasional sneezing), and also felt a tightness or heaviness in my chest. I did not have a fever, but was seating. My overall impression was sympathetic nervous system activation. I thought I could sleep it off, but woke up at 4:30 am with a racing heart and elevated heart pressure and heart rate so I went to a local emergency room. My heart pressure and heart rate went down within the hour, and a chest X-ray was negative (e.g., my heart was OK, my lungs were OK). Additionally, EKG signals at the time of my admission into the ER were also OK. Blood work conducted at the hospital was also okay, potassium levels were at 3.4, when the average should be around 3.5, so I received two potassium pills. Oxygen saturation levels were at 99%.  At the time that I am writing this report, 10:52 pm ET on April 28th, I do still feel a slight heaviness of chest and some minor nasal congestion but I am doing significantly matter.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

                                                Pt was admitted for hemoptysis and a PE 6 days following the event. The PE was in the lung previously damaged by the tumor. The PE was small, the hemoptysis is due to likely a small arterial bleed. He&#39;s been bronched twice and as of 5/10 continues to bleed. The PE is small but we are unable ot anticoagulate due to ongoing hemoptysis. The CT shows ground glass opacities/bronchiectasis in the area where there is bleeding. It&#39;s mostly likely this is due to previous tumor resection and damage from his surgery and XRT and shrunken lung. However, the PE and hemoptysis DID occur within a week of the second covid vaccine so we felt it necessary to report. Pt has no history of DVT/PE. His LE u/s for DVT were negative.

Went out to assist him, but he had fainted. I grabbed his shoulder and shook him for about 30 seconds and he came to. He was a little disoriented and pale and pulse was fast. he refused us calling for an  ambulance. I directed him to sit on the floor. We sat and talked for about 30 minutes until he felt well enough to drive home

                                                Continuing peripheral neuropathy. On 4/21 I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm and within two minutes had a vasovagal reaction?tingling in my underarm, flush feeling face and stiffness and tingling in my upper lips.  That mostly subsided within 30 minutes as the dull arm pain set in.  Over the next 7 days my arm pain intensified some and moved up my shoulder and down my triceps and into my elbow. 4/28 I awoke with numbness and tingling in my pointer and middle finger of my shot (right) arm in addition to the arm pain and neck and shoulder muscle tightness. 5/8 Arm pain and finger numbness still present, I did some yard work that exacerbated the arm pain, and at this point it was the first day I recognized the pain as a specific intense nerve pain from my shoulder, down my triceps, across my forearm and into my pointer and middle fingers. From this point on the nerve pain and finger numbness/tingling persisted and included intermittent cold forearm/fingers. 5/11 Met with my primary physician who diagnosed me with cervical radiculopathy (C7). Prescribed physical therapy, prednisone and flexeril. 5/12 Had a massage w/aroma therapy, cryotherapy, and cupping. Provided some relaxation, but no change in nerve pain or symptoms. 5/14 First day of PT; neck and arms stretches, neck traction and nerve glides 5/17 Completed Medrol dose pack, steroids seemingly had no effect. Flexeril at night helped relax neck and shoulder muscles a bit. 5/20 (Today) Still have numbness and tingling in my pointer and middle fingers with specific nerve pain down my triceps, elbow, across forearm and into my two fingers that intensifies with activity and at night.  Intermittent cold sensation in right hand, underarm inflammation and tenderness, and general weakness of right hand and arm.

I felt body aches, exhaustion, coughing, chest was on fire and my fever got up to 102.5F. Acetaminophen took the fever back down to 100F. I still feel drained and have muscle aches with back pain.

Patient was then helped to the floor to lay down. We placed something under his head to make him more comfortable and then proceeded to elevate his feet. He remained laying down for about 5 minutes. Then the sweating stopped and he was no longer dizzy or pale.  We returned him to the sitting position for another 10 mins and then helped him test standing at which point he said he felt better and would like to go shopping. I walked around with him for about 5 minutes to make sure he continued to feel ok.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Bronchoscopy (left lung filled with blood). Concomitant products included COLECALCIFEROL (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) for an unknown indication.   On 31-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 28-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 03-May-2021, the patient experienced HAEMOPTYSIS (coughing blood) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness of chest) and NIGHT SWEATS (night sweats). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PULMONARY THROMBOSIS (blood clot in left lung, left lung filled with blood) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). an unknown date, the patient experienced HEADACHE (slight headache for 2 days). The patient was hospitalized on 03-May-2021 due to PULMONARY THROMBOSIS. The patient was treated with HEPARIN (intravenous) on 04-May-2021 for Clot blood, at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, HAEMOPTYSIS (coughing blood) and PULMONARY THROMBOSIS (blood clot in left lung, left lung filled with blood) had not resolved, CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness of chest) and NIGHT SWEATS (night sweats) outcome was unknown and HEADACHE (slight headache for 2 days) had resolved.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   They did some tests and found there was blood clot in his left lung and put him on blood thinner but he reported that the blood thinner made his bleeding more worse. The patient still in hospital and currently in ICU and the Doctors are unable to determine where the blood is coming from and unable to remove the clot. And he is still suffering with blood cough.

I reassured him that it was a good time to get this vaccine due to the pandemic and tried to keep in good spirits; he appeared a little nervous. After the vaccine, he stood up and walked over to our waiting area. He walked regularly and sat down. Patient was sitting for a few minutes before the pharmacy technician saw him &#34;slide&#34; down his chair and onto the floor. Patient was unconscious but easily arousable. Regained consciousness after a few seconds. Patient was still breathing and had a pulse. After patient regained consciousness, he said he has a history of passing out after getting his blood drawn/getting a vaccine.

Tried stretching to make it go away and it only got worse.  Shortness of breath came on and I asked a co-worker to take me to a local hospital as I thought I was having a heart attack.  The hospital gave me morphine and I passed out maybe 15-20 minutes later.  After I passed out, the hospital sent me to another hospital.  At the second hospital, I had a heart cath, heart echo, an EKG, and blood drawn both nothing indicated a heart attack.

                                                Heart rate became elevated and sustained roughly 12 hours after injection, at bed time.  My heart rate is generally 50-64 BPM during sleep. On this occasion it was 80-120, consistently staying at 100bpm for about 6 hours throughout the night, but never falling below 74.  Non-sleeping HR is also elevated the day after by 20-30bpm at rest.  I did experience a fever that started around 12hrs after injection.  Temp taken at 3am was at least 101.7 (orally under the tongue) which was reduced to normal levels by 5am after a small dose of Tylenol and Ibuprofen.  I also experienced a substantial headache at the same time as fever and HR increase.  The small dose of Tylenol and Ibuprofen taken for the fever lessened the severity of the headache. Pulse oximeter shower 97-99% oxygen and mimicked readings from wrist-worn Health tracker (Fitbit Sense).

At first I was just feeling tired but then I started shaking uncontrollably and muscles in my neck and back were spazzing out.  I lost all control of my body and fell over, convulsing for an unknown amount of time.  I apparently foamed and/or drooled all over myself.  I woke out of this effect around 3:30 AM.  This was Friday/Saturday.  Its Monday now.  I still cannot stand straight and cannot create complex thoughts in my mind.  I had a hard time perceiving colors for the first day and a half to two days after the seizure or stroke I suffered.  I still have a migraine that feels like an elephant is sitting inside my skull.  I still cannot perform complicated thoughts nor can I do complicated things with my hands because of a lack of motor skills.  I successfully pulled every muscle in my back and neck and cannot stand upright.  I&#39;m 35 and now need a cane.  Its already been 3 days and things really have not changed.  Won&#39;t catch me lining up for a booster shot.  NO THANK YOU.  I did not seek medical attention because lets face it the healthcare system is a joke I would have needed a ride to a hospital, increasing my odds of getting the virus, to have them hold me as long as they can to stab me and poke me and take samples, give me no results, and a humungo bill.  I will die before I go to a hospital ever again because the amounts of testing I required at the time would have covered back and neck and brain scans of various types and those tests are stupid expensive and 99% of the time I&#39;ve ever got one they said oh I&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong go see my friend who is a specialist blah blah blah and its the &#34;doctor-go-round&#34; where you blow all your money on morons that only care about lining their pockets.

On day 4 I was nauseous  all day up to day 9.  On day 5 I started feeling chest pain right below my ribs in the center of my chest. If I sat up it was very uncomfortable and if I layed down the pain seemed to lessen.  On day 4 it seemed to throw my stomach off and up to day 9 I seemed to me more constipated. On day 5-8 I felt extremely  lethargic and need to nap which is something that I never do

                                                Heart palpitations. Frequency fluctuates and is much more noticeable after a heavy/fatty meal and more pronounced when lying down or in the reclining position.  I don&#39;t remember the exact time it started, but it was soon after my second dose. It became more pronounced after I had a meal with deep fried foods.

Pharmacist ran out to patient and brought him to the floor to check his breathing. His breathing was steady and he was slowly coming back to consciousness. We immediately called 911 while all of this was happening. Upon questioning patient&#39;s clinician said he had been feeling light headed all day. When then the fire department came patient reported to them he had not eaten or drank anything all day. Ambulance came 10 minutes after fire and took him to the hospital for fluids.

                                                Last May 6, 2021, I recieved my 1st dose of MODERNA vaccine. For the last 5 days I don&#39;t feel any side effects on my body. But on the 6th day after my vaccination, I started to feel anxiety, insomnia, brain fog followed by  depression, panic attack and rapid heart palpitation and it lasted for 3 weeks. Until now, there are times that I can still feel the rapid heart palpitation.

                                                After the vaccine I had chills, fever, shortness of breath and body aches that lasted for a short time. A long term effect that I noticed is a difficulty breathing, heightened allergies (seasonal) and frequent body aches. I also feel tired often. I contacted my doctor a couple of week after my symptoms and as of today we are still trying to do more tests and figure out what options I have. They ran some breathing tests and determined I have some damage in my lungs, which may be from the Moderna or when I had Covid in November.

No treatment Body aches, fatigue, abdominal cramps, dry lips, dry mouth and throat, sinus pressure, nasal passage closed on one side and closing on the other, pale white skin on back of throat on the right side, chest tightness while laying face-down,  minor nausea, and very tired but unable to stay asleep all night.  Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

                                                Around 1:30am 2/5/2021 I started feeling feverish, chills, slight headache, body and muscle aches, slightly increased heart rate. I took my temperature with a digital forehead thermometer and no increase in temperature was noted. This could be a false reading given my symptoms. I took Tylenol around 10pm the evening before to prevent possible fever and aches. Now around 8:20am I still have described above symptoms. I?m continuing to rest and drink plenty of water.

                                                5-10 minutes after patient received vaccination he complained of feeling disoriented.  Patient was seated  approximately 6 feet in front of pharmacy counter and I went out to check on him.  Patient was sweating profusely and again complained of feeling disoriented.  I asked if he was feeling nauseous and he said no.  I placed a cold compress on the back of his neck and had him try to relax and breath evenly.   I then  got a ice pack for him and wrapped it in towels to protect the patient from the cold.  Offered patient some water which he denied.  Offered to call an ambulance and patient denied.  I took the patients blood pressure and it was 140/84. Patient states this is slightly higher than normal for him.  After 5 more minutes patient began to recover quickly.  Sweating stopped and his color returned to normal.  Patient stated he felt much better.  I took patients blood pressure again and it was 133/94.  Patient stayed under observation for another 15 minutes and said he felt fine and left the pharmacy.

I have been drinking Gatorade when I?m able to make it to my kitchen and taking acetaminophen.  The events started approximately 7 hours after vaccination and have been constant to this point.

Had been sitting at computer for at least six hours straight (and probably smoking more pot than I should have), felt dizzy and short of breath, got up, ended up losing consciousness on the living room floor. Woke up a few minutes later and put myself to bed; felt fatigue, aches, chills, and like I might have been running a mild fever. Slept unusually well; woke up this morning feeling perfectly fine. Not particularly concerned but felt like I should report it.

                                                Sinus pressure started the same night as the vaccine. The symptoms gradually worsened throughout the night. He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses. Then suddenly had a significant flow of blood from his RIGHT nostril. As of this evening he still has congestion in his sinuses, and intermittent tightness in his chest.

I came to check on him and gave him water and orange juice to drink.  I checked his blood pressure twice, approximately 2 minutes apart.  The first blood pressure reading was 73/46mmHg and a heart rate or 46bpm.  The second reading was 110/74mmHg and HR 66bpm.  After the second BP reading, patient stated that he was feeling better.  This was just likely vasovagal syncope.   Patient remained on the floor because it was a cooler location for approximately 15 minutes and was feeling better and went home with his father-in-law and mother-in-law.

About 10 minutes into the 15 minute observation. Patient reported to the observer that he was having just a little bit of difficulty swallowing and felt a little warm. He denied shortness of breath, he was brought into the evaluation area. He was  mildly uncomfortable but was able to speak in full sentences, did not appear short of breath and was articulate and cooperative with the exam. Initial vitals revealed that his pulse is 122,O2 sat was 98%,  blood pressure was 220/120.( Denied known HTN) He had very mild wheezes bilaterally.(Denied H/O asthma or wheezes) He reported feeling warm. He asked for something to drink and after taking several sips stated that his swallowing felt a little bit better describe the situation that is the back of his throat but a little lower. Oral exam revealed slightly red and posterior pallet with chronically enlarged tonsils without exudate, neck is supple, no adenopathy. He was able to swallow without difficulties. He was warm. He was given a cold compress which he stated improved his symptoms. Reports he does not have underlying asthma, has not had such a reaction before and had not been ill in the preceding days,   patient was given a chewable Zyrtec. After approximately five minutes blood pressure was re-checked and it was 160/88 with a heart rate of 98 and O2 sat is 98 wheezes appeared to improve slightly but were persistent. Patient stated in general he was not feeling any better and feeling slightly worse BP was again noted to be 220/110. Concern was for an allergic reaction as demonstrated by the wheezes and sensation of difficulty swallowing but given his persistent significantly elevated blood pressure epi-was not indicated but emergent transport was. 911 had already been called for transport to the hospital for further evaluation.  EMS was transferred care. He was transported to the hospital. He was discharged several hours later.  Review of ER notes revealed he was hypertensive at 187/87 with a pulse of 95 ,he did not have any active wheezes or oral pharyngeal swelling on their exam. he was given a G.I. cocktail for his &#34;itchy&#34; throat.

                                                Patient had flu-like symptoms while deployed at start of pandemic (approx. Jan/Feb 2020), but testing was unavailable. His symptoms (URI-like) completely resolved. He received Moderna dose 1 on 02 Feb 2021 without incident, and Moderna dose 2 on 02 Mar 2021. Approximately one week later, he developed mild, dull, diffuse chest pain and shortness of breath which has persisted since.   He was seen in clinic for chest pain and dyspnea on 15 Mar 2021. Patient noted his chest hurt ?all over? especially with deep or with normal inspiration. Reclining, laying down, and sleeping on his right side increased his pain (he did not trial sleeping on his left). Leaning forward decreased pain. He endorsed feeling short of breath, and stated he felt light headed twice while going up stairs, without passing out. He denied recent illnesses and other symptoms. He is a very physically fit Active Duty Marine, who has continued running despite his symptoms. During this encounter and later f/u encounter, he expressed he did not believe running made his symptoms significantly worse.  Vital signs were within normal range and he did not appear in distress. Cardiac and lung exam were normal, and no friction rub or murmur was appreciated. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, with HR consistent with his known, athletic-type normal variant heart rate. No other abnormalities were detected. Due to limited ancillary services within clinic, he was sent to USNHO ED for evaluation. There, he had basic labs (including Trop I) drawn, which were normal. EKG and portable chest xray were also unremarkable, and he was discharged with Motrin 800mg PO TID.  He was seen in clinic again 29 Mar 2021 for continued, unchanged symptoms, and reported he had been taking his Motrin only in the mornings and afternoons. Vital signs were unchanged (normal limits). Exam, including heart and lung, were normal. EKG again demonstrated sinus bradycardia, consistent with his normal resting heart rate. He was started on empiric therapy for pericarditis. He was released from clinic and will follow up in several weeks.

The pharmacy technician called the pharmacist immediately and when pharmacist arrived patient was alert and talking. He states that he always faints after he gets IVs placed or shots in his back. He states that this is normal and happens whenever he gets shots. EMT was called as a precaution because he hit his head as he fainted. Patient was okay and taken by the EMT to get evaluated.

All took place in less than 2 minutes.  The pharmacist gave him a bottle of water and he waited in the pharmacy for a total of 30-35 minutes.

Patient stated that his has never happened before and didn&#39;t remember anything beyond receiving the vaccine until he woke up. Patient refused BLS transport. Driver stated they were self transporting to the ER for further evaluation.

                                                After patient received his shot, while sitting during the 15 min waiting period. The patient began getting lightheaded and hot, his color went out of him and his eyes began rolling back in his head.  His eyelids turned a purple color and he appeared to momentarily stop breathing.  Myself and another pharmacist got him on the ground and supported his head with a coat.  When he &#34;came to&#34; and was talking to us.  He described feeling better on the cold floor and his color began coming back.   I was speaking with him the entire time.  While we were out with his 9-1-1 was called and paramedics arrived 15 min later.  by the time paramedics had arrived the patient had gotten up and back into the chair himself, was lucid and had color back in his face.  Paramedics arrived and took over.  He was given the green light from them and remained in the pharmacy area for a total of about 30 minutes before heading home. The patient was admittedly nervous for the shot and had not eaten or had anything to drink the whole day to that point. I believe he passed out from a variety of factors not related to the actual ingredients in the vaccine but cannot confirm this.

He was instructed to sit back down, stay for a total of 30 minutes and let the pharmacist know if his condition worsens (his mother was with him). I, asked a technician to provide him with a bottle of cold water. After 4 to 5 minutes, his mother notified me his condition had worsened and the patient looked pale and sweat was visible on his forehead. Another pharmacist stepped in to assist because I was with a different patient. This pharmacist, aligned 3 to 4 chairs so the patient could lie down. He stayed with him until he stated he felt better, which was approximately 5 minutes later. For the record, the patient did not mention a headache or symptoms of a migraine. Patient called pharmacy on 4/14/21 and stated he&#39;s been suffering from a headache/migraine since the day of administration. The pharmacist recommended to follow up with PCP.

                                                Sharp chest and shoulder pains (heart attack like symptoms) started on Sunday evening and I went to the emergency room. The emergency room cardiologist did an EKG and echocardiogram and determined there was something abnormal. The cardiologist then did a cardiac catheterization and the diagnosis was pericarditis and myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart and damage to the muscle. I spent two days in the hospital and upon discharge I was sent home with three different medications that I will have to take for the next couple of months.

An hour later I felt it was difficult to catch my breath.  After getting medical attention (benadryl intravenously and fluids intravenously), the next day I had chest pain and continued labored breathing. Two days after the vaccine I still have persisting labored breathing.

                                                First I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to light, I was also feeling light headed and dizzy on my walk back to the car. (about 30 minutes after injection). I had someone else drive because I felt like I could not drive in my condition. On the ride home, about 40 minutes after injection, I began to have an increased heart rate and had a hard time swallowing. It was also slightly difficult to breathe. I felt like my head was cloudy and I had a hard time concentrating. I felt like my brain was responding about a half a second slower to what I saw. Like if I wanted to turn my head, I would think try to turn my head and my body would react a second later. When I got home, about 1 hour after the injection, my girlfriend told me my hands were freezing cold. I was also having a hard time walking in straight because I was so dizzy. I was still having some minor trouble breathing and swallowing. It was difficult to drink water. After about 2 hours my breathing returned to normal. My mind was cloudy all day, I felt like I was drunk.  On the second day, I woke up with an intense headache. It lasted for 3 days. My arm started to hurt on the second day as well, no pain at all the first day. My head was still cloudy and I had difficulty trying to recall memories or answer questions. By the third day this was basically gone. I was extremely tired for three days total. My mind remain cloudy for about a week.

Returned to work and began feeling &#34;tingling and numbness in my legs, pressure in my head, ringing in my ears, my arms got heavy and it was hard to move, I had trouble using the phone so told coworker to get his boss&#34; He stated, &#34;I was slouching in my chair, sliding out of it, and my eyesight was blurry&#34;. Nurse was summoned and laid him flat w/feet elevated. He ate a &#34;few donuts and peanut butter crackers after his shot&#34;. He felt better when lying flat but as soon as he sat up, symptoms returned three times. BP-142/88 initially, then rose to 149/106, Pulse-92 10 min. later. On third attempt to sit up, BP 153/99. Patient says his BP has never been above 128/84 and that he just had his annual physical two weeks prior and it was good. EMTs were called since symptoms kept coming back. BP was 170/100s. Was transported to Hospital. He said they did a &#34;brain test&#34; having him touch his nose w/his finger, slid heels down shins, etc. but no other testing was done.&#34; He was discharged to home around 3PM and was told &#34;he had an anxiety attack&#34;. He said they never really asked him what happened. Later that evening at 9:30PM, symptoms returned and he had to lie down. He had &#34;pressure in his head, ringing in ears, and couldn&#39;t get up.&#34; Wife called EMTs. His vision was blurry. BP 150/110 upon exertion (movement) and 138/103 at rest, Pulse btw 105-110. He refused going back to hospital since they did nothing the 1st time. I spoke with him Monday morning and he had seen his Dr. She put him on a Beta blocker still his BP was still elevated. He still feels &#34;cotton headed, muddled, w/constant ringing in ears.&#34; Did not go to work on Monday. Felt frustrated that ER &#34;blew it off and said it was anxiety, which he said he was not feeling anxious until his symptoms began and would not go away&#34;.

                                                On Sat, May 8th around 4:30 PM, while sitting and watching TV, I felt a numbing shock to the left side of my body (particularly left cheek, my entire left arm, and legs) and got up to check myself in the mirror. I got chills and my teeth began chattering, but my arm in particular felt like it was on fire. I thought I was having a stroke so I managed to drive myself to the ER where I was admitted. When the doctors performed the initial tests on me, my skin felt dull on my left side but my arm felt a burning-numbness to it. The doctors performed two MRIs, a CT scan, an Echo Cardiogram, Blood Tests, Blood Pressure readings, and a Covid-19 test and found no problems in my brain or heart, no Covid infection, and a healthy cardiovascular system. I was released May 10th with the diagnosis of a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) of unknown cause. When I woke up today on 5/11, the burning-numbing sensation returned to my arm again (even as I type this) but this time I know it is not a stroke. I have had no medical history, exercise regularly, have a healthy diet (vegetarian/vegan for more than seven years), the only thing I&#39;ve done recently is had my first Moderna shot injected intramuscularly in my left arm, the same arm where this burning-numbness is taking place. I thought it is best proactive to report this event and if there is any correlation to the vaccine

                                                After a day of fatigue and fever, which I experienced with the first shot too and didn&#39;t worry me, around 4 PM on the day after I got the shot I started having difficulty breathing. It felt like there was a large pressure pushing down on my diaphram keeping me from taking even small breaths, and if I tried I&#39;d cough. After about two hours of this I took ibuprofen and that relieved the pressure entirely. It came back around 2 AM and once I got up around 8 I took more ibuprofen, but I still feel some pressure.

                                                Night of receiving vaccine I had very intense aching in my lower left back. Felt somewhat like a muscle pulling. I could barely turn. Soon after I began having a pulled muscle pain in my chest. I also have a big, hard lump in my chest. The pain has been going on for over a month. Lower back pain comes and goes but chest muscle pain is always there. None of this was happening prior to the vaccine.

Patient can only use his eyes to respond &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34; since he is non-verbal and when he would not respond to his mother&#39;s questions with his eyes she became very panicked and alerted the pharmacy staff.  When I got to the patient he was very clammy, sweating, and breathing heavy.  She said his eyes had rolled back in his head and his tongue had turned blue.  I propped his legs up on a chair and took his blood pressure with an automatic blood pressure cuff and it was 164/124 with pulse 95.  I decided to contact EMS for assistance. Retook BP  few minutes later and it was the same.  EMS arrived and stated it was most likely a reaction to being afraid of needles but would take him to get checked out.

I saw patient on 3/24/21 after 2nd dose (given to right arm on 3/18/21), and at that time he was complaining of right axillary swelling with some redness as well as persisting left axillary swelling.  Patient had also had other symptoms (fevers, aches, chest discomfort/cough) in the few days after the vaccines that had resolved.  I consulted with our ID specialist, who saw the pt on 4/16/21, and at that time only left axillary fullness was noted.

                                                While laying in bed to sleep, my heart rate was 90 BPM when my normal resting heart rate is in the high 50s. While waiting to see if it would slow down, my heart rate went up up 120 BPM and remained elevated for approximately a half an hour. I went to urgent care and arrived after my heartbeat was normal. An EKG showed a premature heartbeat but they detected no other issues and sent me home. I was later given a Holter monitor for 24 hours which did not detect a premature heartbeat or any issues. On 06/08, while resting, my heart rate slowly climbed to 120 BPM for no apparent reason, then slowed down again after an hour.

                                                This morning when I woke up I had a slight headache on the back of my right side. I felt a wave within and my heart rate rose. I was really hungry and ate 3 or 4 bananas. I started to feel uneasy and felt tightness in my chest and pain below the injection site. My heart rate rose into the 100s. Normal RHR= 47-55. I was burping small burps. I was worried and started looking up ERs and contacting family. This event of immense amount tightness and uneasy feeling that lasted about 30-45. Temp was 99.4 then dropped to normal. I thought I was having a heart attack. I called my sister and my symptoms waned. I have had several &#34;cycles&#34; though out the day of feeling very uneasy and slight chest discomfort, but nothing on the level of this morning, or enough to make me go to the ER. It does seem that why I lay down or bend over when sitting down there is discomfort in my chest and I feel uneasy.

He was sitting in a chair and slumped over. I caught him and was able to get him to floor in lying position while having my technician call emergency number. Patient came to in a couple of minutes and seemed a little disoriented. We got him a bottle of water and a cold rag for his face. He was clammy and sweating. When EMT arrived, they checked him out and cleared him to leave on his own.

                                                36 yo man with BMI 28.8, current smoker, presented with 2 days of waxing and waning chest pain/pressure radiating to his left arm.  His pain improved with ASA, but then later recurred.  He has one younger sister with no known history of premature CAD.  His EKG showed inferior ischemic changes, but no STEMI and his troponin rose to 5.2.  Given concern for ongoing ischemia, he was taken to the cath lab where he underwent PCI with a DES to the RCA.  He required temporary pacing during the procedure.  There was also clot that likely embolized distally, so he was started on Tirofiban.  He is now chest pain free and hemodynamically stable.

                                                I got the vaccine at 6PM on Friday and on Saturday morning around 8 AM started having heart palpitations, I was also feeling tired and a little uneasy.  Spent the day resting in bed, drank a lot of water but when it did not go away until 6 PM, I decided to call a doctor for teleconsultation. She suggested that if I am not having any shortness of breath or chest pain then there is nothing to worry about and advised to drink plenty of fluids and getting some more rest.   Followed her advice ate light dinner(Lentil Soup with rice) and went to bed. The next day I was feeling better, no more palpitations; the whole episode lasted one day.  It&#39;s been three months now, I have been jogging/running regularly but never had the palpitations again.

It is painless, I would not even know it was there were it not for sticking my tongue out to brush it in the mornings. It only happens overnight, now 2 consecutive mornings since the 2nd dose of moderna. No edema, sore throat, or swelling. I have photos that I can send. It looks like I ate a blue colored candy, but I didn?t. I wake up like this from sleep.

Neck stiffness and soreness began Thursday evening.  Severe chest pains early Saturday morning (3am).  Taken to urgent care - EKG showed irregularity and high level of troponin. Transported from there to the hospital.  They did angiogram, and diagnosed me with pericarditis. The on call physician believes this was most likely caused by the second dose of the vaccine.

The day after I received the vaccine I was very tired feeling, my left arm very sore, and I noticed my heart rate was staying higher. At one point at work my heart rate went up to 140 bpm. I went to the doctor after work and was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia. I was prescribed metoprolol for tachycardia. I do not know what caused my heart rate to increase, but the metoprolol has my rate controlled now. I felt the fatigue lasted about 3-4 days and then I was back to normal.

                                                On day three, I had redness and hot on the site. It felt thickened and it was swollen and itchy.  I got right on Cepra - Urgent Care visit like I was given for last vaccine. The symptoms subsided after four days.  I am having heart palpitations about two weeks - I notice it a lot - I notice it intermittently but often; Varies in intensity and I was woken up where my heart was beating very loudly - I tried to calm myself down because my heart rate wouldn&#39;t go down. That&#39;s never happened to me before. Even right now I can feel my heart palpate more than I should be able to feel it. Today at 01:00 PM I am going in for an EKG and have my heart monitored. I am gong to clinic where my Dr practices. I saw a PA for a work injury - for worker&#39;s comp from the vaccine -  so I have had an EKG already- result was normal rhythm acutely at the time.

I called 911 as soon as he began to lose consciousness and while I was on he phone with 911, he regained consciousness and had color in his face again and felt much better. EMS and the firefighters checked him out and all of his vitals were normal and he could walk upright just fine.

                                                patient received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. After receiving in our immunization room, he left the room and then shortly walked over to the pharmacy in-window and told the pharmacy tech that he did not feel well and felt dizzy. Tech had him go sit down in the waiting room and went and got the nurse, who went out to check on patient. Patient was slumped in the waiting room chair with eyes closed and very sweaty. Patient said he wanted water, so staff quickly got him water. After a few sips, patient&#39;s head rolled back and he lost consciousness for roughly 10 seconds before waking up startled and confused. Ambulance was already called and when the arrived they triaged the patient for around 15 minutes. After about 15 minutes the patient seemed much better and the paramedics decided it was OK for him to leave and drive himself home.

A shopper alerted our staff and when I came to check on him, he was just rousing but had his eyes closed due to blurred vision. He was able to speak and look directly at me. He said this reaction had never happened to him before. He seemed jittery probably due to the reaction. Asked for water and was able to drink. He said that he most likely hit his head and compressed his finger during the fall but feels okay. We are not sure how long he was out for.

I aroused him and he regained consciousness after about 1 to 2 minutes. Blood pressure check at that time was 89/43, pulse 59. Patient was able to speak, said he passed out, bumped his forehead and lip. I gave ice pack for head. EMS arrived after less than 10 minutes, check vital signs and forehead and lip condition. Blood pressure was too low, so EMS transported him to local hospital. Hospital gave 1 liter IV fluid, advised him to get second dose on time and discharged him same day.

                                                Patient noted he had no adverse reactions with his first dose of the Covid vaccine or other vaccines he has had in the past.  He was informed that  there are more chances of side effects experienced with the second dose ( such as headaches, flu like symptoms, nausea).  He was directed to stay in the store for at least 15 minutes and to inform the pharmacy immediately if he felt anything  out of the ordinary.  He said he walked down several aisles then started feeling light headed and having tunnel vision.  He was on his way back to the pharmacy when he ended up on the ground.  He does not remember how he ended up laying on the ground.  He said his head did not hurt but does not know if he hit it.  When started regaining conscience, his right arm and leg jerked somewhat then calmed down.  When he came to, he said he didn&#39;t feel dizzy when he tried to sit up.  The ambulance was called so he was instructed to remain laying on the floor.  The EMT personnel asked him his name, the date, and where he was while he was laying down and after sitting up on the floor.  He answered correctly both times.  He was then asked to sit down on a chair to take his blood pressure.  The EMT personnel were having trouble   getting a good reading so he was transported to Hospital.

                                                This morning I gave a patient a moderna vaccine. During administration the patient expressed his fear of needles. After the vaccine I asked the patient to have a seat and wait in the waiting area for 15 minutes. He went and sat down for just a couple minutes and stood up to look for his spouse and when he stood up he passed out and hit the floor face first. I ran out there to check on him and he was unresponsive and bleeding a lot. My team immediately called 911. I started tapping him and slightly shaking him and after a few minutes he woke up. He told me the only thing he remembers is feeling dizzy then woke up on the floor. EMS showed up a few minutes later and took the patient to the hospital.

                                                patient was doing well as outpatient with no significant issues post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.  Received 1st Moderna COVID19 vaccine on 2/3/2021.  Developed a rash, biopsy showed lichenoid dermatitis, but no other symptoms after that first shot.  Received 2nd Moderna COVID19 vaccine on 3/12/21 and rash persisted (may or may not have worsened, hard to know from patient report) and the patient presented to medical attention on 3/23/21 acutely short of breath and hypoxic, after being able to exercise (walk 2 miles every other day, etc) prior.  Found to have biopsy proven lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis with diffuse alveolar damage/ARDS requiring supplemental oxygen.  Started on systemic steroids without response.  Also with concurrent mild transaminitis.  From prior recent labs, LFTs were normal prior to presentation with hypoxia.

                                                My left arm was sore about 2-3 hours after the shot. Later that evening, my arm was worse and I could not lift my arm up past my chest. Around about 11:00 p.m., I began to feel chills, aches and pains. I was sluggish, tired and had no energy. The next day when I woke-up around 10:00 a.m., I still had the aches and pains, all the way down to the bottoms of my feet. My body hurt to stand. The aches and pains continued that evening, along with diaherra and chest pains. The pains continued through Saturday and the chest pains got worse. The pain would radiate from my chest to my left arm, to my left shoulder, and into my back between my shoulder blades. Then by 7:00 p.m. or so on Saturday, my chest started to feel better and my aches and pains were not as bad. I was then woken up around 12:00 a.m. or so, on Saturday/Sunday with severe chest pains again with the radiation of pain. This also came along with the aches and pains and diahrrea. This has continued through to today, Monday. I tried to do simple putting my dishes away and loading up my dishwasher, and couldn&#39;t complete the task due to the chest pain and severe aches and pains all over my body. I have tried to treat the symptoms with over-the-counter medications which would include: Advil II, Pepto Bismal, Alka-Seltzer, hot showers, hot baths, luke warm baths, vapor bath soaks and a heating pad.

At about 5 minutes, I started to feel light-headed and nauseous as if I just had blood taken or an IV in my, likely a drop in blood pressure. I was reading a book, put it down on my lap as I couldn&#39;t focus on reading and considering to get help. At that moment, I passed out, hunched over in my chair staring at the floor.   This moment likely lasted for about 1 minute, but felt like 20. I was in a dream like state and at one point had a series of images and/or memories flash by in a sequence. Then, I felt like I was half asleep but couldn&#39;t tell what I was staring at but knew that I had to &#34;wake up&#34;.   Then , I was surrounded by people who helped me up. At this moment I felt very weak and tired and was sweating profusely. My right hand felt very weak.   About 10 minutes later, I started feeling better. I was given water which seemed to help. I would have waves of mild nausea come and go that eventually subsided. I also felt random cramping around my stomach/lower chest area and lower right side rib cage area.   At about 15 -20 minutes felt confident to walk to the bathroom and throughout the store. Eventually, I felt confident to drive safely home.  At the time of writing this (approx 2 hours later), I&#39;m feeling random sensations/feelings of itchyness throughout my body. No sign of hives.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) in a 37-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 045A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).    On 19-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 21-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and THYROID HORMONES DECREASED (Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) and THYROID HORMONES DECREASED (Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 21-Mar-2021, Blood thyroid stimulating hormone: low (Low) Low. On 21-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation (abnormal) Atrial fibrillation. On 21-Mar-2021, Stress echocardiogram: atrial fibrillation (abnormal) Atrial fibrillation.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications were not provided. The patient was in emergency room for few hours and was given 3 doses of apixaban (Eliquis) for treatment for the events. The patient was on holter monitor for 3 days.  The patient reported, his thyroid level comes near normal after one and half weeks.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. He is pilot and kept off the duty for Atrial fibrillation.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Next evening at 7:30 went to ER with mild chest pains and blood pressure peaking at 225/104, with a resting heart rate of 100 bpm. EKGs, chest X-ray, and heart enzyme tests confirmed no emergent heart condition. Was released after 3 hours observation when blood pressure dropped to 170/100 without medication. On 4/24/21 my blood pressure was 160/100, so physician prescribed 0.1mg of clonidine to take as needed. Before now I was never prescribed blood pressure medication. Will record my blood pressure for two weeks with a follow up visit on 5/07/21.

Within the next ten minutes  became dizzy then fell out of the chair onto the floor where he struck his nose and eye area on the floor. Patient lost consciousness for about 30 seconds then woke up. Patient had profuse bleeding from the nose and dizziness for 15 minutes.  We had patient sit on the floor and press towels to his head to stop the bleeding. We gave an instant cold pack to patient. We called 911 and requested medical assistance due to the amount of bleeding that patient was experiencing. EMS arrived and took charge of the scene. EMS providers attempted to help the patient to his feet and he fell again. EMS decided to transport the patient to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Approximately five minutes after shot, my face began to tingle. My heart felt like it was racing. I had difficulty focusing with my eyes, it felt like my eyes were rolling.  My feet began to tingle. My spouse honked the car horn for assistance. I reached for my epi pen but did not administer it because a doctor was approaching our car. I checked my pulse rate on my iWatch, it was 168.  My throat began to feel tight. The doctor listened to my lungs and heard wheezing. A paramedic came over as well. My blood pressure was taken but I do not remember what my blood pressure was.  At that point the doctor said I should use my epi pen. The paramedic said I should use Benadryl. They were in disagreement, and the paramedic said I should take 50mg of Benadryl and had me put my car seat in recline position.  It was at the point they noticed that my face and chest were flushed.  They had me drink water.  We waited about 45 minutes. My lungs were checked again by the paramedic and I was told my lungs were clear, my blood pressure was taken second time but I do not remember my blood pressure, my face was less flush,  my pulse was in the 70?s.  I still felt tingling on my scalp and feet, my throat felt like it had a lump in it.  I Began to feel nauseous.  I was given the okay to leave and go home.  I had nausea until the evening the next day.  I did not eat until dinner time the night after my shot.  I only drank water.  The next day I experienced shortness of breath performing  duties that typically do not make me out of breath.  I had to take many breaks and used my abuterol inhaler two times.

I have received multiple diagnostic tests so far and to the best of my knowledge they only show that my heart is skipping beats and no other damage or issues have been found.

                                                Noticed heart palpitations approximately 24-36 hours after first Moderna vaccine.  Symptoms have been persistent since 4/1.  I decided to let it play out to see if they would subside in a few days/weeks.  The palpitations did not, so I went to see my PCP, who noticed the abnormality.  We did an electrocardiogram and I was referred to a cardiologist.   Had an initial consultation with cardiologist,  Echocardiogram, and a follow up here in the next few days.

The symptoms persisted for a couple days and got progressively worst where it was uncomfortable to lie down or sleep without being propped up. It wasn&#39;t painful but it felt like there was a lot of pressure right in the center of my chest below my rib cage as if someone was pressing on it.  The symptoms lasted for about a week with the peak of the symptoms on 5/20.

This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness) in a 37-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Eczema. Concurrent medical conditions included Skin infection (Infection on mid to lower back, possible eczema per patient). Concomitant products included TRIAMCINOLONE for Eczema, CEPHALEXIN [CEFALEXIN] for Skin infection.    On 09-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis), HYPOAESTHESIA (Hypoaesthesia) and PALLOR (Pallor). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis), HYPOAESTHESIA (Hypoaesthesia) and PALLOR (Pallor) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 09-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 99 (normal) 99.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The reporter states that the patient received shot and then blacked out a minute or two later. The reporter called 911, and while on the phone the patient regained consciousness and felt much better.  EMS checked him out and all of his vitals were normal and he could walk upright just fine.

At 1537, client asked EMT is it normal to feel a little warm and for my lips to tingle?? PHN overheard and escorted client to the zero gravity chair while EMT obtained the E kit and vital sign equipment. Upon further assessment, the client stated, ?about 5 minutes before my 30 minutes were up, my lips started to feel weird and slowly increased then plateaued. I feel flush and like my heart rate is elevated.? Client was not experiencing any shortness of breath, or tightness in his throat. PHN had client remove his mask to assess his lips. Client?s lips were slightly swollen with few darker pigmentations in areas. PHN also had client look at his lips, to assess if this was his baseline, and client stated, ?my lips have more color than normal.? Client?s skin was slightly red on his face. Client was alert and oriented times 4. Benadryl was offered to client by PHN and client refused. Client stated, ?I want to see if it goes back to normal on its own, and I don?t want to be drowsy.?

At 1553, client stated, ?the tingliness is decreasing.? At 1557, client stated, ?I don?t feel flush anymore. I almost feel 100% normal, like 10% tingly compared to earlier.? At 1557, PHN assessed client?s lips and they appeared to be less swollen with pigmentation that was appropriate to race. Vital signs taken at 1600 (heart rate 78, oxygen 97%, blood pressure 126/96). Vital signs taken at 1606 (heart rate 81, oxygen 96%, blood pressure 128/84). Client is allergic to avocados and said that his throat swells up when he eats them, and he is also allergic to dairy.

                                                Patient arrived for 2nd Moderna vaccine today 5/30/21. He explained that he sometimes becomes faint or passes out after having blood drawn. Inquired as to whether patient had eaten this morning and he stated that he had. Advised patient we would have him stay in the pharmacy area longer just to ensure that he didn&#39;t have any ill effects from the vaccine before returning home. Within a few seconds of receiving the vaccine, patient stated that he was &#34;starting to feel it&#34;. At that point, rather than have him move to the recovery area, I decided to keep him in the IMZ booth and told him &#34;I&#39;m going to just keep you in here and we will talk for a while&#34;. Upon asking patient what his plans for the day were, he became mildly disoriented and I held his shoulders to ensure that he didn&#39;t fall from the chair. He temporarily lost consciousness (10-15 seconds) while still seated in the chair. Upon regaining consciousness, he was alert and responsive and did not show any ill effects aside from feeling warm. I had patient sit on the floor and placed ice packs on back of his neck and gave him another to place on his forehead and chest. Patient sat and spoke with me for appx 25 more minutes before leaving the area with his wife.

This makes me think the &#34;bruise&#34; was engorged capillary vessels that were not flowing due to the clot.

                                                2 weeks after my second vaccine shot, I experienced heart palpitations, which I rarely/never experience. The palpitations were strong, and particularly when I was lying down and breathing deeply. They lasted for about 7 days. On day 3 I went to my primary care doctor and he confirmed them on in-office ECG. There was no pain or other symptoms. I was not feeling unusually stressed or anything. I continued to perform my regular moderate- and high-intensity exercise program (3-5 days/week) and it appears to have no effect on my symptoms.

                                                I received my first dose of the COVID 19 vaccine on the 2nd of May. Approximately a week or two later I started developing 2 unique symptoms not experienced before. First, I started getting a burning sensation across my left chest that would come and go. Second,  I started to develop pain every time I bent my thumb or pressed in the area of the metacarpal joint on my right hand. This persisted, and the week of May the 26th the burning sensation in my chest was getting stronger and the event lasting longer. It has now been a few weeks, and the symptoms were getting worse. It was enough concern to call my sister who is a nurse whom recommended I go to an urgent care. On the 26th of May I went to an urgent care. They stated that I should go to the hospital as they do not have the equipment to properly diagnose. I went to Hospital ER at approximately 4PM. It was there that I did blood work, got an EKG upon arriving and upon leaving, and x-rays of the heart. The outcome was that the physical exam, blood work, x-rays, and EKG did not show anything of major concern. The ER doctor thinks it is somehow related to the heart muscle surrounding the heart. I received baby aspirin, menthol patch, and was told to take ibuprofen as needed. For my thumb issue, I visited my chiropractor on 16 June 2021 and asked about the joint issues in the thumb, and he recommended to see my family doctor. He thinks it might be arthritis related. I am working to schedule an appointment.

I went to the hospital and ER but no cause can be found.  I scheduled the cardiologist and nothing found.  I wore the Zio heart monitor for two weeks from June 3rd to June 17th. The device was sent to the doctor and no result yet. I still feel the skip and irregular beats every day.  Hope I can get some results this time.

                                                On April 9th, I received the J&amp;J Vaccine. Based on recent news of the aggressive variants (namely Delta), as well as J&amp;J&#39;s lower efficacy rates, I decided to boost my original J&amp;J vaccine w/ one dose of Moderna. Approximately 8 hours later I developed severe and persistent pain isolated nearer to the left side of my upper chest and best described as the area around my heart. I took 800mg of IBP at 6:30 PM and the pain went away after an hour. The pain returned at 4AM this morning and again, I dosed w/ 800mg of IBP and it subsided. As I type, the IBP is wearing off and the chest pain is returning. The pain is more severe when I breathe deeply. I may seek medical attention if it does not subside after today.  I know it&#39;s a rare reaction in adults (and a rare reaction in general), but I suspect heart inflammation /  myocarditis.

                                                I run twice a week. One 6-8 mile and one 10-12 mile run.  I breathe through my nose mostly and I&#39;m in very good pulmonary and cardiovascular condition.  I went for a run and 1 mile in I started drooling a lot! Spitting out mouthfuls every 15-30 seconds and I never spit.  Then my chest got tight and hurt and got irritated.  The feeling was identical to Bronchitis.  I started walking home and my breathing rate increased with wheezing. I got nauseous and was bent over with saliva poring out of my mouth.  Walking up one flight of stairs was difficult.  I have a finger pulse oximeter and it was at 84!  Breathing was very rapid and difficult. After 5 minutes it went up to 94 and then up to 98-99 after 1 more minute (when my pulse fell back under 100bpm.  Chest tightness continued for about 1 hour before I was back to normal for the most part. by today I feel 100% again.

                                                I received the Vaccine on Wednesday 1/6/2021 . Later that evening, my right deltoid was slightly swollen and painful. I would rate the pain 5/10. The next day Thursday 1/7/21, I noticed intermittent heart flutter/palpitations. I had my routine morning coffee and I thought the combination of the vaccine and the coffee might be the caused.  The flutter/palpitations continue to the present. I don&#39;t have shortness of breath. The left deltoid pain and swelling subsided. The flutter is intermittent and last 10 to 15 seconds.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

I began to feel ill. Arm hurt, headache, weight on chest. Body hurt. I went to bed early. I woke up on 13 JAN and felt worse. I stayed in bed until around 1300. I got up and went and sat in my office to work. At around 1700, I went to go get my children from a neighbors yard to bring them for supper. I made it to my back yard before feeling to tired to continue. I went inside and laid down. At around 1900 or 1930, I was putting my kids to bed. I then fainted once more. I don&#39;t know how long I was out each time. I don&#39;t think I hit anything with my head. I got up and went to my bed and texted a Doc.

Acetaminophen and naproxen no longer providing relief. Reported to urgent care clinic due to multiple symptoms not listed in vaccine information, was given ondansetron and promethazine. Recovered at midnight, approx 56 hours later, waking up to sweat-soaked bedsheets.

                                                Eleven days after the vaccination the patient developed 2 days of heartburn followed by a worsening nonproductive cough, substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, palpitations, and an episode of near syncope. These worsened over about 6 days and then slowly decreased. During this time he was referred to the ED and then admitted to a civilian host nation hospital. Echocardiogram and CT scan were performed and a paericardial cyst was discovered measuring 7.4 cm. He was then referred to another facility for evasluation. The pericardial cyst was confirmed, now 6.5 cm and laboratory tests were performed on 4 FEB, but there was at that time no elevation in inflammatory markers. Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery consultations were obtained, but the consultants and the attending physician (who is an infectious disease physician by training) did not think that the crescendo-decrescendo symptoms could be explained by the pericardial cyst, which was likely an incidental finding. A milder cough may have preceded these events by up to a year, and this may possibly be related to the cyst. The heartburn, chest pain, tachycardia, diaphoresis, palpitations, and near syncope may well be adverse reactions of the vaccine.

He was vaccinated IM on left arm. Pt. was educated about post care. Pt. was alert. I moved on to the next two cars and on the third car and about three minutes after his female partener called out for help and said that the Pt. passed out. Thats when the other nurse ran to the car to check on him and told me he was having a seizure. I ran to the lead to explain what happend and to call the medical team right away. The other nure was stablizing the patient. The patient was going in and out of consciousness for about ten seconds. The medical team arrived and took vitals.

                                                Started with the regular symptoms shaking (like with a fever) nausea. Was on a road trip in a snow storm don?t know if it just was a combination of the nausea and the dizziness of the snow flying towards the windshield. But started to feel like throwing up. Pulled over and passed out, my wife says I was shaking. Came back to and throw up a few times.  After that I was just not feeling well and had nausea. Started feeling better later that day.

Never experienced one before.  Upon riding back home, went to urgent care near my house, they treated me with diphenhydramine 25mg (2 tablets).  Stayed there for about 90min. Conditions improved a bit. Went home, took 2 benadryl 10 mg tabs approx every 5 hours. Constant daily improvement. By Friday, conditions were pretty much non-existent.

                                                Within 5 minutes of shot my jaw and tongue started feeling numb, so I called them back over to ask if it was normal. Within a few minutes after that I told them my throat was starting to close up, I was having trouble breathing and both arms went numb. They said I was very pale, horse when talking and that they were going to start treating me for anaphylaxis due to my throat and airway issues. They immediately called for ambulance and  gave me 10 ml of liquid Benadryl and prepped an epi-pen. Within maybe 5-10 minutes the Benadryl help stop the throat closing and I asked them to not inject the epi-pen until the EMT arrived since the symptoms held and didn?t get worse.

                                                Patient called my attention. Stated he was very hot. I could see he was sweating and pale. I asked if there was any itchiness or difficulty breathing. He replied no but he felt nauseous. I retrieved a trash can in case he vomitted but he did not. The feeling of nausea passed pretty quickly. I retrieved ice packs for his neck and wrists. he laid his head in his hand resting on the ice packs on his wrist. His first BP reading was 99/68... repeated in 10 minutes...about the same.I stayed with him &amp; had him put his feet up. We conversed through most of the event. Next reading was 110/74. His color was coming back a little but he was still hot and a little woosy. Patient gave me permission to call his supervisor.  I advised his supervisor he would benefit from going home to rest vs working the remainder of shift. I also contacted management to advise the same.  He stayed sitting for a total of @ 50 minutes. Two more BP readings were 106/74 and 108/74. I had him stand he said he was okay. He had to walk to back of store to get his belongings. I asked him to come back to pharmacy before leaving. He said he felt much better and had been okay walking  to back of the store.    I did call him # 2.5 hours later and he said he was feeling okay.  He did say that this has happened before..not always . I told him to let them know when he rec&#39;d 2nd dose.

                                                I received my second vaccination shot of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA around 9am on Friday April 30th. I was able to work throughout the day and then drove to see family in the afternoon, arriving around 5pm. Within an hour of arriving I began to feel a fever that continued to increase in severity. At various times throughout the evening I was laid up on the couch shivering and shaking without much control. I immediately took two ibuprofen pills and was able to eventually find a thermometer which read 102.7 degrees body temperature. My fever persisted through much of the night and partially broke around 4am. Still, the next day (Saturday 5/1) I still had a 101 degree fever and experienced aches and pains (presumably from the fever). As late as Sunday 5/2 I still had a fever of 100.1 but was feeling better. I did experience some minor and brief tightness in my chest on Sunday morning but it subsided quickly. Now 5/3 I feel better but still a bit hungover from the fever, shaking and lack of sleep.

                                                On Friday, April 2nd, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine.  Within minutes, my heart started racing and I felt faint.  Thereafter, my hands and face got the sensation of tingling.  It felt like ice was running through my veins.  My heart stopped racing approximately fifteen or so minutes after it began.  The tingling sensation in my hands and face ended approximately one hour later.  I also noticed a strange taste in my mouth during this same timeframe.  Subsequently, I had the sensation of being dizzy and lightheaded.  Importantly, I have never reacted to a vaccine in this manner.  On Saturday, April 3rd, I woke up with symptoms that were to be expected.  My arm was very sore and I felt a little achy.  However, I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded.    That evening and for the next week or so, my heart was beating rapidly, and my blood pressure was elevated.  I also had the continuous feeling of my skin crawling.  My hands and feet also seemed to be experiencing tremors and twitching.    On Sunday, April 4th, I woke up and noticed that my right eye seemed a little blurry as I read an article on my phone.  I assumed I must have slept on my eye wrong and did not pay it much attention.  I do not recall my eye being blurry for the rest of the day.  The following morning on Monday, April 5th, I woke up once again feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  As I walked to the restroom, I noticed that my right eye was blurry again.  This time it seemed to be more pronounced.  Moreover, when I closed my right eye, I could see hundreds of dots in different colors.  In addition to having blurry vision, my legs felt weak and nearly buckled as I walked.  I felt like I was intoxicated.  Upon returning to bed, my teeth began chattering and I felt like I was freezing.  I called my doctor?s office and spoke with a PA who recommended that I go to the ER.    While I checked in at the ER, I could not remember my ZIP code.  I felt like my brain was not running on all cylinders.  Upon explaining my symptomology to the ER doctor, she recommended that I have my blood drawn and that I get an MRI to rule out a stroke.  All test results came back normal.    On Wednesday, April 7th, I made an appointment with an allergist.  They tested me to see if I was allergic to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and Polysorbate 80.  For the skin scratch portion of the test, neither of the substances had much of a reaction on my skin.  I thought the Polysorbate 80 scratch had a little bit of redness to it, but it was negligible.  When the doctor injected Polysorbate 80 under my skin with a syringe, a welt formed.  I am not sure why, but PEG was not injected in the same manner.  As a result of the test, the allergist confirmed that I am allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He mentioned that there may be instances of cross reactivity to PEG for individuals that are allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He recommended that I not get the second Moderna dose unless it was administered in a controlled setting.    On Sunday April 11th, I noticed what felt like a hard vein in my abdominal fat.  It felt slightly tender to the touch.  I was fearful that it could be a clot.  On Tuesday, April 13th, I woke up and as a I stood in the shower, my foot was painful to stand on.  On top of my right foot near my ankle, I could visibly see red inflammation in a vein.  I massaged the vein and the redness and pain dissipated.  Being fearful that I did have blood clots, I scheduled an appointment with a PA at my doctor?s office that same day.  We discussed my ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and me being fearful of blood clots.  She had an EKG performed at the office and ordered a barrage of blood tests.  Everything continued to be normal.    On Sunday, April 18th, I again went to the ER, because the hard vein in my stomach became larger and more tender to the touch.  When I bent over, it felt like there was a lot of pressure emanating from the hard vein down to my groin.  Once again, blood was drawn and everything was normal.  I also had an ultrasound performed on the area that felt like a hard vein and the doctor concluded that it was most likely swollen lymph nodes.  I was diagnosed with lymphadenopathy.    On Monday, April 26th, I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to discuss the ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and pain in my stomach and groin area.  He told me that he had seen other patients that were experiencing similar symptoms and that my immune system was possibly overreacting to the vaccine.  He told me the symptoms should go away in time.  He also ordered a new blood test to check for clots.  The D-Dimer test came back normal.    On Tuesday, April 27th, I experienced a painful genital herpes outbreak.  I normally get one every year.  I had just recovered from an infection in December of 2020.  This outbreak was more intense and for the first time I had nerve pain that wrapped around my hip and down my inner thigh.  As of a week later, the infection is almost gone.      Today is May 4th, and I am still experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness.  Some days are better than others and every time I get optimistic that my dizziness and lightheadedness is finally gone, it reappears.  Being an IT consultant business owner and an attorney, I need to think clearly for my profession.  The side effects from the Moderna vaccine have made it very difficult to function.  I would like to get fully vaccinated, but I am fearful of getting the second shot.  I do not want the vaccine to cause permanent neurological damage or worse.    Finally, I am sure your organization is aware, but there are many other people experiencing the same symptoms as me.

Tylenol helped, but not much.  This peaked at about 24 hours after the vaccine, and slowly faded over the next 24 hours.  Still having bad headaches and minor body aches four days after the vaccine.  Most people I know under 40 have reported nearly the same side effects, so it&#39;s a bit frustrating that people aren&#39;t warned to expect this, and are told side-effects are rare.  That does not seem to be true.

Upon getting up and going to the bathroom, I fainted which peeing (standing up).  Upon waking up on the floor of the bathroom, I got up, was light headed, took 4 steps to the bathroom door, and fainted a second time.  Upon waking up the second time, I made it to bed and fell back asleep until 11:30.   I took my temperature at 11:30 and found it was 99.9 degrees.  I was feeling cooler (less fevered) then I had been at the time of the fainting incident.  I called a nurse through my insurance company, who instructed me to go to the ER.  I waited 3 hours in the ER waiting room, and then received Fluids, A CT head scan, an ECG 12 lead, and blood work.  All normal.  I felt better, if banged up, by the time I left the ER.   I hit my head and Left shoulder in the fall.

                                                3 weeks after initial dose (4/23/2021), I started experiencing dizziness and a constant mild headache. With the dizziness, there was no visual perception of moving or spinning objects and no proprioception problems. The dizziness is more like a sense of being unsteady and an inability to maintain balance. The feeling has never gone away and persists in any position. On different occasions, many times per hour, there is a sweeping feeling that is never in a persistent direction. On the first day of symptoms, the headache was moderate with a feeling of facial puffiness with an elevated blood pressure near hypertensive crisis levels... which was on a Sunday. The following Wednesday morning, I visited the Emergency room at 0034 EST 5/19/2021 because the dizziness was not getting better. A review of systems was performed with no abnormal results. EKG was normal. Cranial CT scan showed no indications of stroke either although I have not looked at it myself yet.  Blood sugar level was at 90. Chem12 test was normal.  Well for more details, please contact me. Session is about to time out and I don&#39;t know how to extend it on my phone.  I have tried vestibular therapy motions. None improved the dizziness. I also have intermittent fog and below normal focus capacity.

                                                Experienced chest pain and shortness of breath on Wednesday morning, after getting the second vaccine shot on Sunday. Went to the hospital where they reported elevated troponin levels and possible myocarditis. Troponins continued to rise over the next day and peaked at 7.2 before starting to go back down. Stayed at the hospital for two nights to be observed.

                                                After each shot I had an increased resting heart rate for more than 48 hours. Since that time I&#39;ve had a distinct reduction in cardiovascular capabilities in particular my heart rate while running has often gone up to very high rates. Additionally I&#39;ve had general fatigue and weakness since the vaccine particularly during exercise. I have data from my Garmin to support all of these symptoms and the correlation with the vaccine. The vaccine appears to have caused some sort of inflammatory reaction that is resulted in extended and potentially chronic fatigue and weakness.

                                                My first shot was May 4, 2021. After the first shot I had chest pains but they went away. After the second vaccine I was okay for about a day. June 2-3 I experienced strong chest pains. It was very severe that I felt pressure close to my heart, and this is why I went and sought care from a doctor. I have been having chest pains for about three weeks now.

This was present much of the time, and fairly mild, but coming and going, difficult for him to clearly explain. He did not have swelling of extremities or dyspnea.   On office visit on 6/15/21 pt. has had &#34;weird&#34; substernal chest pains, starting right after Moderna vaccine #2, about 2 months ago. Impression at 6/4/21 telemedicine encounter was that these had essentially resolved, or were much better, but he says today that he has them at least daily, sometimes through the day and sometimes with dyspnea.

After about a week I noticed numbness/paresthesias in my fingers and forearms. About a week later it progressed to my face and is now also in my oral cavity (teeth, tongue, and posterior oropharynx). The paresthesias have been accompanied with intermittent mild vertigo, headaches, mild shortness of breath, and palpitations.

Approximately two weeks ago (around 6/27/2021):  Sudden onset of pain in the chest, then heart felt like a clenched fist, then heart started racing.  Couldn&#39;t catch a breath and felt like passing out.  I crawled to my neighbors house and told them to call an ambulance as I thought I was having a heart attack.  While waiting for ambulance, got extreme chills and sweats.  Ambulance came and did EKG which was normal.  Gave me the option to go to hospital, but felt better so I declined.  Since I have gotten the vaccine, I have consistently struggled with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and lightheadedness, to the point where I feel like I&#39;m going to pass out, or die.

Immediately that evening I began to feel symptoms of fatigue. This grew into an overall feeling of sickness and 3 days later, I had major brain fog. This then developed into high anxiety.  However after about day 6 I felt normal again. Then 20 days later, I am feeling the same symptoms again. My armpit is swollen and having brain fog and anxiety.

                                                Severe middle back pain beginning February 21. Initially thought it was a kidney stone, but a visit to a urologist on February 25, determined it wasn&#39;t a kidney stone. The urologist ordered some blood work and that indicated that I most likely had blood clots. Went to the ER on the 25th and had further tests that determined that I indeed did have blood clots in my lungs.

                                                @ 3-5 min... arm started feeling a little sore, like a dead arm. That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

                                                Patient received COVID vaccine and was advised to wait 15 minutes. 5 minutes later, the patient&#39;s wife comes asking for water and stated the patient was feeling dizzy. I approached the patient and asked questions regarding symptoms and he stated he &#34;lost consciousness&#34; for a few seconds and was sweating. I waited with the patient for 10&#43; minutes and asked if his symptoms were getting better. I made sure he was awake and responsive. The patient stated he was feeling tingly and &#34;amphetamine-like effect.&#34; A few minutes later he was pouring the water on his head and decided to lay on the ground. Based on his response, I called 911. After paramedics arrived and checked his condition, his symptoms improved. Based on discussion with paramedics, it looked to be like a panic attack to vaccination.

                                                I received the vaccine around 11am and did not experience any adverse reactions aside from a sore arm throughout the day.  I went to sleep at 10pm and was awakened at 3am with moderate soreness in my arm and I began to feel feverish and woozy.  About 2 minutes later I could tell that I was going to faint.  The thing I remember was waking up on the floor next to my bed with my wife holding me up.  She said that I started making sudden, loud guttural noises and she was afraid that I had been choking.  She reached over to touch my arm and my body jerked out of bed and I hit the ground.  When I woke up, I realized that I had fainted (I have passed out after a flu shot a couple years ago, but that incident happened about 15 minutes after injection) and my entire body was trembling and sweating profusely.  My wife left the bedroom to get me some water and a cold towel.  I got myself back into bed and passed out again.  The trembling and sweating continued but gradually decreased for about 15 minutes until I felt back to normal.  After I had calmed down, I felt no adverse symptoms and fell back asleep and have felt fine since the incident.

                                                I gave pt his Covid vaccine. Pt does not like needles, but he was fine after I gave pt his shot. His complexion was normal after the shot. The mother wanted pt to sit in the chair in the imz booth and I told them it was fine to have pt sit there as we didn&#39;t have anyone in line for shot.  Pt and mother move to one of the chairs that is reserved for post vaccinated pts.  A few minutes later tech called out for me as pt is going down from the chair.  I had tech dialed 911, came to the pt and trying to get him to be responsive.  Pt came to it after like 3-4 seconds.  Pt sat up and we offered him some water.  Per pt and mother, he had not had anything to eat yet.  So mother went and got pt some crackers. We got pt more water. They sat for a few more minutes and when he felt well enough they left.

The chest tightness would persist after these events for roughly 30 mins. This activity-related chest tightness  continued to occur until the 5th day after the shot.

About 10 minutes after vaccination the patient and his wife alerted me that he was feeling like he was going to pass out.  Also reported feelings of ringing in ears, nausea, cold sweats and very pale.  I had the patient sit on the ground.  I offered him water, but his wife got him a soft drink.  He notified us that he had not eaten today.  We gave his wife glucose tablets which the patient took 2.  He took the 2 glucose tablets while we waited for EMT&#39;s to arrive.  He had more color in his face after the soft drink and glucose tablets.  The EMT&#39;s evaluated him and decided to take him to hospital out of caution.

He passed out shortly after that and his face hit the ground. His nose was bleeding a little bit. Right after notified by his friend I came to check on him and returned to the pharmacy to get the Epipen. When I came back, he was awake and lying on the ground and was able to speak. No Epipen injection was needed. The other staff pharmacist called 911 and one of our associates called 911 on her cell phone to report his breathing and consciousness (none reported or observed). His BP was checked at 12:27 pm with the reading of 127/78. At 12:31 pm, the reading was 121/78. The Emergency Ambulance staff came and checked his BP and blood sugar, then the patient was released and advised to get something to eat.

                                                1 week after the second dose, I was exercising in the early morning when suddenly my vision and hand-eye coordination were flashing, my hand appeared in a different position than where I thought it was. I tried to tell my sons to get help, but I couldn&#39;t say any words, just some repetitive mumbling. I was able to walk upstairs but couldn&#39;t speak for about 10 mins, and then everything was coming out slowly. It was about an hour before I could resume normal talking. I went to the hospital, where they gave me a CT scan, MRI, heart echo, and eventually a TEE. They said that I had a Transient Ischemic Attack, and they found a PFO in my heart that probably allowed a blood clot to travel to my brain.  They also did an ultrasound of my legs when I mentioned the timing of the vaccine, to make sure there were no other clots. I am taking baby asprin and crestor, and have an heart event monitor now for 30 days. I am also scheduled for more bloodwork and a pelvic scan. They say it is likely that they will want to close my PFO, but want to see all the test results first to rule out any other possible causes.

                                                Patient has no clotting history. He developed body aches, left arm pain, and fevers immediately after immunization, but improved. Two days later on 6/2, he developed left flank pain and fevers.  On 6/4, he was evaluated in the ED, with CT scan showing partially occlusive thrombosis of left renal artery with areas of renal infarction. Cr remained stably at baseline. Initial workup was otherwise notable for WBC 17 and negative infectious workup. He was initiated on therapeutic Lovenox.  On 6/5, CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed to evaluate for other clots. Left renal artery was complete thromboses with evolving foci of renal infarction. No other clots were detected. He continued to have fevers. By 6/8, his leukocytosis, fever, and flank pain resolved.  Renal ultrasound with doppler showed restoration of some flow in the left renal artery. He is to be discharged 6/9 on Lovenox 1mg/kg BID without patient Hematology follow-up.  His coagulability workup was notable for positive LAC, FVII deficiency, and PET/CT without evidence of occult malignancy.

After these symptoms eased, no appetite (went from eating five times a day and gym workouts 5 days a week to maybe eating twice a day and unable to walk up 20 stairs without shortness of breathe and heavy erratic heartbeats) still accompanied with little energy, erratic heartbeats, shortness of breath, and lingering headaches well into week three.  Admitted myself to the ER on due to lingering affects and a new symptom of swelling/throbbing on the left side of my head; previous mentioned symptoms still there but milder than before.  Diagnosis at ER was high blood pressure 150 over 92; never had blood pressure problems prior 1st COVID vaccine dose. Follow-up visit with primary care provider, checked my vitals and high blood pressure remained; primary care provider diagnosed high blood pressure, prescribed Amlodipine 5MG tablets.

                                                I received my first shot on 1/12/21 and felt weakness and lethargy initially.  I was not able to lift the same amount of weight nor stay on a cardio machine as I once did (I exercise daily).  It never improved.  After my second shot on 2/9/21 I began to develop symptoms of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis).  I was awaking up at night, drinking a 40oz bottle of water and urinating every hour during hours of sleep.  I lost a significant amount of weight as well (I was questioned at work about it).  I have no family history of diabetes and I have always been lean and fit.  I went to the doctor on 2/27/21 because symptoms became overwhelming.

                                                Patient was in the designated waiting area after having received a vaccine. He was seated in a chair just outside the vaccination room.  After about 10 minutes he was observed to suddenly fall to the side of his chair to the floor.  The Cashier quickly called to me for help, I quickly ran out to the patient and found him face down on the floor attempting to raise his head and look around,  I told him to  remain on the floor and we turned him over and kept him lying down on the floor.   I asked him what he could see,  if it was fuzzy or unclear.   He stated that I seemed to look clear to him.  He stated that he didn&#39;t want to be on the floor and wanted to sit down, so I helped him into the chair and I sat down in a chair directly in front of him.  With in  a minute he stated that he was beginning to be light headed again. I noted that he was losing his color.  I asked him to lay down on the floor again. We got him a pillow for his head and a bottle of water to hydrate him.  We also put a cool compress on his forehead.  Through questions I asked, again it was determined that he has had no history of any seizures, and had fainted before when it had been too hot.  We were able to have him get us his father&#39;s phone number and we called him to come to the pharmacy from home.  Patient remained on the floor till the father arrived and we asked him a few questions. Father wanted the BP taken, so we did, it was 122/69  Pulse rate was 72.  Father wanted to give him a sugar pill because he thought that might increase the blood pressure some. So we gave him one glucose tablet. Patient then expressed that he was ready to try and stand again.  We helped him stand up and allowed him to take a few steps and to monitor him.  We brought over a powered scooter to have him sit on out to his dad&#39;s vehicle.  It didn&#39;t have enough power so we had my Tech and the Patient&#39;s father escort him out to the car with out incident.  We asked them to call us if they had any questions. The Father was asked if he was going to take his son to be checked out and he didn&#39;t feel it was necessary.

                                                Couple weeks after second shot moderna vaccination I started getting throat pain and fast heart rate (palpitations). Initial suspicion was COVID-19 shu we did test and it came back negative. Then we did TSH test and it came low at 0.1. Two weeks after initial symptoms doc ordered full thyroid panel as he was suspecting hyperthyroidism. In full theories panel TSH came even lower at 0.03, free T4 2.2 and T3 at 172. Doctor referred me to endocrinologist for further diagnosis.   I?m keeping healthy over all and nothing has changed in my food habits, medical conditions or environment. Only major event was vaccination. In fact my TSH was 2.0 in latest test done on 02/10/2021.
