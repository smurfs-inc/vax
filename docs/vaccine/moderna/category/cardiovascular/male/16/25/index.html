                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                Myocarditis; Acute onset of chest pain; Soreness of the arm; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 20-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced soreness of the arm, acute onset of chest pain, and myocarditis.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included asthma, and allergy to egg, peanut and tree nuts. Concomitant medications reported included dupilumab, montelukast, budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine, albuterol and epinephrine.  On 29 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, the patient reported soreness of the arm for 3 to 4 days.  On 30 Jan 2021, the patient presented to the hospital with acute onset of left sided chest pain. The physician reported that the patient developed myocarditis. Consent for Safety to follow up was received.  Treatment for the events, as reported, included patient&#39;s concomitant medications of dupilumab, montelukast, budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine and albuterol. No additional treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event, soreness of the arm, was resolved on unknown date. The event acute onset of chest pain and myocarditis was not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 20 year old male with medical history of multiple allergies, who was hospitalized with serious unexpected events of chest pain and myocarditis and a non-serious unexpected event of pain in extremity.  The chest pain and myocarditis occurred 33 days after first dose and 4 days after last dose of mRNA-1273.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I obtained my booster shot on my left deltoid at 2:30 PM 2/4/2021. I had slight soreness in my arm til 8:00 which the soreness disappeared. Around 2:00 AM, I was awakened by a pounding headache, fever of 102, and my upper left chest (unilateral between the midline of my left chest and the axillary region) started to hurt. I took Tylenol 1000 mg at 3 and took a hot bath (recommended by  friend who also displayed a fever and headache). After a while, my fever began to lower but my headache and chest pain did not disappear and I could not sleep until 7 AM. I woke up today (2/5/2021) at 10 AM with a fever of 101.4, another pounding headache, and still unilateral chest pain. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol around 10:30 AM and it only helped with the fever. I went back to sleep and slept until 4 PM. I understand that the fever and headache are normal symptoms but my chest pain does not seem like muscle soreness. It doesn&#39;t hurt when I touch it, it comes and goes every few seconds, I have 4 or 5/ 10 on the pain scale for most of the pain but it turns into 6 or 7/10 occasionally (10 being the worst pain). What does help with my pain when it is 6 or 7/10 is when I clench my chest really hard like I am flexing it. It is a sharp pain that stays for a few seconds before it disappears and it feels like a deep pain. I didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol again because I am about to max out (can only take 2 more capsules until 2:00 AM because it states not to take more than 6 capsules in 24 hours, and each capsule is 500 mg) (Also, the Tylenol does not help with the pain so I am only taking it for my fever.) I was wondering if anyone else reported this and if this is an adverse side effect.  This has not cause any issues regarding my breathing but just pain.

                                                Vaccine was Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 4 days after receiving the vaccine, two hours after I woke up, I began to have mild chest pain in the center of my chest. After that, the pain started to grow and grow until it was extreme pain, at around an 8/10. The pain radiated from my chest to the undersides of my arms. After two hours of pain, it started to subside and eventually was gone. There was no pain for the rest of the day. The next day, two hours after I woke up again, the mild chest pain returned. Still in the center of my chest, the pain grew into extreme pain again. This time however, it was slightly to the right and as the pain progressed it moved right until after two hours it went away again.  The treatment I got at the Urgent Care was an EKG and they told me to go to a hospital. At the hospital, I got Toradol, aspirin and propanolol.  My initial Troponin levels at admission to the hospital were 900 and grew to 1300. It lowered for a time, but at the last check, it rose again to 1420 after not getting Toradol for at least 12 hours.

A ER note was  generated in a T-Con on a patient who got their 2nd Covid Vaccine and began experiencing chest pain approx. 12 hours post vaccine. Patient did not report to the ER until 28Feb21. It was discussed that he has myocarditis v pericarditis, elevated D-Dimer of 770, swollen lymph nodes, and elevated Troponin. Patient was transferred to Research Medical Center due to no available beds. Patient was referred to a Case Manager and Cardiology. The patient completed a follow up appointment with 509 MDG on 9Mar21 and reported Dull pain that has been affecting sleep. Cardiology reports shows Troponin was elevated to 9.1 decreased to 4.2 and back up again to 13.4. Cardiac revealed late gadolinium enhancement, possibly representing myocarditis and then at discharge possibly myocarditis.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

Patient also mentioned that he only consumed two cookies and coffee for that day.  When the EMS arrived (about 5 firefighters), they interviewed him and performed a blood pressure test. His sitting blood pressure was 130/82. One of the firefighters assessed his spine and Patient denied cervical, thoracic, and lumbar tenderness or pain. The firefighter assessed Patient&#39;s glucose level, which was a bit difficult to obtain in the first initial efforts, with the glucometer reading ?error?. The firefighters eventually were able to obtain a reading on Patient&#39;s glucose and it read 86. Patient was able to stand on his own, and a second blood pressure test was performed; his standing blood pressure reading was 145/89.  EMS gave Patient gauze to address his head wound Patient initially refused to go to the hospital, but per EMS protocol, fluids needed to be administered.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                During the first night after receiving vaccine I started to have SEVERE shaking / full body muscle spasms-hypertonicity that  lasted 60-90 minutes. Required 30 minutes hot shower to calm down shaking symptoms. Initially thought episodes were caused/triggered by cold temperature (still possibility) but now thinking its triggered by anxiety. Heart rate almost spikes to 120-130 BPM. No fever and normal blood pressure is noted when episodes happen.  Occurrences is not routine and seem to be random.  Very concerning considering symptoms lasted for 2 &#43; weeks now. I do not have health care or ability to see PCP/GP without paying out of pocket.   Now please understanding the severity of these episodes, to the point where it resembles severe Parkinson&#39;s symptoms.   Along with those I still have the normal side effects, fatigue  (extreme)  , mood changes, joint aches, intolerance to cold off and on,  and elevated HR.

                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.
