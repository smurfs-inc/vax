                                                About 3 minutes after patient received immunization, he fainted and had a seizure.  Patient was with his parents and he told them he felt like he was going to faint, so his parents stabilized him before it happened.  Patient seized for about 10 seconds and then came to alertness.  He was made comfortable and given juice and a granola bar after a while because patient had not yet eaten this morning.  I monitored patient for about 45 minutes before I felt patient was stable and feeling well enough to leave.  Patient left with his parents monitoring him.

                                                At approximately 2 PM on Wednesday the 10th, I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and feverish. Color drained from my face and I also began to lose track of the conversation I was having. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace of the conversation and eventually realized I couldn&#39;t remember what we were talking about. Looking back on the event now, I could only remember what was happening for around. 2 minute span before I forgot it. After losing my ability to form new memories, I began to lose old ones. I would look through pictures and not recognize faces, listen to songs and not remember the artists, and lose entire gaps of my past. My parents described my memory loss as that of a concussion but, to be frank, I don&#39;t remember much of any of it. All of my past memories have returned, but I still have yet to regain my memory from 2 PM to 10 PM of that day.

                                                Patient received vaccine in left arm and during waiting/observation period a few minutes later (while sitting), he told the person near him he felt dizzy, and he fainted. He soon regained consciousness (within about a minute) and was observed/attended to. 911 was called immediately as a precaution, and paramedics monitored his vital signs slowly helped him into a chair. He drank some water and a little electrolyte drink. He did not want to seek hospital treatment, and paramedics left.  He stated he was experiencing nausea while sitting in the chair, and said he started to feel like he was going to faint again.  Again 911 was called and paramedics attended to him, but he did not faint again. After resting in a chair and drinking some more water and some electrolyte drink, as well as cold compresses on his forehead and the back of the neck, he was eventually escorted by two store employees on a motorized scooter cart to his parent&#39;s car and went with his parent home (he did not want to seek hospital treatment).

About five to ten minutes to, we were alerted that the patient had fainted. Upon coming to the patient, he was starting to come to but was out of it. I tried asking the patient how he was feeling, is he having a hard time breathing? Patient&#39;s entire arms and legs were bright red with possible rashes that lasted about 5 minutes and went away quick. Patient&#39;s face remained their normal shade. Patient reported he fell asleep and patient&#39;s father reported waking the patient up prior to coming to get his vaccine. Patient sat at the pharmacy to be monitored for an addition 30 minutes before leaving with father. Patient was given water and fan to help cool him down. Patient reported feeling ok after about 10 minutes with legs elevated but was instructed to sit for longer than that time. Patient was ok to leave with father after 30&#43; minutes of monitoring.

He landed on his buttocks and did not appear to hit his head.  He immediately appeared conscious but disoriented.  He had a steady pulse and no itching or rash or trouble breathing, but he seemed pale.  EMT was called and upon evaluation determined that he did not need further treatment.

                                                This patient had some dizziness after the shot and was apprehensive in receiving it. He claimed he felt dizzy and in seconds had slumped off of his chair. He was unresponsive for a few seconds only about 5-10 seconds and we gave him an IM Benadryl as a precaution. He awoke complaining of a funny feeling in the mouth and tongue but had no rash or redness or swelling to indicate an allergic reaction. We decide to monitor closely for an escalation of symptoms but to have a EpiPen handy, and call an EMT unit. His blood pressure was low at first at around 107/68  then quickly come up in about 10 minutes to 130/80. With no other issues we believe he had a vasovagal syncope but wanted the ER to make sure we were correct. I called and checked on him after he was at the ER. and the nurse stated that he was doing very well and that they had seen this happen with the vaccine at other site locations.

                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.     History obtained from:  ? patient                    ? outpatient clinicians  ? family                                  ? staff at facility  ? other                                   ? review of medical record as summarized below   Pt unable to provide reliable history because: ?

                                                Patient stated prior to administartion of vaccine that he has had a history of passing out following vaccinations, mostly when he does not eat or drink beforehand. He stated he made sure to have something to eat and drink beforehand and was aware that it may happen following this vaccine as well. Prior to administering vaccine, I verified details with patient on previous episodes and discussed risks with patient, who understood and wished to proceed anyways and was okay staying additional time beyond 15 mins post vaccination to ensure no serious reaction. Immediately post-vaccination, I asked the patient how they were feeling prior to sending him to the designated waiting area. He stated repeatedly that he was fine and okay to walk to the chairs on his own. Moments after sitting down, a technician alerted me that he had collapsed off the chair and fell on the ground before anyone could get there to catch him. I immediately called 911 and attended to the patient who had already regained consciousness while I was on the phone with emergency services. He informed technician that when he sat down he felt a little queasy and the next thing he knew, he was on the floor. Fortunately there happened to be an EMT in the store that came over to help while waiting for additional paramedics. We provided the patient with an ice pack and a bottle of water, but instructed him not to drink anything until paramedics arrived. We checked the patients blood pressure and found the reading to be low and patient was tachycardic, expected following a syncopal episode. Myself and the EMT got patient to lie down on the floor and elevated his head. We noticed that the patient had suffered a small laceration to his head resulting from falling off the chair onto the ground. Store management also got involved to assess the situation and take statements. Upon arrival of paramedics, care was transferred over to them. At first, patient refused to be transported to the hospital but asked that we contact his mother. After reaching his mother, she arrived shortly after to the store, and after further rest and evaluation, patient was transported to a local hospital for a further workup .Patient was only unconscious for 20 seconds or less, and the event occurred within 5 mins of vaccine administration.  Upon regaining consciousness, patient was alert and oriented, and again stated that he&#39;s fine and it wasn&#39;t the first time it has happened.

Just a few seconds later he woke up and said something along the lines of, &#34;Oh did I pass out?&#34; I caught him in my arms before he could fall to the floor. The same response where he started aggressively shaking and eyes closed happened a few seconds later. His legs straightened out and his head was headed backward. Again I caught him and stabilized him. Afterward, my 2nd pharmacist stopped over and spoke with him. He seemed to be feeling better, but to ensure the same reaction wouldn&#39;t happen again, we had him wait 30 min instead of the standard 15. He sat in his chair and did not have any issues. We offered food but he was not interested. I spoke w/ him again this afternoon via phone and he said he was doing fine. Pt said he has had this type of rxn before w/ previous vaccines.

The patient did receive his second dose of the Moderna vaccine on Friday to his left arm.  He has had fevers over the past 24 hours to 103 at home.  His mother and he indicate that the go away with Tylenol though seem to come back when the Tylenol wears off.  He did complain of some headache, myalgias, malaise and sore throat which she states were all worse when he would have a fever and seemed to dissipate when his fever resolved.  He states he did not and has never had chest pain like this until this morning.  The patient does not have a history of Covid infection.  He is active and has run track in the past.  He has not had any travel.  He denies any pain or swelling to his legs or calves.  He has had no sick contacts.

He slumped in his char, nearly falling to the floor, but was caught by a nearby patient who noticed patient falling. Patient was assisted by staff to lie down on a cot. At that time he regained consciousness and was able to state his name. Staff attempted to check his blood pressure, but the electronic cuff was unable to measure b/p despite multiple attempts. Because of this, and persistent pallor, drowsiness and low pulse, EMS (who was standing by in the parking lot) was requested to enter the building to assess the patient. After evaluating him within the vaccination site for approximately 30 minutes, patient was transported to the hospital due to persistent low pulse and low blood pressure.

                                                Patient received second Materna vaccine 5/28/2021 around 630 pm.  Around 10 PM felt fatigue and headache.  Felt very fatigued and unwell and slept most of 5/29 - 5/30. On 5/31, began experiencing chest discomfort radiating to left arm and palpitations.  Presented to hospital which was notable for abnormal EKG with diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions, troponin peak of 25.  TTE revealed low normal systolic function with EF 50%, no valvular disease or wall motion abnormalities.  Cardiac MRI revealed subepicardial delayed myocardial enhancement in the mid, apex lateral wall of the left ventricle and adjacent pericardium consistent with myopericarditis.  Patient was treated with colchicine and improved.  Infectious work-up for cardiotropic viruses were sent, viral swab was notable for positive rhinovirus/enterovirus.  Patient&#39;s presentation and timing of vaccine should be looked into as it is unclear wheter this presentation can be entirely due to presence of virus as above.  This is notably at least the second presentation of teenager with myopericarditis on this cardiology service in the past 2 weeks in setting of recent Covid vaccination.

We got to him quickly and held him up while it appeared he was fainting.  We lowered him to the ground and called 911 and his father that was in store .  He complained of being very hot and dizzy.  He began to recover fairly quickly,  he drank some water and stayed on floor.  His dad arrived and the 911 call was cancelled due to his improving awareness.  He stayed in the lobby  for 20-30 minutes.  He felt much better and left with his dad in good physical condition.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

I immediately went out to help the patient and a technician called for EMS.  The patient woke up within 2 minutes and reported feeling dizzy, tired, and numb. While waiting for EMS to arrive, the patient was situated in a sitting position and I continued talking to him to keep him awake. EMS assessed him and took him out to the ambulance to wait for a relative to come.  It is unknown if the patient went to the emergency room or not.

                                                Patient experienced loss of consciousness after administration of vaccine.  This happened within 45 seconds of administration.  This happened 3 separate times within a 5-10 minute time frame.  No signs of anaphylaxis were identified during this time.  Patient would &#34;faint&#34; briefly (approximately 10 seconds) and then regain consciousness and confirm that he had no symptoms of anaphylaxis.  Symptoms observed were loss of color of the face and lips and some diaphoresis.  The patient was monitored for any changes and EMS was called.  The patient refused EMS service or hospital service.  He stated that the &#34;fainting&#34; happened to him regularly whenever he received a vaccine.   The total time of the event was approximately 30 minutes and the patient was advised to stay longer for monitoring if he would refuse EMS service, which he did.  The patient has since been called and is currently feeling &#34;normal except for being somewhat tired&#34;.  He has been advised to follow up with his primary care.

Patient was ok as I returned to the pharmacy to prepare for the next vaccination. Pt left the waiting area to shop, then returned after about 2 minutes and sat down in one of our chairs. Pt then announced that he was feeling dizzy. I immediately tried to reach the patient, by the time I reached him he had collapsed to the floor. The patient was unconscious for about 1 to 2 minutes, I had my staff call 911. Then the patient regained consciousness. The paramedics arrived and checked his vitals and watch him. His father arrived and took him home. He was feeling ok when he left the store.

                                                Patient had parked in the COVID vaccine waiting area, and was observed to fall forward onto his steering wheel within a few minutes of parking by 2 other participants waiting in the car next to him. One of them immediately notified one of the parking lot volunteers who came and got me within 1 minute of this observation. 2 students and I came quickly to the open drivers side door and began talking to assess the situation. Mr. Bannister appeared pale, mildly diaphoretic (sweating) and slightly confused as to the passage of time, but was able to state and spell his name and talk coherently about his circumstances. He stated that he was not allergic to anything that he knew about, and that he had no prior history of similar reactions to vaccines or medicines although he had not taken any shots in several years. He noted that he had not eaten anything since breakfast (now mid-afternoon). He described himself as initially feeling weak, faint, and nauseated with his vaccinated arm feeling heavy and numb. He also reported that he had a sensation of blurriness before passing out, but denied any spinning sensation, visual loss or ringing in the ears. There were no obviously visible abrasions or bleeding on his face or forehead. The nursing students brought a chair, and we elevated his legs and gave him some water to drink during the time we were monitoring his vital signs. He refused a cupcake because of the nausea, but as time progressed he gained facial color and was more comfortable in conversing. His hands had equal muscle grip and strength, visible fingernail beds were pink and his capillary refill was less than 3 seconds. Towards the end of our monitoring, he did accept some nuts and M &amp; Ms to eat. A University Safety Medical Report was completed by the appropriate safety personnel. He was fully AAO x 3 at the end of our monitoring, and stated that if he felt better he would drive to his apartment (less than 5 minutes away) but would wait for his girlfriend to get out of class if he did not feel fully capable of driving. We encouraged him to eat something light when he got home, to use cool water/warm water soaks at his shot site, exercise his arm, and to take an NSAID for pain relief the next day. We recommended that he eat something light before his second shot (which had already been scheduled), that he bring someone with him the next time, and as a precaution to wait 30 minutes following the second shot. He left at 3: 15 pm driving his car without any apparent difficulties. An online report was completed for the incident 04/20/2021.

                                                i had regular symptoms the day of and after my vaccine. Headaches, body ache, tired, sore arm, slight difficulty breathing, and slightly faster heart rate. Those didn&#39;t really concern me since i took it as the vaccine is working like it?s supposed to. but starting yesterday when i woke up until this moment i?ve had a really weird pinching feeling by my heart and the side of my rib cage on the left side of my chest. that?s the only thing scaring me now since my other side effects have already gone away.

                                                Pt was given immunization and told to sit in front of the pharmacy for 15 minutes. He was given a card with the time stating when he could leave. He did not wait. He and his mother walked to the produce section of the store. About 5 minutes after he received the vaccination I was notified by management that our pt had passed out in the produce department. When I got there the patient was sitting in a chair and drinking a bottle of water. He acknowledged that he did not sit as I had asked and as he was walking he began to feel dizzy and started to sweat. His mom said he got pale and then passed out. I waited with him for a few minutes until his color had returned and he said he was feeling much better.

                                                19 year old patient came to pharmacy with dad to get first dose of Moderna Vaccine. Questionnaire was completed online with no&#39;s to all questions. Patient was sitting in booth and seemed comfortable while getting vaccine, but immediately after started to lean towards wall and faint. Patient&#39;s father and I supported patient so he didn&#39;t fall and injure himself. Patient was nonresponsive for about 5 to 10 seconds before he became responsive. He was able to sit by himself after about 1 minute of support from his dad. Patient was given water and waited 15 minutes in the booth while being monitored. He seemed to be himself after about 5 minutes. During those 15 minutes I talked to patient&#39;s dad about patient&#39;s medical history. He may had 1 seizure when he was younger due to ADHD medication but test results did not confirm it as a seizure. He also passed out one time in high school while watching biology movies with blood. Discussing this incident with the father and patient, we agreed this patient seems to have suffered from syncope due to fear of needles. I gave his father my business card and told him to call me if the patient reported any symptoms after leaving or if he had any questions whatsoever. I let them know I would be reporting this to VAERS and encouraged him to follow up with his PCP about this incident.

                                                Two nose bleeds in two days. The first one lasted 10 minutes and there was a large coagulated chunk after 30 seconds. The second lasted one minute and was started by me merely lightly scratching the inside of my nose. I could count the number of nosebleeds I?ve had my whole life prior to getting vaccinated on one hand.

                                                The patient received his vaccine and 5 minutes later complained of feeling dizzy. He was instructed to sit and before we could help him into a chair he lost consciousness and fell. His fall was somewhat controlled by the technician. I then assessed the patient and determined he had a vasovagal episode and lifted his legs, he returned to consciousness within 10 seconds of raising his legs. I then allowed the patient to lie on the floor for approximately 20 minutes after which he felt better and returned to sitting . He then sat for about 15 more minutes until a family member was able to arrive. The patient reported no other adverse effects other than dizziness, lightheadedness, some trouble hearing and tingling fingers.

                                                Got vaccinated on May 22 on a saturday at store/pharmacy with Moderna. This was the second dose of the vaccine. I use a smart watch to monitor my health 24/7. I noticed an unusual elevation in my heart pulse after the first vaccine but that went away in a few days and I was back to normal. After the second vaccine I had the usual expected symptoms of headaches etc which went away the next day. After receiving the second dose on saturday I experienced unusual chest pains on monday which lasted for a few while and I was fine the rest of the day. It was tuesday when things got worse. I had a very sharp chest pain which I had never experienced and it continued till I took Alegra. I thought it was heartburn but when I went to the hospital they did my EKG which showed some abnormalities. I was then diagnosed with Pericarditis. After staying in the hospital for 4 days. I was discharged with anti inflammatory meds. I hope to have a full recovery in a few weeks.

                                                Myocarditis; Acute onset of chest pain; Soreness of the arm; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 20-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced soreness of the arm, acute onset of chest pain, and myocarditis.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included asthma, and allergy to egg, peanut and tree nuts. Concomitant medications reported included dupilumab, montelukast, budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine, albuterol and epinephrine.  On 29 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, the patient reported soreness of the arm for 3 to 4 days.  On 30 Jan 2021, the patient presented to the hospital with acute onset of left sided chest pain. The physician reported that the patient developed myocarditis. Consent for Safety to follow up was received.  Treatment for the events, as reported, included patient&#39;s concomitant medications of dupilumab, montelukast, budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine and albuterol. No additional treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event, soreness of the arm, was resolved on unknown date. The event acute onset of chest pain and myocarditis was not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 20 year old male with medical history of multiple allergies, who was hospitalized with serious unexpected events of chest pain and myocarditis and a non-serious unexpected event of pain in extremity.  The chest pain and myocarditis occurred 33 days after first dose and 4 days after last dose of mRNA-1273.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

A couple of minutes later, I heard the gate rattle and rushed over to lower him to the floor gently.  I called out to employee and customer to call 911.  Then he woke up probably within 30 seconds.  I had him continue to lie there and talked with him.   He set up once for a couple of minutes and said he still felt light-headed so i had him lay back down and continued to talk with him.  Then paramedics came in and took over.  They placed him on a stretcher and took him, while he was still conscious while leaving.

                                                Patient reports routinely having spells of syncope with injections and still insisted on receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Gave injection into left deltoid. Had patient scoot up to table in immunization room with both legs fully under the table just in case there was an issue. I set the timer for 15 minutes and left him in the immunization room with his girlfriend, who also received a vaccine. A few moments later the girlfriend asked for our help stating he was feeling like he was going to pass out. I went into the IMZ room and checked with him. At the time, he was sweaty with a rapid hearbeat. I instructed him to take some deep breaths and went to get a cold paper towel to apply to his head. When I returned he had passed out, not responsive but still breathing, in his chair and his girlfriend was holding his head in her hand. We gently lowered his head to rest on the table while another associate called 911 per girlfriend&#39;s request. He began moaning a few moments later and was able to talk to us. He was very hot and sweaty, light headed and breathing rapidly. We applied a cooling pack to his forhead as he continued to lie his head on the table. He then said he might feel more comfortable lying on the floor. We assisted him to the floor, elevated his feet on a chair and placed his head on a roll of paper towels. At that time the paramedics showed up and said his blood pressure was fine and he was just having some hyperventilation. The paramedics got him back up in the chair and his girlfriend got him some apply juice. After about 30 minutes he was talking fine, shaking had stopped and his breathing a temp went back to normal

                                                about 5 minutes after vaccine pt asked for a bandaid due to some heavy bleeding at injection site.  He then asked for water.  When I brought the water to him he was very pale and said he felt like fainting.  We had him lay down and elevate feet which helped him feel better but was still hot so I applied a cold ice pack on head to help him feel less hot.  After about 10-15 minutes he felt better and stayed with us for about 45 mintues until he felt well enough to drive home.  I checked on him about 2 hours later and he was feeling much better.

                                                Felt dizziness and lightheaded about two minutes after receiving shot. I passed out and when I woke up I was struggling to regain consciousness control of my body as I was having a seizure.

                                                Admission HPI: Right-sided chest pain began 2 days prior to admission (3/19) after getting out of car, without identifiable trigger. Pain was sharp, pleuritic, and worst with movement; didn&#39;t feel it when still. Pain not responsive to ibuprofen or heating packs. Reported 30-60 seconds of self-resolving heart racing during ocular migraine which has been his baseline for years. Not associated with SOB (at rest or with exercise), palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. No viral URI symptoms, N/V, or rash. He did receive his 2nd Moderna COVID vaccine about 1 week PTA, followed by 36hrs of fevers, chills, and body aches. Given persistence of pain, Patient asked his parents to present to urgent care.   In UC, he was noted to tachycardic with CXR with bibasilar atelectasis and b/l effusions, per report. Given continued tachycardia, decision was made to transfer to ED to r/o PE.      In ED, tachycardic to 104-116 and tachypneic 22-26. Had one episode of tachycardia to 182 iso ocular migraine. Endorsed chest pain but points to R middle abdomen when asked where worst. Exam was unremarkable. He received 1 dose of morphine which reduced pain from 10/10 to 0/10. Labs notable for leukocytosis (14.61), thrombocytopenia (422), elevated d-dimer (1.56), and elevated CRP (5.6). Otherwise normal chem and coags. COVID/RVP negative. CXR unremarkable. CTPA showed scattered PEs in b/l lower lobes with small pulmonary infarct in RML. No evidence of right heart strain. Heme was consulted who recommended starting him on lovenox and sending lupus anti-coagulant. Cardiology was consulted who recommended EKG, BNP, and troponin, all of which were normal and reassuring against right heart strain. ECHO was therefore deferred to the AM. The decision was made to admit.   Upon arrival to the floor, Patient was tachycardic 114 and tachypneic to 22, otherwise stable vitals. He denied any pain since morphine. Denied any unexpected weight loss; reports that car ride was short. Mom reports that Patient has been less active d/t cold weather and baseball being on hold. Denies family or personal history of clots. Last seizure ~13 years ago.  Hospital Course: (3/21 - 3/22)  Patient was admitted to the hematology service. He was therapeutically anticoagulated with LMWH injections and his anti-Xa level prior to discharge was 0.92. (goal 0.5-1.0) Lower extremity ultrasound with Doppler showed patent veins and no evidence of DVT and upper extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT, though there was potential evidence of collateralization seen in mid and distal third of right subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein. Since this was an unprovoked PE, a full thrombophilia workup was sent and will be followed up by the outpatient hematology clinic. Cardiology consulted regarding possibility of right heart strain and the tachycardia during migraine episodes. Echocardiogram performed on 3/22 was technically limited but showed no gross abnormalities. The cardiology team requested a repeat echo scheduled outpatient for 1-2 months after discharge.

His color drained from his face and he head was kind of limp, he responded to questions with great difficulty.  He never lost consciousness.  He stated like the room was fading away.  We got him into the consultation room and had him lay down on the floor with his feet on a chair, to which he stated he felt better. The color came back to his face. He responded quicker to all questions and steadily improved.  Next we moved him to legs straight, then sitting against the wall to sitting in a chair.  Then he went back out the waiting chairs with his father.

Was found to be in AFib with RVR. Was given adenosine 6 mg x 1, then 12 mg x 1 en rote via EmS with no change to heart rate. When in the ER, his heart rate was 189.  He was initially started on Cardizem drip. Admitted to CVU. Cardiology was consulted. An echocardiogram was ordered which did not show any significant abnormalities. No further workup recommended at this time. Hemodynamically stable for discharge. Recommend following up with primary care 2-4 weeks post discharge.

                                                patient lost consciousness about 30 seconds after receiving the vaccine. Initially I treated it as a syncopal episode and was just trying to wake him up but he began to shake (seizure-like) after about 15 seconds. I could not rule out anaphylaxis so I administered a dose of epinephrine via epipen. Patient regained consciousness approximately 5 to 10 seconds after epipen. EMS arrived approximately 10 minutes later and took patient to the hospital for further observation. Patient vomited on ambulance ride but did not lose consciousness again.  Patient reportedly fine after being administered fluids but reports no memory of ambulance ride or even being vaccinated.

Patient chose to not go to the ER and his mother came to pick him up.

                                                The night that I got the vaccine I got inflammation in my lower spine. I lost feeling in my lower legs. I could still move my legs, but they were numb. There were also a few moments of pain but mostly numbness. It lasted for two days. I was taking Ibuprofen and icing my lower back and the feeling slowly returned to my lower legs. The numbness was in both legs all the way to the hip. I also had lower back pain which went away at about the same time as I regained the feeling in my legs. After the second dose of the vaccine I had severe shaking and I passed out.

I went to the ER on the third day of experiencing the pain, during which they performed an EKG and bloodwork in order to determine whether or not it was a heart issue. There were no significant results and the pain subsided two days later.

                                                As with the first shot, I was very fatigued and achy.  A day or two after the shot I began having pain in the left side of my chest.  It was a tight feeling that made it difficult to breathe.  The pain only got worse and after a couple of days, I decided to go to the emergency room as I feared I was having some kind of heart attack.

                                                On Monday April 12 I had terrible chest pain and it was very hard for me to catch my breath. I tried to get up and walk and became very dizzy. I was then taken to the hospital and my mom stated that while in the car I had a loss of consciousness. Doctors at the hospital came to the conclusion that it was a heart attack but after following up with the cardiologist then he thought I may have myocarditis. Unfortunately I have a pectus excavatum that is being repaired and the mri couldn?t confirm the myocarditis due to the metal in my chest.

                                                I obtained my booster shot on my left deltoid at 2:30 PM 2/4/2021. I had slight soreness in my arm til 8:00 which the soreness disappeared. Around 2:00 AM, I was awakened by a pounding headache, fever of 102, and my upper left chest (unilateral between the midline of my left chest and the axillary region) started to hurt. I took Tylenol 1000 mg at 3 and took a hot bath (recommended by  friend who also displayed a fever and headache). After a while, my fever began to lower but my headache and chest pain did not disappear and I could not sleep until 7 AM. I woke up today (2/5/2021) at 10 AM with a fever of 101.4, another pounding headache, and still unilateral chest pain. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol around 10:30 AM and it only helped with the fever. I went back to sleep and slept until 4 PM. I understand that the fever and headache are normal symptoms but my chest pain does not seem like muscle soreness. It doesn&#39;t hurt when I touch it, it comes and goes every few seconds, I have 4 or 5/ 10 on the pain scale for most of the pain but it turns into 6 or 7/10 occasionally (10 being the worst pain). What does help with my pain when it is 6 or 7/10 is when I clench my chest really hard like I am flexing it. It is a sharp pain that stays for a few seconds before it disappears and it feels like a deep pain. I didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol again because I am about to max out (can only take 2 more capsules until 2:00 AM because it states not to take more than 6 capsules in 24 hours, and each capsule is 500 mg) (Also, the Tylenol does not help with the pain so I am only taking it for my fever.) I was wondering if anyone else reported this and if this is an adverse side effect.  This has not cause any issues regarding my breathing but just pain.

After that, the pain started to grow and grow until it was extreme pain, at around an 8/10. The pain radiated from my chest to the undersides of my arms. After two hours of pain, it started to subside and eventually was gone. There was no pain for the rest of the day. The next day, two hours after I woke up again, the mild chest pain returned. Still in the center of my chest, the pain grew into extreme pain again. This time however, it was slightly to the right and as the pain progressed it moved right until after two hours it went away again.  The treatment I got at the Urgent Care was an EKG and they told me to go to a hospital. At the hospital, I got Toradol, aspirin and propanolol.  My initial Troponin levels at admission to the hospital were 900 and grew to 1300. It lowered for a time, but at the last check, it rose again to 1420 after not getting Toradol for at least 12 hours.

                                                I almost fainted the night after my shot. I had vaped cannabis prior at around 1:00am, and probably re-dosed at around 3:00AM, before falling asleep at around 4:30AM. I had a harder than normal time falling asleep that night, and I didn&#39;t sleep very well. At around 6:00AM I woke up and walked to the bathroom, feeling pain in my anal region. As I started to sweat profusely, I recognized that I was likely about to faint, so I pre-emptively lied down on the floor of the bathroom until I felt well enough to stand up. I don&#39;t remember exactly how long I was on the floor but most likely a few minutes. I then had a bowel movement, still feeling pain in my anal region but to a lesser degree, and then drank some water and went back to sleep at around 6:30AM.

A ER note was  generated in a T-Con on a patient who got their 2nd Covid Vaccine and began experiencing chest pain approx. 12 hours post vaccine. Patient did not report to the ER until 28Feb21. It was discussed that he has myocarditis v pericarditis, elevated D-Dimer of 770, swollen lymph nodes, and elevated Troponin. Patient was transferred to Research Medical Center due to no available beds. Patient was referred to a Case Manager and Cardiology. The patient completed a follow up appointment with 509 MDG on 9Mar21 and reported Dull pain that has been affecting sleep. Cardiology reports shows Troponin was elevated to 9.1 decreased to 4.2 and back up again to 13.4. Cardiac revealed late gadolinium enhancement, possibly representing myocarditis and then at discharge possibly myocarditis.

Patient was not responsive and completely limp. Together we lowered him to the floor where he quickly began to regain consciousness and tried to sit up. Patient was fairly alert within 1-2 minutes. Patient was given water, ice packs for the back of his neck and forehead, and ED was called. Patient stated he was feeling much better and did not need EMS, but due to store policy they were called. Patient relayed a history of fainting after receiving tattoos, that was not notated on his form. Patient remained on floor until EMS arrived about 20 minutes later and checked on patient. Patient&#39;s heart rate and BP were taken by EMS laying down, sitting, and standing and was cleared by EMS to leave.

My nose was bleeding and went to the emergency room. 11:45 in the emergency room they took blood samples, a head scan and put me on an I.V. for 45 minutes.

                                                My left arm was sore starting a few minutes after the vaccine. This soreness last through that night. When I woke up the next day, my arm was extremely sore and I was very dizzy. Additionally, my pulse felt fast but my heartbeat seemed to have less strength. My breathing felt more shallow like I wasn&#39;t getting as much oxygen from the air that I breathed in as I should. For the first two weeks, the dizziness was very strong. Now, at the three-week mark, it is more manageable and life is somewhat returning to normal. I visited an ENT doctor and their diagnosis was that my dizziness was not being caused by a preexisting medical condition.  Their prediction was that I would be fine, though looking back, I downplayed the severity of my vertigo. At its worst, I felt that, when I went for a walk outside, the surface was the Earth was violently spinning through space, with me stuck to the surface. It felt paralyzing. My body felt almost stuck in shock. I was afraid I would be stuck with this dizziness for the rest of my life since it was so long-lasting. Now, I am taking ginger pills and am watching my sodium intake. I feel better but am extra vigilant about taking ginger and not stressing myself too much. I do not plan on getting a second shot since some of my symptoms mirror those of anaphylaxis.

He reported he felt like he was about to pass out, he felt he had dry mouth and was thirsty. To provider he appeared pale and sweating. He was instructed to sit in chair and lean forward with head down towards knees. He was provided water and his blood pressure was taken. The first reading was 89/66 pulse 74. He stated he was not sure what his normal pressure was, but was usually low. He also stated that he had a light breakfast, and didn&#39;t really drink much that day. After his pressure was taken he reported to feel slightly better, and was observed for another 25-30 minutes. After this time passed, his blood pressure was taken again, and reading was 102/74 and his color appeared better, and was more alert. After a few more minutes, he said he felt much better. He also had eaten crackers at this time. He was provided v-safe form again, and encouraged to sign up for follow-up, and to continue to monitor closely any symptoms for at least the next 6 hours.

This is a young man with no precious hx of this. Hospital would not entertain the idea this was related to the vaccine. Was discharged with instructions to return if worse in the AM. Continued high blood pressure and heart rate  for another 24 hrs. Swollen lymph nodes by the next day. Blood work in hospital showed immune response happening but again hospital would not attribute to vaccine.

                                                Pt Fainted shortly after receiving vaccination. Pt came for a moderna covid vaccine with his friend, both first doses. Pt said he &#34;fainted recently&#34; from a shot where he fainted &#34;for a couple minutes&#34; according to his nurse, and he was sure it was psychologically induced by anxiety. He said he was more mentally prepared this time. After I gave the dose to him and his friend, he got lightheaded and slowly started losing consciousness in his seat after a few minutes.   Pt was alert and responded to our questions. I quickly stepped out to give the pt a bottle of water, and upon coming back to the IMZ room, his friend said he urinated himself. He was less responsive, but still alert. I notified the technician. He started to turn pale and felt more cold. He pulse was weak. I encouraged the pt&#39;s friend to keep him alert while we call EMS. I reminded the pt to keep breathing.   The technician called EMS, and I stayed with the patient to kept him calm, but alert until EMS arrived. Pt slowly felt better after a few minutes (color return, and temperature normalized). Pt said he was okay, and he was able to walk. EMS arrived and tested blood sugar; he was within normal range. Pt did not need EMS service, and went home with friend.

                                                At the pre-counsel stage, the patient said that he was a little nervous about getting this immunization, but wanted to go ahead and do it.  I counseled him on the immunization and sent him into the booth to get the shot.  Technician administered the vaccine and then told Technician that he felt a little nauseous.  Technician told him to stay seated.  A few seconds later the patient passed out and started slipping down the chair.  Technician grabbed him from behind and called me over to assist.  I yelled for Staff to call 9-1-1 and a code white.  I held him from the front and Technician held him from the back and we slowly lowered the patient to the floor.  Technician sat behind the patient to hold him up while I assessed the patient and tried see if he was responsive.  The patient was breathing and had a pulse, so I patted him on the face and chest to see if he would become responsive.  After about 15 seconds, the patient became responsive and confused.  He asked what happened and if he got the shot yet or not.  After talking to the patient for a moment he said he was fine, but needed to vomit.  I gave him a trash can and he vomited.  We gave the patient some water and sat with him on the ground for a few minutes until the paramedics arrived.  The paramedics took the patient&#39;s vitals and the patient said he felt fine and declined going to the hospital.  We had the patient sit in the observation area for another 30 minutes.  He said he felt totally fine and was ready to go home.

                                                While giving the patient his first vaccination, the needle was not properly secured to the syringe and the two parts separated while giving the vaccine. He got at least part of the dose, but we discussed giving him a second shot so he could receive the full dose. The patient seemed fine so I went to draw up the next dose, and as I was doing that, he started to get a little pale and said he was not feeling well. I gave him some water and sat with him while he was in a chair. He then began to fall forward and was unconscious. I caught him before he hit the ground, laid him down on his side, and he woke up fairly quickly after. We did not administer the rest of the dose and the patient waited around the pharmacy for 30 minutes, but he stated he felt much better with no concerns fairly quickly after the reaction.

Within the next few minutes the patient did the exact same thing and again responded after shaking by waking back up. Patient felt hot, weak and nauseous for quite a long time, he eventually vomited and thought he felt a little better. We called EMS and they responded by checking him over (B.S. 79 and Blood Pressure initially 87/60 but a repeat reading was 105/74 and patient felt well enough to decline a trip to the hospital. Patient was still feeling weak, so we observed him for over 2 hours and he took some water and drank some gatorade. After a bit we had him call his mother to drive him home. Patient was standing when we had one of our interns take him to his mother&#39;s car.

The next day the only symptom I had remaining was lung/chest pain. The discomfort as not subsided any since the day after I got the shot (it had been over a week and a half), if any it has worsened slightly. It hurt most when I exhale and relax. It is a tight feeling in my mid chest.

Approx, 10 minutes later I heard a noise and looked over at his and noticed he was started to fall out of his chair. He then became as stiff as a board and I held him in place until he came to. He was seemingly scared and not aware of his surroundings. He said that he was feeling better but was still light headed. He was given an icepack and water and took his mask off. He looked pale. He started to feel better and left approx 10 minutes after this happened. He told me that he was feeling dizzy before he passed out.

Client was given moderna vaccine in left deltoid and was asked to stay seated, but the client said he felt fine, that it was a small needle so he was allowed to walk to the waiting area and went to get a snack also. About 5 min after this I was called to the client as he was being lowered to the ground by his sister and MA with department. The client was unresponsive for about a min. We raised his legs and he regained consciousness soon after, and was able to open his eyes and  talk. About 3 min later client sat up on the ground, no other injuries per the client. A few minutes later he got himself up and sat on the bench. Still a little pale and diaphoretic. About 30 min after receiving vaccine he felt much better and said he was ok to leave and go back to work.

Patient reports normal postvaccination myalgias and fatigue for the last 2 days but had onset of left-sided chest pain that radiates to his upper back and is worse with deep inspiration, some positions and movement of his left upper extremity.  He denies cough, shortness of breath or rash.  He is low risk for pulmonary embolism with PERC score negative for PE.  Screening EKG showed a sinus rhythm with elevated J point in anterior-lateral leads, ? ST elevation in 1 and AVL w questionable reciprocal changes in leads 3 and AVF.  Patient went to CXR.  Clinically very low risk patient for STEMI from CAD.  ? Myocarditis or pericarditis?  No hx of stimulant use or early CAD in family.  Upon reevaluating the patient, clinically he seems to have musculoskeletal chest discomfort, worse with palpation and movement of LUE. Repeated EKG - showed more definative ST elevation through anterior and lateral leads with reciprocal changes in 2, 3, AVF.  Slight ST elevation in AVL.  ? Pericarditis vs myocarditis.     Will call cardiac alert.  Evolving EKG changes.  Discussed with ED physician and Interventional Cardiology, we agreed, patient likely has acute myocarditis clinically.  Very low risk for CAD.  Gave aspirin and heparin.  They will evaluate him.   Labs coming back... wbc 17.4, normal chemistry.  Sending off CRP, ESR.  Troponin pending.   Patient and family appreciative and understanding.   1710 - Follow up call from cardiology.  Stat echo normal wall motion.  With elevated CRP and mild trop 1.6, patient has myocarditis with pericarditis.  Dr very appreciative for the detailed history and physical.  CP free.  Holding off on cath lab.

He was referred to the ED where he had an elevated troponin and there was concern for myocarditis.    TTE done showed a normal ejection fraction and normal heart valves.    He denies recent illnesses. He denies recent sore throats or skin infections. He works in the hospitality industry but denies known recent COVID-19 infection.    Since admission he was seen by cardiology and was started on colchicine, indomethacin, and protonix. Telemetry has been reassuring. He reports feeling much better.

His friend with him said he passed out in the chair sitting down.We called 911 and I went to assess him and spoke to him and touched him with no response. He proceeded to slide out of chair and I brought him to the floor and laid his to the side. He twitched and eyes fluttered. I then injected him with epi-pen thinking he may have been having an allergic response. His skin was white. After injection his coloring came back and slowly started to speak.He was able to form sentences. Police and EMS came and assessed him within 10 minutes and took his blood pressure. He was coherent and coloring resumed on patients face. Patient stated he had a little of tingling and mentioned he passes out occasionally after giving blood. Patient was released and aunt came to store and did not seek any further medical attention even though ems wanted him to get checked out. Blood pressure continued to rise and EMS believes patient  had vasophagal syncope.

                                                For the next few days after I received the second dose of the vaccine, I experienced muscle and body aces, fatigue, and a low grade fever. About 3 days after getting the vaccine I woke up at about 2 AM on the 18th with severe chest pain, the other side effects had subsided at this point. I ended up going to the ER after about a half hour of the pain not going away. They ran a Troponin blood test and foinf my levels to be high. They also tested me for Covid which came back positive. They ended up doing an ultrasound of my heart, using a catheter to take a look at my arteries, a chest xray, a CT scan, and an EKG. The final diagnosis was myocarditis of the heart. I had to stay in the hospital for a few days while my heart stabilized. I was given orders to only participate in light exercise and to take it easy for now. I have a follow up visit with the cardiologist in about a week frok now. It was also found out through testing that I may have Wolf Parkinson&#39;s white syndrome.

He was also very pale. EMS were called around 1516 patient&#39;s VS were BP 92/52, HR 42, R 10, 02 95%. When EMS arrived they attempted to do orthostatic BO his seated BP was still low (I don&#39;t have reading) and when they stood him up he got woozy again so they seated him. The decision was made for him to be taken to ER by EMS Transport. Patient denies any medical history or NKDA. Tr

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

                                                On Thursday, March 11th, 2021 approximately 3:10 pm, Patient received his first dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot number: 003A21A) in his left deltoid  Patient received the Moderna Vaccine.

Approximately five minutes later around 3:15 pm, Patient experienced syncope, fell out of his chair, hit the left side of his forehead on the ground. Due to the fall, he experienced a mild abrasion on the left side of his forehead, which led to bleeding.  The Physician?s Assistant rushed to aid Patient who was lying on the ground in a supine position. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) - Fire Department and ambulance were called immediately and approximately five minutes later EMS arrived. During the time frame prior to EMS arrival, the Physician?s Assistant asked numerous questions to Patient to assess his condition. She asked Patient if he could breathe and he responded ?yes?. She asked Patient  if he was short of breath and he responded ?no?. She asked Patient if he felt like his throat was closing and he responded ?no?. At this point, an Epinephrine pen was not used.  Patient was alert and the Orient x 4 questions were asked [(1) Who are you? (2) Where are you? (3) What is the date and time? (4) What just happened to you?]. Patient also denied head pain, neck pain, nausea or chest pain. Staff performed a limited neuro-exam and was deemed within normal limits. Patients Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 Patient  mentioned that he has a phobia of needles and something like this has happened before when he was ?young?.

Patient also mentioned that he only consumed two cookies and coffee for that day.  When the EMS arrived (about 5 firefighters), they interviewed him and performed a blood pressure test. His sitting blood pressure was 130/82. One of the firefighters assessed his spine and Patient denied cervical, thoracic, and lumbar tenderness or pain. The firefighter assessed Patient&#39;s glucose level, which was a bit difficult to obtain in the first initial efforts, with the glucometer reading ?error?. The firefighters eventually were able to obtain a reading on Patient&#39;s glucose and it read 86. Patient was able to stand on his own, and a second blood pressure test was performed; his standing blood pressure reading was 145/89.  EMS gave Patient gauze to address his head wound Patient initially refused to go to the hospital, but per EMS protocol, fluids needed to be administered. Patient entered the ambulance and was taken to the hospital by EMS.

                                                Pt received the first of the two-series COVID vaccination at 1512. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, he was noted to have severe diaphoresis, prominent pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. His head initially fell back and head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. This provider was speaking to the pt and performed a sternal rub to elicit a response, pt remained unresponsive and with eyes closed. Pt remained in this state for approximately 10 seconds. Pt noted to suddenly have some muscular rigidity to arms and torso and in order to prevent injury upon possible onset of seizure activity, pt was lowered to the floor by this provider and RN . Once on the ground the pt was relaxed and opened his eyes. Pt was immediately verbally responsive and asked if he passed out. Pt was able to sit up and was assisted into the wheelchair. Pt moved to treatment area where vitals and blood glucose were obtained. (@1525 BG- 104 mg/dL, VS BP 116/72, HR bradycardic @51 bpm, O2 sat 95%).  Patient responses/speech was clear and pt was oriented to self, place, time and situation. Pt stated that he felt nauseated upon sitting in the observation area and admitted that he only had a coffee today, nothing to eat all day and attributed this as the cause of his reaction. Pt verbalized that he would not respond to the hospital with the paramedics and was encouraged to at least call someone to take him to the hospital.  This provider spoke with the patient?s mother and explained the events. The patient?s mother stated that the patient had febrile seizures when approximately 4 years old, associated with asthma exacerbations; but pt was evaluated with a neurologist and there were no abnormal findings. Pt admitted that he has a similar syncopal episode after washing a laceration and seeing his finger bleeding. Pt states this was a few years ago and witnessed by his father that told the patient he initially fainted and then became momentarily rigid before responding appropriately (similar to today?s events).   Ambulance - arrival @1536 report given and pt stated he was feeling better and declined further evaluation in truck and also declined transport to ED ( departed at 1545). Pt?s overall condition, appearance, including color was much improved. Pt denied any allergies or medication history. Past medical hx of febrile seizures at approximately age three and four, childhood asthma and one syncopal episode as an adult. Pt girlfriend  arrival and she agreed to drive patient from the vaccine clinic.  Pt and girlfriend were both provided with an explanation of the many concerning causes of syncope and the necessity for further evaluation in the Emergency department to rule out any underlying conditions. Both patient and girlfriend verbalized understanding and although they still declined to respond to ED directly from the clinic, both did agree to respond to ED if any changes in mental status occurred.  Pt lives alone, but agreed to stay with parents and family in order to have others watch him for any changes.  Pt was advised to followup with PCP and made aware that an  provider would contact him tomorrow to check on his status, understanding verbalized and agreed with plan of care.

                                                Around 11:30pm I started to get chills and my teeth started to chatter. At the same time my body was shaking slightly. I was laying on the couch during the start of it for the above events, this lasted for about 20&#43; minutes. Then I tried to get up to go to bed. I was shaking very badly at this point, teeth chattering a lot and I was very cold. I tried to use the bathroom and I couldn&#39;t even stand still to use the bathroom. My chest was also tightening and it was hard to breathe.   I went to bed to lay down and I was practically hyperventilating for about 15 minutes at a time and I would stop for a minute then it would start up again. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn&#39;t because I couldn&#39;t breathe and my chest was closing in, it felt like.   I called my parents in and they sat with me and gave me ibuprofen and benedryl. I started to feel better after about an hour. During that time, though, my body was extremely hot (but no fever) but I was still cold and had the chills. My head also was hurting like a headache and my eyes were really hot too. It was hard to get air and if I sat up I would get dizzy.

                                                Syncope. Pt fell backwards as he was leaving immunization room for waiting/observation area after receiving first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Episode lasted roughly 15 seconds at which point patient regained alertness. It was determined no epinephrine etc was needed. Pt was observed following episode until he was clearly okay to leave on his own accord, and no further medical attention would be necessary. Discussed follow up with PCP post event and to discuss appropriateness of receiving second dose.  Out of an abundance of caution, contacted patient later in the evening (about 1.5 hrs later) at home to check up and make sure he was still okay.

He is admitted for further treatment, and required a three day admission with IVF, and IV narcotics and antiemetics to control his nausea and Abd symptoms. He denied dyspnea.

                                                Patient fainted shortly after receiving second dose of Moderna Covid vaccine. When I approached the patient he was laying on the ground and very pale but still breathing. I rolled him onto his back and elevated his feet and asked him to keep breathing and try to stay calm. I asked someone to grab him some water and someone else to run to the pharmacy and grab the pharmacy manager while I monitored the patient. I asked if I could help him sit up to drink some water and he accepted. After sitting up I asked if he had eaten and if I could get him something to eat. He stated he hadn&#39;t eaten all day and that he had a panic disorder and felt like he was having a panic attack. I asked if he had medicine he needed to take to help him feel better, he stated no, he needed to just wait it out. Then he told me he felt like he was going to throw up and I got him a waste basket that he threw up in right away. I asked the patient if he hit his head or if he wanted us to call an ambulance; he stated no to both questions. The pharmacy manager arrived and sat with the patient for the next half hour or more until he felt better. He stated that his dad was going to take him home now that he felt better. Some store staff had us fill out an incident report and the pharmacy manager walked the customer out to his car where he said he would call and find his dad.

Around 6 pm, I started to experience lower back pain and my legs began to throb and my whole body became very sensitive to touch. I took tylenol or ibuprofen every 4 hours for the rest of the night. This went on until Thursday 4/15/21, when the dizziness and throbbing headache started. Every time I would stand up I would become off balanced and need to hold on to something. I was still experiencing the lower back pain, leg throbbing and skin sensitivity but the dizziness and headache became much more intense. Around 9:30  pm on Thursday, I felt like I was hallucinating and was experiencing euphoria along with a fever. I did not sleep the night of 4/15 into 4/16. I was sweating profusely with a throbbing headache that would cause spinning when I would stand up. Around 3 am on 4/16, I fell asleep until around 4:30 am when I woke up in a pool of my own sweat. The body aches, leg pain and skin sensitivity went away along with my fever. Throughout Friday 4/16, I had a throbbing headache and was dizzy with no relief. This continued into Sunday 4/18 when I started to feel some relief. My headache was pretty much gone but the dizziness is still very much there. I have also an experienced elevated heart rate and respirations throughout the last 5 days.

Performed my daily routines uneventfully other than just not feeling 100 percent. By that evening the chest pain returned. On 4/18, I awoke with severe chest pains. I then presented to the ER where was presumed I was having a heart attack vs. acute pericarditis/myocarditis.

When I got to him, he was unresponsive, but within seconds he became alert. He said he had a history of passing out after medical procedures (when seeing a md after finger surgery). He layed down for about 20 minutes, then sat back in chair. About 30 min after passing out, he said he was dizzy and passed out a 2nd time. He became alert after about 10 seconds. He was here about 30 more min then felt ok and left.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna vaccine. After receiving the vaccination and while waiting 15 minutes, the patient became extremely light-headed and passed out out of the chair. Patient immediately regained consciousness and was helped back into chair by myself and his brother. Patient was still dizzy. I immediately told one associate to call 911 and another associate was able to call for management. Afterwards, I told an associate to go grab the patient a water and some hard candy to elevate his blood glucose. I confirmed that the patient has not had seizures in the past. The patient stated that he had not eaten very much today (just a smoothie) and wasn&#39;t adequately hydrated. I stayed with the patient the whole time until the paramedics arrived and were able to test his vitals. The patient was eventually cleared to go home and went home with his brother.

                                                Patient fainted after receiving his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He was very nervous and breathing hard before the vaccine because he is afraid of needles. After receiving his vaccine he was standing in the vaccine area with the woman he was with. The woman was also receiving a vaccine. He was still very nervous about needles and I suggested that he wait in the post-vaccination area so he didn&#39;t have to witness the woman receiving her vaccine. While walking to the post-vaccination area the patient fainted. After fainting he woke up right away. Another pharmacist and a technician immediately went to check on him and assist him. Patient thinks that he fainted because of his fear of needles.

                                                Patient is 22 year-old, admitted to the Cardiology 3  Emergency Department with acute myocarditis shortly following the receipt of his 2nd Moderna COVID-19 vaccination.   He has a remote history of acute pericarditis (01/12/2014) following viral illness, which was treated with high dose ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d.  At that time, he presented with retrosternal chest pain worse with laying down and fever/myalgia, rigors and chills (T 103.3°F) with laboratory findings consistent with leukocytosis 17.3, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 43, but normal ESR 12) with a negative influenza screen.  ECG demonstrated diffuse ST wave elevations in leads I, II, aVF, V1-V6.  He had resolution of symptoms with NSAID treatment.   On this occasion, he presented with non-radiating retrosternal chest pain not responding to Ibuprofen 800 mg.  At the ED, ECG demonstrated diffuse ST elevation, troponinemia 629/725/712/1319, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 38.2, ESR 19).  He had normal D-dimer and SARS-CoV-2 PCR was undetected.  A cardiac MRI was obtained that demonstrated patchy subepicardial enhancement in the mid-apical lateral-anterolateral myocardium, suggestive of myocarditis.  EKG showed diffuse ST elevation.  He was treated with Toradol and fentanyl for pain management with improvement of symptoms.  He was then admitted to Cardiology 3 for further evaluation and management.   Upon admission, Infectious Disease was consulted given the novelty of his presenting symptoms and findings.  Extensive evaluation including connective tissue cascade, respiratory viral panel and tick bone panel have not yielded any significant findings.  They suspected this could be related to his recent COVID vaccine given that there have been reports of myocarditis that have occurred following COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccinations, though it is not clear whether there is a definite cause or effect.  Moreover, the association of myocarditis and the messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccinations appears to be controversial, not supported by recent FDA reports.  All in all, the Infectious Disease team recommended no specific therapies, but the case should be reported as a possible adverse event associated with the recent Moderna vaccination to VAERS.  The center where the patient received this vaccination should make this report. Emergency Management Director was notified to report the event.  They also felt that it may be reasonable to avoid the Moderna and perhaps even the Pfizer messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccination in the future to be conservative.   While inpatient, his troponin level continued to trend up and peaked at 1707.  An EKG was repeated and showed improvement in ST elevation from his initial EKG with no other acute changes.  His case was discussed with Dr., who felt that a steroid taper would be appropriate.  Additional chest pain was treated with PRN Ibuprofen 600 mg QID.  After initiation of steroids, troponin markedly improved to 706.  Due to his history of impaired fasting glucose, his blood glucose levels were monitored q.i.d.  While slightly elevated, he did not require any sliding scale insulin while inpatient.  We will plan to have his primary care provider assess his glucose level at his follow-up visit.  Additionally, while receiving NSAIDs and steroids, his blood pressure was elevated to the 150s to 160 systolic.  He was initiated on Coreg prior to dismissal.   He was dismissed on 04/29/2021 given improving troponin and no concerning arrhythmias on continuous telemetry monitoring.  He will follow up in the Cardiomyopathy Clinic in 3 months with a repeat cardiac MRI and stress ECG.  We have recommended the patient to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the next 3 months until seen by the cardiomyopathy Clinic.  He was provided with education and a letter delineating work restrictions.

When the patient came to he said he must have gone to sleep.  The patient stated he passed out the week before and thought it was due to not eating.  EMS checked vitals, and all vitals were good.  Pt refused to go to the hospital, he left with his wife and she drove.  I told the patient I would follow up with him via a phone call to see how he was feeling.  I called pt at 5 pm on 5-28, he stated he was fine

When I got to him he was sweating and his arms were twitching. Even though he was alert, he was struggling  to straighten his arms. I made a 911 call and then administered one dose of epipen then within  a minute he thanked me for the epipen and he said he is feeling much better. Finally the paramedics came in and asked him if he still wants to go for further checkups. He agreed and left the store with the paramedics.

                                                Patient is a 22 y.o. male with no previous cardiac history, no known cardiovascular risk factors, and no significant past medical history.  2 days ago he received his second dose of the Maderna Covid vaccine.  Yesterday he reported flulike symptoms with fever to 102 degrees, generalized myalgias, and fatigue.  He awoke at 2 AM this morning with sharp somewhat diffuse substernal pain unrelated to activity, inspiration, exertion, position, without radiation or associated symptoms.  He took Tylenol which eventually caused the pain to decrease in intensity.  He called his family, discussed it with his girlfriend, did some online research, and came to the ER for evaluation where his EKG demonstrated anterior T wave abnormalities and his high-sensitivity troponin came back elevated at 16,072.  His pain is now fully resolved, he is being admitted to the hospitalist service, and cardiology consultation was requested. June 6, 2021

This all started a few days after my second shot of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on May 5, 2021. I went to an UrgentCare on May 24th, and the nurse told me &#34;this is happening to everyone... it&#39;s just something going around... it will go away&#34;. A week later, I went somewhere else and got Amoxicillin. I took Amoxicillin for 7 days and it did not resolve my cough. My primary doctor is currently not seeing any patients for &#34;respiratory-related illnesses&#34;.

EMS arrived and conversed with patient, took vitals, and recommended him to go home and rest as he was finally feeling better; overall, it took roughly 3 hours for symptoms to completely fade.

Approximately 1 minute after it began to itch I got very hot and nauseous, approximately 30 seconds later I was unconscious and beginning to seize. I was unconscious for about 1 minute. When I awoke I couldn?t see anything, my entire body was numb and in pain. I couldn?t move my fingers. I was rushed to the ER but by the time I was seen I was fully coherent and fine.

Also developed chest discomfort that progressively got worse over the next 1-2 days which prompted him to visit the ED   on 04/18.   He was found to have troponin elevation  with diffuse J-point elevation.    He received aspirin and was started on heparin drip.   Chest pain completely resolved by the next day. Coronary angiogram was negative. Cardiology attributed stroke elevation and chest pain to myocarditis secondary to vaccine.  Echo was normal with no evidence of pericardial effusion.

Upon arrival, it was noted that a young man in the passenger seat was slumped with his head on his chest and unresponsive. It was witnessed that the passenger stiffened and started shaking as if he was having a seizure. The nurse was called. It was noted that the shaking lasted just a few seconds and he then relaxed and opened his eyes. Once the RN, received call that there was a person having a seizure, 3  nurses went to the scene.  Once RN arrived at the car the patient was awake and alert. The patient was assessed, and he was able to answer questions. History of the patient from the mother revealed that he has responded to other vaccines in the past by having a vagal response. RN noted that there were no signs of patient being postictal. Patient was alert, oriented and stated that he was feeling better. EMS arrived and assessed patient and noted that he was in no distress. Patient denied transport to ED. RN educated patient on importance of reporting this to nurse prior to next vaccination.

After talking to him while in observation, he mentioned that it felt like he was out for 5 minutes even though it only lasted for about 10-15 seconds. He mentioned that 12 years ago this happened (someone had thrown a rock and it hit his hand and when the nurse went to clean it, he went cold and when he came to it was exactly how it was after getting the vaccine). He only recalls feeling cold. When patient was about to leave, I suggested to him to reach out to his PCP to see if it&#39;s ok to give his 2nd dose with us or if he should be observed in a clinic setting. I did a follow up call a few hours later and he is doing fine.

I helped the patient out of his chair and onto the floor. I retrieved an instant cold pack and prepared it. When I returned to the patient 45 seconds later, he said the coolness of the ground helped. He did not feel dizzy anymore but his fingers were still tingling. I gave him the cold pack to place behind his neck and provided him a bottle of water. I had him lie prone for another 5 minutes. When I re-assessed, he was no longer feeling any negative symptoms and he no longer looked pale nor felt clammy.

                                                23-year-old-male presented for a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The patient was seated with his feet planted firmly on the floor. Immediately following vaccination, the patient had some blood running down his arm. I reached for a cotton swab to apply pressure and stop the bleeding, but the patient began to faint. I immediately positioned myself next to the patient; and held his head and arm to keep him in a sitting position. The patient regained consciousness after about twenty seconds. I began talking with the patient to ensure it was only a fainting spell. The patient was groggy but became clear-headed after about a minute. Upon further discussion, the patient stated this happens every time he sees blood, has bloodwork done or receives vaccines. The patient recounted a time when he cut his hand at work and fainted immediately. The patient was doing deep breathing exercises immediately after regaining consciousness. When asked, he said it helps him focus. I asked the patient if he wanted us to call anyone to pick him up but he refused. The patient was advised to remain seated, and we would transition him to the waiting area once he felt stable enough. After about 5 minutes the patient was helped to the waiting area (from our counseling room about 10-15 feet away). I advised him to remain in the waiting area for 30 minutes for further monitoring. The patient was offered juice, water and a snack but declined. After the 30 minute waiting period, the patient was clear-headed and appeared to be in the same state as when he arrived for the vaccine.

Once seated the patient lost conciousness and slid out of chair to floor for approximately 5 seconds, then regained concoiousness.  Patient advised me that he as done this during previous blood draw and immunizations.  Patient did not want to seek additional medical attention and in my professional opinion was of sound mind to make that decision.  His brother in law was with him and agreed that no further treatment was necessary at that time.  Monitored patient for approximately 25 minutes and patient left under his own power.

                                                23 yo man in high school when standing, admitted wit acute onset epigastric abdominal pain after a run, found to have mild elevation in troponin, flat at 0.04, dynamic EKG changes admitted or work-up  1. Acute epigastric abdominal pain/elevated troponin: The patient was chest pain free from the time of treatment with Pepcid, magic mouthwash, and Toradol in ED. His echo is without wall motion abnormalities, troponin is flat and remains chest pain free. The patient had a CT PE protocol study and CTA coronary without acute findings. He had a cardiac MRI which showed no acute myocarditis but may have had some delayed contrast enhancement and may represent prior myocarditis. He was started on low dose lisinopril 2.5 mg po daily for cardio-protection, will reduce physical activity with slow return to activity, and follow with cardiology with an urgent exercise stress test as an outpatient. His u tox shows cannabinoids and no other intoxicants, His lipid panel wnl, HDL 65, LDL 84, His TSH is wnl. His CRP and ESR is wnl.    2. Left axillary lymphadenopathy: Discussed with patient lymph nodes seen on CT scan in left axilla and left pectoral region. Patient cofnirmed he had a COVID 19 Moderna vaccine in the left arm on 4/3/2021. Epic documentation notes in the right axilla, but patient is clear that he had the vaccine in the left arm. Axillary lymphadenopathy is not surprising in this situation.   3. Small 4 mm nodules noted on CT scan: The patient had no infectious symptoms, no cough, no fever, and no elevated WBC. He does smoke marijuana but has no tobacco use. He can follow with PCP to further risk stratify the nodules, either with PPD, and consideration of repeat scan in 6-12 months as needed.   4. Mild bilateral gynecomastia: I informed patient this has been found. He is not bothered by this finding and it seems an incidental finding. He can follow with his PCP for further evaluation as needed for this finding.   Inpatient Consultants and summary of recommendations: 1.

At 1948, EMT noticed that the client?s face was becoming pale and diaphoretic. EMT alerted PHN and both responded to the patient at 1948 and transitioned the client into the zero gravity chair. Client was reluctant to sit in the zero gravity chair and stated, ?I?m feeling anxious and this is not helping especially with my aunt.? Client?s aunt was very concerned and was anxious about what was happening and was standing over the client. PHN asked the aunt to sit in her seat and allow us to assess the client.

At 1952 client stated, ?I?m feeling fine now, I?m not sweating anymore.? Vital signs were taken at 1952 (Blood pressure 130/70, heartrate 87, Oxygen 98%). At 1952, client?s color had returned to his face and his skin was no longer diaphoretic. PHN  asked the client if he has history of fainting from needles, and the client stated, ?no, but I have anxiety.? Vital signs were taken at 2002 (blood pressure 112/70, heart rate 68, oxygen 97%). Client stated that he ate two hours before receiving the vaccine. Vital signs taken at 2010 (blood pressure 114/74, heart rate 78, oxygen 97%).

                                                I kept a log of the events that occurred. Notes: 25mg amitriptyline taken nightly for the last month, 200mg motrin I?ve never taken pain killers before this, time is in military.   Mar 18  1430 (1 hour 30 mins after my shot) i have a compressing headache toward the back of my head so i take 1 motrin.  1700 i head home, take 1 amitriptyline and head straight to sleep. ( i have no apatite so no dinner ) Mar 19 0100 The pain starts, it?s unbearable. I am sweating heavily and im also shivering cold. i have a high fever I have body aches which turns my shivering into shaking which keeps my wife up all night. In my dreams i feel pain. I talked to my deceased mother, i hold my deceased cat and i relive some of my most regrettable moments.  0700 I wake up, the bed is soaking wet. I take a motrin and get dressed. it takes me an hour longer to get ready for work because, the pain has sapped my energy. My supervisor sends me home seeing how horrible I look. 0900 I take an amitriptyline and lay down. I ask me wife to close to the storm shutters to darken the room. They are normally pretty quiet to close but, this time they are deafeningly loud. I struggled to get 1 hour of sleep.  1500 I wake up due to shaking so bad that i hit my head on the wall. I then take 2 motrin and about 30 mins later i notice theres a tightness in my chest. i take 1 tums. I know that my body is exhausted from the pain and my mind is clouded but i really wanted to do all of the tasks that i was planning on doing this weekend. All of the tasks end up failing. 2100 i try the tasks again and end up failing again.   20 Mar 0100. I eat a pear and 2 cheetos. i do not take a amitriptyline and i lay down. i have no pain or fever. (Dream start) The dream i had is of me watching myself get thrown around by a ghost. The ghost possesses my body for a short time. I grab some kittens (cats are a comfort to me so im guessing that my subconscious trying to reel me back in) I then wake my sleeping wife and tell her theres a ghost and we need to leave. We walk outside and im in an old neighborhood that i grew up in, everything darkens and im in pitch black feeling my way around a room. I open my eyes and im in a hotel. The front desk staff will not let me take the kittens up to my room so i leave them. When i walk into the room, it?s full of kittens (dream end) and i wake up  21 Mar 0900 I wake up and I have a sore throat and tightness in my chest. The soreness prevents me from going back to sleep and the tightness in my chest causing some anxiety. Once I calm myself down and convince myself that im not having a heart attack I take 2 motrin and some tums and the pain goes away from the day. These could be some withdrawals from not taking amitriptyline since 19 mar in the morning. This is still happening as I write this report. (23 March 2021)

                                                Earlier today, a Moderna patient at 3213 experienced a 15-30 second seizure after receiving his 1st Moderna vaccine. Shortly after sitting down for his 15-minute post immunization observation period, patient X began seizing resulting in him falling to the ground from a seated position to his left side and seizing for about 15-20 seconds. Patient was positioned in a left lateral recumbent position. Code white was called and EMT arrived on site within 10 minutes.   Patient&#39;s immunization questionnaire did NOT have any contraindications that would warrant he should not receive the vaccine. Patient reported no allergies to medications/past immunizations/foods and reported no seizure and/or neurological condition.   Once recovered and at baseline, patient reported having a light breakfast this morning and also having a needle phobia that may have played a role in his adverse response.   Shortly after recovering, patient was coherent and aware of person, place, and time. He remained weak and fatigue and BP readings from EMT indicated hypotension. EKG was normal.   Patient&#39;s mother happened to be waiting outside in the car. One of my associates was able to call her in and we updated here on the event.   EMT recommended, and patient agreed, to be taken to the hospital for further examination.

He had a brief seizure while on the ground and someone called for help. I ran over and yelled for someone to call 911. He stopped seizing and stood up when he came to. I supported him and asked him to have a seat. He sat down and I asked how he felt and if he would like food or water. He said he felt okay but accepted the food and water. At that time, firefighters that had been shopping in the store arrived and started interviewing the patient. They took his pulse and blood sugar levels. Medics arrived and he continued to be monitored. After several minutes, he refused the ambulance and said he was feeling good enough to leave.

                                                Pt was sitting in post-vaccination area for his 15 minute observation time when he passed out after a few minutes. He had fallen onto the floor beside his chair. I immediately went out to pt. His eyes were fluttering. I shook pt and asked if he was okay. Pt opened his eyes and sat up seemed disoriented and said that he felt nauseated. I told pt to lay down on his back and elevate his feet on the chair, and told my technician to grab a bucket, an ice pack, and to call code white. We applied the ice pack to pts head. A member of management and an EMT who happened to be in the store reported over very shortly. Pt said he did think that he hit his head and his head did hurt. We asked the pt if he wanted us to call an ambulance. Pt said no, he was feeling a little better and he just wanted to wait a little bit and then finish his shopping. Pt was feeling better and was able to get back into the chair and sit. Pt appeared pale and we got him a drink of water. Pt sat and rested for sometime and after about an hour he said he was okay and was going to finish his shopping.

                                                A few minutes after receiving his vaccine, patient fainted and went down to floor. He was immediately responsive and sat up. I provided him a cold compress to his neck. A few moments later, he started to slump and appear to fall asleep. He was again immediately responsive. We moved him onto the floor and called paramedics. They arrived, checked his vitals and cleared him. He left with his father.

                                                On Sunday April 25th 2021, I woke up with severe chest pain that went up to the right side of my neck, as well as having shortness of breath.  I was admitted into the ER and they ran blood work, did a CT scan and x ray of My chest. When my bloodwork came back, it showed I had very elevated troponin levels. Because I was having continuous pain, I was given morphine but it didn&#39;t work. So they upped it and gave me dilaudid and that took the pain away. It was in the doctors best interest I get transported to a facility with a good cardiatric team. Upon arriving to the new facility, they further drew my blood and ran more tests. I got admitted as an in patient on the cardiatric floor. The cardiologists ordered for me to have an echocardiogram done, another CT scan with a special protocol to view my heart, and an MRI done of my heart.   After my echocardiogram and CT scan came back fine, the doctors said they&#39;d be surprised if the MRI DIDNT show something. When that result came back, it did reveal my heart was still inflamed.   After ruling out all other possibilities they concluded that the 2nd Dose of Moderna COVID vaccination I&#39;d received was the culprit behind my diagnosis. My diagnosis being, a case of myocarditis as well as a mild heart arrhythmia.   For the next several months I am kn a medication called metoprolol 25mg, 2 half tablets a day, to correct my heart arrhythmia and relieve stress from my heart as well as minimize the amount of stress I encounter each day. No heavy lifting pushing or pulling of any sort for the next 3 months.

Paramedics checked him out and monitored his BP, HR, and Mental Status. Pt was taken to the hospital upon his consent.

                                                A few seconds after shot, pt became pale and immunizer asked if he was ok. His muscles tensed and shook a little and he passed out, falling slightly to the right. The technician was able to place herself between him and the floor and slowly lower down, leaning  against the wall of the pharmacy.  By this point, about 30 seconds at most had passed, and pt was awake and cognitive, but had no recollection of passing out or how he had gotten to the floor. He did know his name and where he was, but was breathing heavy.  We took his blood pressure at this point and it was 82/46 with a pulse in the 40&#39;s as well.  Pt refused ambulance and we had him continue to sit on the floor.  Patient mentioned he had this type of reaction in past to other vaccines (not stating what), though only telling us prior he had &#34;slight dizziness once&#34;.   He also stated he had not had anything to eat or drink that am so we got him a snack and some water.  Patient continued to breath deeper as we suggested and stay on the floor as we called mgmt from the store.   We took blood pressure about 10 minutes later and it had gone up to 117/71.  and then again 10 minutes later and it was 121/69.  After 30 minutes total, pt asked if he could stand and leave.  He stood with no dizziness and said he felt &#34;fine&#34;.   We called patient approximately an hour later at his residence to make sure he got home ok and patient stated he had no other symptoms at that time and continued to feel &#34;normal&#34;.

Technician, Intern, and myself were checking on patient immediately after he fainted.  He very quickly &#34;came to&#34; and we then helped him up and into the IMZ room to sit.  A store manager was very close when it happened and let other management know of code white.  While monitoring patient, I called 911 to get paramedics to the scene.  I stayed on the phone with them while monitoring patient and asking questions.  Paramedics soon arrived and a store manager began filling out incident form.  The paramedics assessed patient and asked if he would like them to take him to the hospital.  Pt declined.  We gave patient cold cloth, water, and ice pack.  He had a small bump on the upper right hand side of his forehead.  He was feeling much better when he left, had someone to drive him.  I encouraged the pt to go to ER if any pain, vision changes, headaches, nausea/vomiting.

                                                He got the vaccine, mom received her shot and the pharmacist said they were done, and he told his mother that he was feeling a little dizzy and anxious and wanted to sit down.  They were going to the car and he got in first as he was going to drive, and mother got in the car, and he acted like his head was spinning, had a blank stare and started making weird sounds like he could not breath, started foaming at the mouth and then he passed out.  She called 9-1-1 and when they got there he was coming out of it.  They checked his VS and said that everything was OK, and felt that he did not need to go to the hospital but it was their call.  He didn&#39;t want to go either.  She drove him home and he slept OK, he had a bad headache and felt extremely tired and lied down.  He seemed to be OK the next day other than his arm being sore, but no other issues and he&#39;s been fine since.  The pharmacy did not have them wait before leaving to make sure they were OK, the pharmacist told her they were fine and they could go, but the incident occurred within 5 minutes of the vaccine.

Patient fell to the ground on his stomach and I rushed over to turn him on his back. He tried getting up and looked like he had no strength and kept falling back and trying again. The other pharmacist raised his legs while I supported his neck and checked for pulse. Initially we thought it was a seizure but patient was saying he just could not raise his head up and kept going in and out of consciousness. We stayed with the patient for 30 minutes and he felt perfectly fine. Gave him an ice pack for his forehead, but the shoulder took the brunt of the impact.

                                                Initially I had experienced the standard adverse effects of drowsiness, a little difficulty sleeping, minor chills. The next day following my Dose 1 of the Moderna Vaccine, I started noticed chest pains on both sides of the chest. It wasn&#39;t from breathing and not very consistent or something I could re-create on command. It seemed to happen every hour for a few seconds and was a sudden, sharp pain. That was a concern for me so I did some basic internet searches and found that Chest pains are a symptom of the vaccine. I didn&#39;t think too much of it after that but It was a concern I kept in my head. My timeline gets a little foggy here but either that same day or the following day, the chest pains were still happening and I wasn&#39;t feeling 100%. One evening I went to take a bath. As I was laying in the water, my heart rate felt off, almost as if it was skipping a beat or not in the right rhythm. I remember laying in the bathtub, trying to count my pulse or seeing if I could &#34;catch&#34; the incorrect beat.  Rather than one normal heartbeat it felt like there was 2 beats very closely timed with each other. My heart rate felt faster than normal considering I was only laying down in water and didn&#39;t do any exercises the past few days. Unfortunately I never was able to find a good way to track the pulse and timing, but I was sure that something was wrong. I had difficulty sleeping that night because I kept feeling something wrong with my heart rhythm.  I got worried that I would need to go to the emergency room, but I told myself to sleep it off and if the chest pains and awkward heart beat continues for 5 days, I would go see a doctor. As for an outcome, thankfully I stopped noticing it around day 4 and haven&#39;t had chest pains since.  I am extremely worried as to how my body will react to Dose #2.

I felt the pain above my stomach, below my sternum, and above my heart, and it was a sharp, stabbing pain. My heart was also beating faster than normal.  The stabbing chest pain continued for the next few hours before eventually subsiding. However, for the next few days I occasionally felt a fleeting, stabbing chest pain. After a few days, it went away completely. I had never had such a sustained chest pain before.

Gave patient orange juice as he had had nothing to eat or drink since last night.  He would not allow us to call the ambulance for him.  told him to wait around for 30 minutes after he stated he as feeling normal allowed him to leave.  Spoke with patient today and said he was feeling fine.

                                                The patient was administered the vaccination, observed for 15 minutes following the vaccination, after which he left to return to work at a pharmacy. The patient came back into the store about on hour later to pick up some things for his pharmacy and reported feeling a little chest pain. The patient was then informed to keep monitoring the pain and if it got any worse to go to the doctors office. About 2 hours later, the patient called when on the way to the emergency room and reported chest pain and a fever of 102 degrees (at the highest). Around 3pm, which was about 6 hours after the vaccination was administered, the patient reported chest pain was alleviated and that the emergency room treated him for a migraine/nausea with Tylenol #3, Fioricet and Zofran.

Muscle soreness in injected arm.

                                                During the first night after receiving vaccine I started to have SEVERE shaking / full body muscle spasms-hypertonicity that  lasted 60-90 minutes. Required 30 minutes hot shower to calm down shaking symptoms. Initially thought episodes were caused/triggered by cold temperature (still possibility) but now thinking its triggered by anxiety. Heart rate almost spikes to 120-130 BPM. No fever and normal blood pressure is noted when episodes happen.  Occurrences is not routine and seem to be random.  Very concerning considering symptoms lasted for 2 &#43; weeks now. I do not have health care or ability to see PCP/GP without paying out of pocket.   Now please understanding the severity of these episodes, to the point where it resembles severe Parkinson&#39;s symptoms.   Along with those I still have the normal side effects, fatigue  (extreme)  , mood changes, joint aches, intolerance to cold off and on,  and elevated HR.

                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.

A few minutes later I woke up on the floor and asked what had happened. I was not sure what had happened.  I felt fine when I woke up. When first responders arrived they asked me if I knew who I was, the date, the president, where I lived to all I was able to answer correctly. I went to the ER and they did a ECG, blood test, urine test, chest x-ray, CT of my head and they said everything came back normal. I was prescribed Keppra and have an MRI scheduled in the coming week.

I couldn&#39;t stand up and was scared to walk, so I was put on a stretcher. My throat started to close up. I was put in an ambulance and my throat swelled more on the trip to the ER. They gave me Benadryl and Prednisone. I was there for about 4 or 5 hours. I was okay after that. I checked the CDC site and it said I couldn&#39;t take the 2nd dose.

                                                He was ok right after administering vaccination. 10 minutes later he stood up and said he was feeling hot and collapsed on the floor. Seemed like he was having difficulty in breathing.  Called 911 and administered chest compressions. He was partially alert during chest compressions and after 2 minutes of administering chest compressions he gained full consciousness and requested me to stop chest compressions and requested an ice pack to place on his forehead and also requested some electrolyte drink  and they were provided. He sat up on the floor after a few minutes. He also said this fainting happens to him all the time when he gets any shot (injection). He  was responsive and sat on a chair until paramedics arrived. on arrival they asked his couple of questions and checked his blood pressure and monitored his heat for a few minutes. He left with paramedics about 30 minutes from the time of vaccination.

                                                The patient fainted about 5 minutes after administration of the vaccine. He mentioned before the vaccine that this also happened before his last vaccine (M-M-R) and said it was related to anxiety associated with getting vaccines/needlephobia. I asked him if he felt comfortable getting the vaccine today and he said to go ahead and give him the shot. At the time of injection he started breathing a little heavier but looked relatively well. After about 5 minutes in our waiting area, he started to look pale and fainted. The pharmacy manager and technician went to check on him. He was not responsive for about 30 minutes before he came to.

Immediately after being vaccinated, I grew dizzy and felt my vision fading. I asked for some water and waited. Three minutes after vaccination, I lost consciousness and forcefully fell on the floor, scraping my head and biting the front of my tongue. I was immediately wheelchaired over to a nearby bench and tended to by a nurse and two doctors. I was sweating profusely, had a low heart rate and chills, and felt tired. After forty-five minutes, a bottle of water and a can of orange juice, I had recovered and was dismissed. I already had a ride waiting to take me home.

                                                Pt has received second dose of the Moderna series. He had completed his fifteen  minutes of observation and after standing to leave, he collapsed onto the floor hitting his head at 1152. Myself,RN rushed over and began to evaluate condition.  Pt was oriented x4 and stated he had become light headed after standing. Stated that his head hurt from hitting it on the floor. Began monitoring vital signs. Initial VS showed BP of 138/82, Pulse of 83, and respirations at 14. Applied oxygen per nasal cannula until we could monitor oxygen level which was found to be 96%. After continuing to  talk with pt, he again passed out while still laying down. We were able to awaken him and he was still oriented x4. . Second VS  at 1159 showed BP of 130/82, P 82, and 02 of 96.  Pt reported his history of seizures. Continued to monitor. Third set of VS at 1204 were BP 124/78, P 78, R 12, 02 96. Police arrived at 1205 and ambulance arrived at 1209. Pt refused to be taken in  by ambulance and continued to converse. We sat pt up to sitting position. At 1207, BP was 124/80, P 79, and 02 96. He was then moved up to sit in chair but after sitting there at approximately 1215, pt again passed out but was supported by the EMT.  After regaining consciousness, he then agreed to be transported to hospital via ambulance.

A minute or two later at most, we heard his mom yelling for us and I could see him kind of slumped over while she kept him sitting up. I ran out with an EpiPen and saw him on the bench, slumped forward but coming to - he was able to speak with us and answer questions (his name, DOB, today&#39;s date, where he was). He was dizzy and his face was pale and sweaty, but he said otherwise he was okay. We provided him water and Gatorade, which he drank and said it helped. We had them stay for 30 minutes from that point to monitor for improvement, and there were no further issues. We checked in with them before they left, and the patient said he was fine and back to normal.

                                                At approximately 12:45pm on 4/27/2021, patient received his first dose of Covid19 (Moderna) vaccine, given by Pharmacist on duty. During the 15 minute observation period following the vaccine, the patient&#39;s father asked the pharmacist to check his blood pressure.  While the pharmacist was checking his blood pressure (approximately 2-3 minutes following the vaccination), she notices the patient was starting to look pale and shut and squint his eyes as if he was having trouble focusing his vision.  The pharmacist questioned the patient to make sure he felt ok, and the patient said his vision was going black and he was  getting dizzy and lightheaded.  The pharmacist moved nearby objects out of the way to prepare to lay the patient on the ground. When returning to the patient, he was staring blankly, hunched over, unresponsive, no pulse felt on a 5 second check, and had rheum dripping from nose and eyes. At 12:50pm the pharmacist instructed technician to call 911. Patient was lowered to the floor in the supine position where he remained unresponsive and no pulse could be felt on a 10 second check, but chest rise could not be evaluated as patient started to have convulsions.  Convulsions ceased after approximately 15 seconds and patient started groaning and moving his head and said he could hear but he couldn&#39;t open his eyes yet. Patient remained supine and the Pharmacist continued to carry on conversation with patient until EMS arrived at 12:57pm to evaluate patient. EMS attributed  the instance to syncope related to the vaccine.  The patient denied ambulatory care to the hospital for any further evaluation. Patient denied history of fainting expect for ?one unprovoked episode at his grandmother&#39;s house when he thinks his blood sugar got too low.?

                                                I woke up with pressure on my chest and pain on my left arm around the elbow. After a couple of minutes, I began to have a lot of cold sweat, and both the pressure in my chest and pain in my arm began to increase. Then I began feeling a tingling sensation on my neck/chin. After that, I felt lightheaded and decided to go to the hospital. At my arrival to the ER, I was given aspirin and heparin. I got a couple of EKGs and a chest X-Ray, as well as some blood work. I was then transferred to the medical center, where I had some more blood tests and EKGs done. I was also treated with Indocin, Lipitor and Aspirin. At around 9PM, I began feeling the pressure on my chest again, although with decreased intensity. I was given morphine and the pain went away. This event repeated at around 10AM next morning with the same outcome. After that I got an Echocardiogram, and began to be treated with Metoprolol. No other pain events happened for the rest of my stay at the hospital. On the next morning, April 26th, I was taken to an angiogram to rule out Coronary Dissection. After the test, I was discharged with a prescription for Metoprolol.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination the patient began to feel light headed. He stood up and fell back to the floor, landing in a sitting position and not striking his head. He was helped into a chair by a bystander and I was alerted to the situation. He appeared pale and diaphoretic, then he became unresponsive with his eyes up and his arms tensing up. After about 10 seconds he became responsive again. EMS had been called earlier and arrived a few minutes after this and he was evaluated and left with EMS. It was unclear if he had simply passed out or if he had a seizure. He had no previous history of seizure, though the presentation seemed somewhat atypical for just passing out.

Patient presented with petechial rashes all throughout his body  started on Friday 4/9 after getting a tattoo the day prior and his first moderna covid vaccine 3/28.  On admission patient was found to have a platelet count of 1. Heme/ onc was consulted and thrombocytopenia was deemed secondary to ITP.  Hepatitis B panel, showed previous hepatitis B infection, although results may be inaccurate due to patient receiving IVIG prior to hepatitis panel being done.  Patient also had an equivocal syphilis result, which also could be a false positive due to immune response.  Patient received 2 IVIG, 4 days of Decadron, and 1 dose of Nplate.  Patient did not receive rituximab, due to stable increasing platelet count.  Patient received hepatitis-B prophylaxis for 2 days in case he were to receive rituximab.  Platelet count now stable at 25, to follow-up with hematology in 1 week outpatient for repeat CBC.  Patient also to follow-up with his Primary Care Physician in 1 week.

Patient was unresponsive for about 4-5 seconds with convulsion-like movements, while he was on the floor. He then regained consciousness, he independently stood up and assisted to sit in the chair. Patient was pale in color, cool and clammy to the touch at this time (while alert and oriented). Two doctors were at the patient&#39;s side to assess him. Vitals were taken. Patient was alert and oriented (answering all questions from the MD). Patient continued to be monitored and he was given water to rehydrate for an hour after the incident. He was sent home with his wife. Prior to leaving, the patient was alert and oriented. He stated he felt better.

About 15 minutes go by and pharmacist drives patient home, and patient picks up car later. On drive home everything nothing observed abnormal.

                                                Pericarditis. Initial symptoms were noticeable upon waking up the morning after receiving the vaccine, ~ 20 hours after vaccination. Initial symptoms: extremely elevated heart rate (~160 bpm). Heart rate fell to more reasonable, but still high, ~120 bpm after 2-3 hours. Roughly 36 hours after vaccination, began noticing soreness in the chest. Upon waking the following day (~48 hours after vaccination), chest soreness had progressed to pain (rating: 4/10), which remained roughly 6 hours to roughly 1400 that day, when the pain subsided along with all symptoms. Later, at roughly 2000 the same day (~58 hours after vaccination), there was a sudden and extreme flair up of chest pain (rating: 8/10) which radiated down the inside of both arms, this lasted 1.5 hours and then subsided just as suddenly as it came on. I went to sleep, then was woken up by another extreme episode of pain (rating: 7/10) at 0230 the morning of 15 May, again extreme chest pain radiating down both arms.

                                                Mild Chest pain began to occur roughly a week after vaccination. Two weeks after vaccination it had processed to severe bouts of pain accompanied with dizziness and fatigue. After about a week of severe pain, the pain began to taper off and seemed to move from my chest more into my armpit and arm. A swollen and painful lymph node occurred in my left armpit roughly 2 weeks after severe pain had started. The lymph node is currently still swollen but it&#39;s getting mildly better. Chest pain is not entirely gone but it&#39;s also getting better slowly.
