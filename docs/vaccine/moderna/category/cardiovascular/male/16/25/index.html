                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                Myocarditis; Acute onset of chest pain; Soreness of the arm; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 20-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced soreness of the arm, acute onset of chest pain, and myocarditis.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included asthma, and allergy to egg, peanut and tree nuts. Concomitant medications reported included dupilumab, montelukast, budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine, albuterol and epinephrine.  On 29 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, the patient reported soreness of the arm for 3 to 4 days.  On 30 Jan 2021, the patient presented to the hospital with acute onset of left sided chest pain. The physician reported that the patient developed myocarditis. Consent for Safety to follow up was received.  Treatment for the events, as reported, included patient&#39;s concomitant medications of dupilumab, montelukast, budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine and albuterol. No additional treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event, soreness of the arm, was resolved on unknown date. The event acute onset of chest pain and myocarditis was not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 20 year old male with medical history of multiple allergies, who was hospitalized with serious unexpected events of chest pain and myocarditis and a non-serious unexpected event of pain in extremity.  The chest pain and myocarditis occurred 33 days after first dose and 4 days after last dose of mRNA-1273.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Vaccine was Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 4 days after receiving the vaccine, two hours after I woke up, I began to have mild chest pain in the center of my chest. After that, the pain started to grow and grow until it was extreme pain, at around an 8/10. The pain radiated from my chest to the undersides of my arms. After two hours of pain, it started to subside and eventually was gone. There was no pain for the rest of the day. The next day, two hours after I woke up again, the mild chest pain returned. Still in the center of my chest, the pain grew into extreme pain again. This time however, it was slightly to the right and as the pain progressed it moved right until after two hours it went away again.  The treatment I got at the Urgent Care was an EKG and they told me to go to a hospital. At the hospital, I got Toradol, aspirin and propanolol.  My initial Troponin levels at admission to the hospital were 900 and grew to 1300. It lowered for a time, but at the last check, it rose again to 1420 after not getting Toradol for at least 12 hours.

A ER note was  generated in a T-Con on a patient who got their 2nd Covid Vaccine and began experiencing chest pain approx. 12 hours post vaccine. Patient did not report to the ER until 28Feb21. It was discussed that he has myocarditis v pericarditis, elevated D-Dimer of 770, swollen lymph nodes, and elevated Troponin. Patient was transferred to Research Medical Center due to no available beds. Patient was referred to a Case Manager and Cardiology. The patient completed a follow up appointment with 509 MDG on 9Mar21 and reported Dull pain that has been affecting sleep. Cardiology reports shows Troponin was elevated to 9.1 decreased to 4.2 and back up again to 13.4. Cardiac revealed late gadolinium enhancement, possibly representing myocarditis and then at discharge possibly myocarditis.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

Patient self-administered 100mg IM hydrocortisone.  Blood pressure monitored via home monitor quickly decreased and heartrate increased. At 2000 on 3/2 EMS was engaged and brought patient to Hospital Emergency Department. At emergency room patient was diagnosed with acute adrenal crisis and given multiple doses of hydrocortisone 50mg and promethazine 12.5mg. At least three 1000ml NS boluses were provided in ED. Blood pressure continued to drop; lowest noted was low 80s/30s. Admitted to cardiology unit for continued observation and steroid/antiemetic support.  Patient remained admitted 3/3 and was discharged 3/4 following adequate fluid resuscitation and transition to PO steroids.

                                                On Thursday, March 11th, 2021 approximately 3:10 pm, Patient received his first dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot number: 003A21A) in his left deltoid  Patient received the Moderna Vaccine. After which he sat in the designated medical observation area for 15 minutes. Approximately five minutes later around 3:15 pm, Patient experienced syncope, fell out of his chair, hit the left side of his forehead on the ground. Due to the fall, he experienced a mild abrasion on the left side of his forehead, which led to bleeding.  The Physician?s Assistant rushed to aid Patient who was lying on the ground in a supine position. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) - Fire Department and ambulance were called immediately and approximately five minutes later EMS arrived. During the time frame prior to EMS arrival, the Physician?s Assistant asked numerous questions to Patient to assess his condition. She asked Patient if he could breathe and he responded ?yes?. She asked Patient  if he was short of breath and he responded ?no?. She asked Patient if he felt like his throat was closing and he responded ?no?. At this point, an Epinephrine pen was not used.  Patient was alert and the Orient x 4 questions were asked [(1) Who are you? (2) Where are you? (3) What is the date and time? (4) What just happened to you?]. Patient also denied head pain, neck pain, nausea or chest pain. Staff performed a limited neuro-exam and was deemed within normal limits. Patients Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 Patient  mentioned that he has a phobia of needles and something like this has happened before when he was ?young?. Patient initially did not want an ambulance to be called. It was explained to him that it might be in his best interest to call EMS due to syncope and abrasion on his forehead due to the fall. Patient also mentioned that he only consumed two cookies and coffee for that day.  When the EMS arrived (about 5 firefighters), they interviewed him and performed a blood pressure test. His sitting blood pressure was 130/82. One of the firefighters assessed his spine and Patient denied cervical, thoracic, and lumbar tenderness or pain. The firefighter assessed Patient&#39;s glucose level, which was a bit difficult to obtain in the first initial efforts, with the glucometer reading ?error?. The firefighters eventually were able to obtain a reading on Patient&#39;s glucose and it read 86. Patient was able to stand on his own, and a second blood pressure test was performed; his standing blood pressure reading was 145/89.  EMS gave Patient gauze to address his head wound Patient initially refused to go to the hospital, but per EMS protocol, fluids needed to be administered. Patient entered the ambulance and was taken to the hospital by EMS.

The next morning I experienced a less severe headache but experienced noticeable shortness of breath especially on exertion. Tylenol P.O. helped my headache that morning, no known fever.  Approx 2 days after injection I also experienced a noticeable reduction in the ability to smell or taste. This Stayed for at least another day or so.

The patient came back into the store about on hour later to pick up some things for his pharmacy and reported feeling a little chest pain. The patient was then informed to keep monitoring the pain and if it got any worse to go to the doctors office. About 2 hours later, the patient called when on the way to the emergency room and reported chest pain and a fever of 102 degrees (at the highest). Around 3pm, which was about 6 hours after the vaccination was administered, the patient reported chest pain was alleviated and that the emergency room treated him for a migraine/nausea with Tylenol #3, Fioricet and Zofran.

Additionally, I woke up the morning after to pain in my toe, which spread to my foot and groin lymph nodes. I eventually went to the ER and was told my toe was infected. I had previously had a small cut on my toe and the doctor believes that the inflammatory response my body initiated from the vaccine exacerbated this infection.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

Has slowly gone away since, but there is still some of it left.  About 8 hours after dose, had severe chills, likely fever (did not measure), and lots of shivering. Skin felt very sensitive all over body. Arm was already sore at this point. Fatigue, drowsiness. Felt like a flu.  The next day, large red splotch on left arm at injection site, with red line extending into the armpit area. Swollen lymph nodes in neck. Previous symptoms resolved, except for chest rash.  Two days later, large red splotch on left arm at injection site is now very itchy and warm, firm, and slightly raised.

                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.
