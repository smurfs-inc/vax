Patient was with his parents and he told them he felt like he was going to faint, so his parents stabilized him before it happened.  Patient seized for about 10 seconds and then came to alertness.  He was made comfortable and given juice and a granola bar after a while because patient had not yet eaten this morning.  I monitored patient for about 45 minutes before I felt patient was stable and feeling well enough to leave.  Patient left with his parents monitoring him.

                                                At approximately 2 PM on Wednesday the 10th, I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and feverish. Color drained from my face and I also began to lose track of the conversation I was having. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace of the conversation and eventually realized I couldn&#39;t remember what we were talking about. Looking back on the event now, I could only remember what was happening for around. 2 minute span before I forgot it. After losing my ability to form new memories, I began to lose old ones. I would look through pictures and not recognize faces, listen to songs and not remember the artists, and lose entire gaps of my past. My parents described my memory loss as that of a concussion but, to be frank, I don&#39;t remember much of any of it. All of my past memories have returned, but I still have yet to regain my memory from 2 PM to 10 PM of that day.

                                                Patient received vaccine in left arm and during waiting/observation period a few minutes later (while sitting), he told the person near him he felt dizzy, and he fainted. He soon regained consciousness (within about a minute) and was observed/attended to. 911 was called immediately as a precaution, and paramedics monitored his vital signs slowly helped him into a chair. He drank some water and a little electrolyte drink. He did not want to seek hospital treatment, and paramedics left.  He stated he was experiencing nausea while sitting in the chair, and said he started to feel like he was going to faint again.  Again 911 was called and paramedics attended to him, but he did not faint again. After resting in a chair and drinking some more water and some electrolyte drink, as well as cold compresses on his forehead and the back of the neck, he was eventually escorted by two store employees on a motorized scooter cart to his parent&#39;s car and went with his parent home (he did not want to seek hospital treatment).

About five to ten minutes to, we were alerted that the patient had fainted. Upon coming to the patient, he was starting to come to but was out of it. I tried asking the patient how he was feeling, is he having a hard time breathing? Patient&#39;s entire arms and legs were bright red with possible rashes that lasted about 5 minutes and went away quick. Patient&#39;s face remained their normal shade. Patient reported he fell asleep and patient&#39;s father reported waking the patient up prior to coming to get his vaccine. Patient sat at the pharmacy to be monitored for an addition 30 minutes before leaving with father. Patient was given water and fan to help cool him down. Patient reported feeling ok after about 10 minutes with legs elevated but was instructed to sit for longer than that time. Patient was ok to leave with father after 30&#43; minutes of monitoring.

He landed on his buttocks and did not appear to hit his head.  He immediately appeared conscious but disoriented.  He had a steady pulse and no itching or rash or trouble breathing, but he seemed pale.  EMT was called and upon evaluation determined that he did not need further treatment.  The patient went home with his mother.

                                                This patient had some dizziness after the shot and was apprehensive in receiving it. He claimed he felt dizzy and in seconds had slumped off of his chair. He was unresponsive for a few seconds only about 5-10 seconds and we gave him an IM Benadryl as a precaution. He awoke complaining of a funny feeling in the mouth and tongue but had no rash or redness or swelling to indicate an allergic reaction. We decide to monitor closely for an escalation of symptoms but to have a EpiPen handy, and call an EMT unit. His blood pressure was low at first at around 107/68  then quickly come up in about 10 minutes to 130/80. With no other issues we believe he had a vasovagal syncope but wanted the ER to make sure we were correct. I called and checked on him after he was at the ER. and the nurse stated that he was doing very well and that they had seen this happen with the vaccine at other site locations.

                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.     History obtained from:  ? patient                    ? outpatient clinicians  ? family                                  ? staff at facility  ? other                                   ? review of medical record as summarized below   Pt unable to provide reliable history because: ?

                                                Patient stated prior to administartion of vaccine that he has had a history of passing out following vaccinations, mostly when he does not eat or drink beforehand. He stated he made sure to have something to eat and drink beforehand and was aware that it may happen following this vaccine as well. Prior to administering vaccine, I verified details with patient on previous episodes and discussed risks with patient, who understood and wished to proceed anyways and was okay staying additional time beyond 15 mins post vaccination to ensure no serious reaction. Immediately post-vaccination, I asked the patient how they were feeling prior to sending him to the designated waiting area. He stated repeatedly that he was fine and okay to walk to the chairs on his own. Moments after sitting down, a technician alerted me that he had collapsed off the chair and fell on the ground before anyone could get there to catch him. I immediately called 911 and attended to the patient who had already regained consciousness while I was on the phone with emergency services. He informed technician that when he sat down he felt a little queasy and the next thing he knew, he was on the floor. Fortunately there happened to be an EMT in the store that came over to help while waiting for additional paramedics. We provided the patient with an ice pack and a bottle of water, but instructed him not to drink anything until paramedics arrived. We checked the patients blood pressure and found the reading to be low and patient was tachycardic, expected following a syncopal episode. Myself and the EMT got patient to lie down on the floor and elevated his head. We noticed that the patient had suffered a small laceration to his head resulting from falling off the chair onto the ground. Store management also got involved to assess the situation and take statements. Upon arrival of paramedics, care was transferred over to them. At first, patient refused to be transported to the hospital but asked that we contact his mother. After reaching his mother, she arrived shortly after to the store, and after further rest and evaluation, patient was transported to a local hospital for a further workup .Patient was only unconscious for 20 seconds or less, and the event occurred within 5 mins of vaccine administration.  Upon regaining consciousness, patient was alert and oriented, and again stated that he&#39;s fine and it wasn&#39;t the first time it has happened.

Just a few seconds later he woke up and said something along the lines of, &#34;Oh did I pass out?&#34; I caught him in my arms before he could fall to the floor. The same response where he started aggressively shaking and eyes closed happened a few seconds later. His legs straightened out and his head was headed backward. Again I caught him and stabilized him. Afterward, my 2nd pharmacist stopped over and spoke with him. He seemed to be feeling better, but to ensure the same reaction wouldn&#39;t happen again, we had him wait 30 min instead of the standard 15. He sat in his chair and did not have any issues. We offered food but he was not interested. I spoke w/ him again this afternoon via phone and he said he was doing fine. Pt said he has had this type of rxn before w/ previous vaccines.

Encouraged him to stay hydrated and to utilize Tylenol if fever, pain, or aches. Patient was alert and oriented when he left the vaccination room. After sanitizing the room for the next member, preparing the next member&#39;s shot, came out of the room to announce the next member and found the original patient face down on the floor of the warehouse. Witnesses stated he had fell to his knees from a sitting position and then hit his head on the floor with no more then 2 minutes going by (most likely less then 1 minute). Had the patient lay on the ground with legs elevated while he came to. Offered patient water and ice pack. Patient was able to call his parents, which I stayed by his side, until they arrived.

I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

I immediately went out to help the patient and a technician called for EMS.  The patient woke up within 2 minutes and reported feeling dizzy, tired, and numb. While waiting for EMS to arrive, the patient was situated in a sitting position and I continued talking to him to keep him awake. EMS assessed him and took him out to the ambulance to wait for a relative to come.  It is unknown if the patient went to the emergency room or not.

They seem to be random with no obvious cause. Treatment was per the usual, folded tissue paper in nose and tilt head forward to allow the blood to clot.

                                                Patient complained of dizziness immediately after walking to checkout station. We sat him down and he said he was only seeing black and he was got and his neck hurt. We called EMS to check him out also. His BP was 140/90 and his vision started to come back after a couple of minutes as blurry. Once EMS arrived, he was much improved and vitals were all good. He refused to go to the ER, but his roommate assured us that he would watch him today. Patient waited 30 minutes and said he felt totally fine when he left.

                                                Myocarditis; Acute onset of chest pain; Soreness of the arm; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 20-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced soreness of the arm, acute onset of chest pain, and myocarditis.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included asthma, and allergy to egg, peanut and tree nuts. Concomitant medications reported included dupilumab, montelukast, budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine, albuterol and epinephrine.  On 29 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, the patient reported soreness of the arm for 3 to 4 days.  On 30 Jan 2021, the patient presented to the hospital with acute onset of left sided chest pain. The physician reported that the patient developed myocarditis. Consent for Safety to follow up was received.  Treatment for the events, as reported, included patient&#39;s concomitant medications of dupilumab, montelukast, budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine and albuterol. No additional treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event, soreness of the arm, was resolved on unknown date. The event acute onset of chest pain and myocarditis was not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 20 year old male with medical history of multiple allergies, who was hospitalized with serious unexpected events of chest pain and myocarditis and a non-serious unexpected event of pain in extremity.  The chest pain and myocarditis occurred 33 days after first dose and 4 days after last dose of mRNA-1273.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

A couple of minutes later, I heard the gate rattle and rushed over to lower him to the floor gently.  I called out to employee and customer to call 911.  Then he woke up probably within 30 seconds.  I had him continue to lie there and talked with him.   He set up once for a couple of minutes and said he still felt light-headed so i had him lay back down and continued to talk with him.  Then paramedics came in and took over.  They placed him on a stretcher and took him, while he was still conscious while leaving.

                                                Patient reports routinely having spells of syncope with injections and still insisted on receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Gave injection into left deltoid. Had patient scoot up to table in immunization room with both legs fully under the table just in case there was an issue. I set the timer for 15 minutes and left him in the immunization room with his girlfriend, who also received a vaccine. A few moments later the girlfriend asked for our help stating he was feeling like he was going to pass out. I went into the IMZ room and checked with him. At the time, he was sweaty with a rapid hearbeat. I instructed him to take some deep breaths and went to get a cold paper towel to apply to his head. When I returned he had passed out, not responsive but still breathing, in his chair and his girlfriend was holding his head in her hand. We gently lowered his head to rest on the table while another associate called 911 per girlfriend&#39;s request. He began moaning a few moments later and was able to talk to us. He was very hot and sweaty, light headed and breathing rapidly. We applied a cooling pack to his forhead as he continued to lie his head on the table. He then said he might feel more comfortable lying on the floor. We assisted him to the floor, elevated his feet on a chair and placed his head on a roll of paper towels. At that time the paramedics showed up and said his blood pressure was fine and he was just having some hyperventilation. The paramedics got him back up in the chair and his girlfriend got him some apply juice. After about 30 minutes he was talking fine, shaking had stopped and his breathing a temp went back to normal

He did have localized pain in his arm and the following day, had some headache and neck stiffness.  Yesterday evening around 5 o&#39; clock he developed left chest pain that has persisted.  It has waxed and waned, but not disappeared.  It reached an intensity of 7/10 prompting him to get a ride to the emergency room for evaluation.  He was found to have myocarditis, with troponin elevation to 37 ng/mL, and globally reduced ejection fraction 45%.  His care is ongoing.

                                                Admission HPI: Right-sided chest pain began 2 days prior to admission (3/19) after getting out of car, without identifiable trigger. Pain was sharp, pleuritic, and worst with movement; didn&#39;t feel it when still. Pain not responsive to ibuprofen or heating packs. Reported 30-60 seconds of self-resolving heart racing during ocular migraine which has been his baseline for years. Not associated with SOB (at rest or with exercise), palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. No viral URI symptoms, N/V, or rash. He did receive his 2nd Moderna COVID vaccine about 1 week PTA, followed by 36hrs of fevers, chills, and body aches. Given persistence of pain, Patient asked his parents to present to urgent care.   In UC, he was noted to tachycardic with CXR with bibasilar atelectasis and b/l effusions, per report. Given continued tachycardia, decision was made to transfer to ED to r/o PE.      In ED, tachycardic to 104-116 and tachypneic 22-26. Had one episode of tachycardia to 182 iso ocular migraine. Endorsed chest pain but points to R middle abdomen when asked where worst. Exam was unremarkable. He received 1 dose of morphine which reduced pain from 10/10 to 0/10. Labs notable for leukocytosis (14.61), thrombocytopenia (422), elevated d-dimer (1.56), and elevated CRP (5.6). Otherwise normal chem and coags. COVID/RVP negative. CXR unremarkable. CTPA showed scattered PEs in b/l lower lobes with small pulmonary infarct in RML. No evidence of right heart strain. Heme was consulted who recommended starting him on lovenox and sending lupus anti-coagulant. Cardiology was consulted who recommended EKG, BNP, and troponin, all of which were normal and reassuring against right heart strain. ECHO was therefore deferred to the AM. The decision was made to admit.   Upon arrival to the floor, Patient was tachycardic 114 and tachypneic to 22, otherwise stable vitals. He denied any pain since morphine. Denied any unexpected weight loss; reports that car ride was short. Mom reports that Patient has been less active d/t cold weather and baseball being on hold. Denies family or personal history of clots. Last seizure ~13 years ago.  Hospital Course: (3/21 - 3/22)  Patient was admitted to the hematology service. He was therapeutically anticoagulated with LMWH injections and his anti-Xa level prior to discharge was 0.92. (goal 0.5-1.0) Lower extremity ultrasound with Doppler showed patent veins and no evidence of DVT and upper extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT, though there was potential evidence of collateralization seen in mid and distal third of right subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein. Since this was an unprovoked PE, a full thrombophilia workup was sent and will be followed up by the outpatient hematology clinic. Cardiology consulted regarding possibility of right heart strain and the tachycardia during migraine episodes. Echocardiogram performed on 3/22 was technically limited but showed no gross abnormalities. The cardiology team requested a repeat echo scheduled outpatient for 1-2 months after discharge.

                                                I obtained my booster shot on my left deltoid at 2:30 PM 2/4/2021. I had slight soreness in my arm til 8:00 which the soreness disappeared. Around 2:00 AM, I was awakened by a pounding headache, fever of 102, and my upper left chest (unilateral between the midline of my left chest and the axillary region) started to hurt. I took Tylenol 1000 mg at 3 and took a hot bath (recommended by  friend who also displayed a fever and headache). After a while, my fever began to lower but my headache and chest pain did not disappear and I could not sleep until 7 AM. I woke up today (2/5/2021) at 10 AM with a fever of 101.4, another pounding headache, and still unilateral chest pain. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol around 10:30 AM and it only helped with the fever. I went back to sleep and slept until 4 PM. I understand that the fever and headache are normal symptoms but my chest pain does not seem like muscle soreness. It doesn&#39;t hurt when I touch it, it comes and goes every few seconds, I have 4 or 5/ 10 on the pain scale for most of the pain but it turns into 6 or 7/10 occasionally (10 being the worst pain). What does help with my pain when it is 6 or 7/10 is when I clench my chest really hard like I am flexing it. It is a sharp pain that stays for a few seconds before it disappears and it feels like a deep pain. I didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol again because I am about to max out (can only take 2 more capsules until 2:00 AM because it states not to take more than 6 capsules in 24 hours, and each capsule is 500 mg) (Also, the Tylenol does not help with the pain so I am only taking it for my fever.) I was wondering if anyone else reported this and if this is an adverse side effect.  This has not cause any issues regarding my breathing but just pain.

After that, the pain started to grow and grow until it was extreme pain, at around an 8/10. The pain radiated from my chest to the undersides of my arms. After two hours of pain, it started to subside and eventually was gone. There was no pain for the rest of the day. The next day, two hours after I woke up again, the mild chest pain returned. Still in the center of my chest, the pain grew into extreme pain again. This time however, it was slightly to the right and as the pain progressed it moved right until after two hours it went away again.  The treatment I got at the Urgent Care was an EKG and they told me to go to a hospital. At the hospital, I got Toradol, aspirin and propanolol.  My initial Troponin levels at admission to the hospital were 900 and grew to 1300. It lowered for a time, but at the last check, it rose again to 1420 after not getting Toradol for at least 12 hours.

                                                I almost fainted the night after my shot. I had vaped cannabis prior at around 1:00am, and probably re-dosed at around 3:00AM, before falling asleep at around 4:30AM. I had a harder than normal time falling asleep that night, and I didn&#39;t sleep very well. At around 6:00AM I woke up and walked to the bathroom, feeling pain in my anal region. As I started to sweat profusely, I recognized that I was likely about to faint, so I pre-emptively lied down on the floor of the bathroom until I felt well enough to stand up. I don&#39;t remember exactly how long I was on the floor but most likely a few minutes. I then had a bowel movement, still feeling pain in my anal region but to a lesser degree, and then drank some water and went back to sleep at around 6:30AM.

A ER note was  generated in a T-Con on a patient who got their 2nd Covid Vaccine and began experiencing chest pain approx. 12 hours post vaccine. Patient did not report to the ER until 28Feb21. It was discussed that he has myocarditis v pericarditis, elevated D-Dimer of 770, swollen lymph nodes, and elevated Troponin. Patient was transferred to Research Medical Center due to no available beds. Patient was referred to a Case Manager and Cardiology. The patient completed a follow up appointment with 509 MDG on 9Mar21 and reported Dull pain that has been affecting sleep. Cardiology reports shows Troponin was elevated to 9.1 decreased to 4.2 and back up again to 13.4. Cardiac revealed late gadolinium enhancement, possibly representing myocarditis and then at discharge possibly myocarditis.

Patient was not responsive and completely limp. Together we lowered him to the floor where he quickly began to regain consciousness and tried to sit up. Patient was fairly alert within 1-2 minutes. Patient was given water, ice packs for the back of his neck and forehead, and ED was called. Patient stated he was feeling much better and did not need EMS, but due to store policy they were called. Patient relayed a history of fainting after receiving tattoos, that was not notated on his form. Patient remained on floor until EMS arrived about 20 minutes later and checked on patient. Patient&#39;s heart rate and BP were taken by EMS laying down, sitting, and standing and was cleared by EMS to leave.

                                                My left arm was sore starting a few minutes after the vaccine. This soreness last through that night. When I woke up the next day, my arm was extremely sore and I was very dizzy. Additionally, my pulse felt fast but my heartbeat seemed to have less strength. My breathing felt more shallow like I wasn&#39;t getting as much oxygen from the air that I breathed in as I should. For the first two weeks, the dizziness was very strong. Now, at the three-week mark, it is more manageable and life is somewhat returning to normal. I visited an ENT doctor and their diagnosis was that my dizziness was not being caused by a preexisting medical condition.  Their prediction was that I would be fine, though looking back, I downplayed the severity of my vertigo. At its worst, I felt that, when I went for a walk outside, the surface was the Earth was violently spinning through space, with me stuck to the surface. It felt paralyzing. My body felt almost stuck in shock. I was afraid I would be stuck with this dizziness for the rest of my life since it was so long-lasting. Now, I am taking ginger pills and am watching my sodium intake. I feel better but am extra vigilant about taking ginger and not stressing myself too much. I do not plan on getting a second shot since some of my symptoms mirror those of anaphylaxis.

                                                He had Moderna vaccine #2 on 5/13/2021. The day after the vaccination he had fevers and chills.  Two days after his vaccination (5/15/2021) he developed mild midsternal chest pain. This worsened and on 5/16/2021 he felt like someone was sitting on his chest. This pain was worse with deep breaths and radiated to his shoulders. He sought care at an urgent care clinic where EKG unexpectedly showed diffuse ST elevations. He was referred to the ED where he had an elevated troponin and there was concern for myocarditis.    TTE done showed a normal ejection fraction and normal heart valves.    He denies recent illnesses. He denies recent sore throats or skin infections. He works in the hospitality industry but denies known recent COVID-19 infection.    Since admission he was seen by cardiology and was started on colchicine, indomethacin, and protonix. Telemetry has been reassuring. He reports feeling much better.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

                                                Pt received the first of the two-series COVID vaccination at 1512. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, he was noted to have severe diaphoresis, prominent pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. His head initially fell back and head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. This provider was speaking to the pt and performed a sternal rub to elicit a response, pt remained unresponsive and with eyes closed. Pt remained in this state for approximately 10 seconds. Pt noted to suddenly have some muscular rigidity to arms and torso and in order to prevent injury upon possible onset of seizure activity, pt was lowered to the floor by this provider and RN . Once on the ground the pt was relaxed and opened his eyes. Pt was immediately verbally responsive and asked if he passed out. Pt was able to sit up and was assisted into the wheelchair. Pt moved to treatment area where vitals and blood glucose were obtained. (@1525 BG- 104 mg/dL, VS BP 116/72, HR bradycardic @51 bpm, O2 sat 95%).  Patient responses/speech was clear and pt was oriented to self, place, time and situation. Pt stated that he felt nauseated upon sitting in the observation area and admitted that he only had a coffee today, nothing to eat all day and attributed this as the cause of his reaction. Pt verbalized that he would not respond to the hospital with the paramedics and was encouraged to at least call someone to take him to the hospital.  This provider spoke with the patient?s mother and explained the events. The patient?s mother stated that the patient had febrile seizures when approximately 4 years old, associated with asthma exacerbations; but pt was evaluated with a neurologist and there were no abnormal findings. Pt admitted that he has a similar syncopal episode after washing a laceration and seeing his finger bleeding. Pt states this was a few years ago and witnessed by his father that told the patient he initially fainted and then became momentarily rigid before responding appropriately (similar to today?s events).   Ambulance - arrival @1536 report given and pt stated he was feeling better and declined further evaluation in truck and also declined transport to ED ( departed at 1545). Pt?s overall condition, appearance, including color was much improved. Pt denied any allergies or medication history. Past medical hx of febrile seizures at approximately age three and four, childhood asthma and one syncopal episode as an adult. Pt girlfriend  arrival and she agreed to drive patient from the vaccine clinic.  Pt and girlfriend were both provided with an explanation of the many concerning causes of syncope and the necessity for further evaluation in the Emergency department to rule out any underlying conditions. Both patient and girlfriend verbalized understanding and although they still declined to respond to ED directly from the clinic, both did agree to respond to ED if any changes in mental status occurred.  Pt lives alone, but agreed to stay with parents and family in order to have others watch him for any changes.  Pt was advised to followup with PCP and made aware that an  provider would contact him tomorrow to check on his status, understanding verbalized and agreed with plan of care.

                                                Around 11:30pm I started to get chills and my teeth started to chatter. At the same time my body was shaking slightly. I was laying on the couch during the start of it for the above events, this lasted for about 20&#43; minutes. Then I tried to get up to go to bed. I was shaking very badly at this point, teeth chattering a lot and I was very cold. I tried to use the bathroom and I couldn&#39;t even stand still to use the bathroom. My chest was also tightening and it was hard to breathe.   I went to bed to lay down and I was practically hyperventilating for about 15 minutes at a time and I would stop for a minute then it would start up again. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn&#39;t because I couldn&#39;t breathe and my chest was closing in, it felt like.   I called my parents in and they sat with me and gave me ibuprofen and benedryl. I started to feel better after about an hour. During that time, though, my body was extremely hot (but no fever) but I was still cold and had the chills. My head also was hurting like a headache and my eyes were really hot too. It was hard to get air and if I sat up I would get dizzy.

                                                Syncope. Pt fell backwards as he was leaving immunization room for waiting/observation area after receiving first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Episode lasted roughly 15 seconds at which point patient regained alertness. It was determined no epinephrine etc was needed. Pt was observed following episode until he was clearly okay to leave on his own accord, and no further medical attention would be necessary.

He states this morning he awoke and had significant nausea and abdominal pain and then had approximately 10 episodes of non bloody emesis that eventually became bilious. He did have some diaphoresis. He states that he eventually did have some chest pain that he attributed to all of the vomiting. He went to urgent care and did receive Zofran but this did not alleviate his symptoms. He denies shortness of breath, cough, fever, chills, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, genitourinary symptoms, or other pain. He states that he has been having a few episodes of loose stools, but did not have any bowel movements today. In urgent care CT was performed and was suspicious for pneumomediastinum within the partially imaged lower chest and a CT esophagram was recommended. Patient presented here for CT esophagram. He is admitted for further treatment, and required a three day admission with IVF, and IV narcotics and antiemetics to control his nausea and Abd symptoms. He denied dyspnea. On 4/11 the patient was tolerating a diet and stable to dc home.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Pharmacist on duty administered vaccine to patient. Patient walked from the vaccine administration location to the waiting area and sat down. Pharmacist heard a loud thud, and customer yelled &#34;call 911&#34; 911 was called, and patient was given a pillow under his head, and a blanket covering his body. He was unconscious for about 5 seconds, then came to. He was able to answer questions correctly like his name, and what year it is. Management came to help and take care of patient also. EMT arrived and took patient&#39;s BP and blood glucose levels. EMT recommended a snack because patient had not eaten yet today. Patient was given cheetos and water. EMT stayed to monitor patient until his vitals returned to normal. Patient told EMT that he has fainted about 8 times previously after giving blood, but never after receiving a vaccine. Came to pick him up so he did not have to drive home. Patient stated he had chipped his tooth  when he fell from the chair.

                                                I kept a log of the events that occurred. Notes: 25mg amitriptyline taken nightly for the last month, 200mg motrin I?ve never taken pain killers before this, time is in military.   Mar 18  1430 (1 hour 30 mins after my shot) i have a compressing headache toward the back of my head so i take 1 motrin.  1700 i head home, take 1 amitriptyline and head straight to sleep. ( i have no apatite so no dinner ) Mar 19 0100 The pain starts, it?s unbearable. I am sweating heavily and im also shivering cold. i have a high fever I have body aches which turns my shivering into shaking which keeps my wife up all night. In my dreams i feel pain. I talked to my deceased mother, i hold my deceased cat and i relive some of my most regrettable moments.  0700 I wake up, the bed is soaking wet. I take a motrin and get dressed. it takes me an hour longer to get ready for work because, the pain has sapped my energy. My supervisor sends me home seeing how horrible I look. 0900 I take an amitriptyline and lay down. I ask me wife to close to the storm shutters to darken the room. They are normally pretty quiet to close but, this time they are deafeningly loud. I struggled to get 1 hour of sleep.  1500 I wake up due to shaking so bad that i hit my head on the wall. I then take 2 motrin and about 30 mins later i notice theres a tightness in my chest. i take 1 tums. I know that my body is exhausted from the pain and my mind is clouded but i really wanted to do all of the tasks that i was planning on doing this weekend. All of the tasks end up failing. 2100 i try the tasks again and end up failing again.   20 Mar 0100. I eat a pear and 2 cheetos. i do not take a amitriptyline and i lay down. i have no pain or fever. (Dream start) The dream i had is of me watching myself get thrown around by a ghost. The ghost possesses my body for a short time. I grab some kittens (cats are a comfort to me so im guessing that my subconscious trying to reel me back in) I then wake my sleeping wife and tell her theres a ghost and we need to leave. We walk outside and im in an old neighborhood that i grew up in, everything darkens and im in pitch black feeling my way around a room. I open my eyes and im in a hotel. The front desk staff will not let me take the kittens up to my room so i leave them. When i walk into the room, it?s full of kittens (dream end) and i wake up  21 Mar 0900 I wake up and I have a sore throat and tightness in my chest. The soreness prevents me from going back to sleep and the tightness in my chest causing some anxiety. Once I calm myself down and convince myself that im not having a heart attack I take 2 motrin and some tums and the pain goes away from the day. These could be some withdrawals from not taking amitriptyline since 19 mar in the morning. This is still happening as I write this report. (23 March 2021)

                                                Earlier today, a Moderna patient at 3213 experienced a 15-30 second seizure after receiving his 1st Moderna vaccine. Shortly after sitting down for his 15-minute post immunization observation period, patient X began seizing resulting in him falling to the ground from a seated position to his left side and seizing for about 15-20 seconds. Patient was positioned in a left lateral recumbent position. Code white was called and EMT arrived on site within 10 minutes.   Patient&#39;s immunization questionnaire did NOT have any contraindications that would warrant he should not receive the vaccine. Patient reported no allergies to medications/past immunizations/foods and reported no seizure and/or neurological condition.   Once recovered and at baseline, patient reported having a light breakfast this morning and also having a needle phobia that may have played a role in his adverse response.   Shortly after recovering, patient was coherent and aware of person, place, and time. He remained weak and fatigue and BP readings from EMT indicated hypotension. EKG was normal.   Patient&#39;s mother happened to be waiting outside in the car. One of my associates was able to call her in and we updated here on the event.   EMT recommended, and patient agreed, to be taken to the hospital for further examination.

After lying down I heard a static/white noise sound in my ears that progressively got louder. It hit a peak volume then slowly started to get quieter until it went away. Muscle soreness in injected arm.

                                                During the first night after receiving vaccine I started to have SEVERE shaking / full body muscle spasms-hypertonicity that  lasted 60-90 minutes. Required 30 minutes hot shower to calm down shaking symptoms. Initially thought episodes were caused/triggered by cold temperature (still possibility) but now thinking its triggered by anxiety. Heart rate almost spikes to 120-130 BPM. No fever and normal blood pressure is noted when episodes happen.  Occurrences is not routine and seem to be random.  Very concerning considering symptoms lasted for 2 &#43; weeks now. I do not have health care or ability to see PCP/GP without paying out of pocket.   Now please understanding the severity of these episodes, to the point where it resembles severe Parkinson&#39;s symptoms.   Along with those I still have the normal side effects, fatigue  (extreme)  , mood changes, joint aches, intolerance to cold off and on,  and elevated HR.

                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.

That same night I ran a fever and woke up the next morning feeling ok. I was taking a shower and it was reported to me by my fiancé I had passed out, started to seize, my eyes rolled to the back of my head. A few minutes later I woke up on the floor and asked what had happened. I was not sure what had happened.  I felt fine when I woke up. When first responders arrived they asked me if I knew who I was, the date, the president, where I lived to all I was able to answer correctly. I went to the ER and they did a ECG, blood test, urine test, chest x-ray, CT of my head and they said everything came back normal. I was prescribed Keppra and have an MRI scheduled in the coming week.

I couldn&#39;t stand up and was scared to walk, so I was put on a stretcher. My throat started to close up. I was put in an ambulance and my throat swelled more on the trip to the ER. They gave me Benadryl and Prednisone. I was there for about 4 or 5 hours. I was okay after that. I checked the CDC site and it said I couldn&#39;t take the 2nd dose.
