Patient was with his parents and he told them he felt like he was going to faint, so his parents stabilized him before it happened.  Patient seized for about 10 seconds and then came to alertness.  He was made comfortable and given juice and a granola bar after a while because patient had not yet eaten this morning.  I monitored patient for about 45 minutes before I felt patient was stable and feeling well enough to leave.  Patient left with his parents monitoring him.

                                                At approximately 2 PM on Wednesday the 10th, I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and feverish. Color drained from my face and I also began to lose track of the conversation I was having. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace of the conversation and eventually realized I couldn&#39;t remember what we were talking about. Looking back on the event now, I could only remember what was happening for around. 2 minute span before I forgot it. After losing my ability to form new memories, I began to lose old ones. I would look through pictures and not recognize faces, listen to songs and not remember the artists, and lose entire gaps of my past. My parents described my memory loss as that of a concussion but, to be frank, I don&#39;t remember much of any of it. All of my past memories have returned, but I still have yet to regain my memory from 2 PM to 10 PM of that day.

                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

I immediately went out to help the patient and a technician called for EMS.  The patient woke up within 2 minutes and reported feeling dizzy, tired, and numb. While waiting for EMS to arrive, the patient was situated in a sitting position and I continued talking to him to keep him awake. EMS assessed him and took him out to the ambulance to wait for a relative to come.  It is unknown if the patient went to the emergency room or not.

                                                I obtained my booster shot on my left deltoid at 2:30 PM 2/4/2021. I had slight soreness in my arm til 8:00 which the soreness disappeared. Around 2:00 AM, I was awakened by a pounding headache, fever of 102, and my upper left chest (unilateral between the midline of my left chest and the axillary region) started to hurt. I took Tylenol 1000 mg at 3 and took a hot bath (recommended by  friend who also displayed a fever and headache). After a while, my fever began to lower but my headache and chest pain did not disappear and I could not sleep until 7 AM. I woke up today (2/5/2021) at 10 AM with a fever of 101.4, another pounding headache, and still unilateral chest pain. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol around 10:30 AM and it only helped with the fever. I went back to sleep and slept until 4 PM. I understand that the fever and headache are normal symptoms but my chest pain does not seem like muscle soreness. It doesn&#39;t hurt when I touch it, it comes and goes every few seconds, I have 4 or 5/ 10 on the pain scale for most of the pain but it turns into 6 or 7/10 occasionally (10 being the worst pain). What does help with my pain when it is 6 or 7/10 is when I clench my chest really hard like I am flexing it. It is a sharp pain that stays for a few seconds before it disappears and it feels like a deep pain. I didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol again because I am about to max out (can only take 2 more capsules until 2:00 AM because it states not to take more than 6 capsules in 24 hours, and each capsule is 500 mg) (Also, the Tylenol does not help with the pain so I am only taking it for my fever.) I was wondering if anyone else reported this and if this is an adverse side effect.  This has not cause any issues regarding my breathing but just pain.

After that, the pain started to grow and grow until it was extreme pain, at around an 8/10. The pain radiated from my chest to the undersides of my arms. After two hours of pain, it started to subside and eventually was gone. There was no pain for the rest of the day. The next day, two hours after I woke up again, the mild chest pain returned. Still in the center of my chest, the pain grew into extreme pain again. This time however, it was slightly to the right and as the pain progressed it moved right until after two hours it went away again.  The treatment I got at the Urgent Care was an EKG and they told me to go to a hospital. At the hospital, I got Toradol, aspirin and propanolol.  My initial Troponin levels at admission to the hospital were 900 and grew to 1300. It lowered for a time, but at the last check, it rose again to 1420 after not getting Toradol for at least 12 hours.

                                                &#34;Moderna&#34; Adverse vaccine reaction possible as began 12 hours post second COVID vaccine dose on Friday. A ER note was  generated in a T-Con on a patient who got their 2nd Covid Vaccine and began experiencing chest pain approx. 12 hours post vaccine. Patient did not report to the ER until 28Feb21. It was discussed that he has myocarditis v pericarditis, elevated D-Dimer of 770, swollen lymph nodes, and elevated Troponin. Patient was transferred to Research Medical Center due to no available beds. Patient was referred to a Case Manager and Cardiology. The patient completed a follow up appointment with 509 MDG on 9Mar21 and reported Dull pain that has been affecting sleep. Cardiology reports shows Troponin was elevated to 9.1 decreased to 4.2 and back up again to 13.4. Cardiac revealed late gadolinium enhancement, possibly representing myocarditis and then at discharge possibly myocarditis.

                                                I almost fainted the night after my shot. I had vaped cannabis prior at around 1:00am, and probably re-dosed at around 3:00AM, before falling asleep at around 4:30AM. I had a harder than normal time falling asleep that night, and I didn&#39;t sleep very well. At around 6:00AM I woke up and walked to the bathroom, feeling pain in my anal region. As I started to sweat profusely, I recognized that I was likely about to faint, so I pre-emptively lied down on the floor of the bathroom until I felt well enough to stand up. I don&#39;t remember exactly how long I was on the floor but most likely a few minutes. I then had a bowel movement, still feeling pain in my anal region but to a lesser degree, and then drank some water and went back to sleep at around 6:30AM.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

Patient also mentioned that he only consumed two cookies and coffee for that day.  When the EMS arrived (about 5 firefighters), they interviewed him and performed a blood pressure test. His sitting blood pressure was 130/82. One of the firefighters assessed his spine and Patient denied cervical, thoracic, and lumbar tenderness or pain. The firefighter assessed Patient&#39;s glucose level, which was a bit difficult to obtain in the first initial efforts, with the glucometer reading ?error?. The firefighters eventually were able to obtain a reading on Patient&#39;s glucose and it read 86. Patient was able to stand on his own, and a second blood pressure test was performed; his standing blood pressure reading was 145/89.  EMS gave Patient gauze to address his head wound Patient initially refused to go to the hospital, but per EMS protocol, fluids needed to be administered. Patient entered the ambulance and was taken to the hospital by EMS.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I kept a log of the events that occurred. Notes: 25mg amitriptyline taken nightly for the last month, 200mg motrin I?ve never taken pain killers before this, time is in military.   Mar 18  1430 (1 hour 30 mins after my shot) i have a compressing headache toward the back of my head so i take 1 motrin.  1700 i head home, take 1 amitriptyline and head straight to sleep. ( i have no apatite so no dinner ) Mar 19 0100 The pain starts, it?s unbearable. I am sweating heavily and im also shivering cold. i have a high fever I have body aches which turns my shivering into shaking which keeps my wife up all night. In my dreams i feel pain. I talked to my deceased mother, i hold my deceased cat and i relive some of my most regrettable moments.  0700 I wake up, the bed is soaking wet. I take a motrin and get dressed. it takes me an hour longer to get ready for work because, the pain has sapped my energy. My supervisor sends me home seeing how horrible I look. 0900 I take an amitriptyline and lay down. I ask me wife to close to the storm shutters to darken the room. They are normally pretty quiet to close but, this time they are deafeningly loud. I struggled to get 1 hour of sleep.  1500 I wake up due to shaking so bad that i hit my head on the wall. I then take 2 motrin and about 30 mins later i notice theres a tightness in my chest. i take 1 tums. I know that my body is exhausted from the pain and my mind is clouded but i really wanted to do all of the tasks that i was planning on doing this weekend. All of the tasks end up failing. 2100 i try the tasks again and end up failing again.   20 Mar 0100. I eat a pear and 2 cheetos. i do not take a amitriptyline and i lay down. i have no pain or fever. (Dream start) The dream i had is of me watching myself get thrown around by a ghost. The ghost possesses my body for a short time. I grab some kittens (cats are a comfort to me so im guessing that my subconscious trying to reel me back in) I then wake my sleeping wife and tell her theres a ghost and we need to leave. We walk outside and im in an old neighborhood that i grew up in, everything darkens and im in pitch black feeling my way around a room. I open my eyes and im in a hotel. The front desk staff will not let me take the kittens up to my room so i leave them. When i walk into the room, it?s full of kittens (dream end) and i wake up  21 Mar 0900 I wake up and I have a sore throat and tightness in my chest. The soreness prevents me from going back to sleep and the tightness in my chest causing some anxiety. Once I calm myself down and convince myself that im not having a heart attack I take 2 motrin and some tums and the pain goes away from the day. These could be some withdrawals from not taking amitriptyline since 19 mar in the morning. This is still happening as I write this report. (23 March 2021)

                                                During the first night after receiving vaccine I started to have SEVERE shaking / full body muscle spasms-hypertonicity that  lasted 60-90 minutes. Required 30 minutes hot shower to calm down shaking symptoms. Initially thought episodes were caused/triggered by cold temperature (still possibility) but now thinking its triggered by anxiety. Heart rate almost spikes to 120-130 BPM. No fever and normal blood pressure is noted when episodes happen.  Occurrences is not routine and seem to be random.  Very concerning considering symptoms lasted for 2 &#43; weeks now. I do not have health care or ability to see PCP/GP without paying out of pocket.   Now please understanding the severity of these episodes, to the point where it resembles severe Parkinson&#39;s symptoms.   Along with those I still have the normal side effects, fatigue  (extreme)  , mood changes, joint aches, intolerance to cold off and on,  and elevated HR.

                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.

That same night I ran a fever and woke up the next morning feeling ok. I was taking a shower and it was reported to me by my fiancé I had passed out, started to seize, my eyes rolled to the back of my head. A few minutes later I woke up on the floor and asked what had happened. I was not sure what had happened.  I felt fine when I woke up. When first responders arrived they asked me if I knew who I was, the date, the president, where I lived to all I was able to answer correctly. I went to the ER and they did a ECG, blood test, urine test, chest x-ray, CT of my head and they said everything came back normal. I was prescribed Keppra and have an MRI scheduled in the coming week.

I couldn&#39;t stand up and was scared to walk, so I was put on a stretcher. My throat started to close up. I was put in an ambulance and my throat swelled more on the trip to the ER. They gave me Benadryl and Prednisone. I was there for about 4 or 5 hours. I was okay after that. I checked the CDC site and it said I couldn&#39;t take the 2nd dose.
