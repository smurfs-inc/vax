                                                At about 1330 on 30DEC, the patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Less than five minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient noticed a metallic taste.  About two to three minutes afterwards, the patient noticed a ?tingling? sensation mostly on the left side of the face and minimally on the right side.  Almost immediately after the ?tingling? sensation, the patient felt the sensation of an increased heart rate and checked his pulse with his watch that had a pulse sensor.  The watch indicated that he had a heart rate of 115 bpm.  This sensation of an increased heart rate subsided after for one or two minutes and repeat pulse measurement was in the low 90s.  Towards the end of the 15 minute post-vaccination observation period, the medical technician did the final check on the patient.  The patient admitted to experiencing a metallic taste and a mild tingling sensation on the neck and face area.  The service member was immediately brought back to the treatment room were a faint red rash and was noticed on the left side of the neck by the medical providers present.  Two doses of Benadryl 25mg were given and the patient was told to continue to be observed in the observation area.  After about 20 minutes, the tingling sensation resolved.  The patient checked his pulse again and it was in the low 70s.  The metallic taste resolved after about one and a half hours after the start of the symptom.

He pulled over and threw up. Once he got to work he vomited again. He drove to another facility for work and then threw up 3 or 4 more times. He began experiencing hot flashes at this time. He went to the hospital and was seen in the emergency room. He threw up several more times in the ER and stated that his heart was racing and that he had diarrhea. The emergency room gave him medications for the nausea and he stayed there for 2 or 3 hours. He began to feel better and was discharged to home.

                                                Around noon, my fiance doubled over in agonising pain and clutched his right side. We treated it like a stomach ache and he went through the rest of the day, even at work, in gut wrenching pain. This morning when I woke up, I noticed he was out on the couch. When I went to check on him, he was as white as a ghost and his lips were greying around the edges. I immediately told him to call into work. I thought he would say no because he has not called in in over 10 years, but to my surprise, he did so. I put him in bed and the abdominal pain is still present and now his fever is over 103!!!  I bought Tylenol and Motrin and will be alternating between the two until the fever breaks and if the pain persists by 8 pm, we will be headed to the emergency room...

He was complaining of trouble with focusing his eyes, left sided chest pain, and was diaphoretic.  Pt appeared to be in moderate distress and very anxious. I examined the pt through the car window and listened to his heart and lungs. Pt was not in respiratory distress and heart rate and rhythm were regular. Reassurance was provided to the pt, but he was also told that to be safe I recommended that he be evaluated in the emergency department and that he be transported via ambulance. Pt expressed understanding and agreed to going to the ED but was refusing transport via EMS. Pt was the passenger in the vehicle and he said that the driver could just take him. I expressed that transport via EMS would be the safest but we could not make him go via EMS and that if they wanted to leave via private vehicle then they could but i still recommended that he be evaluated in the ED. He expressed understanding and that he would go directly to the ED via personal car.

Pt agreed to this. Transport to ED via EMS was offered and pt declined as he had a driver. Informed pt that I could not make him go via EMS but I did recommend it. Pt expressed understanding but thought that he would be fine with it being as close as it is and him being the passenger, so he again declined transport via EMS. They were instructed to proceed directly to the ED for further Eval.

                                                Initial symptoms of the first shot included injection site pain, neck soreness, and severe headache that would come and go.    The next day I was so exhausted I couldn&#39;t work for 2 days.  I barely got out of bed until about 40 hours after the shot where I was able to get out and do some gardening.   The reason I am filling this out was at right around 72 hours after the vaccine, I was laying down watching a YouTube video feeling quite relaxed.  I then experienced a tachycardia event where my heart rate went up to 120 and stayed there for about an hour.  I remained calm and was not experiencing anxiety, but the heart rate persisted.  I have had this happen before in panic attacks, but it&#39;s quite rare and I am in acute, high level stress.    Almost 2 weeks later to the day, I had another tachycardia, stronger than any I&#39;ve had my entire life that only lasted about 7 seconds, but I would estimate my heart rate jumped to over 250.   I thought I was going to go into cardiac arrest it was so jarring.  I&#39;m not sure if that one was related to the vaccine.

                                                Patient recieved the vaccine  in the left arm and was asked to wait in the pharamcy waiting area for observation for 15 minutes (no previous hx of anaphylaxis). Upon returning to the main pharmacy floor a few minutes later one of the technicians alerted me to the patient had retrurned to the counter and was &#34;feeling something&#34;. He was visibly struggling to maintain balance and I asked patient to take a seat to prevent any risk of falls and motioned to a chair. He took a seat on the floor  next to the pharmacy counter and I rushed over to him to tend to him. I asked him if was having any other symptoms and he noted he was feeling lightheaded and having chills all over his body. His body was cold and clammy to the touch and had a difficult time locatiing a pulse on the radial artery. While talking to him his responses were shorter and he seemed like was starting to almost lose conciousness. Management had already called 911 and we offered water to the patient while we waited. Prior to the paramedics arriving I was able to get a pulse using a cuff and it was around 53bpm, the patient also seemed hypotensive.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (hospitalized for 7 days; treated with Remdesivir; long recovery) from 11-Sep-2020 to October 2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure (ongoing issues) and Heart rate (ongoing issues).    On 05-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ILLNESS (Gotten very sick from vaccine), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Blood pressure issues), DIZZINESS (Dizziniess) and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (Heart rate issues). At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke), ILLNESS (Gotten very sick from vaccine), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Blood pressure issues), DIZZINESS (Dizziniess) and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (Heart rate issues) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 9.64 after one round of the vaccine. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 220 natural antibodies after 2 months.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was withdrawn on an unknown date.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient reports that he had worked for an urgent care performing testing and contracted COVID-19 back in 11SEP2020. Patient was hospitalized for 7 days, was administered Remdesivir, and had a long recovery. Patient reports having issues regulating his blood pressure and heart rate so bad that he had almost died during that time. The recovery took up until 1st week of October and did not feel well until then. Patient reports it was advised to defer first dose of vaccination for COVID-19 for 3 months.   Patient self-medicated with OTC Tylenol and Advil which did not help. Patient reports that he was hospitalized a second time around last month (03MAR2021 approximately) for experiencing a stroke. Symptoms felt like he was experiencing a mini-COVID-19 episode and was having a relapse of COVID-19. ER professional advised patient to never take the second dose of the vaccine. Patient reports taking an antibody test (after a single dose of the vaccine) for both natural and for the spike protein on 25MAR2021. Patient reports that he had gotten a 9.64 reading from just one round of the vaccine in comparison to the doctors he had worked who had received both doses of the vaccine, never gotten sick with COVID-19, and produced a 9.0 reading. Patient reports his natural antibodies after 2 months was at 220. Patient wishes to report this information to highlight that his natural antibodies were so high from the previous COVID-19 infection that when he had gotten the first round of the vaccine, he believes that his body rejected the vaccine so strongly that he presented with severe side effects from the vaccine. Patient would like to submit his information to show that he is proof that if someone previously had COVID-19, they should only need a single dose of the vaccine. In addition, patient expressed that if a patient&#39;s natural antibody is high, then a reduced dose should be provided or the vaccine should be deferred until natural antibodies reduce   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 02-Apr-2021: Event details reported; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

He drove himself to the emergency room at 7am because he just wasn&#39;t feeling right.  After two EKG&#39;s, the Dr. at Hospital located in the area decided to air lift patient to another Hospital for an assumed fatal heart attack.  Upon arrival, he was given a heart catheter and no blockages were found.  They determined the had myocarditis, inflammation of his heart.  However, he had not been sick or battling any illness.

                                                Patient came in for his 2nd Moderna shot today 4/26/21. I administered the vaccine and asked him to remain in the store for a 15-minute observation period (just like the 1st dose). After 2-3 minutes he walked to the pharmacy window to let my technician know he was starting to feel dizzy. At the same time my technician was informing me about his complaint, he lost consciousness and fell, hitting the side of his head on the consultation wall. I immediately asked technician to call 911 and rushed to get EpiPen to patient. He immediately regained consciousness. I did not administer any EpiPen doses. I stayed with him and monitored him until paramedics arrived. When paramedics arrived, they asked me which vaccine I administered and started asking patient questions. They measured his blood pressure. Patient was responsive and he called his wife to let her know he was going to the ER. Paramedic informed us that his blood pressure was low. On his way to the hospital he looked at us and said thank you. I will call him tomorrow to check on him.

I found him in the bathroom after he regained consciousness in a cold sweat, extremely pale, saying that he thought he was going to throw up.  He said it felt like food poisoning.  I got him back into bed with a cool wash cloth and he slept off and on the rest of the day.  He started feeling a bit better but struggled to comprehend simple questions and would just stare at me blankly as if he couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying.  Even though he slept most of the day he was falling asleep in his chair by about 8pm.  The paleness, waves of exhaustion, and inability to stay awake past 8:30/9pm has continued.

The following day this continued along with significant confusion (he did not recognize the turn onto the major street to our home where we have lived for nearly 2 years, he also forgot the a  pizza was still in existence even though there is one down the street for us that we have passed many times and discussed at length in the past 2 years).  The week after his injection he would get home from work and be falling asleep in his chair by 7:30pm with no change to his sleep schedule.  He has remained pale and still struggles with exhaustion.

PCP suspected lymphatic bacterial infection &amp; prescribed Keflex 500mg t.id. for 10 days. After 10 days condition had not changed. I experienced no pain throughout the entire event, only felt tightness in skin on calf from swelling.   Bilateral ultrasound performed &amp; results negative for DVT in both legs. Final Dx is Superficial Thrombophlebitis. Treatment plan is to elevate affected left leg &amp; apply warm compress when possible &amp; wear compression stockings when standing for extended periods.

Patient is a 40 y/o male with no significant PMH who initially presented to the hospital after being found down at a restaurant. Was found to have ST segment changes on EKG, somnolent, and hypotensive requiring pressors. Taken to the cath lab where he had equalization of diastolic pressures and subsequently received pericardiocentesis due to concern for tamponade from pericardial effusion. 350 ccs of fluid was drained and his hemodynamics immediately improved and he came off vasopressors. Pericardial drain was placed. Over the next several days he had ongoing workup for the etiology of his pericardial effusion. His pericardial drain output dropped off, was clamped 5/31 and repeat echocardiogram 6/1 did not show significant effusion. Unfortunately, patient went into PEA arrest in the afternoon and was coded for ~40 minutes without return of ROSC. Unclear etiology at this time, no evidence of significant effusion on echocardiogram

As of 6-16, loss of feeling still continues.  1 week after, chest and lung pain, I think my heart is hurting, almost like random stabbing pains through it, random waves of muscle and joint pain. Issues sleeping. Issues with thinking clearly.   I have felt run down since receiving my second shot. Loss of appetite and foggy brain.

                                                About a week after the shot I noticed I was a experiencing some hypertension. I was having chest pains on the right side of my chest, as well as pain and numbness in my right arm around my bicep area. The chest pain is intermittent but the arm pain is pretty constant. My PCP ran a blood panel that showed high cholesterol. I also had an EKG, which was normal. He scheduled me for a stress test. I passed but was told that for a male my age and fitness level, I should have done better. I was prescribed aspirin and atorvastatin 10mg 1x/day. I had COVID in 11/2020, I was asymptomatic.

The technician alerted the pharmacist and when the pharmacist looked over at the patient, he looked pail and started slouching.  Pharmacist ran to patient and caught him as he started to pass out.  Pharmacist laid him on the floor and by the time the pharmacist had him laying down, the patient came back awake.  Patient was sweaty and very warm to touch. During this process, EMS was called.  When they arrived patient was already back to normal cognition and said he felt fine other than being warm.  EMS check stats and cleared him to drive home after another 15 minutes wait period.  The pharmacist believes this was a vasovagal syncope reaction to this patient getting the Moderna vaccine.  Patient was fully recovered within 30 minutes of the adverse reaction.

I was admitted to The Emergency room because of high blood sugar so I went back on Lantus and everything has normalized. I was admitted on 06/09/2021 and discharged 06/10/2021. I had blood work drawn and a COVID test. My COVID test came back normal and my blood work showed that my blood sugar was very high.

                                                I have Peripheral Artery disease and have had bypasses done on both legs.  It has been managed fairly well with a several minor &#34;tune ups&#34; by angio. I was able to walk pretty well with minimal pain.  About a week after my second dose I started noticing increased pain in both of my calves which has become considerably worse since then.  I cannot walk 1/10 of a mile without taking a break.  Also,  around July 1st, my fingers went numb in my right hand,  then I started getting pain in my right forearm and cramping in my hand. That pain has made it so the way up my arm.  I saw my vascular surgeon and an ultrasound revealed a clot in the bend of my elbow.  I was asked how I think I could have gotten the clot, the only thing I&#39;ve done differently was get that vaccine. It&#39;s extremely obvious to me that the vaccine has caused a severe reaction in me.  I have a surgery scheduled on Wed. July 14 to have the clot removed.

                                                Started with flu like symptoms, chills, aches, etc. For about 12 hours. Then I rapidly spiked a 102.7 fever and became so physically weak I felt paralyzed. Oxygen saturation dropped into the low 90s and I began to have labored breathing. I made an attempt to stand up and urinate, then passed out and collapsed. Ems came to the house and checked me out. I declined their offer to go to the hospital because I broke the fever, was breathing better, and had no concussion signs from the fall.

                                                Patient is a 41 y.o. male on no AC/AP with no pmhx reported presents 1/31 PM initially to Hospital for acute onset 10/10 headache refractory to 800mg motrin which started in occipital region then spread to whole head and neck, nausea and vomiting x 3. Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

                                                Flair up of tendentious and upper arm pain in my right arm (the opposite arm from the one I had the shot in).  This is still ongoing. (I have had a few limited periods where I have had tendentious/bursitis in the past, but it as not been an issue in over a year and reoccurred immediately after the shot.) Significant fatigue the  day after injection with ongoing fatigue following.   Elevated heart rate for at least the day following the injection.  Pain at injection site for 3 days

                                                It was the Moderna Vaccine. I had a prescheduled meeting to get some tests done on the Monday, following my vaccine (02/22/2021). The results of those labs showed a severe inflammatory response. My blood platelet levels were at 27, and my CRP was at 15. I started bruising easily, which I have never done before, and I had serious body aches and fatigue. I met with Dr.  on Tuesday, March 16, 2021 to do some follow up tests. At this point, my platelet levels were up to 96, much improved, but still low. He said that it could very likely be connected to the vaccine. I had the first dose on January 23, 2021, and the second dose on February 20, 2021. I now have to get additional tests to see if these levels improve.

He received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 18MAR21 at clinic and within 14 hours developed chills and myalgias. He denies any immediate onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine. The following day he reports experiencing chest pain 24 hours after the vaccine was administered that progressively worsened over the subsequent 36 hours that finally prompted him to seek care. He describes the pain as a central non-radiating squeezing pain that worsened with movement and breathing. He waited to seek care because he reports several of the soldiers in his unit have experienced similar chest pain that eventually resolved.   He reports being at his baseline health prior to receiving the vaccine and denies any fever, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.   Upon initial presentation to care at clinic he was noted to have a Tropnon I of 0.9, WBC of 14, elevated CRP (7.3), and temp to 101.4. Patient was given ASA, Plavix, Lovenox, Tylenol, and Ceftriaxone.    Since arriving to clinic and EKG was obtained showing ST elevation in lead 1 and avF concerning for ischemia and underwent a left heart catheterization which was clear of obstruction. Serial high sensitivity Tropnonin levels have been trended to peak of 465. Respiratory viral panel to include SARS COV-2 was negative. Cardiac MRI was consistent with myopericarditis, and show mildly reduced EF for 46%. Blood cultures have not grown any organism. His chest pain has resolved since starting Aspirin and Colchicine.

                                                About 1 hour after injection I started feeling mild tingling in my face and throat. I then lost my voice for approximately 5 minutes. As the next few days started to progress I started noticing mild muscle spasms all over my body, mostly in my legs; waking up in the middle of the night, dry mouth, night sweat (1 occurrence), sudden onset of rapid and irregular heart beat (1 occurrence); kidney pain (right and left), upper abdominal pain (right and left). Prior to vaccine I did not experience any of these events.

                                                Went to ED 3/30/21  Immediately after receiving the second vaccine 2/25 he developed chest tightness and joint pain. The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

                                                I?ve been vaccinated for 2 months now. My new symptoms just started to really ramp up 3 weeks ago. Of course I had the initial symptoms of being sick for 2 and 1/2 days after my second shot?.but recently it started with leg aches and then it matriculated up into my upper body. My legs have since become less achy per say. Now it?s my upper body and mostly in my shoulders (more in the one I received the shots in), back pain, and general fatigue. Currently still dealing with the upper body ache discomfort, cold hands and feet but I noticed that I have a slight headache always and my vision has became a little blurry in one eye. The headache severity is day to day but what?s interesting now is I?m having ear ringing and sensitivity to sound. Headache seems to emulate from the back of my skull and the crown of my head. The other lingering piece is the fatigue after doing activities. I?m an active guy and recently my body gets really achy after I do anything super strenuous and I get tired. Also feeling a little shaky, some rapid heart rate, and some circulation issues in my legs and arms. Note; never experienced these issues before the Vaccine aside from the normal wear and tear of an active lifestyle.

Aftervaccination i sat with pt a few minutes to make sure he was feeling well and ready to move to a chair in front of the pharmacy to sit for 30 minutes and make sure he is feeling well. I notified my manager that pt in front has fainted before and he kept a close eye on him. I was administering shot to the next pt and heard a sound. I left vaccination booth and saw pt on the ground. I placed his legs/feet in front of him and his wife held his head and ice pack. Our pt reported that he did not hit or hurt his head and did not need other assistance. we monitored the patient an additional 20 minutes and he was feeling well, vital signs good and accompanied by his wife.

                                                Passed out; Sweaty; Slightly feverish; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out) in a 41-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 045B21A and 045A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.   On 21-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 21-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 21-Apr-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out) (seriousness criterion medically significant), HYPERHIDROSIS (Sweaty) and PYREXIA (Slightly feverish). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out), HYPERHIDROSIS (Sweaty) and PYREXIA (Slightly feverish) had resolved.            For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.  Concomitant medications were not reported.   Description: The patient felt sweaty and slightly feverish all night on 21 April 2021. When he got up to urinate he actually passed out (medically significant) and was on the floor for a few seconds. Later last night, on the same day, he went to drink some water, and passed out again for a few seconds. The patient did not seek any medical attention, and stated that he felt fine now.  No treatment information provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Per PCP visit note 4/28/2021: Patient reports has had some malaise, labile sugars, insulin resistance for past 2 weeks which he notes began about 2-3 weeks after initial Covid Moderna vaccine.  He then reports over past 4-5 days has felt dehydrated, dark urine, and now with some abdominal distension, nausea, and fatigue.  Normal bowel movements.  Able to eat, no Tylenol or alcohol use.  All meds stopped by Endo due to lab results except his insulin.    Did find a note that states he received 2nd Moderna vaccine but also noted that his Endo suggested he should not get the 2nd dose.  Our Immunization system did not pull in a 2nd dose.  Also was some confusion as to whether he got Pfizer or Moderna, but the system did show Moderna given 3/30.  Plan: CT scan, stay off all meds except insulin, PharmD review of meds and report to VAERs, schedule f/u with GI (will see in ~ 2months)  CT Scan of abdomen/pelvis: no acute findings  Will continue to f/u with PCP and watch lab to be sure numbers are improving.

I nearly blacked out. I got very hot and had to take off all my clothes, then when I got up to the toilet to diarrhea again I needed to vomit, I blacked out on my bathroom floor. when I woke up I went back to bed. at the time of the occurence I was too delusional to call for help. I barely ate that day because I felt so bad. I did notice the second day I felt worse after drinking 1,000 mg of vitamin C from one of those Emercencey Packets with lots of water. and the next day I took twice as much to (knock out) what ever I was feeling.

                                                On April 27th, I went to local ER with acute shortness of breath.  X-ray and CT scan showed possible fluid build up in lungs.  I was admitted to hospital on April 28.  Echocardiogram diagnosed heart failure, ejection fraction was 25%.  Pulse was also quite high (120-135), and blood oxygen was low (88-90%).  Cardiac catheterization showed no blockages in coronary arteries.  Echocardiogram, EKG, and bloodwork were negative for heart attack.  Ultimate diagnosis from doctor was idiopathic cardiomyopathy.  Currently taking several medications and under care from primary care physician and cardiologist.  At follow up appointment with primary care following discharge, she suggested I report the incident out of an abundance of caution.

I called for help and my son assisted me to my bed where I collapsed and could hardly move while I broke out in cold sweats and my wife monitored my heart rate and placed an oxygen monitor on my finger.  she said my pulse held steady and slow.  The event lasted about 10 minutes and I felt I must return to the toilet for a bowl movement.  I began having diarrhea and then began to throw up. After that i took a cool shower and laid in bed. I stayed in bed for about 48 hours.

                                                After headaches and fatigue following the shot (within 24 hours) I began to notice slight shortness of breath 3-5 days following. I didn&#39;t give it much thought, but, roughly two weeks after my dose I began to experience severe intercostal pain and sharp pain in the lower lobe of my right lung upon inhalation. I thought this was musculoskeletal at first but after it didn&#39;t abate within days, I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with several distal pulmonary emboli.   Luckily I survived and am currently on blood thinners while trying to determine the cause of this, having no history of blood clots personally or in extended family.

                                                Patient had no previous issues with vaccines in the past. Patient went to the post-vaccination chairs and about 2 minutes after giving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, patient&#39;s wife informed me he was not feeling well. Patient was sweating profusely, shaking, light headedness, and difficulty breathing.  Site of injection looked normal.  I brought him back to the immunizing booth, laid him down, gave him something soft to lay his head on and cover- up with.  His sweating and shaking seemed to get worse. He wanted to sit in the chair since the floor was cold.  We sat him up, gave him an ice pack, and gave him some orange juice. We called 911 and instructed EMS where to find us and the patient&#39;s symptoms. While waiting on EMS, his symptoms improved slightly. They arrived quickly and assessed the patient&#39;s blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar. He did not feel as if he needed to go to the hospital. I had the patient wait in the immunization booth a bit longer.  He felt better, and color came back into his face. He went home with his wife. I gave them the V-Safe info, so he can report any issues while at home.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: SUICIDAL IDEATION (pt. reports suicidal thoughts) and FEVER (pt. received 2nd Moderna vaccine approx 1100 yesterday approx 3-4 hours ago developed chills/fever/anxiety/visual hallucinations/generalized body aches) HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: HPI:  Patient is a 41-year-old male who presents to the emergency department from home with his wife for chief complaint of suicidal ideation, anxiety. Nursing noted him to be hyperventilating in triage. Patient states these thoughts started about 4 hours ago after he started feeling unwell.  Patient states that he got his 2nd moderna COVID vaccine at 11:00 a.m. yesterday.  This evening after trying to go to bed he started getting fevers body aches and myalgias.  He took Advil around 8:00 p.m..  After this, he started having increased thoughts of wanting to harm himself.  He states he is having &#34;hallucinations of himself cutting his arms and legs off&#34;.  He called telemedicine who told him he needs to go to the emergency department.  Patient originally did not want to wake his wife up and did not want to go in but he eventually woke his wife and she brought him here.  Patient does have a history of PTSD and depression.  He is on Cymbalta which apparently he has been taking.  He has not been able to see a counselor since the beginning of the year because of his insurance.  He does see physicians through the hospital.  he has never had to be inpatient but has had to come to the ER a few years ago for suicidal ideation. He also tells me that he quit his job yesterday because he doesn&#39;t like seeing people be mean to other people. ED Course as of May 19 0613 Wed May 19, 2021 0339 Patient is a 41-year-old male who presents to the emergency department with suicidal thoughts.  Patient has PTSD.  Suicidal thoughts started about 4 hours ago.  He did get his 2nd moderna COVID vaccine at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and now has a fever and generalized body aches and fatigue.  I do believe this is a normal immune response to the COVID vaccine.  We will give him Toradol.  Patient is very tearful and anxious.  I will give him some Ativan while we are waiting for lab work to return.  Medical social worker will have to evaluate the patient.   0521 MSW is currently talking to the patient.    0611 Medical social worker and wife felt that patient could be discharged home with the safety plan.  He will follow up with the hospital for mental health counseling services.  Patient feels much better after fever subsided.  He will continue to rotate between Motrin and Tylenol.

                                                Friday after the shot was good, just a sore arm. On Saturday I developed a fever of 101 and chills and was very tired. I felt a little better on Saturday night and Sunday morning after some Tylenol 500 mg. My fever would break then come back for a bit  By Sunday afternoon my back began to really hurt. I have some chronic back pain so didn&#39;t think too much of it just tried to massage it and stretch it out. However it just kept getting worse and the pain radiated into my chest around 9:00 PM Sunday night.  It continued to get worse until about midnight, and I  ultimately decided to go to the ER.  The tylenol helped reduce the pain by the time I got into the ER but I went in anyway because I was concerned about the intensity of the chest pain I&#39;d had earlier.  I was tested for heart enzymes and they were slightly elevated, at .12.  On this result, I was admitted to the hospital on suspicion of having suffered a heart attack.  I was put on a heparin drip and my troponin levels were tested every 3 hours.  They continued to rise to a high of .67.  More testing was done, and the cardiology department concluded that I had not suffered a heart attack due to the low troponin levels but that instead I was dealing with heart inflammation.  Every doctor and nurse there commented that there had been other patients coming in with cardiac inflammation from vaccines as well.  Due to my family history of heart issues and my own existing risks, I was moved to the hospital where I was examined in the cath lab via angiogram.  This found no blockages in my arteries, further confirming the cardiology suspicion of cardiac inflammation, and I was given a diagnosis of pericarditis and prescribed colchicine to treat the inflammation.

                                                Elevated heart rate, led to arrhythmias on Sunday 5/16 - 48 hours after my 2nd dose. Apple Watch indicated AFib several times that day. Went to sleep and heart arrhythmia woke me out of my sleep at 4am on Monday 5/17/21, so I went to the ER to get checked out. In the hospital, I was diagnosed with myocarditis, was held there for 4 nights for monitoring and am still taking medication to keep it under control.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

Had a glass of water and resolved. Evaluated by doctor and had pulse of 92 (high for patient) and elevated blood pressure 148/92. Rest of vitals normal. Felt anxious. Ate lunch, had about 6 more episodes of mouth drying out, last one about 10 hours after vaccine.  Resolved with water. Took benedryl 50mg. Next felt fatigue and right arm soreness. Felt normal within 48 hours.

He stated he was tachycardic.   I had pt sit down immediately.  We called 911.  I took his blood pressure which was considerably elevated (235/107).  Pt had no other signs of an allergic rxn. Paramedics arrived and took pt to the nearest hospital.

His Apple Watch told him he was in afib.  So the patient was taken to the ER by his wife where this was confirmed with an EKG.  He was cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm and he was prescribed Eliquis.  Patient has no prior heart arrhythmias or medical concerns.  Patient is slightly overweight, but has not had any arrhythmia or history of a fib in the past.  Patient was discharged to follow up with his family physician.  All of his blood work was normal.

This lasted about 1-2 minutes.  I did not receive any treatment for this. There was no further outcome to report.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

                                                Arrhythmia; Heart palpitations; A spontaneous report was received from a 42 year-old, male, patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced heart palpitations and arrhythmia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 07 Jan 2021 at 14:30, approximately 2 days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 09 Jan 2021, the patient went to the emergency room (ER) because he had heart palpitations and an arrhythmia for about 5 hours. Blood tests, electrocardiogram (EKG) and a chest x-ray were normal.  On 10 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s heart palpitations came back again. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome for the events, heart palpitations and arrhythmia, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a  42-year old male patient. The medical history is not provided. The patient experienced a medically significant and unexpected event of Arrhythmia and an unexpected non-serious event of Heart palpitations approximately two days after receiving their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown).  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                Within 2 min of injection, I walked out to waiting room felt tachycardic and dizzy.  I immediately informed pharmacist who took my BP.   BP first reading in left arm was 235/130 with a HR around 130. Second reading was 205/120 with HR in 120&#39;s about 4 min later.  I requested an ambulance due to the feeling of being very unwell and dizzy.  Trouble concentrating.    Ambulance ride was 190/112 ish EKG and BP monitoring at hospital.   No anaphalaxis diagnosed but unknown cause.   ER discharge after benadryl.    BP and HR would continue to cycle up and down for the next  18 hours.   Red spot formed about 2 inches away from where I was injected.      PCP and allergist thin it was an intravascular injection.

Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.  The patient stated that he had been fasting for 2 days and we determined low blood sugar likely played into his response to the vaccine.  Glucose gel was placed in mouth and patient felt better within 15 minutes.

I call the nurse line and requested a CBC.  On 2 February, the Emergency Department called me back and stated my platelets were at 6K (over the last 10 years with CLL, they consistently are at 110K-120K).  The emergency department directed me to come in and began treatment with Prednisone and platelet transfusion.  I was transferred to Hospital  where they started IVIG and 40mg of Dexamethasone for four days.  I was discharged on 7 February with stable platelets at 42K

The next day I was in bed the whole day feeling as if I had Covid all over again. I did previously had Covid but waited over 30 days to receive the vaccination.

Symptoms began Saturday, 4/10; pt was helping her mother around her house; was not straining excessively; however, later that day had a sudden burning sensation in her lower-mid back, which has since been recurring in paroxysms.  At times it spreads into the posterior thighs but not into the feet; sometimes also spreads upward into the upper back and just below the chin.  In between attacks, there is no pain or numbness.  There has never been weakness. No urinary/bowel incontinence or saddle anesthesia; sphincter tone was normal.  NIF/FVC normal -60, 2.3L.  Paroxysmal pain controlled w/ 600mg gabapentin q8h since being hospitalized.  There has been no development or progression or symptoms, still only pain and normal neurologic and physical exam.

Cranial pressure that felt around entire circumference of head.  Lasting over 36 hours each time that forced bed-ridden behavior, forced time off of work, and loss of appetite.  Spiked heart rate on numerous occasion throughout the following 36&#43; hours with heart rates spiking as great as 136 bpm.  I should of reported it and visited my physician, but there was nothing more they could do besides for me to hydrate, suppress with Tylenol, &amp; ride it out.  Anyone with previous decent COVID cases should be advised against receiving the vaccine.  But entities are still forcing us to have it for our jobs.  I couldn?t endure a third round.  It was a violent illness following the vaccine, which was equivalent to one of my first ?bad? days of actual COVID.

He was having yellow sputum production and he had chills. Upon arrival to the hospital on 4/18 the patient was tachycardic and chest x-ray that showed cardiomegaly with fluid overload. Progressively became severely hypoxemic and had to be emergently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Patient developed cardiogenic shock which may be acute myocarditis and was placed on an Impella device and norepinephrine drip. The patient continued to worsen and developed acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia and was placed on CRRT. LFTs were also elevated.

On the morning of 19 APR 2021 at 0730 I began having chest pain, I thought I had pulled a muscle while exercising the night before. Throughout the morning the pain in my chest got worse until  I called  emergency services. The EMTs told me I had a blood clot in my heart and rushed me to the hospital. Once at the hospital I  had an angioplasty . No stint was inserted.   After the surgery the doctors told me I had very large veins and a strong heart after the clot was removed  flow returned and no stint was needed.   The doctors also told me that they could not rule out the COVID vaccine as the cause of my blood clot as the rest of me heart looked good with no visible plaques or build up.

                                                On 4/22/21, approximately 1 hr after the Moderna COVID-19 first vaccination injection, I started to encounter allergic reactions that I used to suffer about 20 years ago. My air intake decreased, and my skin began to become irritated. I formerly had environmental allergies that would reduce my air intake, and the first place I noticed the effects were on my skin and I would become irritable. Physicians told me that when my oxygen levels were low, the body would channel the air to where it was most needed, which is generally not the skin, so my skin would become irritated. When this used to occur, I would respond involuntarily with facial twitches and pulling at my face and hair. Physicians explained that these twitches and pulling actions would draw air to the surface of my skin where I was air depleted. When I took the Moderna injection, this happened again -- I found myself with low air, my face was twitching, and I was pulling on my face to draw air to the area. The result when I was 19 and dealing with allergies is that I would remove small patches of hair from my head or eyebrows or eyelashes, and this would happen almost unconsciously as I tried to stimulate the areas and draw air to the surface of my skin. I did the same thing on 4/22/21, and found later, when looking into a mirror, that I had removed a section of my eyebrow unconsciously. It all comes back to oxygen depletion. A different and more intense event occurred in the night of Friday, 4/23/21, and the early morning of Saturday, 4/24/21. I went to bed at about 11 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. Between that time and approximately 1:30 a.m., I had difficulty sleeping, and I dreamed of pain in my chest. I finally woke up about 1:30 a.m. and found the pain in my chest was real. I was having difficulty breathing deeply. It felt as if  the lower part of my lungs (at least on one side) was solidifying or inaccessible. What I did was begin forcing myself to breathe as deeply as possible. Over a period of 30 minutes or longer, I was able to gradually reclaim the use of the deepest part of my longs. With every forced deep breath, I was able to chip away at the area that felt like it was freezing up. Finally, I felt that I could access the deepest part of my longs and breath normally. The pain and lack of use in my lower lungs were very concerning.

When I came out he looked at me with his lazy eye and sweat. He did not say anything then his eyes rolled back then fainted. He did not remember the event . I pat him on his shoulder and he was awake right a way. I called 911 but he felt better before the emergency people arrived and they checked him out. He refused to go to the hospital.

                                                I am a pharmacist with 17 years of clinical experience and so medically literate. The night of the vaccine I had severe heart palpitations that woke me every 2 hours, but I managed to get some sleep. The 2nd night I could not fall asleep at all. I stayed up all night. 2nd night tried melatonin and benadryl, and only manged to sleep 2 hours very late in the night. This went on for a week. I saw a doctor and was given trazodone. It helped fall asleep but kept waking up every hour or 2 and then trouble falling asleep afterwards. So only managed 3-4 hours of sleep each night. I had side effects from Trazodone with mood changes so had to stop taking it. I saw another doctor based on a friend&#39;s recommendation who was going through the same issue. I was prescribed clonazepam 1mg. I was finally able to sleep a full night. I took it for 7-10 days and tried to taper back since I did not want to be dependent on it and wanted to go back to sleeping without  any sleeping aids. Klonopin 0.5mg seemed to be helping so on a follow-up appointment, I was given a months supply of clonazepam 0.5mg. I took that for a week and tried to taper that further and that did not help with sleep.  Amidst of this I started having tinnitus in the right ear and I never had tinnitus before. I don&#39; t know if it was triggered by sleep deprivation, the vaccine or the clonazepam.  But I stopped taking clonazepam altogether after 3 weeks.  9 weeks out since the 1st dose and I can sleep a little on alternate nights only. And that sleep is fractured. So one night of almost no sleep and one night of 3-4 of hours of sleep if lucky. I tried benadryl and it helps a little but the trouble falling asleep is just as severe and continue to wake up every 2-3 hours. 8 hours in bed and only manage 3-4 hours of sleep. I skipped the 2nd dose due to continued issues with sleep. Looking for answers and guidance on how best to treat this and if/when this will be over for me.

Since the second night I have had severe insomnia. Tried trazodone, ambien then clonazepam in that order. Clonazepam helped but I weaned myself off after 3 weeks, did not want to get addicted to them and I also started having tinnitus in right year. Not sure if it is from vaccine, lack of sleep or clonazpeam. 9 weeks out since 1st dose and I continue to suffer from severe insomnia. Only get about 4-5 hours of sleep that is fractured. Takes hours to fall asleep. Skipped 2nd dose due to side effect after 1st dose. Never had sleep issues ever.

                                                No more than an hour after receiving the first dose, I began to have chest pain, middle of the chest and maybe angled a bit to the right side.  More usual symptoms began to appear later that same day.. fatigue about 3 hours after shot, headaches about 5 hours after shot.  After the ?usual? symptoms subsided, the chest pain continued. May10, I went to immediate care, had a ekg which showed healthy results. May22, I was feeling much better, but had pressure applied to my chest by my partner? she inadvertently did this twice in a row. Over the next 1-2 hours, chest pain came rushing back and I began coughing a lot. Now May24, I am still having elevated chest pain and have been having a lot of heart palpitations over the past two days. I was scheduled to have the 2nd dose today, but am worried about what it will do to me.

Instructed patient to stay in consultation room for observation.  I stayed with the patient and called 911.  EMS arrived on scene about 5-10 minutes later.   Took vitals, oxygen saturation within normal limits, elevated bp, normal heart rate.  EMS monitored patient for about 15 minutes after which patient was still conscious and alert.  EMS advised patient to go to hospital for further evaluation and patient accepted.  EMS took patient to hospital.   Patient generally seemed fine when he left the pharmacy which was about 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

Wife explained that patient was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome prior to being vaccinated. PCP unaware of diagnosis, and patient did not disclose that on vaccine consent form. Patient reported to his wife that he was feeling unwell after receiving vaccine including unable to move legs well. Patient later diagnosed with thrush and supposedly treated by physician. Patient did not discuss concerns regarding vaccine or WPW with physician.  Patient called his wife the day of death and asked her to bring him to the doctor the following day. Wife reported that patient experienced seizures but not concerned as it was similar to childhood seizure. Wife was done at work and drove home after phone call, arriving at house approximately 10-15 minutes after call. Patient supposedly dead when wife arrived. Wife performed CPR for ~15 minutes until EMS arrived, and EMS attempted for another 40 minutes for any electrical activity. Wife declined full autopsy from ME, suspecting that it was massive MI or clot. Wife and patient unaware that WCW could place patient at risk of clots and wondering if the vaccine was partially responsible.

Sore arm was mitigated with movement and stretching (as compared to the first dose). Other symptoms have lessened since 7am (19 hours after shot), but linger.  Ibuprofen seems to lessen, but not end eymptoms.

She verbally said she had multiple allergies and had an anaphylactic reaction previously to allergy shots received in a doctor?s office. She said she does carry an Epipen. RPh counseled on the cases of anaphylaxis with the Pfizer vaccine and recommended a 30 minute monitoring period following the vaccine in accordance with CDC guidelines. Patient agreed and received the vaccine at approximately 11:30am with instructions to check back in with RPh at 12:00pm.   A few minutes later (at least 5 minutes), a friend of Patient alerted RPh that patient had fainted. The friend was able to catch patient before she fell off the chair and lower her to the ground. Patient was awake and answering questions but appeared to be having trouble maintaining consciousness. She denied shortness of breath, itching, swelling, and no rash or wheezing was evident. An Epipen was available and present but not administered due to lack of respiratory symptoms. 911 was called at 11:39am with the patient?s permission. Her symptoms remained the same until EMS arrived and she left in the ambulance at 11:57am.

I did not think much of that is reason I did not report it right away.  Day by day the discomfort and pain got worse.  Exactly one week after my second dose I was not able to sleep due to the pain.  On Wednesday 2/3 I decided to go urgent care.  From there I was referred for an ultra sound a few hours after.  After the ultra sound I was contacted by my doctor, letting me know that the results showed I had a blood clot on my left leg.  I was put on Eliquis medicine right away.  On 2/5 I was able to physically see my doctor who told me that this was caused by the second dose of the moderne vaccine that I took on 1/26.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

                                                Patient states he had a typical reaction the day of the vaccine (low fever, chills, aches, injection site pain) and when to bed earlier than usual because he was tired.  He didn&#39;t sleep well, and this morning his sleep app indicated his heart rate during the night was between 100-110.  After noticing his heart rate was between 130-140, he called the clinic and was told to go to the ER.  Hospital ER administered several tests and did blood work. The MD&#39;s determined his heart was fine and it is likely vaccine related.  He is home again and is feeling better (no chills, etc.) and his resting heart rate is now in the low-90&#39;s.

                                                I experienced two separate adverse reactions.   First adverse reaction occurred on 2/11/21 at 5:00 am (after receiving my second shot of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine).  I experienced tachycardia with an approximate heart rate of 175 bp for approximately 30 minutes.  I was able to lower my heart rate down with 25 mg of quick release metoprolol.   Second adverse reaction started on 2/21/21.  I developed shingles on my lower left side.  It appears the shingles originated from my L1 dermatome.  At the current time 2/10/21 I am still recovering from my shingles.

I woke up the next day to go to my job and as I was standing at my closet to grab a shirt I felt like I was going to pass out. everything went black. The next thing I knew I was laying on the floor with a shirt in my hand but don&#39;t remember how I got on the floor or if I even fell.  I asked my Girlfriend if she had heard me fall, She said no. I walked into the bedroom and layed back down on the bed still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. after what felt like a few minutes, I began Heaving like I was going to throw up but I felt like it was a dream and was very slow to react until my girlfriend told me to run to the bathroom. the whole time I was coughing up a foam.

I want to add that I was not nervous about the vaccination. I did not have any fear or anxiety about the shot.

                                                On my first dose vaccine, 01-22-2021, I went to bed at 9:00pm.  On 01-23-2021 in the next morning I woke up with heart racing with chest pressure, felt dizzy with SOB. I called an ambulance and they performed an EKG which was normal. I went to the hospital and they did triponine values, EKG and I was released after 24 hours of monitoring. About five days later I went to see my PCP for a physical I had scheduled. He performed another EKG and this time it looked abnormal, showed I had gone into cardiac arrest and other tests, such as stress test, reactive blockages test and heart test were also performed.  I had no blockage nor heart attack. I then drove home and since then I have been going to doctor&#39;s appointments. I have also scheduled a second dose of Moderna vaccine in three to four weeks.

                                                Two nights in a row, 04/07 and 04/08, woke up with rapid heart rate (fluctuating from 85-110 bpm) and felt dizzy, fatigued, feverish, sweaty, shaky and about to pass out. Could have been hyperventilating in sleep because of rapid heart rate. Required about 2 hours of attention to reading, yoga and relaxation to get to sleep. On morning of 04/08, heart rate was still high (78-95) for resting, which is usually in the 50s or 60s. GI disturbance led to frequent bowel movements and the whole condition resulted in malaise and feeling of impending doom. A feedback from acute anxiety as a result of symptoms could be involved. Also involved is the diphenhydramine I took at 9 pm on 04/07 to treat hay fever and acute insomnia. Night if 04/08 was more manageable. But it interrupted sleep with strong disturbances that felt like spasms in prefrontal cortex coming out of sleep. More likely it was movement in sinus congestion that triggered a startle response while exhausted from work. It was bad timing to have the shot during a very busy work week.

                                                On the evening of Friday 4/2/2021 around 9:30 PM, I was experiencing what felt like heartburn. It got better before I went to bed. At around 9:00 AM on Saturday 4/3/2021, I was awakened by intense pain and pressure that felt like the worst heartburn I&#39;d ever experienced. After OTC heartburn treatments didn&#39;t help, at around 11:00 AM I went to the local ER where I was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack. After being given some baby aspirin and a nitro tablet, I started feeling better and was airlifted immediately to a nearby cardiology unit at another hospital. A heart catheterization and EKGs determined that I had not had a heart attack, but instead had takotsubo cardiomyopathy. I was admitted into the cardiac ICU overnight for observation, transferred to a non-critical room the next day (4/4/2021), and released on Monday 4/5/2021.

                                                Patient by 5/8/21 was experiencing fever to 103, lower back pain, palpitaitons, headache, nausea, left arm and neck pain and dizziness.  He was taking Advil and Tylenol to assist with symptom managment.  Left arm and neck pain persisted.  On the morning of 5/11/21 he awoke with central chest tightness, left arm/shoulder/neck achiness, nausea and headache. During ride to hospital, he had palpitations for 30 minutes.  He arrived at  Medical Center where he was found to have a positive troponin I of 4.2 (ULN of &lt;0.045).  Echo done at that time showed EF of 59% with basal inferior, anterolateral hyokinesia, basal inferolateral hyokinesia, mid inferolateral hyokinesia, diastolic LV function normal function for age and trace mitral regurgitation.  ECG showed non diagnostic ST elevations in leads II, III, AVF.  The patient was transferred to another Medical Center  for urgent cardiac cath based on resting chest, arm and neck pain, positive troponin and wall motion abnormalities seen on echo.  Cardiac cath found normal coronary arteries that were free of disease.  Troponin I at this medical center was positive 0.31 and 0.39.  Further testing ordered is a cardiac MRI to assess for possible acute myocarditis.

Had xray but nothing was broken. thought he had sprained ankle.  Given prednisone.  Ankle continued to be swollen for following days so we followed up with family dr. on 3-22  who sent him for ultrasound which showed an extensive blood clot - DVT.   Sent to emergency room.  Put on blood thinner shots for a week and sent to doctor on 3-24.  He did many blood tests.  He started eliquis on 3-30.  Saw doctor again on 4-13.  His blood tests had shown he has Factor 5--Leiden.  On May 11 we saw doctor again.  Remain on Eliquis.  Another ultrasound and more bloodtests show clot is chronic, but blood thinner is doing its job.  No active clotting.

                                                ANAPHYLAXIS: Pt received his second Moderna COVID19 shot on 12Apr2021 at approximately 2:30pm. He waited the required 20 minutes to check for any adverse reaction and then left the facility to drive home. On his drive home, at approximately 3:30pm, he started feeling light headed and lost consciousness, striking a telephone pole. He was gasping and struggling to breathe, so the ambulance treated him with oxygen. When he arrived at the ER , the doctor assessed his condition and confirmed that he was experiencing an anaphylactic reaction related to the COVID vaccine and treated him with an epinephrine injection, steroids, benadryl, and nebulized albuterol.to open his airways. He remained at the ER for ~ 6 hours for observation until his blood oxygen levels increased and he was stable to be released. The car accident resulted in PT suffering a fractured sternum as confirmed via Chest CT Scan by his primary doctor. PT has no history of any allergic reaction to any medication or vaccine. Although he does have well-regulated asthma, this incident was not characteristic of any asthma-related reaction he has ever experienced.

                                                About 45 mins after getting the shot. I experienced a tightening of the face with hives.  It felt like the last time I got a bee sting and found out I was allergic to bees.  My neck musscles where tight but it was not enough for me to take my epi pen  I  slepped until 5-19. only awake for about 6 hours a day. When I normally sleep that much.  Then  on 5-19.  Around noon time I woke up and was able to stay awake. I was experiencing fast heart rates from time to time. Still very tired.  I was drinking about 32 ounces of water an hour.  Then on friday 5-21. The heart issues where very severe and I went to the Emergency room.  They gave me an iv bag of fluid and I felt better but still had minnor heart fast rates from time to time.  I still felt off. and had a follow up with my primary dr.  During the visit he observed high blood preasure of around 144/90.  Currently i am observation phase and purchased a blood pressure monitor. According to the over the counter blood pressure monitor .   I have been as high as 152/106  and slowly over time it has gone down to as low as 79/58. With more of an average currently holding around 122/80. The monitor has detected two irregular hearbeats with bp stat(138/82, 82bp anb 79/58, and bp 76. I will continue to monitor and report these self monitoring finding to my primary DR on 7-6. I left a message today about updates.

                                                About 2 weeks after getting my second vaccination, I started to have mild but then severe heart palpitations. I thought it was the anxiety meds I was on, and adjusted the dosage but it wasn&#39;t helping. I stopped taking them. After about a month I started gradually feeling better. Palpitations would worsen if I worked out and or stood up too fast. Today my PCP and I scheduled for me to see a Cardiologist at the end of June. My PCP did some tests that included an EKG after first 6 weeks which was normal. She also did a troponin test, which was also normal. A CRP and Sed rate which were also normal. I still struggle with heart palpitations to this day.

D-dimer blood test revealed a range 400 times the appropriate range.  Number exceeded the scale.  The number of clots on imaging were so numerous, the doctor that read the report said they would not even count them.   Was treated on heparin IV and placed in cardiac ICU, prescribed Eliquis to thin blood allowing the body to not create additional clots. In process of establishing a medical team to treat.

                                                Felt lethargic (aprox. 1 hour after shot) went home fell asleep for about 2 hours and woke up severe pain in chest and tightening of chest and airway and could only get about half at most of a full breath of air every breath. Could only get sufficient O2 it seemed when lying on back and laying down on my side. Was every bit of all my energy to just take a shower and nearly blacked out with heart racing as I tried to breath in the shower but steam in air was too much to breathe.  Lasted for 4 days that way.  I still feel like I am constantly winded and I as of today have only regained about half the lung capacity I had prior to incident, and that is just over 1 month mark. I also now have been getting these bad facial breakouts particularly on and around my nose and forehead /;eyes area. I never ever had any acne issues to speak of prior, even as a teen and during puberty. Never had any acne ever and now its bad breakouts some appear to may even leave ling term scarring in certain spots. My day to day diet and normal habits have not been added to or altered in any way either. My heart feels like it beats twice as fast and twice as hard now and I am always short of breath now too. I do not have a family doctor to go and see and I was afraid to call for an e.m.t. or go to the e.r. at the early onset of it all. I truly hought I was a gonner a couple of times though throughout the first 4 days.

I got an xray and the doctor at the City Md refused to believe me that this was related to vaccine and my lung wound from a previous surgery that increases inflammation as I am now experiencing.  I am asking to please help me get a cooling airc conditioner in my kitchen/ bathroom area as it is also where I will be teaching virtually hybrid schedule and only feel relieved in cool air. My school that I teach at is in some rooms adding daily heat exhaustion and  I would greatly like if possible any help or treatment and or rehabiliation phyical therapy and also reexamining the area where my origial surgery was and how this can be dangerous  for people taking the vaccine.

                                                10 minutes after vaccination, I was waiting in my car per instructions and began to feel extremely light headed and dizzy/faint.  I began to sweat a little and have minor tachycardia.  I never went back into the clinic but instead leaned the seat of my car back and those symptoms went away after about 30 minutes.  I never experienced any symptoms after that.

                                                Near vasovagal syncope 5 days after 2nd dose. 5 days after my second COVID vaccine, I was outside in snowy, cold weather about a mile from my car. I had stopped moving to rearrange some items. While stopped, I started to feel lightheaded, develop tunnel vision, and feel faint, almost to the point of blacking out. I put my head down and legs up and felt somewhat better. I then attempted to return to my car. I could go 100-200 yards at a stretch, before having to purposefully fall down and elevate my legs. I traveled the mile back to my car like this (slowly). I could not check my pulse because my hands were too cold; my respiration rate was elevated. At the car, I drank fluids and warmed up and began to recover enough to get home.

Other symptoms resolved but not startle symptoms and pt now also having cough and nasal congestion. Normal exam other than congestion. EKG NSR w/ no feeling of the startle while here and no CP or SOB. CXR normal. Full lab eval also normal including neg CRP, Trop, BNP, and D dimer. CBC and CMP also normal. TSH mildly elevated but normal T4 so likely c/w pt&#39;s prior minor thyroid abn but unlikely to be source of current symptoms. Given normal exam and w/u do not feel myocarditis, pericarditis, or clots or other significant process associated w/ current symptoms. Pt retested for COVID since not fully immune prior to symptom onset.

                                                Ive always had a resting heart rate in the upper 70?s innthe past years until the vaccine.  I have noticed that its been staying in upper 90?s  to 103 most of the time especially when I stand up or simply walk across the room.  I didn?t realize what was going on for sure for two or three days.  This on top of being winded easily.

We propped his feet up and gave supportive care such as blanket and ice packs.  Patients heart rate went back to normal (75-80 bpm) after 10 minutes.  However, 35 minutes post vaccination, pt started having chills and shakes.  Gave blanket and monitored patient for 45 min after vaccination.  Pt declined 911.  Wife took patient home 50 min past vaccination stating she felt he was stable and they would monitor at home.

                                                I experienced what I would describe as a cardiac event. My heart started racing out of no where. I have an activity tracking device and it was pacing me at 184 bbm for thirty minutes then a subsidence to 120 bbm for the next couple hours. By the evening my heart rate had decreased to the 70 - 80 ish range.  Sleep time and the following morning it was what I would consider normal. This event made me dizzy and my skin paled. I was also very tired. It was as if I had done an intense cardio workout with no warm up. 0 to max. I didn&#39;t seek medical attention but did consider it.

                                                Experience chest pain on right side of chest near armpit which spread across chest one week after the first vaccine shot given on January 25, 2021.  Pain was going away before the second shot. Received second shot on February 22, 2021 and had the chest pain return, extreme fatigue, headaches, rash at injection site and all over back, achy muscles mainly in upper body, dizzy spells, nausea, and abdominal pain. All these symptoms (minus nausea) continued for three weeks and some are still present (fatigue, chest pain and periodic headaches) after six weeks.   I was tested for antibodies and the results came back greater than 400, which is the max limit for the test.  The doctor has never seen results that high and we have no idea how high my antibodies actually are.   Since my symptoms seem to be slightly improving, the doctor did not recommend further treatment.  However, I am concerned as to any possible danger of antibody levels this high.

About 5 minutes down the road started having stabbing back pain shooting from the middle of the back up and down the spine.  Chest feels like someone bear hugging hard from the back.  Chest tingle and neck pain.  This has been for the day.  I turned around and went home crying because I was and am scared.  Still hurts now and it&#39;s 9pm.  No insurance and the hospital already has me in collections so I can&#39;t go.

No issues with breathing (even while wearing a mask).  Reaction started with blurred vision while reading (during the waiting period at the vaccination clinic). Started within 10 minutes of receiving vaccine.  Then the throat heaviness started, nose became numb, and lips were somewhat numb.  It occurred in waves, with a few minutes of symptoms, then a mild relief of symptoms (but not total relief), then symptoms returned. This continued for 30-45 minutes.   Received water and 2 Benadryl at the vaccination clinic from RN. Benadryl didn&#39;t seem to have any impact on symptoms.

Evaluation was positive for bilateral DVT and pulmonary embolism     Bilateral PE, infarction, bilateral DVTs -No obvious precipitating factors -patient underwent first COVID 19 vaccine injection, is actually due for second shot.  Unclear if this is contributed, recommended to hold on getting second dose and discuss this with PCP.  -Also follow-up with PCP for appropriate cancer screening -patient was treated with therapeutic subcutaneous Lovenox, remained hemodynamically stable and is feeling better today.  Upon discharge we&#39;ll prescribe Elocon is 10 mg b.i.d. for another 5 days followed by 5 mg b.i.d. maintenance dose.  He will be provided with coupon for 1 month supply, he was recommended to follow-up with PCP for further recommendations.  He will probably need anticoagulation for at least 6 months or longer depending on further course. -Echocardiogram showed ejection fraction 50-55%, Mild mitral valve prolapse no evidence of RV strain.      Hemoptysis  -Most likely was related to PE and infarction -resolved.   Pleuritic chest pain, h/o Afib -Most likely pain was secondary to PE, improved -Continue Cardizem as prior to admission -Stop aspirin since patient will be on anticoagulation therapy   History of opioid dependence, alcohol abuse Continue suboxone     Ongoing smoking smoking cessation was advised   Disposition: Routine Discharge Home   CONSULTS: Consults Ordered during this Encounter Procedures ?

I was out for a minute or two and when I was conscious again my vision was blurry and I felt very drunk for the next 45mins - hour. I also felt like I could taste the chemicals from the vaccine when I became conscious again.  The drunk/vertigo feeling subsided slowly over time but I was given a Benadryl from the pharmacist so I?m not sure when the dizziness stopped but I definitely could not drive home. My fainting was not due to any anxiety due to having a shot or anything, I was perfectly fine for approx 10-15 mins after the vaccine then I felt a cold feeling coming on from my right shoulder then up my neck then I got foggy and dizzy and passed out

                                                After the vaccination, the patient was asked to wait at the Waiting Area for at least a few minutes. He was with his father that time and they were seated at the Waiting Area. After a few minutes, the father saw the patient looking somewhat pale and he asked if he is doing okay and he seemed to become unconscious for a brief moment then he started shaking for a few seconds. While this happened, pharmacy called 911 and attended to the patient. His color came back after maybe 5 to 10 minutes, but still had sweats on his forehead. His palms were warm the whole time, no clamminess. 911 came and they attended to the patient and took him.

I checked my temperature &amp; only once was the temperature above 100F.   I did have some chest pain at times as well.   I drank mint tea, took tylenol at regular intervals &amp; used icy hot on the sore back and neck.    Following morning I&#39;m feeling a little better but still quite a bit of soreness but as of 7 am , the chills/hots have subsided.  I did pee a lot over night; at one point I went to the bathroom about 5-6 times within an hour to 90 minutes.

Vision was dark and I spent most of the time concentrating on breathing.  I did not lose consciousness or pass out at any time.   I was with my wife and children so they were able to give me the timeline.  My wife noted I started sweating after about 5 minutes.  The symptoms peaked at about 10 minutes and faded slowly after that.  Because I felt like the worst of the event had passed we did not report the event at the time.  When we got home I laid down for about an hour.  My shoulder started hurting about this time as well.  I feel I was recovered from the initial symptoms within 2 days.  My shoulder was in pain for about 3 days, with the first two days being much worse than the third.

Recognizing symptoms of a heart attack, the patient presented to the emergency room at 5:30am.  ECG normal, Troponin at 2.1 at presentation, continued to increase to 4.6 prior to being taken to Cath Lab.  Coronary angiography showed no occlusion; patient admitted to telemetry unit for continued monitoring; discharged following day with order for cardiac MRI.  Outpatient cardiac MRI conducted 5/5/21 revealed myocarditis.  Treatment with beta blockers (Metopolol Succinate 25MG QID) and anti-inflamatory (indomethacin 25MG TID) with direction to avoid exercise.

                                                Initially, the patient had dizziness, lightheadedness and a syncopal episode within 5 minutes of the vaccine. He returned to normal fairly quickly and went home by report. He presented to the ER shortly after with palpitations and shortness of breath and required a dose of IM epinephrine. Patient since had intermittent fatigue, dizziness, blurred and vision changes as well as tinnitus. On May 31, 2021, patient presented to the ER with headache, lethargy, weakness, diaphoresis and dizziness. Additionally, noted to have slurred speech by his wife. MRI of the brain done at 4 am on 5/31/21 showed  the following  &#34;1. Acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts are seen with a right posterior 4.3  mm focus a left middle cerebellar peduncle 3.2 mm focus and a left superior cerebellar 7.9 mm linear focus. 2. Occlusion of the left vertebral artery extending into the basilar artery with reconstitution of the basilar artery via bilateral posterior communicating arteries. Findings are concerning for acute dissection occlusion. Consider further evaluation with MRA head and neck. 3. Question subtle area of restricted diffusion seen within the left dorsal medulla better appreciated on the maps measuring approximately 4.9 mm. Left lateral pontine 7.3 mm focus of restricted diffusion versus  artifact. These infarcts are not definite and could be artifactual asymmetry.&#39;. He required admission, heparin drip and neurology consult at that time, as well as permissive hypertension. shortly after 1 pm on May 31, he developed chest pain with ischemic changes on EKG requiring cardiology consult with possible intervention, though this was being coordinated with interventional neurology, as he also required basilar angiogram for his MRI findings. as cardiology and interventional neurology were coordinating taking patient for intervention, he became further unresponsive, though maintained his pulse, and required intubation and transfer to ICU, as well as repeat CT of the head to evaluate for continued thrombosis of his basilar system.

                                                Patient  developed episode of diarrhea shortly after 1st shot in series,  this was followed by  lower extremity swelling and mild dyspnea on exertion, that quickly exacerbated after the 2nd shot on 5/15/2021,  that resulted in severe dyspnea on exertion, severe lower extremity swelling with approximately 25 lb weight gain, orthopnea and hemoptysis. Patient reported temperatures of 99.2 F to 99.8 F.   Outside CT chest abdomen pelvis angiogram showed moderate to large acute segmental/subsegmental pulmonary emboli with trace right heart strain and right lower lobe pulmonary infarction, moderate right pleural effusion, acute splenic vein thrombosis with extension to the proximal portal vein and associated splenic infarcts, bilateral renal infarcts, and evidence of portal hypertension. He was transferred to the Hospital for further management. Upon presentation here he was tachycardic but with stable blood pressures and requiring up to 5 L by nasal cannula. Initial laboratory studies were notable for WBC 21.0, INR 1.8, D-dimer 11653, NT pro-BNP 17684, troponins 603 to 579 to 574, CRP 127. He was started on a heparin infusion. He was admitted to the MICU for further management.   Bedside ultrasound demonstrated reduced biventricular contractility. He was given two doses of 40 mg intravenous furosemide with about 3.5 L of urine output since admission (net negative 3.1 L). His oxygen was weaned to 1 L by nasal cannula. Lower extremity venous and arterial Dopplers were negative.  Subsequent imaging  demonstrated a transperineal inferior infarct with akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior and inferior lateral walls with apical and mid ventricle akinesis secondary to a complete occluded RCA.  moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade noted.  Upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated acute DVT in the lower right IJ, innominate, subclavian and proximal axillary veins.  MRI  venogram was negative for clots, but multiple acute and subacute enhancing infarcts within all 3 vasculature distributions consistent with embolic etiology were noted.  TTE showed of mural thrombus along the septal and inferior walls of the LV apex,  severely enlarged left ventricle with EF of 20%, severe hypokinesis.    Patient was aggressively IV diuresis, with improvement in respiratory status.  Maintained on  high-intensity heparin for pulmonary emboli, DVT, and diffuse arterial and venous thrombosis.  He was bridged to warfarin.  Patient was  prescribed LifeVest for primary prevention. Started on beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor given EF.     Patient planning on discharge 6/5-6/07, outcome pending.

                                                I developed a DVT in my lower left leg, which I noticed from the swelling, warmth and pain. Then, a few days later, on a Sunday so my Dr&#39;s office was closed, I started having extreme difficulty in my breathing. I went to the ER and, after having multiple testing, was diagnosed with the DVT and a PE in each lung (almost to the point of full blockage). I was kept in the hospital overnight so they could monitor my breathing to be sure I wasn&#39;t stopping breathing throughout the night. I&#39;m now on blood thinners for life.

                                                I experienced tachycardia, almost lost consciousness in the early morning of 1/13/21. I had to call 911. When EMT&#39;s arrived about 10 minutes, my heart rate went down to 100bpm. I decided not to go to hospital and just continue observation. I still have a feeling of increased nervousness and palpitation in my chest today.

                                                Vaccine was administered to patient in his room at 12:50pm.  After the patient finished his lunch in his room he was wheeled out to the nursing station for observation.  at 1:30pm the nurse wheeled patient into our working/set up area and stated that patient is having a vaccine reaction.  I observed that his lips were noticeably swollen.  I asked patient to stick out his tongue, it also was noticeably swollen.  Only the tip of his tongue extended about 1/2 inch past his lips.  I administered 0.3mg of Epinephrine via and epi-pen into his right thigh and instructed the nursing staff to call 911.  Patient improved markedly over the next 10 minutes when Fire Department EMT&#39;s arrived.  Nursing staff monitored his  blood pressure, heart rate and pulse  and oxygen sat.  heart rate was elevated somewhat likely due to epi , BP was 121/73, pulse steady and ox sat good.  Fire Department transported patient to a nearby ER for further evaluation and treatment if necessary.

The staff member monitoring saw me going to the floor and called the head doctor over to help.  They called EMT&#39;s.  I was laid onto the floor on my back and legs up onto a chair.  The staff took my blood pressure which was low.  Approximately, 2 minutes later, they took my blood pressure and it went back up to a more normal level.  The EMT&#39;s helped me up and took my blood sugar levels and pulse oxygen levels which seemed normal.  I was able to feel better, but the color of my skin was yellowish and pale.  The EMT&#39;s suggested that I talk with my doctor before getting another vaccine and talk about my symptoms.

                                                At 12:30  i was lying in bed and started getting more and more restless.  I could feel something happening with my body on the inside like a storm.  I got up to use the bathroom and had a syncopal episode about halfway to bathroom. Fell and i came to immediately when my name was called.  I got back into bed.  My lips were white.  I still felt lightheaded but could breathe freely and easily.  There was no noticeable swelling impairing my breathing.  Initially i could not get a reading on my pulse oximeter.  After a few minutes it worked and by then i was at 95%. I suspect the oxygen was quite low prior to that.  For the next day i had a fever and farigue.  The day after that I had some lingering fatigue but no fever.  Right now I am not planning to get the second shot in the series.

Shortly thereafter ambulance arrived on scene at which time it was determined that I would be transported to the hospital. Once there, a series of tests were conducted, one of which was a D-Dimer blood test to rule out blood clots. That resulted in an elevated count to which a CT scan was ordered.   The result of the CT scan revealed that I had 2 Pulmonary Embolisms, one in the upper lobe of my right lung and one in the middle lobe of my right lung.   Due to me being what the doctors said was a healthy 45 year old with no underlying conditions or signs of DVT (deep vein thrombosis) they deemed me low risk at that time and advised I was at low risk of dying in the next 30days. However, they advised that at any time, the clot could possibly become dislodged and cause worse problems, possibly death if time is not given to the body to dissolve the clots. Ultimately it was determined that I be discharged and prescribed blood thinning medications to help thin the blood to prevent further clotting should I have a clotting issue (undetermined at this time).

I got dizzy and felt weak at points. I went to the Doctor and it was also determined that I was wheezing when he checked my lungs. He prescribed me a 30 day usage of the Albuterol Sulfate pump to help with the wheezing 3x a day.I saw the doctor January 23rd.3 days after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.

Pharmacist and another associate helped patient up who was conscious. He asked what happened and if he were standing.  He shared that everything went pitch black.  He was placed on chair; pharmacist asked if he wouldl like to lie down and he declined. He stated he had felt nervous and scared about imz before his appointment. Patient did cut his lip in fall and was given napkins for bleeding and a cold compress for face and neck. Patient waited with us for 2 hours. His BP was 154-74 and pulse of 54 ; patient stated he was a runner with low pulse. Patient arranged for a ride from family member since he lived far and was not sure about driving. I recommend that he place a call in with his provider.

                                                I have had a low grade fever (99.5)  for a week now.  I have had insomnia since the night of the injection.  EVERY night I wake up hot 3 hours after I went to sleep.  I have never gotten the chills, only hot.   I usually need to take a sleep aid to get back to sleep which is NOT normal for me.   Many times I wake up again 3 hours later even after the sleep aid hot.   My lack of sleep has really been hard on my daytime working and living at this point.  When I wake at night hot my temperature is usually 99.5, but has been a bit lower at times too.   I also feel that I have rapid heart rate at this time (when I try to fall back asleep)  and it seems as if my heart is beating harder than normal.  I also feel a buzzing in my head like I drank too much coffee type of feeling.  The first couple of days I felt tired and weak and a bit achy throughout the day.  The next few days after that I felt dizzy and light headed with a headache.  The first few days I also noticed slight muscle spasms throughout my arms and torso particularly when I laid down at night to go to bed and was still and relaxed.  I have been taking over the counter pain/fever pills usually for the headache.  I contacted my doctor and he said to give it a week.  It has been a week yesterday, but Dr is closed for weekends and Fridays.  I went to urgent care on Friday and they were not helpful (virtually).  They said give it 5 more days!!!!!   I am extremely tired of this and worried at how long it has been.  NOBODY I know with the first shot has had this reaction.  My wife is nervous as well and we would really like to hear something that may ease our minds at this point.  Some explanation as to why my body may be reacting this way, or if any others have had this same situation.

                                                After receiving my shot, I waited the half an hour. I felt a pinch in my head and tightness in shoulders and neck. Once I reached the parking lot I was belching ridiculously and started feeling like vomiting. Than my chest hurt.  Went back to the clinic and said I don&#39;t feel right.  They had me stand in line and wait to be re-admitted.  The nurse starting taking blood pressure and offered me water I could not swallow the tiniest amount.  My neck felt like I was being chocked. My fingers on my left arm started tingling and arm was getting slightly red and arm felt heavy. The nurse said my symptoms were happening internally.  The doctor had me remove my mask and looked at the back of my mouth. Than used a stethoscope on my chest and the back.  Asked  if I had asthma , said no. He Than requested epinephrine shot and a steroid. With in a few seconds I started feeling like I could breathe. He prescribed an epinephrine pen incase I had another episode. Two day later I had another visit online with doctor from about redness on left and right arm. Having another allergic reaction and possible site infection. Now I&#39;m taking 10 days antibiotics and allergy medicine.

I was seated at the time, waiting the 15 minutes for observation after the shot, symptoms happened about 10 minutes into the waiting period.  I was given some cold water right away, over the next 10 minutes my vision started coming back and I stopped sweating. Was told I looked flush when they first came over but was looking much better after another 10 mins.   I stayed an additional 30 minutes for observation after the event and had friends come take me home and get my car. I&#39;m still feeling very slightly light headed and somewhat tired 2 days later, but otherwise feeling great.

                                                Body aches in left shoulder, overnight nausea.  These adverse reactions are not so concerning because I have heard how commonly these are experienced. What is most concerning is that I woke up at 3:30 AM feeling nauseous and made my way to the bathroom as a result. At some point, once entering the bathroom, I lost consciousness and when regaining consciousness saw that I had pulled the entire toilet off the floor, cracking the large reservoir and breaking the lid into several pieces. Water was spraying and leaking. Fortunately, I did not suffer a bruise or cut. I am, however, concerned whether I should expect to lose consciousness again.

                                                A spontaneous report was received from a Consumer concerning himself, a 45-years-old male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced uncontrollable extreme abdominal pain/abdominal pain, cold sweats/cold sweat and passed out/loss of consciousness. The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported. On 14 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot batch: 013L20A) in his left upper arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 15 Jan 2021, the patient experienced uncontrollable extreme abdominal pain, and passed out. He also had cold sweats.   Lab data was not provided.  No treatment was taken, just rehydrated.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of events -uncontrollable extreme abdominal pain, cold sweat  and passed out so badly was considered resolved within 24 hours on 16 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

This was most likely due to an adverse reaction to the prescriptions that were prescribed to him post surgery.   He was taken to the ER and admitted to the hospital for 2 days.  All tests - other than blood pressure of 80/38 on a man with high blood pressure, were normal.

                                                I started coughing up specs of blood out of the blue.  Called doctor and they said to watch it.  Later that night I started coughing up Tablespoons of fresh blood that wouldn&#39;t go away.  Took ambulance to ER.  CAT Scan showed an inflammation in lung and showed source of bleeding.  They diagnosed me with pneumonia though I had no other symptoms (no fever or elevated white count, cough, or anything).  Gave me IV antibiotics and sent me home with more antibiotics.   Following up with a GP next week and asking to see a pulmonary specialist.

In the evening the same day I started running temperature 101F that last 3 days non stop. I started experiencing severe chills, could not stop at times shaking! I was hot and cold every so often. I started experiencing same evening severe body ache which was constant and felt like I was squeezed by some machine. I could not sleep, I felt just terrible,  couldn&#39;t find comfortable position. My heart beat resting was 110 per minute and it stayed like that first night. My normal resting pulse is 60-70 bps. I did not have headaches or nausea. At night everything felt worse. After 3 nights temperature subsided but I was exhausted and my temperature dropped 95.9F my normal temperature is 97.88F. ( 36.6C) .

                                                Soon after injection I developed soreness at injection site, and about an hour later it travelled down my arm and to my hand, with also arm stiffness.  On Monday, 4/12/2021 at 12:15am (about 6 hours after injection) I developed chills and body aches.  Throughout the night I also developed a headache, muscle aches, nausea and started sweating.  At 9am (4/12/2021) when I woke up, all the symptoms continued (chills, body aches, muscle aches, arm soreness and stiffness, headache, nausea) and also felt extreme tiredness.  My temperature at 9:15am was 100.4 degrees F.  I basically stayed in bed and slept most of the day.  I got up at 2:30pm to get something to eat and had a temperature of 101 degrees F.  After eating, which made me feel even more nauseous, I went back to bed and continued to sleep.  I woke up at 7:30pm to feed the cats.  I felt the same as I did at 2:30pm--listed above--and was up and about for 20 minutes.  I started to prepare a quick meal and fainted twice (around 8pm) within a minute from each other.  The first time I fell to my knees and the second time I felt onto my back.  I was unconscious for only a few seconds each time.  I went into bed after and placed an ice pack on my forehead.  I took my temperature after the ice pack at 8:15am and my temperature was 101.4 degrees F.   I ate soup around 8:45am and took Tylenol (1000mg) at 9:30am.  I went back to bed and slept all through the night.  This morning (4/13/2021--2 days after injection) I feel much better--only have some slight chills and arm soreness.  My temperature at 9:15am (4/13/21) was 95.7 degrees F.

Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient notified pharmacy staff that he felt dizzy and nauseous. The patient was given cold compresses for his neck and wrists. After a few minutes the patient said the dizziness went away but he still felt nauseous. He sat on the floor with his feet elevated for 10 minutes then said he felt better and wanted to go to the bathroom. Upon return from the bathroom he said he vomited a small amount and felt better. We had the patient wait another 10 minutes in the pharmacy area before the patient left to go home.

After 5 more minutes, but then, he said he feels chest tightness on his right side.  He got his shot on his right arm.  I told him it is probably not an allergic rxn since he has no swelling/rash, no problem with breathing.  Most likely he is feeling something on his right side because he got the shot on his right arm.

                                                For my 2nd dose vaccine, the first night I experienced seizures and was trembling a lot; also developed headaches and fatigue. I also displayed symptoms of dizziness and blacked out. I have trouble breathing and I am now diabetic. I have congestive heart failure. I cannot go outside to the heat because I black out. I am on an albuterol treatment due to coughing spasms. My arms also get stiff, and I feel when I black out, I am out for a couple of minutes. They performed lab work, EKG, stress test and I am following up with a cardiologist. My blood pressure went up to 210/178. I have to follow up with my cardiologist in two months to monitor my heart. For my 1st dose vaccine, I had two seizures the same night. I could not breathe and gurgled. I went to see my PCP who placed me on high blood pressure medications. I lost 67 pounds of fluid in my chest. I swelled up so bad that I could not put on my shoes. I did not have these problems before receiving the MODERNA vaccine, dose 1 and dose 2. I also got lab work down and found out I had type II diabetes.

I called patient back a few hours later and patient said he felt better and the chest pain went away. He later noted that it could have been his anxiety causing the pain. Patient had been taking ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and drink a lot of water for treatment. Patient did not feel is was necessary to see the doctor or emergency department.

With the panic attacks, I also experience extreme dizziness, tingling throughout my body and significant spikes in blood pressure.  It is now 71 days after my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccination and I am still experiencing panic attacks, dizziness, rapid heart rate, and body tingling.  The episodes are intermittent.  Some days I am completely incapacitated and can&#39;t leave my bed which means I am out of work on those days.  Some days, I am completely fine and can make it through the day.  I am being treated by my doctor with Celexa which is an anxiety medication.  So far, the medication isn&#39;t working.  I had no indication of anxiety or panic attacks prior to getting the vaccination.

I thought it might have been what I ate for lunch after the shot but I started to have diarrhea and vomiting. While I was in the bathroom experiencing both I passed out and hit my head on the floor. My wife called 911 and was checked by the responding paramedics; my vitals were good and I did not feel the need to be transported to the hospital. Throughout the night I had chills and continued to throw up and experience diarrhea.

                                                I received my 2nd dose of the moderna vaccine on 1/24/21. On 1/25/21 at approx 2am I had tremmors, feeling of intense cold, headache, body pain, fatigue. That lasted until approx 0300am 1/26/21. I slept most of the day 1/25 except for taking kid to school and monitoring another at home. I had read the side effects and I felt as though things were subsiding  on 1/26 but I was still weak with body pain. I was not 100%. I was home alone with 2 kids (wife out of town). 1/25 I had a cough and was short of breath but didn&#39;t think much of it. The cough persisted. On 1/27/21 I was still short of breath. I went to a nearby fire station and had them put me on a lifepack. I was in atrial fibrillation. I could not do anything because my wife wasn&#39;t due back until 3pm. At 3PM she walked in and I walked out and drove myself to Hospital. I was diagnosed with A-Fib w/ RVR. I was in A-fib until I was cardioverted on 2/1/21 and was given a cryo-ablation.

                                                8 days after my first dose, 01/20/2021, around 9am, my eyes started to turn red, and teary and difficulty to look on computer screens and TV.  Thinking it might be a Conjunctivitis, assuming it was a windy week in my area, I did do some yard work. That night it started to build pressure, pain and headache.  I asked my spouse to buy me eyedrops., did used with no relief. I&#39;ve putting cold packs at the beginning, but it gives me more headache, I changed to warm compress, and had some relief.  For 4 days I suffered the same symptoms and discomfort, not until the 4th day (Friday) I can&#39;t take it anymore, I went to an urgent care, they check my V/S, BP is elevated, ranging from 140&#39;s/92&#39;s. They check my eye pressure, it was elevated.  The PA prescribed Tobramycin eyedrop(Tobrex) and recommend me to see an Ophthalmologist to do further evaluation.  The next day 5th day (Saturday) went to Dr., get evaluated both of my eyes had high pressure,

                                                Note:  I had a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March, 2020.  Approximately 12 hours after the second vaccine dose, I experienced intense soreness at the vaccination site (significantly greater than the first dose).  In the middle of the night I awoke with flu-like symptoms.  At 9am I took acetominophen  for fever, rigors, muscle aches.  This brought mild relief from approx. 9:45am to 11:15 am.  My condition continued to worsen through the early afternoon with rigors and significant generalized muscle aches.  I experienced tachycardia (90-105 bpm vs normal of ~70bpm),  SOB,  and starting measuring pulse oximetry which read from 89%-94% (my usual does not go below 97%).  This persisted until approximately 8pm with no improvement.  I took 40 mg prednisone, 600 mg ibuprofen and within 3 hours was starting to have symptom resolution. I am a physician and up to date on all my vaccinations.  I have never had anything approaching this type of response.  I don&#39;t know if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection  creates a situation were the very potent mRNA vaccine triggers a large immunologic recall response.  I wanted to get this noted as there may be some reason to alter the vaccine schedule for prior SARS-CoV-2 infections

I started to get dizzy and was sweating.  Called over the Fire Dept personnel who were administering the injections and they helped me (fluids, ECG, etc.).  During this time they stated that my blood pressure dropped to the low 40&#39;s (not sure the exact number) and my heart rate as well.  My complexion was pale to them and sweating a lot.  After administering IV fluids a few minutes later my BP and HR started to rise.  My SpO2 was good.  Transported to ER for evaluation and labwork.

I also had a metallic taste.   3.  Fortunately, the chills, body aches, and fatigue went away the second day.  However, I continued to have the metallic taste for days. 4.  Also, starting the third day and I still have a cough and tightness in my lungs.  I went into a doctor at urgent care four days after the second dose (due to a concern about the cough and tightness in my lungs).  All of my vitals were normal and they attributed to side effects from the vaccine.  Also, they gave me an inhaler. 5.  The inhaler has been somewhat helpful, but I had a consistent cough as well as  some tightness in my lungs for two weeks after the second dose.  On unusually stressful days, it was even worse. 6.   The cough has improved, but I still have it occasionally throughout the day as well as the tightness in my lungs.   7.  Finally, I continue to have the metallic taste.

                                                On 4/10/21 around 2:30 pm I gave the patient his first Moderna COVID vaccine and had him sit in the observation area for the standard 15 minutes. Around 2:35 he and his family notified me that he was feeling lightheaded/faint and nauseous; he also appeared pale and diaphoretic. It seemed to be a vasovagal reaction until he said he was starting to have trouble breathing so I called 911 and got the Epipen/emergency kit ready, and monitored vitals. Then his breathing trouble resolved without needing to administer medication. EMS arrived at 2:39 pm and confirmed his HR/BP/O2 sat were normal. EMS cleared the patient to go home with his family. The patient had never had a vaccine reaction or vasovagal reaction before.

It was 105/60. He claimed that was low for him. He said he feels that way when blood sugar gets low. Paramedics arrived and took BP again had come up to 130/90. We were in the process of taking his sugar when they came and did it. It was 139. Patient felt better on his own really with some candy and water. He decided not to go with paramedics. I called and checked on him this evening and he was fine.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

Then within 20-30 seconds I realized that my chest was heavy/pressure on my sternum, arms and torso went warm and sweaty, a bit light headed and had fast heart rate. I asked medical team for assistance. They took blood pressure/O2 levels and listen to my heart and lungs. Had epi pen ready, but never administered. Watched me like this for about hour and a half until my bp came back down to normal levels.

                                                Heart palpitations, pounding heart that feels irregular, at times. Felt nausea a couple of morning along with heart symptoms and a sensation of difficulty breathing. However, I am able to take a deep breath when feeling this way and am able to work out with no difficulty. The symptoms continue intermittently, but do not happen constantly. A Kardia Mobile device purchased and I was unable to detect irregular heart rhythms with it. I considered going to the doctor and possibly the emergency room to get it checked out, but decided against as the symptoms would stop. They still continue off and on to this day.

                                                The day after the shot I began having severe abdominal pain, muscle and nerve pain, and shortness of breath. The abdominal, muscle, and nerve pain began at around 10:00am. The shortness of breath began around 2:00-3:00 in the afternoon and lasted for 30-45 mins (longer than the 20mins listed in the attending ER physician&#39;s report), at which point my wife called for an ambulance and I was taken to the emergency room of Hospital. I was prescribed diphenhydrAMINE injection 25 mg, droperidoL injection 1.25 mg, ketorolac injection 15 mg, and another pain killer by the paramedics that I do not see listed in the record.   Although not to the same degree, I have continued to have gastrointestinal cramping since the second vaccination. This is a worsening of a condition (IBS) that I had previously, but which had mostly been in remission since beginning Mirtazapine in Fall 2019 subsequent to a heart attack on 8/7/19. I am meeting with my primary physician, Droctor, on 5/10/21 and contacted, my gastroenterologist, on 5/5/21.

He was treated initially with high-intensity heparin nomogram and converted on 5-5-21 to oral apixaban. He has done well with this therapy.  His risk factors for PE include immobility; however, the risk of a thrombotic event in quadriplegic patients should be that of the general population after the first year of disability, and he has been immobile for around 2.5 years. He has no known underlying malignancy, and his recent imaging of his chest and head are reassuring in this regard. The patient received his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 12-23-20 and 2-2-21 with vascular events having been reported as being more common following this immunization. Without a clear cause for his PE, this will be reported on VAERS.

The heart rate settled down within a few second, but the ringing persisted, and has continued.  Before the vaccine, the ringing was a very high pitched, constant tone, like the high pitched tone I used to hear on an airplane sometimes, but it was so quiet that I only noticed when I would wake up in the morning or at other random times when everything around me was very quiet.  Since the vaccine, however, it has become loud enough that it&#39;s impossible not to notice it constantly; not so loud that I can&#39;t hear other things around me or people talking, but definitely loud enough that it&#39;s unmistakably there and can at times be a real distraction to focus and even conversation.

                                                Condition aggravated; Palpitations; Tinnitus; This case was received on 01-Jun-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 01-Jun-2021.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Condition aggravated), PALPITATIONS (Palpitations) and TINNITUS (Tinnitus) in a 46-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 039A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure high, Asthma and Allergy NOS. Concomitant products included FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE, SALMETEROL XINAFOATE (ADVAIR) and LOSARTAN for an unknown indication.    On 25-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 25-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Condition aggravated) (seriousness criterion disability), PALPITATIONS (Palpitations) (seriousness criterion disability) and TINNITUS (Tinnitus) (seriousness criterion disability). At the time of the report, CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Condition aggravated), PALPITATIONS (Palpitations) and TINNITUS (Tinnitus) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Immediately upon receiving injection, the patient&#39;s heart began racing, and what had been a relatively quite ringing in his ears for the past year or two, also immediately became 2-3x louder (maybe even more), where it had remained ever since (nearly 2 months). The heart rate settled down within a few second, but the ringing persisted, and continued. Before the vaccine, the ringing was a very high pitched, constant tone, like the high pitched tone he used to hear on an airplane sometimes, but it was so quiet that he only noticed when he would wake up in the morning or at other random times when everything around him was very quiet. Since the vaccine, however, it became loud enough that it was impossible not to notice it constantly; not so loud that he could not hear other things around him or people talking, but definitely loud enough that it was unmistakably there and could at times be a real distraction to focus and even conversation.  Treatment medications were not reported.

                                                Within 24 hours, I began experiencing the usual symptoms associated with 2nd dose, including chills, fever, body aches, etc.  Within 72 hours, I began experiencing serious chest pain, radiating pain into back and shoulders, and numbness in left arm--all symptoms associated with a heart attack.  I was immediately taken to the emergency department where I was treated with pain killer for chest pain and given a blood thinner and IV fluids.   EKG and chest X-ray were normal.  Blood work indicated highly elevated troponin levels thereby indicating significant stress to heart muscle.  Treatment included prescribing medications including Lopressor, Lipitor, and aspirin.  Following stay in the hospital, I was released with no signs of heart complications.  I&#39;m continuing the medications for general maintenance and prevention.  Prognosis is good with no further complications and no further threat of a future heart attack based on current medical conditions.

                                                I have underlying Afib which has been controlled on Sotolol for the last five years with occasional episodes of arrhythmia but my heart rate stayed controlled.  After the vaccine my heart rate shot up to nearly 300 while I was driving home and it eventually came down but I stayed in Afib for nearly 2 months afterwards.  I upped my dose to 400 mg daily from 320 mg of sotolol and eventually got some control of the Afib but now goes out of rhythm more frequently and when it goes out I am not rate controlled.

I woke up the next day with chills, body aches and pain, chest pains, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, arm soreness and swelling, fatigue, nausea and I could not get out of bed.  I called the hospital and left a message.  The doctor called me back and advised me to go to the ER.  By the time the doctor called me back, my chest pains and heart palpitations had resolved.  The other symptoms still persisted- extreme fatigue and headache which lasted another 4 days.  I started to feel better and it took about 6  days  for all symptoms to resolve.  I did not go to the ER since the cardiac symptoms  have resolved. I am still having SOB.

I couldn&#39;t think at all. When walking it felt like I was floating above my body. Anxiousness. Tired. Out of breathe. Irregular heartbeat. Lasted about a week. Then one morning it was gone. Almost like a fever breaking but instead it was my blood pressure.

About one minute later he felt like he could not get a full breath and he felt the need to run away. We connected a heart monitor, did serial vital signs, listen to lung sounds. He symptoms seem to worsen. He did not have hives, his lungs were clear. His HR was normal but his B/P was elevated. We started and IV and gave him 25 mg mg of IV Benadryl. We contacted Dr. via phone. He talked to the patient and he agreed with our assessment and treatment.  He began feeling better about 10 min after the Benadryl and he symptoms cleared by 30 min after Benadryl. We kept him on the heart monitor for 1 hour.  He reported he felt fine and back to normal when he left to go home. He refused ambulance transport to the hospital. All reports will be filled out by me.

Nurse called 911, and I was transported to emergency. About 1.5 hour later, my heart was even beating more quickly, and I could hardly talked and difficult to breathe. This happened when I walked to the restroom by myself and came back. After they did some medical tests, gave me medication for allergy (the doctor gave me this since he was not sure if it was my allergy reaction to the vaccines), injected 2 IV bags and rest for few hours, my blood pressure went down to about 140/9x and heart beat back to normal. I was released from ER on the next day at 4:00am.

                                                About 3-5 minutes after getting the vaccine began experiencing a light headedness feeling. Took my blood pressure and it was a little high (140/95), I attributed this to anxiety but got home and my BP at home was down to about 120/76 about 1 hr. after. I laid down to sleep it off but could not sleep as about 1 hr. after trying to go to sleep I started to get a headache. After about 2 hours of battling it I decided to take a Extra Strength Tylenol which helped with the headache about 2 hrs later is was almost gone but the feeling of lightheadedness/dizziness was still there a bit worse than at the beginning. I slept it off and the next morning it was about 50 % better and by about noon it seemed to be 99% better. Today is Thursday ( on my 3rd day) and still feel a slight dizziness but I also have seasonal allergies which sometimes give me the same symptoms. I expect to be better soon.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

                                                Night of 2nd vaccine woke up with a high fever, and severe headache. Fever lasted 36 hours and peaked at 104.8 (with Tylenol).  Fever was over 103 degrees for majority of 24 hour period. Fever went away after 36 hours.  However, headaches have continued constantly (17 days and counting).    Went to the Dr. on 2/19/21.  They wanted an CT Scan of head and sinuses.  Dr. Prescribed cefuroxime 250 MG tablet in case of sinus infection and ibuprofen 800 MG tablets.  Insurance did not approve a STAT CT Scan, so Dr. told me to go to the ER if headache persisted.  Went to the ER on  2/23/21.  Dr&#39;s indicated Blood pressure was very high (180/120).  I do not have a history of high blood pressure.  They did a CT scan (normal) EKG (normal), and blood work.  They inserted an IV with migraine cocktail to alleviate headache.  Unfortunately no change.  While in the ER they gave me:  - Sodium Chloride - Tylenol - Metoclopramide (injection) - DiphenhydrAMINE (Benedryl) (injection) - Dexamethsone  - Ketorolac (Toradol)  They prescribed methylprednisolone (steroid).  Went back to primary doctor on 2/25.  Blood pressure remains high (average 158/112 throughout the day), headaches continue (constant).  They did more blood work, urine sample, and another EKG.   They also ordered a STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM.  The prescribed lisinopril 10 MG tablet for blood pressure.

Concerned, sweating,  Bp was very high at that point. Don&#39;t have the exact number. Called for ambulance, paramedics ruled out WPW and gave me iv drug that brought rate down to 120 fairly quickly, Over the next hours resting rate slowly normalized to around 80 (normal for me is 72).  For 2-3 days afterwards had some high resting pulses up to 118 but never as bad and normalized in a few days.

                                                A few minutes after the shot i started getting dizzy. it increased with intensity so i flagged down an attendant for help. I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

                                                On 3/16/21 at approximately 12PM a middle-aged male patient came in to get his first dose of Moderna vaccine. I took in this patient into the IMZ room to give his vaccination and reviewed his form he filled out. On the question related to &#34;have you ever had a reaction to a vaccine (fainting/dizzy)&#34; the patient answered &#34;No&#34;. The patient walked outside to the waiting area and sat down to begin his 15mins, at that point another customer yelled for medical attention for him because he passed out in the chair. I ran out with an EpiPen in case it was anaphylaxis. After I got outside the patient regained consciousness in the matter of seconds but was still dazed/confused and I applied a cold compress to the back of his neck and gave the patient some water to drink while feeling for his pulse in the wrist. He began to lose his color/pallor in his face again for a second time at that point I told my technician to call 911, after we dialed them, the patient came back to fully again this time and all color was restored to his face and he was fully conscious this time and able to speak in complete sentences. He wanted me to cancel the 911 call and since he came back to consciousness again in the matter of seconds so we canceled it. I made the patient wait an extra 30 minutes to observe him and he was fine from there on out, his wife was accompanying him and stated he has done this in the past for vaccines (despite answering no in the assessment form) and said she will be driving him home and checking in with his doctor later.

                                                Client received his first dose of Covid vaccine in the clinic on 4/1/2021 at approximately 10:25 a.m.  Client was walked to the courtroom for observation for 15 minutes post-vaccination.  This is standard procedure.  When his 15 minutes was up, Nurse informed him that his time was up and he was free to go, and signed him out.  As she was speaking with him, she noticed he was disoriented.  She asked if he was all right and fanned his face for a few seconds. 2nd nurse came by at that time, and the women helped pt. back to the clinic and onto a pad on the floor in a nurse?s office. Third person was called. Vitals were taken several successive times (BP ranged from 148/99 to 155/104), Temp was normal and in 97.5 to 98.4 range.  Resp 16-18. Pulse was between 78 and 93.  Client was disoriented, could not state his name and could not name anyone for us to call.  Ammonia salts were employed with no effect.  All emergency meds, oral airways, and AED were gathered in case they were needed. No other meds or equipment were used. By standard called for the clerk, and By standard, to call paramedics.  She called 911 x 2 and when put through to EMS, was given a disconnect notice.  She ran down the hall to the constable?s offices, who placed the call and had paramedics on their way.  Then two constables (male and an unknown female constable) came to the Health Dept.   Third person got the client to answer with whom to call. Third person called the client?s mother-in-law and employer.  Both arrived after the client was transferred via ambulance and left to join him immediately at the hospital.  As all this was happening, Nurse, 2nd Nurse, third person, and Bystander were attempting to ensure pt. airway and breathing were patent.  He never had difficulty breathing and never had wheezing.  There were no other visible signs of anaphylaxis. His color was pale, then improved, but became pallid again at about the time the paramedics arrived.  He was never alert or oriented throughout the event. Paramedics arrived at approximately 11:00 a.m. They did an initial assessment and received report on what had occurred and data gathered.  They then had to lift pt. onto the stretcher.  He was then transported to Hospital.

His vitals were stable at BP 133/95, HR 90, Pulse ox 97% on room air. His symptoms persisted so 911 was promptly called. Dr. came and assessed patient and he was found to have clear lungs with no abnormal heart sounds. When EMS arrived, his vitals were very similar and still stable. Patient was taken to Hospital. I spoke with him the following day, 4/7/21, and he reported that his labs were all unremarkable and they treated him for a panic attack and he was feeling well by the time he got home.

After about 10 minutes, the patient had a syncopal event. 2 pharmacists quickly rushed over and aided in laying him on the floor. His feet were lifted off the floor and leaned against a chair. He was sweating profusely and his face was red. He has no prior history of fainting. He stated he only had a power bar to eat all day and has severe anxiety from receiving vaccines. After the patient started to feel better, he sat up on his own on the ground. He given a granola bar, chips, a soda, and some candy. After finishing the snacks, the patient sat in the chair and was advised to stay for at least an additional 15 minutes.

                                                Patient received Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. About 10 minutes after injection patient was not looking well. I escorted him to a private area where he continued to be light headed, pale in appearance, and communicated in short sentences. While sitting patients BP was 60/40 and pulse was thready. He was placed on the floor with legs elevated and EMS called. Lungs were clear and normal, heart tones normal as well. No sings of angioedema at any point of his episode. 3 minutes later BP increased to 80/60 with a stronger radial pulse, and a recheck again about 5 minutes later resulted in a BP of 110/72 with regular radial pulse. EMS arrived and assessed patient. He refused transfer to hospital. He was given time, water, and a small meal as he had not eaten or drank much of anything through is night shift. After about 30 minutes he was able to ambulate through the auditorium and stated he was feeling much better. We encouraged him to take the remainder of the day off but he declined and returned to work. He stated he would return if any symptoms were to reoccur or if he had any concerns. He will have his next dose of vaccine in clinic.

I had trouble sleeping through most of the night and got up twice to urinate.  I could not get comfortable enough to fall asleep - was not necessarily feeling pain, just soreness.  During the day Sunday, I tried to rest having lost sleep, and it was mainly my lower back (back strap muscles) which were experiencing soreness.  Sunday evening, I went to bed around 9:30, and I woke up around midnight having a sore neck.  It felt like I was not necessarily sore in the muscles, but I could feel my heart rate increase and my blood pumping through my neck to my brain.  I could not get comfortable at all and lost sleep.  During the day Monday, I tried to rest it off, and there was no position I could rest where I was not in pain in my neck.  It almost felt like I had some form of encephylitis.  I went to bed around 8:30 PM, exhausted.  Woke up around midnight again, and I could not get back to sleep until 4 AM.  I found a position where my head turned and my shoulder extended away was not painful.  I woke up having felt like I had strained that muscle however.

                                                The night after I took the first Moderna shot, I sweat so much that it went thru my bed matress and onto the hardwood floors that became warped the next work. I called Moderna to file an insurance claim. And they told me this was a normal side effect. I wish they had told me to put a plastic pee protector sheet on first which would have avoided my warped floors. I have a bid for $3000 to fix the warped floors. Furthermore, my girlfriend left me. Shes and anti-vaxxer and couldn&#39;t stand the musty smell of the matress. I have a high blood pressure now. 160/120. I can&#39;t tell if that&#39;s from the vaccine or the fact that my anti-vaxxine girlfriend left me. Should I go see a doctor or a psychiatrist?

                                                Patient called 4/21/21 at 2:08 pm and said at 6 AM he woke up in a &#34;pool of sweat&#34; and started vomiting &#43; chills. No fever. He vomited once and has been nauseous since. He feels very dizzy. He was walking down hallway, and he &#34;blacked out&#34; and fell down the stairs. He said he did not hit his head, but the right side of body hurts, as well as chest, after the fall. He said this pain is causing some difficulty breathing. He said his dad witnessed the fall. When asked if the pain is severe, he said &#34;yes&#34;. He was told that if he&#39;s experiencing &#34;severe&#34; pain after a fall, accompanied with difficulty breathing, he should seek medical attention. He was told he can contact his Dr. for a second opinion first, if desired. Otherwise, it was suggested he check his BP, if possible, sit with head between knees or lay down with feet propped up and NOT walk around if feeling dizzy. He was advised to stay hydrated and introduce bland foods first to see if he can tolerate solid food. He was told he can take whatever oral pain reliever he normally takes that he&#39;s allowed to take if needed. Patient will report back to me.

                                                I woke up on Sat April 17th the day after my 2nd dose of Moderna and went to the bathroom. I was sitting on toilet and next thin i know i&#39;m waking up on the ground looking at the shower. I had blacked out. I then managed to pull myself up and was looking at the mirror in my bathroom and next thing i know i am waking up.  I had blacked out again.  My wife then discovered me on the floor and helped me up and to bed.  There is a cracked tile in my bathroom so i believe i knocked my head pretty good. I felt woozy and had a large scrape on  my right shoulder from one of the falls.  I was put into concussion protocol by wife;  The rest of the day i had the normal side effects of moderna: Fever, chills, headaches, sore left arm, and took tylenol extra strength, rested, hydrated, etc.  I felt better later in the day and by the next day Sunday April 18th i felt much  better;  I was able to drive and get errands done, but felt &#34;Foggy&#34;.  I felt back to 100% maybe by Tuesday April 20th.  My concern is the blackouts not being known. If someone was operating heavy machinery or driving the day after their 2nd shot and blacked out that is a major cause for alarm.

                                                MYOCARDITIS: Patient developed chest pain and shortness of breath. He was seen by me in the emergency department on 5/16/21 and was found to have an elevated troponin.  He was admitted to the hospital and underwent a coronary angiogram which was normal. He has evidence of some global hypokinesis on his echocardiogram and eventually had a cardiac MRI which confirmed that he has myocarditis.  He became ill the day after his 2nd Moderna shot and then more ill the next few days and I saw him on Day #3 after his 2nd shot.  He is otherwise healthy. He was hospitalized for two days. He was discharged on Losartan and Metoprolol and was not on any medications prior to his presentation.

Progressively got worse. by Wednesday night it felt as if my heart was beating upside down. they were probably every 6 beats . went to medical center, where they did chest xray and EKG, along with blood work to see if I was having a heart attack. They diagnosed them as premature beats. Sent me home on a pepcid and magnesium  Followed up on Friday the 29th with a cardiologist as they were continuing every 10 beats. He prescribed metoprolol   25mg  They subdued after another week. They flared up for second shot but not as bad . I no longer take metoprolol

The patient presented to PWF 5/16 with CP, fatigue and elevated HR.  He had received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 3 days prior. The initial ECG showed nonspecific ST abnormalities. HS-troponin 1,438 -- &gt; 5,951.  Echo showed ejection fraction of 35% with global hypokinesis, akinesis in inferior and inferoapical segments, and mild right ventricular hypokinesis. He was subsequently transferred to to PPMC and underwent coronary angiogram on 5/18/21 which demonstrated normal coronary arteries. In consultation with Dr. , he was discharged on losartan 25 mg/day and metoprolol succinate 50 mg BID for outpatient follow-up.    Cardiac MRI 5/19 showed T2 signal abnormality and LGE involving the subepicardium of the lateral wall, inferior wall, as well as septum c/w acute myocarditis. LVEF 53%.   Dr. submitted his case to the VAERS site.   reports feeling much improved. He denies fatigue, dyspnea, palpitation, or presyncope. He has noted fleeting chest discomfort. No fevers or chills.

It seemed he lost consciousness  twice but came  back very quickly. Patient said he had lack of sleep the night before so we do not know for sure if the reaction was just because of vaccine or there are other reasons behind his reaction. By the time 911 came patient was ok and could talk and communicate well. they took him to ER for more exams.

His heart rate  increased rapidly from 3:00 to 3:15, reading 104 - 106 - 108 - 116 bpm.  I can provide a photo of these last four readings if you need them.  I don&#39;t know other symptoms.  His body was found by police who were called for a well-check three days later, 05/24/2021.  Patient died unattended, at home, alone.  I only know for sure the vaccine was administered at a Target store near his home.  Patient texted me at 2:48pm saying that Target gave him a $5 coupon for getting his vaccine, and he was going to use it to buy Tylenol.

                                                After the vaccine, I had regular symptoms from virus that you hear people talk about.  Head aches, muscle ache and soreness, then I felt better after a few days.  Off and on I would have good days and then I would have bad days.  I felt sluggish, and would make myself get through the day.  Some days I would have headaches and others not so much until month of May following the vaccine.   My head hurt almost every day, I was in a busy time in my family owned business as well.   I made an appointment with the Doctor and of course had to wait 2 weeks to get in.  I couldn&#39;t stand it any more and my wife got me in to see Dr. at the walk in clinic.  My Blood pressure was high, he did blood work and called and admitted me to hospital.  My numbers where all messed up and they told me my kidneys where not filtering. After 3 days at Hospital I was transfered to another hospital.  There I met a Nephrologist, who did test, biopsy on my kidneys and started me on dialysis.  My Biopsy report is as follows: 1 advanced Glomerular and tubulointerstital fibrosis (Approx. 60%) 2 Focal segemental glomerular sclerosing pattern, likely secondary 3 Moderate arteriolosclerosis 4 Rare neutrophil cast, superimposed pyelonephritis can not be excluded 5 active cellular cresents are not identified in light microscopic material. This basically says that the high blood pressure is what damaged my kidneys.  I went from a healthy 48 year old with no blood pressure issues, no health issues  until I took the vaccine and with in 6 months it killed the filtration of my kidneys.  I am now on dialysis 3 days a week and on the transplant list awaiting a new kidney.

                                                A few days after the vaccination I got a sporatic nose bleed which was stopped by applying pressure.  A few hours later it happened again but this time because it happened twice within a few hours I reached out to the EH and advised the NP I experienced it and was advised to report if via VSafe.  It was handled by applying pressure and it finally stopped.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

Got better after a bit, and went home. 28 hours later, my heart started racing at home, drove to the WR and it was 133-145 Beats and BP was 180-120.    Went to the ER again tonight for being light headed,  did the EKG and it was normal.  Tonight I woke up three times with a heart rate of 90

Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

                                                This morning I gave  Moderna shot to patient. Once I finished giving the shot ask patient to wait 15 in one of the chairs. The patient came up to the window to tell one of my technician that he didn&#39;t feel well before we can go check on him he fainted and fell on floor. He lost conscious for a second by the time I got to him he was speaking with me. One of my technician was on the phone already calling 911. Made sure he didn&#39;t have any injuries, checked airway, put his feet up, applied cold compress on face, neck and wrists. Tried checking blood pressure but the paramedics arrived. The paramedics told us his blood pressure was low and didn&#39;t want him driving because he was alone in the store. They took him to the  hospital.

Exceeded six hours without ibuprofen and fever returned 27 hours post injection. Took 400 mg ibuprofen and immediately became nauseous. Began walking up stairs and lost consciousness and seized/convulsed briefly (witnessed by my wife). Upon regaining consciousness, I was immediately aware of what happened, date, time, etc., so we did not seek medical attention. Continued ibuprofen every 4-6 hours. On two occasions post loss of consciousness, the first within an hour and the second four hours later, I felt tingly and smelled a strong scent of acetone or ammonia. Both passed quickly. Fever broke soon after second incidence. All symptoms were gone within 48 hours of injection.

                                                PATIENT WAS NOT NERVOUS ABOUT RECEIVING HIS FIRST DOSE. OUR IMMUNIZATION CERTIFIED PHARMACY TECH ADMINISTERED THE DOSE. ABOUT 2 MINUTES LATER HE STATED HE WAS FEELING TINGLY AND HIS EAR TURNED A WHITE COLOR. THE TECHNICIAN CALLED ME INTO THE ROOM WHERE I EXAMINED THE PATIENT. HE WAS NOT RESPONDING AND HIS EYES WERE DILATED. HE WAS TRYING TO BREATH BUT HE WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY. WE MOVED HIM TO THE GROUND AND PLACED HIM ON HIS SIDE TO MAKE SURE HE DID NOT ASPERATE. AFTER ABOUT 20 SECONDS OF BEING ON THE GROUD HE STARTED BREATHING NORMALLY AND WAS CONSCIOUS. THE ENTIRE EPISODE LASTED ABOUT 1 MINUTE (MAYBE SLIGHLY LONGER). EMS ARRIVED A FEW MINUTES LATER. HIS PULSE WAS LOW (ABOUT 50 BPM PER EMS) BUT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WAS NORMAL (UNSURE OF THE VALUE). HE SAID HE REMEMBERED TALKING TO US AND THE NEXT THING HE KNEW HE WAS LAYING ON THE GROUND. HE WAS VERY NAUSEOUS AFTERWARDS FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES (HE THREW UP TWICE). WE CONTACTED THE PATIENT THE DAY AFTER AND HE SAID HE WAS FINE AND THAT HE ONLY HAD A SORE ARM. WE BELIEVE THAT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPED TOO LOW AND CAUSED A VASOVAGAL TYPE RESPONSE.

When I walked back into the room he was pale and sweating, but responding to questions from the person he arrived with. His arm twitched a few times and his head rolled to the side for a few seconds. Then he regained consciousness, but momentarily looked confused. The patient has a history of seizures, but has not suffered from one in 10 years. After that, the patient remained alert, but continued to sweat and felt light headed for most of standard wait time post vaccination. After the 15 minute wait period the patient felt more normal and left.

Then about 3 or 4 days after I continued to remain sick and I passed out on the kitchen floor, my wife called the ambulance and they took me to the ER. They gave me some fluids and ran an EKG on my heart. I was observed for a few hours and released to go home later.  They did not give me any medications.

                                                The day of the first dose of the COVID 19 Moderna vaccine I experienced tinnitus in my right ear for about 2 hours. Thereafter, I started feeling my heartbeat in my ear every time I laid down and intermittent tinnitus . In early June, I started feeling pain in the same affected ear. At that time I went to my primary care  physician who prescribed me antibiotics(Amoxilin)  infection. After completing the five day treatment of antibiotics symptoms did not improve so I made an appointment with an ENT and went to an urgent care clinic where they prescribed me an antibiotic and steroid drop but that medication did not improve my symptoms. At the appointment with the ENT on June 9th I was diagnosed with a bulging ear drum and ear infection. More oral antibiotics were prescribed with a steroid to reduce swelling. Pain in the ear seemed to subside but I still had ear fullness and redness.  At the follow up appointment on 6/30 a hearing test was done where it was discovered that I lost about 50 percent of my hearing on right ear.  I still have tinnitus and hearing loss today.

                                                After receiving the 2nd Moderna Covid Vacine I noticed shortness of breath, chronic dry coughing and fatigue/tirdness. Each week was progressively getting worse and rapid declining in my ability to fuction.  I was gaining weigh and felt very tired, but thought it was respitory infection and tried to rest hoping it would clear up and improve. After several weeks, I noticed that both feet and legs started to swell and wouldnt return to normal. The decline was rapidly getting worse and I was not able to simply tasks. I tried to get an appointment at my primary physisan and was unable to get an appt, they recommeded I visit urgent care, so I went and was told to go to ER, where I was admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure.

Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia without fever was made, patient started azithromycin on 1/5 and albuterol treatments every 4-6 hrs. Initially he improved, but then worsened.  chest xray on 1/6 was negative for pneumonia, PCR covid test was negative, albuterol treatment did not bring much relief. He started respiratory distress on 1/10 and was taken by car to the local ER where another covid test was negative and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. The leg US revealed blood clots in both of his legs. He had an emergency catheter-delivered thrombolysis and was discharged home from the ICU on 1/12 on oral anticoagulants. He is gradually improving, but very weak. He tires easily and gets a drop in oxygen to 90- 93%, as well as an increase in the heart rate to 120  when walking less than half a mile. He runs out of breath with exertion.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                Upon waking up felt cold sweat, nauseated and became dizzy. Within 5 min from leaving the bed I lost consciousness for 2-3minutes. Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

Symptoms began approximately 24 hours after receiving the second vaccine, and gradually subsided over the following 24 hours, with only moderate diarrhea, heart palpitations, and fatigue remaining. It was by far the worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to a vaccine The only side effects after the first vaccine were moderate fatigue the evening of the vaccine and moderate arm pain.

                                                Severe shaking to the point I could barely walk, talk, or function in general. In fact, had to end work conference call due to effects.  In desperation, I have my wife help me into a hot shower where I continued to shake violently for about 25 minutes.  My wife continued to monitor me to make sure I didn&#39;t collapse or pass out and continually ask if we should go to the ER.  However, after about 25 minutes the shaking subsided and I was left exhausted with some minor muscle pain due to shaking.  It was very difficult to breath during the incident, noticed my hands turning blue so I focused on deep breaths and staying calm to eventually stop it.

We sat patient down to monitor and took BP and pulse rate (120/59 and 60). After a few minutes, patient stated he was nauseated and still feeling dizzy. We continued to observe patient and after a few more minutes he stated he was starting to have intermittent chest pain. We then contacted 911 to request assistance. While waiting for EMS to arrive, patient stated the chest pain was becoming more constant. At this time we also observed patient was very pale, sweaty, and his skin was cold to the touch. EMS arrived quickly and took over patient care, stablilizing him and then transporting him to the hospital. We have not received an update on his condition at this time.

                                                On Friday, 4/2/21, a client (49 yr old male) arrived to the 30 minute Vaccine Recovery lot after COVID 19 Moderna Lot# 020B21A administration at 11:40am. Patient had reported history of rash after taking both Cipro and Penicillin. At 11:55 am while pt was being assessed by vaccine recovery lot, pt reported sudden onset of involuntary movements and mild shortness of breath. The EMT called for the Vaccine Recovery Lot Medical Lead. Began assessing patient at 11:57 am, noting the pt was having involuntary movements of the upper and lower extremities every few seconds. 12:00 pm BP 152/98, pulse 65. Patient was alert and oriented with normal skin color.  Pt reported feeling anxious and &#34;maybe it is all in my head&#34;. Pt reported the blood pressure on scene was &#34; higher than my normal at 120s/80s. Pt denied any history of recent illness or other vaccines. Pt stated, &#34; I should have known something would happen, I had a premonition about this&#34;. Repeat vital signs at 12:32 pm BP 152/98 and pulse 65. Pt continued to have episodes of the involuntary upper and lower extremities lasting approx 3-5 minutes per episode. NP explained to pt that she could not allow him to drive with these movements and pt agreed to evaluation with EMS and transport to local ER for further evaluation. NP instructed to call for EMS. Call was made at 12:48pm and EMS/Fire arrived onsite shortly after. While awaiting Fire Department and EMS, pt reported to NP, &#34;I have a history of Aspergers Syndrome&#34;. Also NP spoke with pt&#39;s spouse who also agreed pt should be evaluated at local ER. He was transported to the local hospital.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Heart valve operation. Concomitant products included WARFARIN SODIUM (COUMADIN) for an unknown indication.   On 12-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (Memory lapse, difficulty with memory recall) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Cerebral Ischemic Attack) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 15-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FEELING ABNORMAL (Brain Fog) and HEADACHE (Headache). The patient was hospitalized from 10-Apr-2021 to 12-Apr-2021 due to CONFUSIONAL STATE, MEMORY IMPAIRMENT, THROMBOSIS and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. At the time of the report, MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (Memory lapse, difficulty with memory recall), FEELING ABNORMAL (Brain Fog) and HEADACHE (Headache) had not resolved and CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused), THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Cerebral Ischemic Attack) had resolved. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 10-Apr-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) revealed blood clots. On 10-Apr-2021, International normalised ratio: low (Low) Low. On 10-Apr-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) revealed blood clots. On 15-Apr-2021, International normalised ratio: low (Low) Low.         It was reported that the patient still has difficulty with memory recall, brain fog, headache, and still having trouble with low INR. The patient did not have any side effects after the first dose. Treatment for the events included Levonox injections and Coumadin (increased dose).  Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, excluding other etiologies causal relationship cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the product known safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, excluding other etiologies causal relationship cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the product known safety profile.

Pt then layed his head on the table. He blacked out for several seconds at that point. When pt regained consciousness, he was given water and a cool towel. Pt remained in clinic area for 10-15 minutes post vaccination. Pt stated he felt better and remained in pharmacy area for an additional 15 minutes.  Pt was called an hour post vaccine to follow up and he stated he felt normal.

                                                I track my blood sugar 3x per day (morning, an hour after lunch, an hour after dinner).  Blood sugar is very well controlled using insulin - fasting blood sugar is consistently 115-125, sometimes varying to 110-130.  When I got the second Covid shot, my fasting blood sugar the next two days were 147 and 143 - the highest values I have EVER recorded since I started taking insulin (earlier this year).  Correspondingly, the values after lunch and dinner yesterday were very elevated.  This afternoon and evening, the numbers have returned to normal, and I expect tomorrow morning&#39;s fasting value to be back around 120 again.  This was not dangerous, but as an engineer, I found it to be a fascinating and statistically significant  outlier.  The other symptoms I had from the second shot was a fever (over 100 degrees from 11/28 5:30pm through 11/30 8am, and over 102 from 11/28 10pm through 11/29 9am), some general aches and fatigue, and injection site soreness.  I had no adverse reaction to the first shot (a month earlier) except for injection site soreness.

On 02/15/21 it got worse and could not turn my head as the neck was stiff and swollen. My neck got better after few days and the pain moved to both my biceps. They were also swollen and painful. After few days the pain was gone but I started having pain on both my thighs. They were also swollen and very painful. After few days the pain disappeared and it moved to both legs and feet. At that same time my skin was also getting inflamed and peeling off.  I could not even take a shower or bath as the skin was very sensitive and painful.  I also started developing some blisters on most parts of my body. It was diagnosed a Bullous Pemphigoid.

Resolution of leg symptoms per patient.  3/15/21 &amp; 4/15/21: Received Moderna vaccine one &amp; two at Public health clinic    (Additional Information for Item 12: Cigarette smoker 10.5 Pack years, hypertension)   Additional information for Item 18: 4/19/2021-4/27/21: Presented to Medical Center ER with complaints of Left leg redness and weakness. Stated he felt weak and tired after receiving the second dose and has been feeling worse since. His friend brought him to the ER stating &#34;he didn&#39;t seem like himself.&#34; Admitted for acute cellulitis of Left lower extremity, altered mental status, and started on IV Vancomycin (4/19/21-4/22/21) and Levaquin (4/19/21-4/26/21). Baseline plt 74 at admission. Rivaroxaban 10mg PO QD was given 4/19/21 until 4/21/21. Plt count continued to downtrend during admission. Hematology/Oncology service consulted on 4/22/21 who initially suggested thrombocytopenia possibly due to infection or DIC. Yet, worsening thrombocytopenia despite improvement of infection and clinical status was noted. The etiology was then suggested to be Vancomycin induced thrombocytopenia, so Vancomycin was stopped on 4/22/21. Platelet count  Patient was discharged with p.o. prednisone and p.o. Levaquin on 4/27/21. Patient stated almost full resolution of LLE pain and redness. Plt count upon discharge was 51. Instructed to stop Rivaroxaban.  5/1/21:Patient presented to ER at Medical Center for Leg pain. US Doppler was negative and patient given Clindamycin IV 600mg in the ER and discharged with Bactrim 800mg qd to be continued until his PCP appointment.

Patient was afebrile with a normal wbc count. Upon admission, Plt count was 36. Patient was started on Linezolid 600mg q12h and Ceftriaxone qd. Antibiotics were changed later to Tefalo 600mg Q12Hto be started on 5/15/21. ID consult recommended Daptomycin given patient&#39;s thrombocytopenia. Patient was continued on Daptomycin throughout admission and upon discharge, patient&#39;s leg was almost back to baseline. Plt count was 138. To rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia, patient medications were reviewed and imaging was done in addition to labs drawn during this admission. See above for the labs. All alternative causes during this admission were ruled out.

The pharmacy manager tried to talk to the patient, but he appeared to be having a seizure (his eyes were rolled up in his head, he was shaking). When the patient came to he seemed confused about where he was. He began sweating profusely. He said he was nauseated and lightheaded.  He said he was tingling all over his body. We also noticed that he was bleeding where he hit his head on the ground when he passed out. He stayed seated while the pharmacy manager held a paper towel to the bleeding part on his head.

                                                The pt had his first Moderna covid vaccine on 3/19, and after the vaccination, he developed left upper lateral calf pain that lasted several weeks.  He then had his second Moderna covid vaccine on 4/22, with left knee pain, and again left upper lateral proximal calf pain.  He denies any chest pain, heaviness, tightness, pressure, palpitations, or dizziness.  He contacted his PCP, and he was advised to come to the ER for evaluation of a possible DVT.   This is very suspicious for a direct thrombotic side effect of the pt&#39;s Moderna vaccine.  The pt has a very high d-dimer, and we can not rule out a mid-distal thigh and left popliteal DVT, so the pt will be covered with Lovenox, and he will present to hospital tomorrow to obtain a venous duplex.  They can then, based on clot burden and his subsequent complaints on continuing lovenox bridge to warfarin or a direct acting anticoagulant.

                                                Injection was painless.   Within 5 minutes of vaccine felt dizzy and had heart rate into the 120&#39;s.  Duration approximately 5 minutes then tachycardia and dizziness resolved.  Also had a tremor.  No angioedema, urticaria or other skin/mucosal findings.  Was not anxious.  Arrived home and wife and children told me I looked flushed and noticed my pupils were significantly dilated.  The flushing and dilated pupils resolved over the next hour.  No shortness of breath or hoarse voice of any kind however my mouth felt extremely dry.  I did not do anything for treatment.  Spontaneous resolution.

I forced myself to go to work.  I am a Registered Nurse.  The joint pain and aches increased throughout the day along with altered periods of chills and hot flashes.  Around 6 PM on the 29th is started feeling worse.   I felt like I was tachycardic.  I had my wife take my blood pressure.  My normal vitals are Pulse-50, BP 110/60.  When I took my vitals at 6:00 pm my pulse was 91 and my BP was 85/53.  Clearly an allergic reaction.  I had no difficulty breathing.  Finally, around 1:00 am on 1/30, my fever broke and my heart rate and BP returned to normal ranges.  My first vaccination was unremarkable with only a sore arm for three day.

                                                Narrative: Patient is a 49 year old man with past medical history of hypertension and kidney stones who presented with a chief complaint of word finding difficulties and slurred speech. Patient was last seen normal at 1230 pm on 1/21/2021. He got his covid vaccine and shortly after he developed a headache that was on both sides of his head. Felt like 8/10 pain. He then had difficulty with speaking - he didn&#39;t know what word to say so he would make a noise. He was on the phone, and that person recommended that he come to the ED to get evaluated.In the ED, a stroke code was called. BP 169/97. NIHSS 0. A CT non con did not show any acute bleed or any signs of a stroke. After the stoke code was ended, the patient has a headache severity 1/10 and did not have any word finding difficulties. Patient was non focal by the time that the stroke code was ended. In the setting of hypertension, a blood pressure of 169/97 on admission and fluctuating symptoms, most concerning on the differential is a TIA. Given his risk factors and episodic presentation, he will need to be worked up for a stroke. The differential also includes post-vaccination reaction vs complex migraine.

I felt a little off, but I thought I was ok.  I entered my shower, and then I was found unconscious on the floor of my shower by my wife about 5 minutes later.  I passed out 2 more times while attempting to stand and exit the shower.  I was extremely fatigued at this point.  I went back to bed and slept until 10 pm that night.  I woke for about 2 hours , ate  some food and drank some water and soda pop.  I then went back to sleep until 7:30 am  the next morning.   I was awake for 3 hours, and then I slept for 3 more hours.  I have been awake for about 2 hours, and I am now typing this adverse event document.   The entire time I have had temperature regulation issues, severe headache, muscle and joint aches, and fatigue.

                                                Had vaccine and had a red spot and sore arm which went away after a couple days. Four days after the vaccine a blood vessel in my hand burst (I don&#39;t recall hitting it on anything at all). It puffed up about a centimeter and slowly went away over a few days. Then a little more than a week later the red spot came back and itched very badly and was sore again. It also faded after several days. then yesterday morning I woke up and my arm was sore at the injection site again only I started having the worst headache of my life that lasted 30 hours. I started shaking, sweating massively, I felt hot and cold at the same time, felt as if I had a very high fever but my temperature was 98.4 (totally normal). I was vomiting if I tried to eat or drink. I had severe body aches and EXTREME weakness throughout my body. My heart began to race at 150-160 bpm for several hours and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It has gotten about 50%  better in the past few hours and will hopefully continue that way. I&#39;ve never felt anything like it in my life. I need to know if it is safe for me to get the second shot.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

                                                Started with tightness of chest, (under the lower part of ribcage); sporadic hot flashes and dizziness; pulse going up to 95,( when normal is in the 60&#39;s).  Then sat down an hour later and almost immediately a deep tiredness.  got off work early, went home and had no other problems until I attempted to go to sleep.  Somewhere around nine o&#39;clock, I started getting muscle cramps so I went to the couch.  Shortly after, my right arm, (vaccinated arm) became extremely sore; shortly after, my total body ached; no relief from lying on my left, right, stomach or back; hurt to even sit upright.  Then, I started getting cold chills; which alternated with hot flashes and periods of nausea.  My mouth went extremely dry, so when I struggled to go use the bathroom, I would wobble my way to the kitchen and want to take a big drink of water, attempted to swallow two tylenol, gagged and started throwing up.  Went back to bed and started getting continuous headaches that would move to different places.  This happened the rest of the night and most of Thursday when most of the worst symptoms happened.  Was able to sleep Thursday  night and thought I was feeling better, until I stood up.  Today, I was not able to stand longer than one half an hour at any one point; had to lie down and rest while doing any kind of activity.  I haven&#39;t been able to keep anything down; either vomiting or diarrhea. Have been slowly feeling better with occasional headache.

Upon waking, I realized that it was blood that was from a fairly significant bloody nose that I was having.  Even though I used facial tissues to deal with the bleed, it took nearly 25 minutes or so to subside as it was quite severe.  The situation is/was HIGHLY unusual as I haven&#39;t had a bloody nose for at least a decade (or perhaps even 2 decades) and when I earlier did, I was usually able to deal with it and get it to stop within a minute or two.  In this case, the bleed was significant, flowing quite heavily, when standing straight up (with blood dripping out of my nose) and even when lying in a prone position, wouldn&#39;t stop for 25 minutes.  Additionally, in my life, I have never had a bloody nose be the source of being woken out of a sound sleep.

                                                Immediately after receiving 1st dose of moderna my arm began to have a burning sensation and become sore. The burning sensation expanded to my left armpit area over the next few hours and extended to left side of chest. It felt like streaks of burn extending out of armpit area.  Approximately 12hrs after receiving the shot (3am) I became extremely nauseated. I alternated between throwing up and diarrhea for the next three hours. During this time i also experienced a fever, chills, sweats, uncontrollable shaking and elevated heart rate. Today (3/19) I am dehydrated, lightheaded and dizzy. fever and chills are gone as well as nausea but heart rate is still elevated.

                                                1. Right after I got the shot, I got dizzy and felt a little faint but then was fine after that - it only lasted a couple of minutes. 2. I had a sore arm for 2 days, but just a dull pain right after the shot. 3. I was fine for the past week but then 8 days after my shot, my arm got a small red rash at the injection site, it was itchy, and a little sore - I got the so called &#34;Covid arm&#34; or &#34;Moderna arm&#34;.  It came out of nowhere.

He then started to become responsive. He was able to verbalize who he was and paramedics arrived on the scene. They had him lay on a cot and began to take his blood pressure, pulse, and pulse oximetry. They then checked his blood sugar. Patient was able to sit up and started feeling better.

Since last seen he initiated AIT in December 2020 and reports he had tolerated his AIT injections without large local or systemic reactions until yesterday, 16 Mar, when he received his first maintenance dose. Within minutes of receiving his dose he developed shortness of breath, dizziness/altered level of consciousness resulting in collapse, and was noted to be hypoxic. He was treated with IM epinephrine with initial improvement but subsequently again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness. He received his second dose of IM epinephrine and a dose of IM Benadryl with transient improvement, but again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness followed by nausea and vomiting. He was noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic despite these interventions so a third dose of IM epinephrine and IV fluids were administered. He was transferred by ambulance to ER where he was given IV solumedrol, monitored, and admitted to the ICU overnight for observation. He reports fever (Tmax 101 F) last night in the ICU. He endorses he took his Allegra prior to his AIT dose and did not exercise. Of note, on 15 Mar he received his second mRNA COVID19 vaccine.

Symptoms lasted until 6PM the next day. fever went back to normal around 4pm next day after shot.   * I NEVER had a fever when I had covid.   I had an Antibody test completed back in January. It was positive for Antibodies.  I had an antibody test back in 2020 BEFORE I had covid. It was negative.  A week late after 1st does of vaccine. My heartrate started to increase and had symptoms of Afib again. same symptoms of the Afib and heartrate and breathing, back after I had covid. Exact same feelings and symptoms.  The Afib/heart symptoms, stopped last week.   I am supposed to get 2nd dose this Thursday, and I am most likely not going to. I don&#39;t want the heart rate to increase again. I am having problems making an appointment to ask my doctor. My PCM changed, so it is all confusing and a pain.   Its best I just don&#39;t it.  I had antibodies as of january. I just had the 1st dose last month. I think I am god to go. Not worth the risk for me. I am sick of having covid symptoms, so why force it upon myself again....

                                                Patient came in for first Covid shot. After the vaccination, he was instructed to stay for 15 minutes in the &#34;post vaccination&#34; area. He went and sat there and I walked back into the pharmacy to finish the paperwork. I then was alerted by a customer that the patient fell off the chair and hit his head. I ran over to him and by then, he was back in his chair and just realized that he had passed out. While I was with him and talking with him, we paged out for code white. I had instructed one of my techs to call 911 as he was pale and palms were sweaty. I had him walk over to the IMZ area and had him lay on some towels and had his feet propped up on a chair. He was given water and I kept talking with him until EMS arrived. They checked his vitals and were asking standard questions and after about 15-20 mins, he was feeling better and didn&#39;t want to go to ER. By then, his coloring was much better and he stated he was feeling a lot better. I asked him if he had a headache and he says that he didn&#39;t have a headache and was more embarrassed than anything. He thanked me for my professionalism and care and assured me that he felt back to normal. I called him 2 hours later and he was doing well.

The next morning had an incredible cold chill as soon as air hit him, bone shaking.  Then had cold chills/sweating with soaking of his groin area.  He can go to sleep with extreme chills and then wake up in a puddle of sweat.  He had a headache at first, took Tylenol and it went away.   Numbness in his foot like it&#39;s falling asleep, left hip hurting, left wrist pain.  Today both calves hurt./sore like workout burning pain.  Two days ago his father went to have bypass and was at the hospital with him, and walked painfully in but had difficulty hobbling along and was unable to walk back to his truck and had to borrow his dad&#39;s cane to be able to walk.  Yesterday he was going to cut the grass, knelt down to do something, and when trying to stand up was not able to walk due to the throbbing pain and had to use the cane again.  Also having swollen left ankle with discoloration.  The calf pain is extreme and throbbing, and the pain when he&#39;s not able to walk is in the calf.  The ankle has been swollen since Sunday, 4/18/21.  He spoke with the ICU nurse in the hospital and he told her about it and she grabbed his ankle and asked if he was sure he didn&#39;t have a blood clot.  He has not been able to shake the symptoms.  The issues with walking are intermittent, some days he can walk fine, the other days he has to use the cane.    He still continues with every day hot sweats/cold chills.  It&#39;s 74 where he is right now and has a sweatshirt on as he is cold.  Also the legs hurting, ankle swelling that he ices down at night but the swelling does not go away.  Feels like a hard knot in his ankle.   He has not sought any treatment for this at this point.

                                                Severe dizziness that presented at 8am on 4/26/21 with sharp intermittent vertigo (like starting to pass out) that subsided quickly approximately 5 times over a 20 minute period.  This graduated to constant dizziness and cloudiness and severe shaking while outdoors.   Arrived at ER at about 10am  and &#34;room spinning&#34; vertigo began shortly after and at about 11am there was about 5 episodes of severe vomiting over about a 2 hour period.  Dizziness did not decrease until enough medication was administered to stop the vomiting and allow a dose of Meclizine 25mg PO to be administered and take effect and decrease the dizziness to barely manageable.  Left the hospital in this state at about 6PM.  Today is 4 days later and dizziness continues as manageable only with Meclizine 25mg every 8 hours.

He had no prior coronary disease. This operation was done for an enlarging aortic root aneurysm in the setting of Marfan syndrome. The right coronary was anomalous and needed vein extension for reimplantation. He recovered very well and was seen in our clinic on 4/23, with no unusual findings. He had a normal echo, EKG and DVT study performed.   On 4/28 he had his first Moderna COVID19 dose. on 5/1, he developed malaise, myalgias, painful lymph nodes, chills, and chest pain. He called my clinic and was instructed to go to the ER, but then felt better and didn&#39;t go. He was then found unresponsive later that afternoon and was pronounced dead on arrival of EMS.

                                                Racing mind; accelerated heart rate; outbursts of uncontrollable screaming and anger; trouble staying in one place as if I couldn&#39;t control my own body movements; severe anxiety with desire to escape. None of these symptoms had been experienced in my past. The events looped in cycles for approximately 5-6 hours. Thought I might be losing my mind. No treatment or medical attention given other than having friends watch over me, and forcing myself to drink plenty of fluids. Outcome: back to normal the next day.

He had been in his usual state of health prior to this evening. He received the COVID Vaccine on 5/12/21. He went out with his wife for dinner and then upon return, started to have some substernal chest discomfort radiating down his arm. This is associated with some SOB and nausea. No vomiting, no diaphoresis. The pain continued for about 2 hours and then he decided to come to the ED. The EKG was consistent with inferolateral wall MI. States that he has been very active without exertional chest pain or dyspnea. He does have a history of HTN and is currently on lisinopril for this. No known history of hypercholesterolemia. Denies any diabetes. No smoking history. No history of PVD. His mother did have a bypass in her early 60s. At age 37, he did have a catherization following an episode of substernal chest discomfort. The patient states this catherization did not show any abnormalities.    Following this, the patient proceeded for PCI stenting with a DES for an occluded OM2 . Patient received Aspirin, Brilinta, Atorvastatin, Metoprolol, and Heparin prior to PCI stenting. Cardiology note confirms acute inferolateral STEMI due to occluded OM@, successfully opened and stented acutely.

I had the following issues after my second dose (April 29, 2021):  Day 2 (April 30), 28 hours following injection, I experienced an internal feeling of ?jitteriness?, shortness of breath, and accelerated pulse. Pulse oximeter showed my oxygen saturation dropped to 92 percent (my normal is 98-99) and my resting pulse rate increased to 120 bpm (my normal varies from 66 to 75). Aforementioned symptoms subsided after 6 hours.  Day 3 (May 1) following injection, local swelling and pain in muscle at site of injection (upper left arm). Arm swelling and pain subsided by Day 7.) Day 4 (May 4), noticed two swollen lymph nodes (size of pea and small marble) near collar bone area of neck (same side as injection).

I did take ibuprofen and Benadryl a few hours later around bedtime.  I woke up with  fatigue, lethargy and Covid fog (decrease mental acuity and lethargic).   I had symptoms for 4 days and symptoms started to improve.  I noticed my heart rate increased at 120 and would only decrease if I lay down.  I went to see a doctor who diagnosed me with POTS (posterial orthostatic tachycardia syndrome).   I was prescribed metroprolol 25mg once a day.

                                                I am a healthy 50 year old male who competes in endurance events including 15 Ironman triathlons and many ultra endurance races.  I was diagnosed with acute Pericarditis 8 years ago, after 4 days in the hospital and a couple of weeks of rest at home all of my symptoms had subsided and I have had no reoccurrence of this condition since.  Approximately one week after receiving my second dose of the Covid 19 Moderna vaccine I began to experience chest pain.  8 days post vaccination the chest pain was radiating into my Left shoulder and arm, I had significant pain on breathing and was extremely uncomfortable lying on my back and could not lie on my left side due to pain.   I went to the ER  on the evening of May 6th, they performed a chest x-ray, 2 EKG&#39;s as well as 2 separate blood work panels.   While I did relate my history of having pericarditis and that this pain was very similar to what I had felt before, they, of course, were more concerned on if I was having a coronary event.  The EKG and blood work showed I was not so I was simply sent home with a &#34;we don&#39;t know why your chest hurts but your are not having a heart attack.&#34;   After a follow up to a cardiologists almost 2 weeks later it was determined that it was more than likely a flare up of pericarditis but that it had subsided by that time.

                                                Approximately 30 hours after 1st Moderna shot, I began to have elevated Blood Pressure and rapid pulse.  Day over day, I developed extreme abdominal bloating and elevated blood pressure and rapid pulse.  Symptoms have continued for 14 days post shot.  Treatment with 4,000mg Simethicone daily to treat bloating.  When bloating is reduced - Blood Pressure and Pulse are significantly lowered.  Had appointment with PCP on day 13 - currently stopping Metformin - extreme bloating is reducing.    Have previously experienced similar (but milder) side effects of extreme abdominal bloating twice (when starting Metformin), but did not have elevated BP or Pulse.

Called 911 and paramedic took EKG and informed me I was having a heart attack on the way to the hospital.  Once at the hospital they measured my TnT-Gen5 and the baseline was 2658 ng/L with another test taken an hour later showing 2873 ng/L which led to additional tests listed in box 19.  Final diagnosis was perimyocarditis and I received a prescription of Colchicine 0.6 MG to be taken twice a day for 6 weeks and then follow up with a cardiologist.

                                                One week after 2nd dose noticed left ankle and calf area swollen much larger than right ankle.  Slight pain and tightness in left upper chest, upper back, and into left arm occurring often.  Symptoms have persisted for over a month.  Was checked for a blood clot in left leg but results were negative.  Seeing my doctor for additional tests, probably an echo next.  Symptoms have persisted daily since about one week after the 2nd dose.  Concerned symptoms are consistent with myocarditis.

The symptoms were reminiscent of having pneumonia. I went to the doctor that following Monday. I continued to use Tylenol.  Last month, I&#39;ve been having cognitive issues and I was blacking out. I went to the hospital and it was discovered that I had an aneurysm. I was hospitalized for 3 days. I am actually going to see a neurologist tomorrow.

                                                About a week  after the second shot I experienced some minor chest pain that would go away some  if I stretched and some heart palpitations that I had never experienced before - for about 3 weeks.   The heart palpitations were frightening to me.      Reaction to second Moderna shot was quite intense for 2-3 days with chills and fever near 101F - have not had a fever that high in 30 years since I was a kid/teenager (for me it was a high fever).    Was wearing a winter jacket while working and it was 70F.      EKG was normal when I could get one (mid June) and the conditions seems to have have mostly cleared.     Quite strange how it aligned a week after the shot and the fever.   I felt this should be made available for metadata review, esp after later hearing of reports in younger males of heart issues the past month.     I have routinely gotten flu shots/etc and never had any kind of reaction like this.

On the way he vomited, having sweats and arriving at the hospital he said that he could not walk, I brought him a wheelchair and he went into the hospital telling me that one foot felt cramp and numb that he could not move it, after the doctors checked him and two hours later he told me that he no longer feel both legs. Since that day he could not  move from his stomach down to the tips of his feet,  And after a few days and several tests they could not find any reason why he had  paralysis, the doctor said that it was a syndrome called Guillen Barré and to date he is still hospitalized without being able to move his feet and waiting for help to receive  therapy since we do not have the monetary resources for these services.

                                                I experienced insidous onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations after approximately 2-3 minutes of inoculation.  This episode lasted about 1-2 minutes.  I was not expecting this having no prior history of adverse response to vaccines.  I also felt a flushing sensation in my head.   My breathing felt slightly more difficult.  No sweating, throat closure or itching.   I did not measure pulse and instead tried to breathe/meditate to bring it down.  I estimate it was about 140 bpm .  Breathing/meditation brought it down but it was still elevated when the nurse checked me after 20 minutes.  I remained onsite an additional 15 minutes until I felt well enough to leave but my heart rate was still somewhat elevated, about 20 bpm higher than my usual.   My heart rate seemed to fluctuate throughout the evening and my sleep was subsequently very poor.  I feel much better this morning, just the usual arm soreness after a vaccination.  I have reached out to my primary doctor concerning whether she feels this event would warrant my not getting the second dose or perhaps having a prescribed epipen on my person.  Having no personal history but a family history of severe heart disease (father had first MI at age 42, second at 44 followed by triple bypass and CHF) this incident with my heart rate certainly raised some anxiety.  I had a routine EKG done in June which was normal, I am a physical therapist and in good health.  I am hoping to have the next vaccine in a proper medical facility.   I have read CDC recommendations to not have the second shot if certain adverse responses are experienced and I am not certain whether this would qualify.   I have no history of adverse reactions to vaccines.    Considering the role of anxiety versus the insidious and nearly immediate onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations and persistent elevated heart rate for more than 12 hours, I feel this event was primarily driven by the vaccine.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

I have waves of Tachycardia and nausea. I had pretty bad diarrhea the first day and second day, this was also a side effect from the Celexa. The Tachycardia was going up to 130-140 .  Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

                                                Shortness of breath:  First noted about 18 hours after the dose, along with body aches, headaches and fatigue.  The latter symptoms resolved after 48 hours, however, the shortness of breath has not resolved as of today (77 hours after the dose).  No crackles or wheezes but inhalation and exhalation feels restricted.  I had Covid-19 with symptoms beginning on 11/16/2020 and had shortness of breath along with crackles and chest tightness  during the second week of illness.  The oxygen level declined to 92-93%.  I was treated with steroids and azithromycin at that time and the tightness of the chest resolved by about day 17 of illness.    I am reporting this adverse effect (chest tightness and shortness of breath) because it may be an autoimmune reaction triggered by the response to the vaccine.

Over the course of the next  6 hours, my blood pressure plummeted to 82/63. I countered this by intaking large amounts of salt, and ultimately took my Diltiazem and some Tylenol PM.  Around 3 am my blood pressure returned to normal and currently holding steady at 118/83,  I am monitoring it throughout the day, but it seems stable.

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

There was a tightness in my chest and a tingling of my lips. I brought this to the pharamacists&#39; attention, and they gave me Benadryl and had me wait at the pharmacy, after making me promise to let them know if things got worse. In the next 15 minutes or so, I experienced additional allergic reaction symptoms, including swelling of the tongue and an itchy rash (although these were relatively minor). About an hour after I got the shot, I felt well enough to drive hom.

We called 911 immediately. The EMT tested patient&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate. Both came back WNL. We monitored the patient for an additional 30 minutes in the pharmacy counseling room. We also got patient an orange Gatorade from the store to help restore his electrolytes as he was profusely sweating. Patient refused the EMS take him to the hospital and wanted to drive himself home from the pharmacy.

                                                Patient presented to PCP office 5/17/2021 for intermittent SOB, pain with breathing, and acute pain to left lower calf. Calf pain began 5/16/2021. SOB had been intermittent and ongoing since after receiving 2nd COVID vaccine per patient. He was dx with acute DVT of LLE. Chest CT was not performed to evaluate for PE as patient reported improvement with SOB/breathing over the prior few days. He was started on Xarelto for blood clot. Blood clot was unprovoked, no prior history of clots/bleeding disorders. He is a generally healthy and active 51 year old male. Unclear if there is a correlation between recent COVID vaccination.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose, I spiked a fever of 101, felt body aches and chills. This lasted for about 1 day. On day 3, I woke with stiff, achy and sore joints in my right hand. On day 4, these symptoms remained in my right hand and moved to my left. Over the next week, stiff joints moved into my toes. EXTREME FATIGUE and mental fogginess also developed as did blood pressure spikes. On week 2, move joints started aching including knees, elbows and shoulder. On week 3, my fingers were so sore and stiff it became difficult to use door knobs. I contacted a virtual doctor to ask for direction. He assumed in was side effects and prescribed me Diclofenance Sodium 75 mg for pain. Two days later, I went to the emergency room as the pain, fatigue and fogginess was becoming very concerning. On week 4, I was finally able to see my family doctor. He assumes it is a overactive immune response to the vaccine and prescribe Prednisone 20 mg to overcome the symptoms. The course of Prednisone has decress the severity of my symptoms but on week 5 I continue to have stiff, painful joints, mental fogginess.

                                                24 hours after the second vaccine, I felt so out of breath and my heart rate had gone up to 115 that I had to go outside and have my daughter drive me home.  I did not go to the hospital because I did not believe what was happening and I did not want to worried my daughter on her special day. This was on Saturday May 1 at about 5:00 pm. I went home and went straight to bed. My wife was in disbelief and thought I was faking it. I have been having shortness of breath ever since. I am a teacher and on Monday I spoke to the school nurse and she had told me she had the same reaction and that it would be over in a month or two. I have had the same issues, but over the weekend of the 22 and 23rd of May, I have not been able to sleep as much. On  Monday, May 24, I went back to the nurse and she had took my blood pressure. It was 176/99 and that same day I went to the ER . I had all the blood work done and the only thing I had according to the doctor was high blood pressure. I had never had my blood pressure so high before.

                                                on 6/19/21  Patient came to store for his 2nd Moderna shot. After the shot was given I had staff observe the patient.  In a few minutes the patient felt tired and dizzy.  His wife  said this did not happen with the first shot.    I then had staff call for a code white and I went to assist the patient.  Immunization cart was brought out and I took the patient&#39;s BP  167/122 HR  76.  I asked the patient did he have any problems breathing, he said no.  I did inform him that his blood pressure was high and that can contribute to him feeling dizzy.  I continued to ask the patient if he was breathing ok and he said yes.  There was no need for an epi-pen as the patient was conscious and responsive to all my questions.  Where his blood pressure was still high I continued to take his blood pressure.     Blood Pressure remained high at recorded times:  4:06 pm  176/114  hr 73  4:16 pm  151/110  hr 76  4:18 pm  153/102  hr  76  4:19 pm  patient said he tests his sugar twice a day and complains of a headache straight across his forehead  4:26 pm  153/104  HR  74  at this time I was wanting to see if the cuff size played a role in the high blood pressure.  Staff was able to find a meter with a larger cuff size  4:30 pm  159/103  HR  79  wife stated that his BP was on the lower end at home  4:34 pm  patient stated that he&#39;s feeling a bit better .  BP still elevated.  4:35 PM  147/103   HR  77  4;36 pm  patient said bottom # rarely goes over 100 but has saw top # the same or higher  4:37 pm patient said he&#39;s able to walk and go on about his day.  I was asking about him eating/drinking anything and this is when he mentioned that he drank 2 monsters and had 2 cups of coffee.  I told the patient that this can contribute to him having high blood pressure at this time and asked his wife to monitor his BP when he got home.  I will call them in the morning to make sure he is doing ok.  Note:  patient does not have a PCP verified by his wife.  However standing order doctor will be notified.

The outcome of the event of VACCINATION COMPLICATION (this was the first time I am experiencing a reaction ) was resolved.   mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was withdrawn on an unknown date.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The reporter noted he never had any adverse reaction after taking any medications before and this was the first time he was experiencing a reaction. He reported to be a healthy person before and now after receiving the Moderna vaccine, he is very sick. The reporter stated that he &#34;will not take the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine.&#34;; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                1. After FIRST dose, I had reaction within 30-40 seconds where I found it difficult to catch my breath, felt like I might pass out, my palms were sweating profusely, &amp; I experienced tingling in my extremities.  These symptoms resolved themselves within a few minutes, with the tingling resolving in about an hour or so.(no more noticeable reactions after that) 2. After SECOND dose, ...no immediate reaction like the first time, but arm hurt, as expected for the next couple of days.  I didn&#39;t notice any side effects until, 06/03, which was about 8-9 days later.    So I was running at about mile 4(I am a trail runner), when something just didn&#39;t feel right around my heart...some tightness, even some pain across shoulder blades.  I continued the run...turned into a run/walk.  I continued my day, with something feeling a little off and experienced some night sweats, &amp; poor sleep.  I went a couple more days and then on Sunday I went to the local Immediate Care.  They did an EKG &amp; sent me to ER.  At the ER, they did an EKG, and wanted me to stay to be monitored over nite.  At that time, I did NOT feel bad enough to stay, so I left with the agreement that I would return on Monday to do a Stress Echo on my heart.  HOWEVER, upon getting home and having a bowl of soup, I experienced what I would call my first episode.  Upon getting off the couch, my heart started beating unusually fast, it became VERY difficult to breathe, and I thought I was having a heart attack.  Long story short, I drove back to the ER, they checked me in, did another EKG, a chest X-Ray, a chest CT-Scan, admitted me overnite, where they drew blood every 4 hours, and attached me to a heart monitor for roughly 12-16 hours.  The next day they also performed a heart stress-echo.  Everything came back normal.    Since that time, I have had roughly 4-5 of those major episodes, with some smaller ones as well.  I went back to Hospital ER on 06/19/2021 with another episode that I felt was worse than the original one.  Again, they did an EKG, a chest X-Ray, various blood tests, and everything came back normal.    Amongst all of this, I have seen my Family Doctor twice, and a cardiologist once. Hospital performed a heart Calcium test, which came back with a score of six. I believe the range where medium risk of a heart attack comes in is around 100-200.  I have also been put on a Holter heart monitor, of which I have a week left of a two week assignment.  I haven&#39;t had a major episode in about a week and a half now, but I also stopped eating chocolate and given up all caffeine about a week and a half ago.  All of that said, I still have tightness in my chest, as well as just an odd feeling there. Other symptoms I am having include being light-headed, dizziness at times, and, more concerning, tingling and numbness in my extremities.  The tingling &amp; numbness are primarily in my fingers, hands, and forearms.  In addition, twice my index finger on my right hand has turned blue/purple, but ultimately returned to normal color after 24 hours or so.  Finally, It is very difficult to get sleep.  It seems my heart tries to wake me up every 2-3 hours to let me know something is not right.  I can feel an unusual feeling almost immediately after lying down.  I really can&#39;t even explain the feeling in my chest, but I have never had this feeling before, and have never had sleep issues.  In summary, I WAS a 52 year old man with no history of any heart problems, a fairly avid runner with a resting heart rate between 40 and 50, and no history of dizziness, tingling, or numbness in my extremities.  After the 2nd dos of Moderna, I now have stopped running, have a myriad of symptoms as mentioned above, and my life has been flipped on its head for a month now,....moreover, I am getting little relief.  I need help.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.   On 17-May-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 18-Jun-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced THROMBOSIS (high range d dime test / blood clot) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FEELING ABNORMAL (brain fog), DYSPNOEA (breathing issues) and FATIGUE (Exhaustion). At the time of the report, THROMBOSIS (high range d dime test / blood clot), FEELING ABNORMAL (brain fog), DYSPNOEA (breathing issues) and FATIGUE (Exhaustion) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In 2021, Fibrin D dimer: normal (normal) normal and .55 (High) There is concern for patient that there is a blood clot.         The patient treatment data was not provided. Patient allergies and medical history was not reported. Patient concomitant medication was not reported. Action taken with m-RNA1273 (moderna COVID-19 Vaccination) (Intramuscular) in response to events was not applicable. In between the doses of vaccine patient had done test (d-dime) and original came back in fine range but after second dose patient test came back in high range .55 so there is concern for patient that there is a blood clot.

This subsided and then on day 3 he developed severe substernal chest pain and came to ER where his hs-cTnI was &gt; 2000 ng/L and peaked at 6700 ng/L.  His ECG, echo and cardiac cath were normal but MRI showed evidence of myocarditis with mild left ventricular dysfunction. He is doing well clinically and we are managing expectantly.

Received the second shot the morning of 18 Feb, noticed some minor joint stiffness, minor pain and tiredness mid morning 19 Feb. Laid down at 16:30 and remained asleep until 0530 the next day. Unusual to sleep 13 hours. Later that weekend I noticed a bruise on my leg. I rarely bruise and had not hit my leg on anything. I ignored the bruise a couple weeks, but as it did not heal, continued to hurt and had swelling I went to my primary doctor on 4 March who thought it was a blood clot and sent me for imaging. They determined it was superficial thrombophlebitis and treated with antibiotics and heat.

                                                Patient did say before vaccine that he has fainted in the past from previous vaccines. I had a Representative administer vaccine while i stood next to patient and talked with him as a distraction from the shot. After Representative gave the vaccine patient asked &#34;did you give vaccine?&#34;, he then immediately started to sweat very hard and said he was light headed (he was sitting down), then his eyes rolled back and he slouched down in chair, at which point I held him so he did not fall on floor. He started to jerk and twitch, perhaps was having a seizure, and was sweating very hard. I held him in chair so he would not hit his head or get hurt. After about 30 seconds he regained consciousness and asked how long he was out. His T-shirt was soaked in sweat and he said he felt very dizzy. The Representative got him an ice pack and placed at base of neck, which he said helped alot.  I sat with him for 10-15 minutes until he said he felt fine. I asked if he needed medical care and he said he did not, just needed to sit for awhile, and said this has happened before. I gave him a chair to sit in after he was fully alert and he sat for close to half an hour, at which point he said he was back to himself and felt fine.  I did offer he could stay as long as needed and I could call anyone if he needed me too, he insisted he was fine and after about 45 minutes he left. I did call him the next day to check on him and he said he was fine.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Open heart surgery. Concomitant products included POTASSIUM, FUROSEMIDE (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]), WARFARIN, METOPROLOL SUCCINATE (TOPROL XL), MINERALS NOS, VITAMINS NOS (PRENATAL VITAMINS [MINERALS NOS;VITAMINS NOS]), CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) and ESCITALOPRAM OXALATE (LEXAPRO) for an unknown indication.    On 11-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Mini-stroke transient ischemic attack) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required), VERTIGO (Room spinning) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required) and BLEPHAROSPASM (Winking eyelids involuntarily) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required). The patient was hospitalized from 19-Mar-2021 to 21-Mar-2021 due to TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. On 21-Mar-2021, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Mini-stroke transient ischemic attack), VERTIGO (Room spinning) and BLEPHAROSPASM (Winking eyelids involuntarily) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient received vaccine in right non-dominate deltoid muscle to prevent COVID-19. Patient was admitted to hospital from 19Mar2021 to 21Mar2021 for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scan, with observation and Low-Dose Aspirin. Patient was feeling much better and his cardiologist recommended that he receives his second Moderna vaccine as soon as required and to take an extra Vitamin D supplement as a precaution. Scheduled second dose was due on 08Apr2021. Treatment included was low dose aspirin.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the temporal association between the product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Pulse rate and blood pressure also increased.  On the worst night, April 20, pulse was 105, blood pressure was 150 over 110.  Patient also experienced extreme chills, sweating, and hallucinations.  The following day the entire body was sore and ached.  The following days the symptoms subsided but have yet to completely go away.  The other aspect is that these symptoms were not as bad in the day time as they were overnight.  The symptoms came in waves.

                                                15 minutes after the shot, I became lightheaded in the waiting area and felt like I was going to black out.  I seemed fine after, and shrugged it off as I sometimes experience this on a rare occasion. Thought it was my anxiety from all the drama hearing about side effects. They kept me for 40 minutes and asked me a few questions and felt that I looked and acted normal.  My ride home, my vision seemed &#34;off&#34; and again, I shrugged it off to anxiety.  I also had light heart palpitations.  I get these sometime when I&#39;m stressed, overly tired, too much coffee, or have anxiety.  I wasn&#39;t dizzy at all, but my balance felt a tad &#34;off&#34;  I was much better in the morning and back to normal within about 24hrs.   I am worried about geting my 2nd shot as I read people being dizzy and with super high blood pressures......  Hoping these &#34;symptoms&#34; were just from myself getting worked up about..... possible side effects and allergic reactions.

                                                4 days (4/20/2021) post vaccination pain in right calf was experienced. As the pain did not resolve over the next week and felt similar to a DVT experienced post a spinal fusion in 2018 I consulted, on 4/16/2021, with the vascular surgeon, who treated my post surgery DVT in 2018 . He performed an ultrasound and identified a clot in my right calf. On 4/21/2021 he prescribed a course of Eliquis (initial dose 20 mg per day) to resolve the clot. As of today (4/23/2021) the pain has lessened but not resolved. In addition to the DVT I experienced a significant level of fatigue for 3 days post the vaccination. While the fatigue has lessened it has not completely resolved.

                                                Within 2 minutes after COVID vaccine first shot I felt a flushing sensation and began developing heart palpitations. It lasted about 5-8 minutes. I sat down for 15 minutes as required by the clinic for all those getting shots.  After about 8 minutes heart stopped racing and slowly got back to normal.  It did not appear to be caused by anxiety. I did not report it to the clinic staff.  In researching this allergic reaction is likely related to Polyethylene Glycol allergy.  When I got a colonoscopy a few years ago I used colo prep.  Back then my heart was pounding hard the night before and the day of the examination.  I did not know it was a side-effect from the solution.  Doctors could not explain why my heart rate was high but went ahead with the exam. With the current event it appears is the common link between then and the COVID vaccine.

I was ready to call an ambulance since I felt I would pass out.  The cold sensation lasted all night; each time I got out of bed I started shaking cold. -This morning the symptoms are mainly elevated blood pressure by about 50 points.  No one has been able to advise me if I should take the second shot, and that is really bad.

Patient stated he received his vaccine and about 4 hours after started experiencing lightheadedness, dizziness, and overall feeling unwell.  Patient stated that he called the pharmacy and we verified that what he was experiencing could be related to the vaccine but to seek medical attention if his symptoms progressed or felt unmanageable.  Details were not given further but patient ended up in the hospital and had suffered a stroke.  Two weeks later he had a second one.  Patient stated he was seen by a neurologist who did not believe that the covid vaccine caused this as it was such a short time from vaccine to onset of symptoms.  He stated he was ok to get his second one per the physician.

                                                54 days after the first vaccination with Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine, and 25 days after the second vaccination, at approximately 0730 on Day 1, a 52 year old male, height 175.2cm, weight 95.5kg, without significant medical history or prodrome, had an acute onset of dyspnea manifesting as a small sigh at intervals of 4-6 minutes, which increased in frequency to intervals of 2-3 minutes over the course of the day. At approximately 1400 he had a one minute episode of tachycardia &gt;120 bpm. At 1515, his forehead became diaphoretic. He had neither chest pain nor a pericardial friction rub at any time. He went directly to the local emergency department. Additional information for Item 18:   Blood pressure at admission was 155/87, pulse 97, respiratory rate 22/minute, SpO2 98%, and Temperature 37.2. ECG at 1539 interpreted as: &#34;NSR at 85, Lateral ST depressions; ST elevations in aVR, ischemia / Posterior wall MI&#34;.  ECG at 1541 showed: NSR at 82, unchanged from prior ECG. ECG at 1552 interpreted as: &#34;Sinus tachycardia at 102, ST depressions remain in lateral leads but now also in V3 and V4; persistent ST elevations in aVR CW evolving posterior wall MI&#34;. PR depression in leads II and V4-6, and reciprocal PR segment elevation in aVR (pericarditis ECG Stage 1) Atypically for pericarditis, ST depression, rather than ST elevation, was present in leads V3-V6.  Owing to a working diagnosis of an evolving posterior wall myocardial infarction,  an emergent cardiac catheterization was performed, which demonstrated non-obstructive CAD and a small myocardial bridge. Initial laboratory values were notable for a white blood cell count of 11.89 K/mm3 (4.5 - 11.5), monocytes 1.1 K/mm3 (0.0 -1.0), 9.4% (2.0 - 9.0),  neutrophils 7.9 K/mm3 (1.5 - 6.6), 66.9% (40.0 - 75.0). Troponin was negative at admission and 18 hours later. D-Dimer was negative. Viral panels including SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV were negative. He was admitted for overnight observation. On Day 2 an echocardiogram was normal with no effusion, and ECG was notable for the absence of PR depression and persistent ST depression in leads (PR segment normalization part of pericarditis ECG Stage 2)... His dyspnea persisted, with a moderate sigh every 1-2 minutes at rest. He was discharged with a presumptive diagnosis of coronary vasospasm or a pulmonary etiology, and told to follow up with his pmd. Over the next several days, his dyspnea was continuous and progressively worsened, and he had diaphoresis of the forehead every morning approximately 0900 until Day 20. Sleep remained normal. On Day 5 he was sighing deeply more than once per minute at rest, causing him distress, and ECG showed (?persistent ST depression in V4-6 with reciprocal changes in aVR). On Day 12, ECG showed T-wave inversion in V1-6 and ST depression in V3-6 (ECG Stage 3); a computed tomography of the chest was normal; and blood tests notable for normal monocyte count .57 K/microliter (0.0 - 0.8), normal CRP 2.15 (1.0-3.0), and an ANA titer of 1:80 (elevated) described as a speckled pattern, which is associated with several autoimmune diseases. Repeat echocardiography on Day 26 showed a small, generalized pericardial effusion and was otherwise normal. Cardiac MRI on Day 29 showed delayed gadolinium uptake. Pulmonary function tests on Day 38 were normal. Stress echocardiography on Day 44 was normal. Cardiac CT angiogram on Day 46was normal. The patient was diagnosed with pericarditis of unknown origin and started on aspirin 650 mg p.o. b.i.d. An ECG on Day 80 showed PR depression in II and V4-6, continued ST depression in II and V3-6, without T wave inversion (T wave normalization c/w ECG Stage 4). Symptoms progressively worsened from onset to nadir around Day 12, on which he had continuous moderate dyspnea upon awakening with severe dyspnea with mild exertion. Symptoms then generally improved until after Day 47, he began to have alternating periods of several days without symptoms followed by several days of  mild dyspnea.  Clinical symptoms resolved on Day 85.

                                                My brother took the day off work on May 12, 2021 to receive his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine. He communicated with friends later that same day saying he was tired and needed to rest. On May 13, 2021, a work colleague followed up with a text message to see how he was doing to which my brother did not respond. This same colleague went to his house a few days later to find him dead lying on his couch.

With in 15 minutes he had 2 waves of this reaction. The 3rd wave started about 20 minutes after shot and he said it was worse, tingly in both hands , funny feeling like he was going to faint , cold and felt like his pulse rate was up . He never fainted. He kept talking to me. Since the 3rd wave  was worse and it lasted the longest, we call 911. They came and checked him out, but he declined to go with them to the hospital. He waited in the store for at least 1 hour. Checked on him at home at 3:05p.m. and he said he felt fine.

He said follow up with primary care.  I got into see my PC,  April 24.  He said my heart sounded OK but decided I should be taken to the emergency room for  enzyme test. Also did xray.  ER doc ruled out heart attack and said likely inflammation of chest wall or bones in the area.  Pain still persists. Got referral to cardiologist and did SPECT test June 8th.  results pending.

                                                a 52 y.o. male sent for evaluation due to symptoms which have now lasted for months and began occurring shortly after he received his second Materna vaccine.  He had his first Madrona vaccine on 3/26/2021, and his second vaccine on 4/23/2021.  Initially he noted headaches, neuralgia, chills and sweats, and just suspected these would dissipate as had been described in the media.  His headaches and neuralgia did resolve, but he continued to have significant night sweats and fatigue.  He had one episode where he passed out and struck his head.  This has not recurred for over a month.  He has had 2 episodes of vomiting bilious material these were significantly spread out.  He has noted a 20 pound weight loss and difficulty sleeping.  He does report that in the last few days his symptoms seem to have improved, and his appetite has improved as well, but he has not noticed any weight gain yet.  He did have low-grade fevers the highest being in the 101 range.  He had no visual, taste, pulmonary, genitourinary, rheumatological, or dermatological complaints.  Apart from the 2 episodes of vomiting he has had no GI issues.  His wife is present and concurs with his history.  He has had a significant work-up from his primary care provider who included an LDH in late May that was normal, CBC with differential which was benign, a Monospot which was negative, CRP that was elevated at 85 with 0-10 being the reference range, a negative ANA, negative RA, and a sedimentation rate of 42, blood cultures were performed and were negative.  Labs earlier in the month noted similar findings.  His basic metabolic panel and liver enzymes were also normal.  He was also reportedly screened for Lyme and was negative but I do not see this test result.   He denies any childhood infections of significance. The also went to a safari in 2019.  They traveled recently prior to the onset of his symptoms but he reports no known bites or scratches by ticks, insects, mosquitoes, or other animals.  No one else in the household has been sick.  He did receive the BCG vaccine as a child.  They also report a chest x-ray was performed and was benign.  He was given a 10-day course of amoxicillin and reports no significant improvement while on this.

It stops occasionally if I pinch my left nipple.  I looked it up on the internet and it seemed harmless.  Then it went away but returned about 2 weeks ago.  I didn&#39;t think much of it until I saw the reports of myocarditis and pericarditis as side effects today.  There has been no treatment as I do not have insurance of any kind.  It is still occurring as of today.

He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

                                                At 5:00 pm on vaccination day I started to experience aching in both legs.  By 5:30 pm the aching in both legs became greater and started a general unwell feeling.  By 7:00 pm I had a headache/full body aching/major pain and aching in both legs/rapid heart beat at rest/chills/diarrhea.  I suffered from sweats/chills/rapid heart rate/major right and left leg pain and aches/headache for the whole next day.  By 11:00pm the day after vaccine, I was only suffering from major head ache and major left and right leg pain and aching and sweating.  I woke up the 2nd day after the vaccine symptom free but very fatigued.  I took 800mg of Advil every 6 hours from the onset of symptoms.  My watch reported my heart rate at a range from 90-121 BPM while at rest for at least 24hours during onset of symptoms.

                                                Patient report to have been in A-fib for three days after receiving first dose of vaccine; Throat closure; Felt like anaphylaxis; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was a 53-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who developed atrial fibrillation and an anaphylactic reaction.    The patient&#39;s medical history included heart failure and allergies to butter and NSAIDS.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included metoprolol, diltiazem, apixaban, lisinopril and loratadine.    The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 040A21A) on 11 Mar 2021 in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Mar 2021, the patient reported that he experienced a moderate reaction; throat closure (not complete).  He stated that it felt like anaphylaxis.  He also reported having a numb tongue. He reported that the reaction was not immediate and that  it started about four hours after the vaccine.    Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation, was considered recovered/resolved. The outcome of the event, anaphylactic reaction, was considered recovering/resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 53-year-old male who experienced a serious anaphylactic reaction with serious unexpected event of atrial fibrillation and throat closure.  Event onset occurred the same day as the first dose of mRNA-1273. Treatment not reported. Atrial fibrillation resolved, and anaphylaxis resolving. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Shortly after receiving the shot, I had combination of headache/head pressure, which went away after about 2 hours. Somewhere in 36-48 hours later, I began having headaches (clearly aches, not pressure).  These were like my concussion headaches (but I hadn&#39;t had been experiencing such strong headaches for a while). These lasted about 2 weeks. Along with the headaches, I got lightheaded very easily. I also noticed my heart rate was lower than normal when I did light exercising (and maybe even at rest, too). I had been experiencing the headaches and lightheadedness when my concussion was worse; I figure some connection / recession brought about by the vaccine. Neurologist attributes the response to inflammation.

No swelling of lips, tongue, face noted. No rashes. EMSA arrived shortly after vitals were taken and he was assessed. He refused to go to the ER via ambulance, but agreed to let his wife take him for evaluation. No medications were given before he left. No major progression of symptoms before he left with wife in car.

                                                TWO lower GI tract infections, each one about two weeks after a vaccine shot. Other worries are confusion and bp oscillation.  DETAILS: 1st dose only minor flu like symptoms then 14 days in, big GI tract infection tennis ball size in lower GI followed by UTI and Colo-rectal infections. Gas and no stool passing.   2nd dose down  24-72 hrs later with serious chills and internal fever in main body cavity. Slept it off and hydrated. Then consistent flu like symptoms but stronger and longer than 1st shot. Increasing confusion and maybe dementia? Some 3-D visual dreams too?  lots of inflamation feel in body wherever old injuries were. Also blood pressure going high and low even though I cross checked with both electronic wrist version, and mechanical armband version of bp monitors. Consistent frontal lobe head pressure, bp oscillation, and flu like feelings (upset stomach, change in urine and stool color, wooziness, chills, etc.). Thank goodness for coffee! It helps clear up my mind a bit.  Then again, 14 days beyond second shot roughly, and the only reason I filed the report, another lower GI tract infection. This time I hit it right away with potassium penicillin 800 mg. This worked the first time too. Just an FYI in case others are showing  GI tract version/issues. I believe this was a secondary form of Covid symptoms in early Chinese data if that can be trusted.   Still not in good shape but it sounds like second shot causes more issues. I will probably schedule general checkup with my doctor if I dont get better in a week or so.

                                                Approximately 48 hours after my second Moderna Vaccine I started experiencing breathing difficulty and shortness of breath. After 58 hours was admitted to emergency room but CT scan of lungs and heart normal. Breathing difficulty continued 24 hours a day until 8 days later in which the breathing difficulty became worse and increased light-headedness occurred On 4/13. A second trip to emergency room happened on 4/13 another CT scan of lungs and heart normal. Breathing difficuly continued until On April 24th I collapsed and blacked out while out for a walk. Was admitted to emergency room on the 24th and remained hospitalized with brain fog, light-headedness, breathing difficulty and sharp pain in right side of chest. Ecco cardio gram test negative. Breathing difficulty, lightleadedness and chest pain have all been steadily increasing since 48 hours after the 2nd Moderna vaccine shot. To date, still no answer as to why this is happening and getting worse.

                                                Patient with no known prior history of coronary artery disease,  woke up early morning between 4 and 5 with severe substernal chest discomfort, associated with some dyspnea. He had the 2nd COVID Moderna shot 2 days prior and has been experiencing mild fever, and chills. He did not get relief with ASA and antacid, and elected to come in . ECG at presentation showed left bundle branch block which was not present on previous ECG done in the hospital and stress test 2 years ago. His initial high sensitivity troponin was markedly elevated around 2500 ng/ml, and second set withint next 60 minutes rose to over 4000 ng/ml, consistent with acute coronary syndrome. Urgent coronary angiography was performed which did not reveal any culprit lesion. A stat echocardiogram showed normal EF and valve function. He was observed for 24 hours and discharged without incident on medical therapy.

                                                I recieved the Covid19 vaccine first shot on March 29th. Approximately 1-2 weeks later, I had a brief (&lt;hour) experience of numbness on the left side of my face. Concerned with possible stroke, I examined myself and found nothing of any concern. On May 1st, about 5 days after the second and final Covid19 vaccine shot, I felt the same numbess and did the same check. This time, there was disctinct loss of muscle function on the left side of my face. A call to available urgent-care services indicated it was highly likely that is was -not- a stroke. I went to Urgent Care, which immediately moved me to Emergency Care for a full stroke evaluation (under the -just in case). The diagnosis was Bell&#39;s Palsy (&#34;likely triggered by a viral event&#34;). Treatment is oral steroids, antivirals, and lubrications for the affected eye. Expected to clear up between 2 weeks -&gt; 6 months.

                                                Patient reported rapid heartbeat after vaccine. He also complained of dizziness, and or severe exhaustion. His blood pressure was initially 180/103 with a pulse of 85. Patient was given water and and the blood pressure was repeated, it became even more elevated 180/110 with a pulse of 83. EMT was called because patient was not improving and seemed to be deteriorating

                                                Eight days after receiving the Moderna shot I woke up in the morning  (3/22/2021) with irregular heartbeat.  My family doctor confirmed via EKG that I was in Atrial Fibrillation (Afib).  Blood samples were taken, test results were normal. Blood thinners were described. Went to see a cardiologist (3/23/2021) where the Afib was confirmed. Following that visit an echocardiogram of the heart was performed, results were normal. Afib turned into persistent mode and I decided to undergo a cardioversion (4/21/2021) to bring my heart back into regular sinus rhythm. Even though the cardioversion turned out to be initially unsuccessful, I experienced the last Afib episode at the end of last month (4/28/2021).

                                                Hospitalized after vaccination with acute submassive PE.  ASSESSMENT / PLAN: Patient is a 53-year-old male in no significant past medical history who presented with complaints of progressively worsening shortness of breath, chest pressure and was found to have acute submassive pulmonary embolism for which he underwent successful mechanical thrombectomy per Interventional Radiology.  Subsequent bilateral lower extremity DVT ultrasound demonstrated acute DVTs in the left popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal veins. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: PRESENTING PROBLEM: Acute pulmonary embolism, unspecified pulmonary embolism type, unspecified whether acute cor pulmonale present (HCC) [I26.99] HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 53-year-old male in no significant past medical history who is admitted for Acute Saddle Pulmonary Embolism. In the ED, the patient was tachycardic, tachypenic requiring 2 L of O2. CT angiogram thorax showed saddle embolus with extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli and evidence for right heart failure. He was immediately started on IV Heparin. PERT Team was activated and the patient underwent a successful mechanical thrombectomy with IR. Dopplers of the lower extremity showed Left lower popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal DVTs. After 24 hours of hemodynamically stable vitals, the patient was transition to Eliquis.  The patient stay was complicated with elevated blood glucose along with Hba1c of 9.7. Endocrinology was consulted and started the patient with Lantus and LDC. The patient will be discharged with diabetic regimen and followed up with PCP/outpatient Endocrine.    The patient was stable, AOx4, without complications and discharged safely to his home with his wife.

He reported the symptoms were since approx the 5/17/21. Pt said it possibly started sooner on the 15th. Pt came in  today 5/21/21 because he received an ultrasound at a clinic by referral from his pmd and was dx with a DVT to the left calf. His pmd then referred him to come to ER where I triaged him in the triage department. He mentioned that began feeling bad after the Moderna Shot he received on 4/28/2020 and stated the now he has this new problem that he never had in the past. Only hx was mild htn he said.

                                                Vaccine Received on Wed 3/10/2021. On Saturday - shortness of breath, very elevated resting pulse (by 25 bpm) reduced oxygen saturation (87 on oximeter vs 95), moderate ongoing chest pain.  Primary care doctor advised to go to ER.  ER visit resulted in misdiagnosis of Heart Attack which was later changed to heart inflammation.  Troponin levels elevated and stayed elevated and continue to be elevated 8 weeks later.  AFter 8 weeks Troponin levels still elevated and pain occurs upon anything more than modest exercise.  Patient has a history as an edurance athlete.  All other tests on heart function - stress test/ Ekg, perfusion, echo - show a high peforming heart - no other defects other than heart inflamation.

                                                Patient manifested with flu-like symptoms (myalgias, fatigue, cough, abdominal discomfort, shortness of breath) with high-grade fevers (TMax 103F) approximately 4-6 hours following administration of 2nd Moderna vaccine on 5/4/2021 per patient&#39;s wife. The symptoms progressively worsened to the point that he presented to an outside hospital on 5/12/2021 at which time he was found to be tachycardic and febrile (T 103.1F). Labs at that time were notable for significant thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, elevated lactate, elevated procalcitonin. Chest imaging showed bilateral airspace disease. CT of the abdomen noted hepatosplenomegaly with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function. He was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Labs on 5/13/2021 were notable for a markedly elevated ferritin level, fasting hypertriglyceridemia, elevated CRP, elevated transaminase levels, hyperbilirubinemia, markedly elevated CXCL-9 level, markedly elevated IL-18 level, normal natural killer cell function. Of note, while his blood and urine cultures were negative, he was found to have elevated EBV viral load on peripheral blood draw. He had a bone marrow biopsy which reportedly showed rare evidence of cells with what appeared to be erythrocytes within their cytoplasm, concerning for HLH.  Given strong clinical and serological suspicion for HLH, he was transferred to our hospital for a higher level of care. Upon transfer to our facility on 5/18/2021, his inflammatory markers were persistently elevated. He unfortunately developed worsened renal and respiratory failure, and required both hemodialysis and intubation respectively. He was continued on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, however we additionally initiated high-dose steroids as well as anakinra for treatment of HLH. Given EBV viremia, we also began rituximab therapy. He was successfully extubated, however as of 5/26/2021 remains dialysis-dependent with continued improvement in urinary output. His post-intubation course has been complicated by encephalopathy of unknown etiology. We have consulted infectious disease to proceed with a diagnostic lumbar puncture to ascertain potential CNS pathogens explaining the cause of his altered mental status. MRI of the brain showed no evidence of pathology. CNS involvement by HLH remains on our differential.

                                                I got my second shot of mederna on april 2  at about 130 pm, I got the shot and felt fine for about 4 hours at which time I got so tired and dizzy I felt like I was going to pass out, so I stopped what I was doing and went to bed. I slept for 4 hours and woke up in a pool of sweat and was so wet it was like I had just gotten out of the shower. I had the chills and felt cold in 84 Deg F, I went down stairs drank power aid and got out and set up a space heater and sat in front of it with it blowing the hot air on me but had hot and cold flashes, a mild head ach and joint stiffness and pain. I was only able to stay up for 4 hours before I was so exhausted I had to back to sleep and woke up the same way, this continued for the entire weekend. By monday morning my urine was so yellow it was almost black in color, I called my PCP office, they called me back and advised I go to the emergency room asap. I called my parents and got a ride to the hospital emergency room. I told intake what happened and sat down to be called in, they called me in 1 time then had me wait for diagnostic testing, I got vary dizzy just sitting their watching the tv. By the time they called me in for testing I told them I felt vary noxious and ended up passing out on the nurse after they took my blood. They transferred me from that chair to a bed in the blue pod, gave me nausea medication and hooked me up too 2 vary large IV bags and ran them at the same time. Then being up for 4 hours then sleeping for 4 hours and waking up wet in a pool of sweat continued for 6 days in total. the hot and cold flashes and sitting in front of a space heater went on for 12 days in total. waking up in a pool of sweat went on for about 28 - 30 days in total decreasing in severity along the course of time. The only side effect I still have is my sleep is all screwed up now. If I stay up untill 4 am I will sleep to 10;30 then wake up tired and stay in bed untill 11;30  am. if I go to bed at 2 am I wake up at 6;30 am have to use the bath room then can not go back to sleep for at least a hour then do not wake up untill 11 30 am. Normally, I used to goto bed at 2 -3 am and wake up at 9 -10 am every day.  on wednesday april 7 th, the doctors office which is part of the same group as the hospital called me to go over the results from the emergency room, but the person calling did not seem to know I had called them on monday morning or they had called me back to tell me to go to the emergency room, so I do not know how much of a help the PCP will be,  but I have proof of that in the phone call records.  MY PCP is no longer with the practice, so I had to choose a new one

Frontal headache lingered for about 10 days along with general fatigue.  Also experienced elevated hear rate on runs by &#43;20bpm compared to same runs prior to second dose.  Since the second dose dose, I?ve experienced monthly episodic frontal headaches requiring ibuprofen to treat and some issues with blood glucose levels. These events are some what transient in that they resolve within a day.  Prior to second dose, I rarely experienced headaches, NMT 1/yr and rarely requiring treatment with NASAID.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Obesity.   On 16-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 15-May-2021 at 2:00 PM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 15-May-2021, the patient experienced ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), DYSPNOEA (Stuggling to breathe) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (Struggling to walk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged). In May 2021, the patient experienced SEPSIS (Acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), CARDIAC FAILURE ACUTE (Acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), CARDIAC ARREST (Cardiac arrest) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), INFECTION (Blood infection) and PYREXIA (Fever). On 17-May-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (Seizures) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant) and THROMBOSIS (Bood clots) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 15-May-2021 to 25-May-2021 due to DYSPNOEA, GAIT DISTURBANCE, SEIZURE and THROMBOSIS. The patient died on 25-May-2021. The reported cause of death was Cardiac arrest, Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, ards and acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. At the time of death, SEIZURE (Seizures), THROMBOSIS (Bood clots), DYSPNOEA (Stuggling to breathe), GAIT DISTURBANCE (Struggling to walk), INFECTION (Blood infection) and PYREXIA (Fever) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-May-2021, Blood pressure measurement: elevated (High) Twice normal. On 15-May-2021, Glycosylated haemoglobin: elevated (High) High. On 15-May-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Required intubation and was placed on ventilator.. On 15-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: negative (Negative) 1 negative COVID antibody test. On 15-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negatie (Negative) 3 negative COVID antigen tests.         No concomitant medications were provided.  It was reported that within few hours after second dose of vaccine patient was struggling to walk and to breathe. The reporter and her husband went to see the patient and took him to an emergency room (ER). In the ER his blood pressure was markedly elevated (twice normal) and his oxygen level was low and by midnight he required intubation and was placed on a ventilator. His HbgA1c was noted to be elevated. Two days after admission (17-May-2021), he developed seizures which the medical team believed to be due to blood clots and he was anti-coagulated. It was determined that he did not have blood clots on his heart valves as the source of the clots. The source of the blood clots was never identified. He later developed fever and was diagnosed with a blood infection and treated with antibiotics. At one point his oxygen requirement on the ventilator went down to 65% but later returned and remained at 100%. He ultimately died on 25-May-2021 and as per copy of his death certificate he had 4 causes of death as cardiac arrest, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis.  Treatment included, anticoagulants, antibiotics, intubation and ventilator.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

                                                I suffer from lingering SOB with exertion  after COVID infection. On the night of 12/31/2020 I began to feel more SOB than usual and was unable to correct my SOB with rescue inhaler. Became more SOB with exacerbated tachycardia and tachypnea, My family had to call 911 because I became aphasic and showing signs of possible stroke. I was taken to the ER and admitted for respiratory recovery and to role out stroke. The stroke was ruled out and I recovered with IV prednisone therapy, twice daily and supplemental oxygen. Released after HR, BP, &amp; respiratory effort returned to normal: 01/03/2021

I felt weak kneed for about 2 hours afterwards, and was still wobbly knees the next day.   I also had muscle/joint aches the same day, which went away within 24 hours.  In the past 6 days, I have had reoccurring headaches, fatigue, and  this morning, had a severe enough headache to bring on nausea.   I am med compliant with all my meds and I take care of my Type II diabetes,    I am also a volunteer firefighter - advanced EMT, so I know when there is a problem.

                                                I had pain in arm from injection immediately, after injection, which was much different than first dose.  But not unexpected.  But the adverse symptoms started about 5 hours in or so, i developed a cough, and dyspnea, it was tight in my chest, hard to breathe.  the cough was/is (it remains), sometimes hard and raspy, i was a bit wheezy, and I had air hunger, like i could not breathe or get air.  if i exhale to strongly i cough, if i talk to much i cough, if i sing i cough, if i inhale too deeply i cough.  I also have been very dizzy since the shot and vertigo.  I am still coughing and it is 5 days post shot.    I started developing headache and severe body pain, pain in  my spine, low back and joints.  which is expected, but i also had scalp pain and it hurt to be even touched the slightest bit on my scalp and everywhere on my body.  I had very stiff neck and eye socket pain as well.  I also feel &#34;funny&#34; in my head.  LIke dizzy, and vertigo, but also like it is wrapped in a heavy towel and my eyes feel heavy and like i can&#39;t see well.  my vision is as if it has diminshed.    5 hours after shot cough started, and the dyspnea, i started feeling chills and deep squeezing ache in my arm at jab site, and soon had fever of 100.6, over night it went to 100.8 and i felt terrible, headache, body ache, restless.  but next day fever was 102.  it remained all day, i had zero energy slept the whole day.  no appetite, did not eat anything except a scramble egg which made me nausea.  fever remained all day at 101.8. over night.  next day temp was 99.8 (my normal is 97.6) and it was 99.8 all day.  Cough was persistent and really bad with the dyspnea this whole time and i still have cough 5 days out, just giving a timeline here.  by friday, my temp was 98 but i felt extreemly fatigued.  I went and got a covid test which was negative.  i saw the chiropractor and they helped my back and headache a little bit.  went home and rested.  cough has lingered, dizzy lingers, chest tight and sob lingers.  fatigue lingers.   Cough and dyspnea are NOT signs, the sheet i got for V-safe says right on it these are NOT expected.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.    Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 12-Feb-2021, approximately 2 days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    The patient received his vaccine on 12-Feb-2021 and reported that his arm hurt a little for a few days. On 14-Feb2021, he reported that he started feeling sluggish and on 20-Feb-2021 he began to have difficulty breathing and pain in the right lower base of rib cage. He went to urgent care where he was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism for which he received treatment. On the evening of the same day, he again started having difficulty breathing with pain upon inhalation. He returned to urgent care and was subsequently admitted at 12:30 AM on 21-Feb-2021. That  Monday, 22-Feb-2021, a doppler ultrasound revealed a deep vein thrombosis in the left calf. Patient was treated with heparin intravenously (IV). He was discharged 22-Feb-2021.    Treatment for the event included Xarelto 20mg twice per day for two weeks and Heparin IV.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and dyspnea, was considered recovering/resolving as of discharge on 22-Feb-2021.  The outcome of the events, vaccination site pain and sluggishness, were considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

It got progressively worse. By about hour 17 I was beginning to get cold sweats and stomach bothering me more. By hour 18 I was cold, sweating, nauseous, vomiting, hard tight pain in stomach /and sternum/chest.  Stomach / chest pain persisted badly for about 30- 45 minutes then began to subside.  By hour 19 most of the sever pain subsided.  for the rest of the day (@and still 25 hours later) I still have a lingering miserable stomach and slight headache.  I slept most of the afternoon without any medication.

Suffered uncharateristic insomnia the same night.  On 2/23/21, I awoke after 6 hours sleep, with mild body aches and general torpor -malaise.  This progressed into the early afternoon to severe body aches 8/10 on pain scale of 10, a moderate headache of 3/10, excessive drowsiness, extreme diaphoresis, chills, and a temperature spike of 1 degree.  I had very mild motor trembling in upper extremeties (hands) that seemed unassociated with fever.  I took no medications and slept under these general conditions for 80% of the next 48 hours.  The headache did reduce after the 10 hours from onset.

                                                after about 30 minutes, I started having a metallic taste in my mouth.  I was also experiencing soreness in left arm area.   After about an hour, the pain in my arm started to feel as though it was spreading to my left chest cavity area.  I then started to get chest pains in the left breast area to the armpit area, but not severe, just concerning.  After probably 70-80 minutes, I started feeling drowsy.  I continued to feel drowsy all evening and did not sleep well.  I woke up and could not return to sleep at 4:45am.  My normal waking time is 6:00am.  I had/have quite a bit of soreness in my arm, but nothing unbearable.  No signs of rash or inflammation around injection sight.  I am taking a sick day from work to relax and recover from loss of sleep.  The metallic taste persist, but only an annoyance and taste seems to be normal when eating or drinking.  A slight achiness in joints, but a cold front was also moving in, which can cause me to have the same effect.

As he was driving he wasn&#39;t feeling very  well,  I told him maybe we should go sit in the parking lot of the hospital.  We ended up in  parking lot.  He was pale, nauseated and  he thought he was getting a fever (but didn&#39;t)  and was really getting tired like ran down.  So,  he said for me to drive him home so he could lay down.  I got him home I called Dr.  office  I knew these symptoms were normal , but didn&#39;t think on  first dose and that fast... 30 minutes from time of injection to when he got  sick feeling.  The Doctors office just said to watch him for  symptoms if he got worse etc.,  and I asked if this was normal for how fast this happened.  She said there is no normal.   He was cold and covered up when we got home and took a 2 hour nap!  Afterwards, he helped make dinner and was ok just his arm was really sore.

                                                Muscle tightness - soreness - at the arm with the injection and it was for about three and five days. Maybe about 2 weeks from vaccine -  I had some congestion (nasal congestion and sneezing) - it was odd (not allergies) and it lasted a solid with heavy heavy drainage and that lasted about two days. I had to use the Mucinex D for it. Then I had the nose bleed - it wouldn&#39;t stop bleeding in right nostril. I went to ER - Sunday, the 28th - started at 10:30 pm and after midnight on the 29th it was after 4 hours of bleeding when  I went to ED in town. The doctor said my nasal passages were really dry because of the weather. I was using a travel CPAP that doesn&#39;t have a humidifier.  They cleared a giant clot in the back of my throat - it was the size of a hamburger - it was huge. They used a nasal vasodilator - it looked like nasal spray and they did it and stopped. Vitals were stable and they sent me home. I might have one bloody nose after  - a week after and they had given me the nasal vasodilator and that stopped it. They also prescribed a nasal saline spray and I only use the CPAP with the humidifier now.

                                                Patient was given 2nd Moderna vaccine at about 7:30. Patient was pale and diaphoretic and was lowered to the floor by RN and another patient receiving the vaccine who was a cardiologist. He had several beats of clonus and then woke up. He was awake when his first vital signs were obtained. HR 110, BP 190/96, O2 sat 100%. When he was more awake he was assisted in to a reclining chair. BP monitored every few minutes and dropped as low as SBP 104, HR 70-80s. Pt reported that he periodically syncopizes, last 6mo ago. He reported feeling lightheaded after seeing his arm bleed and be swollen after vaccination. After about 1 hours the patient&#39;s vital signs were stable but he continued to have symptoms of lightheadedness which worsened when I sat him up (though BP was stable). EMS was called and he was transported to the ED.

All mucles were sore, but especially the thigh muscles, headache, chills, temp = 100,

MY BLOOD PRESSURE (WHICH I HAVE NEVER HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE) SHOT UP TO 215/120 AND MY HEART RATE SHOT UP TO OVER 115. AFTER PARAMEDICS GAVE ME A BENADRYL, AND AFTER WAITING THERE FOR AN HOUR, I WAS RELEASED TO GO HOME WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO TAKE ANOTHER BENADRYL. I ENDED UP TAKING TWO BENEDRYL WHEN I ARRIVED AT HOME AS MY THROAT WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE. SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD HEART ISSUES (PAIN, TIGHTNESS, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, ANGINA). I AM SEEING MY CARDIOLOGIST ON A REGULAR BASIS DUE TO NOW HAVING SMALL ARTERY DISEASE AFTER MODERNA&#39;S COVID-19 SHOT #1.

                                                In the afternoon, I experienced a nosebleed.  The weather was not overly dry, I was well-hydrated, and I was confused why I would experience a nosebleed.  The bleed was not excessive, and I considered coincidence.  An hour or two later in the late afternoon, my wife noticed that I had a ruptured capillary in my left eye.  She was very concerned since it appeared very bloody even though it did not cause me any significant pain.  The affected eye was mildly itchy afterward.  I was not hit in the eye or scratched it in any way.  I associated the capillary bleeding events as related to each other and potentially related to my vaccination.  However, both events were minor and passed, cleared up in 72 hours.  I have a photo of my eye that is available upon request.

                                                Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in right lower leg.  Symptoms initially occurred about two days after feeling sick with a high fever.  Initially, the pain in the right calf muscle was thought to be a muscle or tendon strain.  On May 22nd, during a campout, there was pain along the entire right leg, but at the time I thought it was just related to lower back pain from sleeping on the ground.  On May 27 and 28th there was sharp pain at the bottom of my right foot, then on May 29th I noticed sweeling and a hard warm spot just above the inside right ankle.  I reported to a local urgent care clinic first  then was referred to Medical ER.

                                                I had pericarditis 2 years ago and 4 days after my 2nd dose of Moderna I felt similar symptoms to when I?d had it. They subsided after a day but came back 3 weeks later. Because of my history of having had Pericarditis I had ultrasound and CT Scan and they showed some inflammation. Blood tests showed  C-reactive Protein levels high (70). On my own I googled if pericarditis was a side effect from vaccine as it was odd to me that my symptoms started so soon after. I read that there have been rare cases reported recently  but mostly in young people and they?ve subsided. Perhaps  because I had it two years ago it triggered a recurrent effect. I was prescribed 600 mg ibuprofen as before by Cardiologist and colchicine as before. My PCP suggested I might want to notify you.  I thought I should report this given what I read and that I&#39;m 55, so it?s different than other reports you?ve received.  I do not know if I have pericarditis again but the symptoms have been identical to when I did and the CRP level increase would suggest so. I had Echo and EKG and heart alright so it&#39;s not Myocarditis. Symptoms included: pain in abdomen chest area, pronounced in URQ this time but it migrated, increased when walking or lying down, difficulty sleeping in side, slightly elevated fever 98.9-95 when I?m usually in  96-98 range, breath hiccups, some nausea. Since taking colchicine and ibuprofen have been feeling better, just concerned that this seemed to have recurred, and started exactly 4 day after my 2nd shot.

                                                Early morning of 5/29/2021, I experienced chills, fever, fatigue. Chills and fever resolved after about 6 hours. Fatigue lasted about 48 hours.  Since then, and still continuing as of the time of this report (6/11/2021), I am experiencing periodic chest tightness that comes and goes. It  often, but not always, increases with physical exertion, but it sometimes is experienced even at rest.  On 6/10/2021, I had a tele-medicine consultation with a doctor who prescribed 600mg ibuprofen 3 times daily for one week to try to resolve suspected myocarditis resulting from the vaccine.

He passed out briefly within about 5-10 minutes after the vaccination. He stated that he was not having difficulty breathing but felt light headed and dizzy and needed to lie down. He was placed on the floor and 911 was called. He was not given an Epi injection as he was not having difficulty breathing. Paramedics arrived and  stated he was in bradycardia and needed to be transported to the hospital. The man refused to ride with the paramedics in the ambulance, but stated that his wife would drive him to the ER.

His symptoms initially improved but then slowly worsened again, developing shortness of breath, palpitations, heat intolerance, and continued polyuria, polydipsia. Three days prior to presenting to our hospital (which was 3 weeks after his 2nd vaccine dose), pt developed worsening nausea with vomiting and substantial worsening of shortness of breath.  On admission to our hospital, he was found to be in Diabetic ketoacidosis (no prior history of Diabetes, auto-immune Diabetes labs pending) as well has having new pulmonary embolism, Atrial fibrillation with RVR, and hyperthyroidism with anti-tpo abs (other&#39;s thyroid antibodies still pending). Given the time course of his presentation, it seems to us that he developed these conditions as a complication of his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                After the 1st dose vaccine, I had a little bit of a sore arm and mild flu like symptoms of low grade fever and headache.  On 5/2/2021,    I started to notice a pain in my leg and went to my normal routine physical and brought that to my doctor&#39;s attention. I was sent to get an ultrasound on 5/6/2021 and 2 blood clots were detected.  DVT thrombosis on my right calf and another behind my right knee.   My 2nd dose of vaccine was schedule for 5/7/2021 and my doctor approved me to go ahead to receive the vaccine (2nd dose Moderna lot #041B21A IM LA).  After getting the vaccine, I went to pick up my prescription (Rivaroxaban) for blood thinner for my blood clots.  I am going to be on that medication for 6 months.  I have also been on Androgel testosterone gel for 10 years which has a warning for blood clots.  My doctor have taken me off of the medication for now.

Extreme migraine headaches started two weeks after first Moderna Covid shot.  Tapered down to low/moderate headache  until second shot a month later when extremeness returned.  Has tapered down to chronic (24/7) mild headache. 3. Moderate vertigo/dizziness persisting 24/7.  Body feels like it&#39;s moving on it&#39;s own. 4. Random heart palpitations, random high blood pressure.  Typically have low blood pressure due to genetics (so low at times I pass out, Cardiogenic Syncope).  5. Caffeine intake exasperates all the above in extreme manner.

                                                Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient&#39;s tachycardia patient&#39;s Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily. (Please note clarification in comparison to discharge home med list.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily was called to pharmacy in place of the metoprolol.)

Daughter reported to ARNP,RN Director Clinical Support on 01/03 the following outcomes:    Patient first exhibited the first signs of reaction started about 60 hours after vaccine: hives only (no difficulty breathing, dizziness, lightheadedness); applied hydrocortisone cream, took diphenhydramine. Patient slept for a few hours then woke up for lunch. Around 12:30-1:00 the patient exhibited three episodes of syncope. Emergency services was called after the first. Firefighters couldn&#39;t find BP, was in 70s by doppler only. Patient taken to hospital for care.    Discharged from ED around 5, suspecting hypotension 2/2 to diphenhydramine use. Monitored vitals at home; became severely hypotensive (BP 70s/40s both with automatic monitor and manual read) and lethargic again about an hour or so after, but normotensive again right before about to call ambulance. Pt claimed to be okay and had some dinner. Fourth episode of syncope, ambulance was called.         Patient remains at hospital ED since, still in observation unit. BP&#39;s normalized but itching returns periodically. IV steroids and diphenhydramine. Took head CT yesterday; no word on the results. Stable and alert enough since yesterday to communicate with us with his phone. Patient is scheduled for an echo to be done today.    No hx of severe allergic reaction. Treated for active TB 30 years ago, shingles x2 in the past few years; otherwise healthy 55 y/o male.     Pt discharged 01/04 to home with fatigue and malaise. Not additional symptoms reported since then. Provider doing full cardiac and neurologic work up.

Patient previously had blood glucose within normal limits and was well controlled for some time. These elevated blood glucose levels lasted approximately one week. He had no other dietary/medication changes during this timeframe. The only change was that he received the vaccine.  He also experienced headache, fatigue and severe injection site pain, peaking at 24 hours post injection.

ON THE 3RD,,4TH AND 5TH DAY POST VACCINE ADMINSTRATION, THE SENSATION OF CHEST SQUEEZING HAS NOT RESOLVED COMPLETELY.  THE REASON I AM REPORTING THIS OCCURRENCE IS THAT SEVERAL CO-WORKERS THAT RECEIVED THE SAME MODERNA VACCINE HAVE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.

The patient&#39;s medical history included daily exercise and no personal or family history of clotting issues and no trauma. Products known to have been used by the patient were not provided.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k20-2a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 30 Jan 2021, approximately 28 days after the first dose, and prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012m20a) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Jan 2021, the patient reports that for the first 18 hours, he experienced fever, chills and myalgia.   On 01 Feb 2021, the patient reports that he thought the myalgia was continuing, as he had pain in his chest and back. The chest pains gradually worsened.  On 05 Feb 20221, the patient went to the emergency room and was admitted.  He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. He was started on enoxaparin sodium but switched to apixaban. A computerized tomography study of the lungs showed that he had bilateral pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct and atelectasis. His dimer was 4800. COVID-19 test was negative.  An echocardiograph was performed, no results were reported. An ultrasound of the legs was performed and ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Date of discharge was not specified.  On an unknown date two days after discharge, the patient experienced left leg pain and returned to the emergency department. Patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis that ran the entire length of the femoral artery. Patient was switched back to enoxaparin sodium and taken off the apixaban. A repeat computerized tomography study was done to see if the pulmonary embolism was progressing and it was not, however, it showed pulmonary effusions. All current lab work was reported as normal, except for an increased prothrombin time. COVID-19 test was negative.  Patient continues to be followed by a pulmonologist and hematologist.  Consent to contact patient, pulmonologist and hematologist was obtained.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, fever/pyrexia, chills, myalgia, chest and back pains, bilateral pulmonary embolism/pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct/pulmonary infarct, ateltheisis/atelectasis, left leg pain, and deep vein thrombosis, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. Company assessed the events to be unlikely related to company product.

This lasted about 36 hours. These symptoms were similar to those I experienced when I had Covid-19 in early December of 2020.

As the day progressed I began to feel body aches, chills, fatigue, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and numbness in my neck, arms, and hands.  These symptoms are still persisting.  The numbness that has since spread throughout my body (from my head to my feet), body joint and muscle pain and burning sensation, muscle cramps and twitching, and continued fatigue.  Additionally, I have had a few of episodes of pressure in my eyes and head resulting in vision issues and issues with my hearing&#34;

His troponins returned to normal and he was discharged with an appointment for outpatient coronary angiogram.  Of note, he did have a Covid19 infection last fall several months prior to vaccination.

                                                On Friday morning I started having chest pains. The pains were sharp and would go away quickly. (Almost immediately) They were from the center of my chest to the right of my chest at about the same level as my heart, I could tell that the pains were NOT coming from my heart, or at least, that is how it seemed. I also felt some pains to the left of the center of my chest, but the pains from the left were fewer and not as pronounced. These pains resulted in my leaving work early (I was on the way to work when they started) and I stayed home from work today. The pains did not continue for more than 4  hours or so, and seemed to dissipate later that day. I did feel some discomfort in my chest this morning. This discomfort was extremely mild and did not last much more than an hour and a half. I feel fine this afternoon, as I am writing this note. I have been eating, urinating and have had normal bowl movements today, so I think I am okay. You might be mindful of these chest pains the Moderna vaccine is causing. The pains were sharp and noticeable. I did not call my Doctor because it did not seem necessary. Thank you.

I should add to the other that my blood pressure has elevated since the vaccine.  As part of going on medication on 3/18, it was a concern the medications would elevate my blood pressure.  I bought a wrist BP check device and it was averaging 134/95 on 3/22/2021.  On 3/23/2021, I was prescribed Losartan.  I took one pill at 7:30PM.  Today when I woke up and for most of the day the BP has been 124/77-82.  The ringing remains persistent

The hospital discovered a coronary artery embolism with myocardial infarction.  I was taking a blood thinner at the time so the blood clout should not have formed to begin with.   No heart disease was found and once clout was removed by heart function returned.  I had had my first COVID-19 shot the Thursday before the event so I thought I should report the event in case there&#39;s a connection.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications included dolutegravir sodium;lamivudine, pregabalin, and modafinil for unknown indication.  On 19 Feb 2021, approximately two days prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 011M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Feb 2021, after receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt unusually tired for midafternoon that day. The patient had suffered from chronic fatigue issues but never felt more tired than usual at that point in the day. The patient then experienced a black out and woke up face down with a bloody nose and head. The patient felt very dizzy, was not able to walk and crawled to their mattress and fell asleep. The patient managed to get himself to the Emergency room, a CT scan of the head was performed, and it was revealed that the patient had a fracture that had occurred before the vaccine and was not related to the vaccine. The doctor thought the vaccine however maybe related to the blackout or have exaggerated a concussion and have caused these delayed symptoms. No treatment information was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the event experienced a black out was resolved at the time of this report and the outcome of the events, felt unusually tired for midafternoon, woke up face down with a bloody nose and head, was very dizzy and couldn&#39;t walk was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and patient&#39;s skull fracture that had occurred before the vaccine the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-057947:Second Dose Case

                                                After 1 hour I started  Serious AFIB issues. I had not had serious AFIB since March 2020 That was the time I had surgery to correct it. The time of the shot and the AFIB is NOT a coincidence. I suffered through this attack until Wednesday March 24. On advice through Dr.&#39;s nurse I went to the emergency room at the hospital. After 3 hours  and IV&#39;s to reduce my heart rate I was okay to go home. This is still happening periodically since the ER visit where it was EXTREMELY rare before.  I have decided NOT to get the 2nd dose as I am worried I will have to go to the ER again. Will one dose be enough to combat the virus? Please e-mail an answer if possible.

I sat down and started sweating, after that my wife said she was asking me if I was ok and she said I was staring straight ahead and moaning then my eyes rolled back in my head and I was unconscious. My wife called 911 and was trying to get me to respond but no response. While she was yelling get an ambulance I came to and I asked my wife who are you calling. She told me I was unconscious for several minutes. I went to the ER via ambulance due to the symptoms. The paramedics thought I had a blood clot or heart attack.

I also had heart palpitations and the medic personnel took my heart monitor, it was 80bpm. About 45 minutes of monitoring,  my symptoms were slowly going away and I went back to work. That same night I felt fine and by the next morning I was feeling much better.

Patient reports he takes supplements as concomitant medications Patient was prescribed clonazepam for his anxiety and took ibuprofen for his symptoms. Patient went to the ER two weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, he was checked out, ran some tests and everything was within normal limits. Blood work was normal.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Company comment: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills and pyrexia are consistent with the product safety profile.

                                                Two days after second shot, I began experiencing pain in my chest, especially sharp when cough, sneeze or hiccup.  I went to see Dr. on March 10 and he diagnosed as a recurrent pericarditis.  I had a case approximately 2 years earlier.  He said it would take longer for it to go away this time.  I&#39;ve been under his care ever since, and the pain has never subsided.  I am now in an extended timeframe of having the pain and do not believe it to be a coincidence.

                                                5 days after first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, pt noticed his leg was swelling and told his doctor that his leg was swollen at a routine doctor visit that was scheduled ahead of time prior to vaccine. The doctor told the patient to go next door to vascular clinic. They did an ultrasound and found an acute DVT and chronic deep vein thrombosis. Pt was put on Eliquis the same day (4/12/21) to treat the issue. Mild swelling is still present in leg, but pt was cleared by Dr. to receive second dose which he did on 5/5/21.

Issue built up/recurred every 2 to 3 hours throughout the day. Also, had sinus pressure on left side and maybe post nasal drip (felt it and had the vague taste of iron in my mouth). Issue resolved itself overnight. After clearing my nose  in the morning on 04/26, I was good.  Also, I had a sore arm around the injection site, starting about 6 hours or so after injection, lasting about 2 days

                                                On 4-18-21, 17 days after 1st dose of Moderna, he developed upper abdomen pain, chest discomfort. He thought it was indigestion and treated it as such. When he got no relief he went to Emergency room where a cardiac alert was initiated. After he died I was told he had developed myocarditis,/pericarditis and they had to remove a liter of blood from the sac around his heart, but that his heart had gone into cardiogenic shock and that he died. They were prepared to insert a stint thinking he had a blocked coronary artery, but his arteries were clear and they had no idea what had caused this to happen.  When he died so soon after the vaccine there were people who wanted to blame the vaccine but I checked into it and there were NO links between the vaccine and myocarditis, pericarditis or cardiogenic shock.  Within a few weeks of his death, there began to be possible links between the vaccine and myocarditis. I know 55 is older than what is being looked at, but he had absolutely no previous cardiac history prior to this and this case should e looked at as well

This presentation required brief hospitalization for treatment of a presumed cellulitis and further diagnostic workup of fevers and lymphadenopathy.  The patient was treated with antibiotics for cellulitis and empirically for possible tick-borne illness (early Lyme, glandular tularemia) with notable improvement in the skin erythema and fevers.

                                                This is a 55 yo male who contacted his care team on 4/28/21 to report that following his covid vaccine (Moderna dose #2 on 4/24/21), he developed Afib (symptoms = palpitations).  Patient does have a history of Afib, diagnosed in 2011, last seen by cardiology in 2017.  Patient reports that he will have Afib episodes every few months, they last 6-10 hours (with palpitations), then he self-converts back.  In this current episode, it has been persistent.  He was advised to report to ED and f/u with his cardiologist.  No notes regarding an ED visit.  Cardiology visit took place on 5/5/21.  BP=134/90, HR=147, Ht=77in, wt=162.8kg; Labs wnl except chol=224, Trig=180, LDL=142.  EKG=Afib with RVR, rate 125bpm.  Patient was initiated on anticoagulation (apixaban) and completed a cardioversion and TEE on 5/13/21.  Patient was managed on diliazem and flecainide. On 5/18, patient called to report he was back in Afib, however he self converted within 24hr.  Although patient has a history of Afib and the vaccine is not a clear cause, I will report to VAERS as a potentially clinically significant event.

Called supervisor to take to ER works as Paramedic, was in brady cardia normally does not have heart problems nor ever had brady cardia. Admitted to hospital, was on prednisone and benzos, for a few days. Was in contact with neuro and endocrinologist.  I was very angry with this happened I tried calling Mederna, Mederna read him the info about not being able to sue them. He waited three months before Mederna asked for records, CDC did nothing. Very angry about the fact that nothing was set up to help people with severe reactions to the vaccines. No one wanted to listen to him. Endocrinologist said this is not normal and they continued to push forward and it was proven that it was attributed to the vaccine.  Nerve damage underneath the right eye from the Bells Palsy.

It got progressively worse and 2 days later, I felt like my blood sugar was high and it was 507 and this was taking Metformin. So I went to the hospital. They were able to get my BS under control. the next day it was high again and they had me come back. I went to the ER 2 days in a roll. For my arthritic pain the hospital prescribed muscle relaxer. My real concern was my blood sugar being so high, but they were able to get it under control. I still have joint pain.

                                                I got the shot at 3pm. I started feeling &#34;off&#34; in stomach/chest around 7-8pm. By 3am, my stomach/chest did not feel good at all and I had trouble sleeping. It was definitely not heart related. By 8am I felt chills coming on. By 9am I was fully dressed, with two blankets on, and lying on couch shaking for 20-30 minutes. Later a fever started and it reached about 102.3 before subsiding late afternoon. By 8pm, I felt blah but fever was gone. During that entire time I felt achy overall (similar to what I felt like 2 hours after running a marathon).  I didn&#39;t have headaches (and rarely do), but area around my eyes were heavy and tired. Weirdly, at times, the top 1/2 of both ears hurt.   I experience about every symptom I had as when I had Covid and went to hospital for 26 days except for the breathing issues.

                                                &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34;    Hypersensitivity &amp; fleeting / flowing pains spread throughout left side of body from tip of nose across face, up and down neck and left side of head out through fingers of left hand, down left side of back, down left thigh / leg and out through toes of left foot.  It was as if the left side of my body was in a different time zone than the right side.  I called the nurse line; they suggested a visit to the ER.  My BP was way up, and I panicked just a little; but, tried to use my mindfulness practice to observe the unfolding events, rather than being consumed by them.  There was a CT of my skull wherein they found indications of &#34;an old&#34; stroke; so, they decided that it was possible I had a stroke.  I was transferred from the Medical Center to the Stroke Center at the Medical Center under the care of Dr.  Another CT with contrast and a MRI confirmed &#34;OLD&#34; stroke, but nothing new.  I was assured the vaccine had nothing to do do with my symptoms, and that I most likely experienced a Trans Ischemic Attack (TIA), and that the situation was merely a coincidence as they believe the vaccine had nothing to do with the TIA.  However, based on my personal experience of the events as they unfolded, it is my sincere belief that the vaccine was incidental to the effects as I experienced them.  I was kept overnight for further observation, released the next day, and had a follow-up with my primary care physician at the Med Center.  I am now taking an 81 mg aspirin, Plavix, and 80 MG Clopidogrel as a precaution, and my symptoms have been gradually fading away.

Patient arrived in ED on 3/4/21 at approx 9AM via ambulance.  ED physician note:  &#34;56-year-old male brought in by EMS intubated with CPR in progress.  It was reported that he arrived to work and then passed out.  CPR was initiated almost immediately.  BLS determined that he was  pulseless and AED was applied.  He was defibrillated twice.  He was then intubated by ALS and administered epinephrine twice with return of spontaneous circulation.  He maintained a pulse for approximately 20 minutes when he again developed cardiac arrest.  ACLS guidelines were again initiated and there was no return of pulse for approximately 20-25 minutes until he arrived in the emergency department.  Emergency department CPR was continued and he was administered an additional epinephrine with return of a pulse.  Is reported that he had no complaints prior to the event.&#34;  Patient was intubated and ventilated, started on norepinephrine drip in ED.  Twelve-lead EKG demonstrated right bundle branch block with left posterior fascicular block and diffuse QRS widening and diffuse repolarization abnormalities.  Family consented to Cath Lab.    Per Interventional Cardiologist note:  &#34;1.  Angiography demonstrated proximal to mid LAD hazy 90-95% lesion likely culprit for cardiac arrest.  1 stent placed.  2.  Diffuse distal right coronary disease that is likely nonculprit for cardiac arrest.  3.  Left ventriculography demonstrated severe anterior wall hypokinesis with overall left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%.  4.  Patient electrically and hemodynamically stable.  Levophed has been stopped.  Amiodarone bolus given in the Cath Lab for frequent ventricular ectopy.  No drip was continued due to resolution of ectopy.  5.  Dyslipidemia he will be on high-dose statin therapy.  6.  Diabetic management as per primary team.  7.  Quad-Lumen placed by me.  Hypothermia protocol to be initiated in the ICU given GCS score less than 8 with no purposeful movements.  Head CT scan completed before cardiac catheterization that demonstrated diffuse cerebral edema.  8.  Prognosis guarded and likely poor.  The next 24 to 40 hours will be critical.  Family was updated in detail.&#34;  Patient transferred to ICU post Cath Lab.  Remains intubated, ventilated in ICU.

Then I had fatigue and then at about 14 hours after the injection, I started having chills - like I had temperature with hot and cold chills. I got very cold; my blood pressure dropped - I happened to have a doctor appt the day following the vaccine - the bottom level was very low of my blood pressure - it was 45. I couldn&#39;t warm up - my extremities were very cold. I had chest pain and it felt like my heart rate was going in an out of atrial fibulation. I had shortness of breath. I measured my blood oxygen concentration and had dropped down to 90%. I didn&#39;t sleep well because I was so chilled and not feeling well. I felt like I had a bad flu. I rested the next day (10th) the symptoms slowly went away between 10 am and 1:00. At 3:00 pm, I saw my pain doctor and I told him about it but I was feeling much better although blood pressure was low. Fatigue lasted for 3-5 days afterwards but it wasn&#39;t anything last the first 24 hours. I didn&#39;t go to ER because it seemed to resolve itself in the day.

                                                Three days after the vaccination I started having severe nightmares and vivid violent dreams that prevent me from sleeping. They happen 5-6 times a night and each time my body experiences an Adrenaline rush. I jump from my sleep with high pulse and elevated blood pressure. It subsides quickly after I am awake. But then after I fall back to sleep and within one hour, the event repeats. I wake up again and again. The sleep has become very light and filled with violent dreams that I can remember vividly.

I had fever, chills, rapid pulse (108 bpm normally runs 70), &amp; chest tightness. Almost called ambulance because of the pulse and chest tightness. Within a couple hours of waking up I also began to have muscle cramps in my feet, toes, and thighs. Worse than I have ever experienced  and I have been diagnosed with PAD for over 10 years. I tried to get some sleep. I couldn&#39;t. My PCP also did not like the way my lungs sounded that morning at the Clinic. I was told after a xray that my lungs were ok. My injection site has been sore until today. It is better. I did have Covid in October 2020.

                                                I was feeling fine/normal prior to vaccine injection on 4/26/21.  In the middle of the night on 4/27 I woke up due to severe pain in my right ankle, right knee and right hip.  It was a full blown Rheumatoid Arthritis flair up.  I couldn&#39;t walk, required crutches to move from room to room.  Right knee was swollen.  Right foot became numb which has not happened to me with previous flair ups.  Blood pressure was taken and running high.  Called on line doctor and she recommended going to ER.  I sent my Rheumotolgist doctor an email.  I have yet to hear back.  Symptoms began subsiding around 3pm on 4/27.  I am able to walk now without crutches.  Swelling has subsided in right knee.  Right foot is still

                                                4/30/21- Pt is a 56yo White male who presented to the Clinic for 1st Moderna vaccine via MyTurn registration. Patient answered No to all of the vaccination screening questions on MyTurn. At 1000, patient was checked in by staff. Immunization was administered approximately at 1002. Around 1007, the clinic providers were called for emergency response by CORE team member who was stationed at the observation area because this patient lost consciousness, fell down, and hit his head.  NP arrived to the scene with Emergency Epinephrine pen and benadryl tablets. RN was already at scene and assessed for patient&#39;s consciousness. EMS was called by Google volunteer. Patient was seated in the chair, being monitored by the clinic and CORE team member. Pt was unresponsive and actively undergoing tonic seizure-like activity with sustained posturing of bilateral hands in decorticate &#34;cup&#34; position. Patient&#39;s eyes were open during entire seizure-like activity, but unresponsive to stimuli. Inflamed abrasions were noted on patient&#39;s right temporal lobe, right cheek, and bilateral lower extremities near the knees. No active bleeding was seen.  At 1008, Pt regained consciousness after 10 seconds of seizure activity and began to answer RN&#39;s questions. Patient stated that he was &#34;fine&#34; and answered that he knew his current location &#34;at the vaccination site.&#34; Pt was unaware that he lost consciousness, fell to the ground, and hit his head. Pt denied any active medical illnesses, hx of seizures, or reactions to prior vaccinations. Pt stated that he drove here to the appointment. Patient was given bottle of water, which he started drinking. NP measured pt with pulse oximeter, reading 98% O2 Saturation and 61bpm for heart rate.  NP arrived to the scene. The medical staff RN, NP, and NP advised for patient to stay and wait for EMS out of concern for his own safety and the safety of others because he will be driving home. We informed pt that EMS has already been called and for him to stay hydrated while waiting. Pt stated &#34;I do not want to go to the hospital&#34; and refused EMS evaluation. I informed pt that due to sustained head injury, LOC, and seizure activity, we highly advise for patient to seek further medical evaluation. Pt refused and walked away from the observation area to his car.  Adverse Reaction was reported to VAERS and CMO of the clinic.

Patient reports that paramedics had to come after he passed out.   Treatment of the events included acetaminophen.  Company comment: This case concerns a 56-year-old male with a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness, and nonserious unexpected blood pressure decreased, feeling hot, hyperhidrosis, dizziness, lethargy and expected pain in extremity. Event onset the same day as first dose mRNA-1273. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He states that within a week he started having pain in his left foot that eventually moved up to just below his knee.  This included swelling.  He saw his physician, who began treating him for gout.  His also said that he felt off and insisted that his doctor checks his blood sugar, although he had no previous issues with his blood sugars.  He came back at a 241.  He is now taking allopurinol and metformin.  The pain and swelling in his left leg is subsiding now.  He did go thru one period of 4 days where he said he could not stand on his left leg.  He was due for his second shot today, 5/24/21, but chose not to out of caution, until his doctor figures out what is going on.  Also, his dietician recommended he not get the vaccine at this time

                                                A friend texted me today at 1231 on 1-11-21 asking me how I was doing following the COVID vaccination given 10 Jan 21 which we both received.  In subsequent texts he disclosed that he was had difficulty sleeping last night due to fever and 7/10 chest pain. He took motrin 800mg and ½ of a Percocet, but did not relieve chest pain. He denied any SOB and he described his pulse as wnl. He also noted dizziness, sweating and left arm pain. He denied hx of HTN, but did relate a history of dyslipidemia which he felt was controlled. I then contacted him by phone and he verified his text messages. As he is over 50 yo and has symptoms suggestive of an Acute Coronary Syndrome he was advised to take aspirin and call 911...He was seen at Hospital, ER  on 1-11-21. A mediastinal mass was noted on imaging. This mass was initially thought to be the cause of his chest pain and not related to his Covid vaccination. He was later seen by a thoracic surgeon with follow-up imaging showing significant decrease in the size of the mass raising the possibility in may be inflammatory or infectious in nature. He continues to be followed and has not had any surgeries for this condition.  His thoracic surgeon is:   MD thoracic surgery Specialized cancer program   Hospital  Name of a cancer institute Listed Address Listed phone number and fax number

                                                Patient received first dose Moderna vaccine on  3/31/2021. Approximately two weeks after receiving the first Moderna vaccine patient states he started to have pain in the lower leg which was not normal. Pain increased to a point that patient seeked care and was evaluated for a blood clot which he was told was &#34;negative&#34; as no clot was initially found. On 4/28/2021 Patient presented to pharmacy to receive second dose. Pharmacist asked how patient tolerated first dose to which he replied he had no issues, so the second dose was administered. AFTER the second dose, patient did state he was seen by a CNP for leg pain but a clot was ruled out. Approximately 3 weeks after the second dose of Moderna vaccine the patients leg pain increased to a point that he presented to the local ER and it was determined at that visit that he did indeed have a large blood clot in the leg and a second smaller clot in the upper thigh. He was sent home on Eliquis. He subsequently presented to another ER approximately one week later for uncontrolled leg pain due to massive size of blood clot in leg. At this point, patient is at home recovering.

G17-C21A and G26-B21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Smoker (30&#43; years of smoking.) and Vapor cigarette smoker (vaping the past two years.). Concomitant products included BENZTROPINE [BENZATROPINE], FLUOXETINE, TAMSULOSIN, CLONAZEPAM, AMLODIPINE and LURASIDONE HYDROCHLORIDE (LATUDA) for an unknown indication.   On 05-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-May-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 12-Apr-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passing out, dry cough so bad that he would faint) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FALL (Stood up to cough, passed out, and fell and his head hit the concrete), HEAD INJURY (Head hit the concrete floor, hitting head on floor) and COUGH (Bad, dry cough). On 12-May-2021, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passing out, dry cough so bad that he would faint) and COUGH (Bad, dry cough) had resolved. At the time of the report, FALL (Stood up to cough, passed out, and fell and his head hit the concrete) and HEAD INJURY (Head hit the concrete floor, hitting head on floor) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Went to get tested for COVID-19 due to dry, bad cough and came back negative.         The patient stated that approximately one week after the first dose, he was having a bad dry cough.  The dry cough was so bad that when he was sitting on recliner he would cough so bad, he would faint and pass out. One time the patient stood up to cough, passed out, and fell and his head hit the concrete floor. He went to emergency department three times because of this cough. On 12 MAY 2021, the patient stopped experiencing coughing and passing out. The patient also stated that he has no other side effects and that his healthcare provider thinks this experience was attributed to the first vaccine. Patient was prescribed an &#34;inhaler&#34; from his healthcare provider to help with &#34;lungs and stuff.&#34;  The patient also has an appointment with a pulmonologist in June.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  Head injury was due to fall and thus cannot be directly associated with mRNA-1273 use.  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded   This case was linked to MOD-2021-138832 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Head injury was due to fall and thus cannot be directly associated with mRNA-1273 use.

No reaction 1st 15 minutes.    5/15/21 - small fever in the evening    5/16/21  In bed all day with Fever and Fatigue.     5/20/21 Becoming short of breathe going upstairs in my residence.   Complained to my wife after a couple of days saying I was getting winded just climbing the stairs.   I thought maybe it was  common chest cold.   5/29/21 1:00 am - woke up to 102 degree fever.    Fever went down to 99 and up to 100.8 over the next 4 days cycling throughout the day and night.     Shortness of breath was getting a little worse and it would take 10 seconds to recover going up the stairs in my home, after several deep breathes.    June 1st, I went to CVC pharmacy to take a COVID19 test.   The scheduled me for the next morning, June 2, 2021 at 10:00 am.   I completed that test and returned home.  At about 2:00 - 2:30 pm, I stood up from the couch and walked out to my front porch.  I bent over to pick up some light items from the porch so the gardener could trim the bushes near the porch.  As I walked to the garage (main front 2 car entrance), I suddenly became very short of breathe, my heart began racing, and I could not get a full breathe.    I walked slowly inside my house and used my blood pressure cuff and oximeter.  Blood pressure was at 170/121  heart rate 112, and the oximeter showed oxygen level 75  %SPo2 with heart rate 110.    I was taken directly to the Emergency Room where X-ray and CT scans showed I had numerous blood clots throughout my lung arteries.   I am on oxygen and blood thinners for an indefinite amount of time.

                                                I had a  Lifeline screening ( they did an EKG and a Carotid and Blood tests on me) after  the vaccine- I got a odd reading on a c-reactive protein - inflammation and infection in the body - Can get those records from them. Started taking my blood pressure and I noticed thing weren&#39;t right with my heart. I went to my doctor   his office clinic  they are moving their office, though next month) with a federally funded program for the testosterone  replacement therapy- he had give me testosterone replacement therapy which I have since stopped with recommendation by the cardiologist - it makes my blood very thick ) and he told me I had A-Fib - gave me samples of Xarelto and he said to come back on Monday and confirmed the A-Fib. doctor cardiologist and he confirmed A-Fib and recommended a procedure - to reset the heart with the paddles - I haven&#39;t done that yet. Since then,  I have had chronic fatigue, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing; I think it&#39;s related to my heart. I am taking naps every day. I wake up and I&#39;m just wasted. I go run errands and then I&#39;m exhausted. Chronic fatigue. I will be seeing my  brand new primary care doctor on Thursday and I want to talk to Doctor provided me with a whole bunch of diagnoses for all of it. They are saying on the diagnoses paperwork that I could have &#34;blood cancer.&#34; But it could come from TRT treatment. Dental at first and then went to Affordable Dental - Periodontal work done - there was an infection there and they gave me antibiotic mouthwash. I will be going back in three months. I have not recovered from A-Fib - have to get Cardio Version test and I have chronic fatigue - it comes and goes. The blood cancer - I haven&#39;t had a chance to talk to anyone about it yet and no one has been in touch with me about it.  I went to Hospital ER the other day - mostly to get a more accurate diagnosis - I do have chemical disorder history in past. I had mental confusion - it was chemical - it was just like what I had in 2000. But hospital misdiagnosed it.

The next morning I woke with lower leg pain in my R leg. I thought it may be a pulled muscle as I work out at a gym 5 days a week. The pain persisted as did some swelling in my lower leg so I sought out a medical opinion thinking it may be a torn muscle. I was finally able to get in to see a DR. on 4/1/2021 at which time an ultrasound was ordered which showed multiple blood clots in my R leg (Ankle, Calf and behind the knee). I was immediately placed on XARELTO. I have never had any issues before with clotting. Dr. referred me to Oncologist. Dr. examined me and the ultrasound test results and agreed with the assessment. I have follow a up scheduled with both doctor&#39;s. I have been on XARELTO since. I did get the second COVID shot because both doctor&#39;s could not agree as to if I should or should not get it.

I told the  RN was having a reaction. I had brought my liquid benadryl in case I might have a reaction due to my severe food allergies. I immediately drank 50 mg of benadryl.  In 2 to 3 minutes my heart rate came down and I felt better. I was able to leave and drive home. I am an RN myself so I knew how to manage this situation.

Patient has no prior history of sudden acute numbness in arm and did not report any recent injury to his arm. Neurologist evaluated patient for possible stroke and patient was unable to lift right wrist and hand. Patient was able to lift both arms overhead, lift both legs, smile normal, open and close mouth and move tongue.  Both CT Scan and MRI were normal. Neurologist and emergency medical specialist determined that patient did not have a stroke and diagnosed acute brachial plexus palsy possibly due to patient sleeping in an awkward position. Emergency specialist said it was unlikely but could not rule out the possibility of an adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine, which patient had received 10 days earlier (second dose, see details above.)

I asked patient what happened and he stated that suddenly he felt dizzy and that he was anxious about the vaccine from the beginning and excited to get it at the same time, then I measured the blood pressure  it was 125/61 with pulse of 45/min.I offered him and his wife to call 911 but they declined it. I asked him to go back to my consultation area so he could lie down on the floor and raise his legs up so we can bring back the blood pressure up, he did that, and he went with me over there and laid down on the floor and we raised his legs up,later I measured his blood pressure again, and it was 113/71 with pulse 51/minute, I offered again to call 911 but he refused and he said that he was feeling better. I left him about 10 more minutes,then he started to get up and sit by the chair and I re-measured the blood pressure  and it was 121/76 with pulse of 54/minute, he started to drink water. He stated he felt better than he was about 20 minutes ago, then they left once their driver came to pick them up.

The chills, flu like symptoms, cough and chest congestion continue to linger on a week after the vaccine was received.  I am not running a fever however I do feel feverish. I still feel tired and have no energy.  I contacted my primary health on Friday 3/12 concerning the pain in my chest cavity from extreme coughing attacks.  I was instructed to take some Tylenol and Mucinex.

Had plenty of water/fluids throughout the night. urinated often about ever 1 3/4 hrs-I cath and good at it (big prostate) and use a bucket.  Had a nasty headache by 3am and while cathing I stayed low because I felt real sick sweaty nauseous and went blind passed out, covered with half quart of urine, woke up on the floor with face against the wall-didn&#39;t know anything for a few seconds. Went back to bed-headache lasted for about four days.

                                                About 12 hours after getting the second Moderna dose, while trying to sleep, my heart rate was 100-110, with the feeling of repeated PVCs in my heart.  I knew this feeling because I had dealt with episodes of repeated PVCs (and later PACs) from about 2016 to February 2020.  After being in the hospital in February 2020 for life-threatening sepsis, pneumonia, and strep, the arrhythmias stopped completely.  I had been trying to control the episodes by taking atenolol 25mg/d; upon realizing that the PVC episodes had stopped, I terminated the medication.  So at about 1AM on 3/7/2021 or so, I noticed the PVCs and the rapid heart rate and could not sleep.  Fever went up to 102.4, thirsty and possibly dehydrated. Went to ER at 7am.  Tests showed repeated PVCs.  Kidney function was slightly abnormal.  Started taking atenolol through Tuesday, 3/9.  Heart monitor halter showed PVCs continued through Tuesday.  By Thursday, 3/11, it was apparent that the PVCs had stopped and heart rate was normal.  I stopped the atenolol and the irregular heartbeat has not returned.

One week later I started developing lighter patches of skin on my forehead and around the outer edges of both eyes.  I have been diagnose with very mild case of vitiligo (1%) on my face about 4-5 years ago but it went into remission.  Now it has seem to resurface after my first shot but only around the areas as I described which I have never had these areas effected by vitiligo. My question should I get the second and final round of the vaccine?

He was breathing and had a pulse, but eyes were open in a blank stare and he did not respond to verbal or to gentle shaking. After a few minutes he came out of it and said he was feeling better. A few minutes later, the episode happened again. Emergency responders was called and the pharmacist continued to monitor him until paramedics arrived. The episode happened again while paramedics were attending to him and he was taken to the hospital. Patient did return about 6 hours later looking much better and thanked the staff who helped him.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 09 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine the patient had sore arm. On an unspecified date in Jan 2021, the patient had experienced a pull in his muscle in his calf and lower calf area got swollen. On 09 Feb 2021, after receiving the second dose of vaccine he had experienced a sore arm. On 11 Mar 2021, his leg got really swollen and on 12 Mar 2021, he visited hospital where it got diagnosed as DVT in his right lower calf. Treatment for the events included blood thinner Apixaban. Patient is concerned about possibility of indirect relation of events to the vaccine.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the event DVT, leg got really swollen, swelling of the lower calf area and calf pain were unknown at the time of this report. The event pulled a muscle is not resolved. The event sore arm which the patient experienced for both the doses got resolved on 13 Jan and 14 Jan 2021, respectively.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association a causal association between the event of sore arm and the administration of mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The evens of DVT , pulled muscle and swelling of lower calf is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Events were all attributed to muscle strain.

The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation and had a pacemaker placed about 8-9 months ago.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event were blood pressure medication, antiarrhythmics.  On 01 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030m20a) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01 Mar 2021, after vaccination, the patient developed red dots on both of his arms. For next two days, the patient had rash on both arms, was dizzy, felt sick, developed fast heart rate; went to hospital twice for heart rate either 07 Mar 2021 or 13 Mar 2021.During first visit to hospital, fast rate was brought under control, while in the second visit, the patient had a procedure in which his heart was cut from top to bottom and was made pacemaker dependent. The atrial fibrillation could not be controlled for 26 hours and had a flutter which was not identified and could not be controlled. Flutter returned after stopping amlodipine and hence patient was restarted on amlodipine. The patient now feels very weak, has a hard time walking, has no energy, cannot do the simplest of tasks, still experiences fast heart rate and flutter every now and then.   No Laboratory investigations were provided. The Treatment information included pacemaker, amlodipine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cardiac pacemaker dependent, atrial fibrillation, red dots on both of his arms, rash on both arms, dizziness, sick, atrial flutter, very weak and no energy, hard time walking, cannot do the simplest of tasks were unknown.

After discussing with patient and patients spouse, agree that patient needs to be seen by either PCP, Dr. or go to ER. At the time pt did not wish to go to ER. Wife proceeded to call Dr.&#39;s office to see about getting him in. Pt then started to feel worse and like he needed to go to ER. offered to call for an ambulance, pt refused as his wife could take him and would probably be quicker. staff offered diphenhydramine and pt declined, stating he would wait until he got to ER for treatment. Pt appeared very anxious and nervous. transported him via wheelchair to his vehicle at 1620, his wife then drove him to ER. 04/09/2021 at 0828  I left a voicemail with pt for follow up.  0830 I called to get follow up on pt. I spoke with the nurse that treated the patient. Pt did indeed come to ER and was treated for a reaction. He was given a dose of benadryl and solumedrol. Pt verbalized feeling like he was having a severe anxiety attack and that his adrenaline was really high. Nurse stated that she agreed with him. Pt was later discharged that evening. No epinephrine use reported.

                                                Patient presented to the ED after being found down outside. Initially hypotensive, was intubated in ED. Required increasing pressor support. Found to have profound anion gap metabolic acidosis with lactate peaking at &gt;27. Initial workup also significant for WBC 40s, AKI with Cr peak at 2.5. Transaminitis likely 2/2 shock liver. Toxicologic workup was negative for alcohol, Tylenol, salicylates, urine drug screen. Blood cultures grew S. hominis. Other infectious workup including covid, hepatitis, hiv, rocky mountain spotted fever, respiratory panel, GI PCR, all negative. Also found to have a PE which was removed via thrombectomy. Developed DIC requiring multiple transfusions of cryo, FFP, and RBCs. Condition improved slowly with lactate downtrending currently and pressor requirement weaning.

A few weeks later May 9,2021; I noticed discomfort and swelling in the same lower left leg and my, medical alert service dog, kept alerting to it.  I had a regular appointment with my cardioligist on May 10,2021 and advised of my issue and he ordered an ultrasound. The ultra sound revealed blood clots on my llower left leg.  I have never had clotting issues in my life and absolutely believe that this colt was caused by the Moderna vaccine, since i have been on anticoagulants and asprin theray since 2008.

By that evening, headache evolved into a migraine and needed bed rest.  Also started to develop a fever.  About 99.5 deg.  Around that time, several hours after vaccination, heart began to race and had mild chest pains.  Chest pain subsided a couple of hours later.  Headache/ migraine persisted until the next day.  The following day, 24 hours after vaccination, headache subsided but I developed fever 101.5 deg. and chills.  This lasted about 24 hours.  All symptoms subsided after about 48 hours.

                                                Patient admitted with high grade AV block, sinus pause, and recurrent syncope. 57-year-old white male with PMH only of cigarette use who notes about 2 weeks of generalized malaise, then in the last 24 hours has had 2 syncopal episodes that were accompanied by diaphoresis only without other prodrome.  He got his second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 5/28/21, then on the following day had been working in the barn without any dyspnea chest pain or shortness of breath but felt generally fatigued so went to take a nap.  He got up to check his temperature, then &#34;just hit the floor&#34;.  Not preceded by blackout of vision, lightheadedness, chest pain, dyspnea palpitations, nausea but was accompanied by sweats.  He believes he was out only briefly, and when he awoke was not confused and did not have tongue biting or loss of bladder or bowel continence.  He then got up and went about his day normally, then around 2 AM awoke to let the dogs out and had an identical event, but this time hit his chin on a chain saw on the floor and suffered a laceration. He presented to ED for evaluation where his laceration was sutured. He is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Initial labs and diagnostics are unrevealing and an EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm without acute or chronic ischemic changes.  Noncontrast CT of the head and the face showed no evidence of bony damage, no intracranial bleed or large territory infarct. While in the ED, the patient had a brief bradycardic episode accompanied by diaphoresis although a dedicated strip is not available and it is unclear what his rhythm was.  He did not syncopize.  Hospitalist service was asked to accept for syncope evaluation. When admitting physician saw patient, he reported feeling completely well without any other issues.  He does note he had about 2 weeks of malaise before all of this started and a mild decrease in his ability to work intensely, but had attributed this to cigarette smoking.  Review of systems was essentially negative.  He is a hobby farmer and has had a couple of tick bites this year. While admitting physician was in the room at the end of the visit, the patient had an episode of diaphoresis and went into a high-grade second-degree AV block with disappearance of atrial activity without ventricular escape and lost consciousness for about a second.  No jerking or twitching observed.  The episode a couple of seconds then self terminated and the patient awoke and completely recovered mentation and was in a sinus rhythm.  He was diaphoretic and felt ill afterward this.  He had no chest pain or dyspnea. Immediately after the episode with repeat vitals the patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 70s and a normal sinus rhythm and blood pressure is 136/80.  Oxygen saturations are preserved. Not on any rate limiting agents either here in emergency department or at home. Patient found to have P-P interval prolongation with AV block and subsequent sinus arrest possibly situational in the setting of coming off of a colonoscopy and receiving second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. A pacemaker was placed 6/1/2021 without complication and the patient was discharged in stable condition on 6/2/2021.

                                                I woke up on Saturday morning with whole body soreness, but this passed by that afternoon.  Saturday night through to Sunday, I had chest pains on my entire left side.  This worsened all of Sunday and I developed dyspnea (shortness of breath) if I tried to lay down on my back or side along with the pain.  I could not sleep or rest Sunday to Monday night so I had to prop myself forward over a bundle of pillows in order to rest.  Monday I still had some pain though less, but the dyspnea was more pronounced with any moderate exertion.  I called the medical director where I work to ask for advice.  He told me it was ok to take an antihistamine.  I had taken nothing from the time I received my second dose Thu until then.  I took over the counter Chlorpheniramine (4mg) one time and that seemed to relieve the symptoms.  The next day I was 85% better (Tue), but it took exactly 7 days (Thu) before I was back to normal. For the 3 - 5 day period following my second dose, it was a little bit scary struggling to breathe and thinking I was having a heart attack.  I almost went to the hospital, but I didn&#39;t because I take care of my elderly father and could not leave him by himself.  If this had happened to me out of the blue, I would have gone to the emergency, but I had read of people having reactions to the vaccine after the second dose so I was mentally prepared to ride it out.  I didn&#39;t read about people having my particular side effect, so I thought I was an outlier of sorts. I am filling this out now because there are reports coming out that the Pfizer vaccine may be tied to myocarditis in men, and from the symptoms explained, it seems to line up with what I experienced.  Although I had Moderna, not Pfizer, I thought maybe I should report it in case it is a generic &#34;mrna vaccine&#34; issue.

He was unresponsive to touch or sensation for about 3 minutes but did stop breathing/circulation. He had some clamminess and low blood pressure/pulse during the event. However, he did not show symptoms of swelling, itching, or anaphylaxis. We applied a cool towel to his head and neck, and when he became conscious, gave him a bottle of water. Patient waited until EMS arrived where he was found to have had syncope/hypotension. Patient remained in pharmacy area another 15 minutes after being cleared by EMS before leaving. He did not require any further medications or treatment.

Each day the pain got a little worse and started stretching to my chest. My chest and heart were uncomfortable. My wife was having the same symptoms so we just tried to manage through the pain. One April 28, the pain was so severe it woke me up in the middle of the night. I took some antacids and that seemed to help. The next 3 days the pain was on and off until May 1 evening, the pain was so severe and I was vomiting that we decided to go to the hospital. It was determined that I had a heart attack.

I had a bio-polar v-tach ablation in 2018 that was successful and had no V-fib since May 2019. The symptoms cause my heart rate to elevate 300 bpm in a fraction of a second and passed out each time. I was hospitalized and had to have amiodarone added to my system to get it to stop. Since I have had no v-fib and the only change in my life was the vaccine I received just 1 week prior.

On 04-Jun-2021, the patient experienced CARDIAC ARREST (cardiac arrest) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced CAROTID ARTERY OCCLUSION (Block) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, CARDIAC ARREST (cardiac arrest) had resolved and CAROTID ARTERY OCCLUSION (Block) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Electrocardiogram: normal (normal) Normal.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No treatment medications were reported.

After I received my first Moderna vaccine shot I started to not feel well with TSH numbers going down. After the second Moderna vaccine shot my TSH number went down even more and I went to the Emergency Room multiple times as it seems the vaccine could have accelrated my TSH numbers to go down more they were previously. Due to my thyroid I experienced tremors, rapid heart beat and elevated blood pressure.  On June 5,2021 I was put on thyroid medication, Before the vaccine shots I did not experience any of these thyroid issues or symptoms.

                                                For about six days I was miserable and not feeling very good. Fever,  fatigue, headaches and just felt like crap. I had a fever of 100.5 (highest) for three or four days. It broke and then it started feeling better on the 6th day. I had very sore shoulder for the first two days. I have regular side affects of medicine that affects me daily. I felt very miserable.  (This was worse symptoms than after I got  the second vaccine.) I have long term COVID - low oxygen issue - I went to Hospital - 11 liter 02 and 60% pressure. I was still dealing with low 02 during the day; I have insulin issues - still out of whack - doctors are monitoring it. My blood pressure has been up in the 200 range - they got it into the 160&#39;s or so but they are increasing the heart meds - they are doubling the heart meds (have some new ones - Metoprolol was ended - and  Carvedilol 25 mg take one tab twice a day; Mepacrine ER Osmtic - 30 mg one, twice a day now )- my heart is still unstable - electrical tachycardia is the name for it and that is affecting me. Inflammatory of the voice box caused by what they don&#39;t know - it comes and goes (the voice) -I will get it examined it soon - it is also causing Thrush - burning redness of the tongue. Monday the 19th of April - was in ER for 15 hours before they got me upstairs - admitted the 20th. (Have a previous spinal cord injury, hip injury etc. from work related.) Potassium - was taking one a day and I&#39;m taking four a day now - they are not sure why but I need to take that many  now. I am also going thru a Respiratory therapist - every couple of weeks I&#39;m going through that to strengthen my lungs.

My heart began racing to about one and one half the normal to a rate of 100, at about 30 hours after the injection.  It then slowed to 50 bpm for about 15 minutes before racing back to 100 and becoming somewhat irregular, slow pace followed by several quick beats then a beat or two slow again and then several quick beats.  This lasted for a few hours and then I fell asleep.  When I woke up about 7 hours later, it was back to normal.  Some slight body ache and headache.

The patient was admitted to the hospital   We was found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and treated for pneumonia with Rocephin and azithromycin.  He was tested for COVID-19 multiple times, but each of the results were negative.  Despite the negative results, there was high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and the patient was started on Remdesivir and Decadron.  The  patient&#39;s oxygen requirements continued to worsen and the patient was transferred to another facility for higher level of care.  There  his hypoxia worsened and he required mechanical ventilation.  Patient then developed hypotension and required vasopressors for blood pressure support.  Furthermore, patient developed acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.  Despite mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100%, and for vasopressors, patient clinically deteriorated and family decided to palliatively extubate on 02/05/2021.

                                                Per MD Clinical Note 3/14/21, &#34;Further discussion with his daughter today-patient has not been able to walk and has had unclear mentation for approximately 8 years after an alcohol related decline.  Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

Continued to &#34;not feel well&#34;. 3/15/21, presented to ED with chest pains and dx with pericarditis again.  Treated with IV Vanco x1 and IV Zosyn x2 until blood work came back and cultures were negative. Due to no infection and negative for an MI, Dr. determined pericarditis was a rxn to the vaccine.   Other tests results include: Elevated BNP, BUN, and CRP.  CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis is clear. 5 covid tests since admission, all negative. IgG antibodies for COVID negative.   PT currently is stable and bloodwork somewhat improved. On O2, fluids and Morphine for chest pain. An acute Hepatitis panel is currently pending.

I monitor glucose with a fasting check every morning, and went from a steady average in the low 130s to a peak of 162, with four days running at 150-plus.  My levels haven?t been that high since shortly after I was diagnosed, and my diet did not change. Just something I think has likely been under-reported.

Patient leaned back in their chair and became unresponsive upon questioning. At this point 911 was called and an ambulance was dispatched. It appeared patient was unconscious for a short period of time (5-10 seconds) and failing to respond to questions. Pt was experiencing mild diaphoresis. Pulse and breathing were being manually monitored. Patient seemed to regain consciousness however was still not answering our questions. Patient was then able to sit up and very slowly (taking many breaks) was able to walk (with assistance) to an observation room closer to the doorway. Paramedics loaded patient onto stretcher and took patient to hospital.

                                                Patient was seated and in 15 minute observation period (approx 10 mins in) and when questioned if he was ok, replied that he was light headed. His pallor was very pale and he was sweating. When the pharmacist approached him to help, he was slumping over in the chair and in and out of coherence. He answered questions about his breathing and confirmed that he only felt light headed and breathing was not labored.  After removing his sweatshirt and mask to cool him off and allow better breathing and giving him some water, his skin color returned to normal and he was again speaking coherently.  His pulse and heart rate were a bit slow throughout. Ambulance was called and the patient refused to go to the hospital claiming he felt fine.

He denies any history of headaches.   He denies any other symptoms.   No nausea, no vision changes, no numbness or weakness.   No swelling, itching, rash, no shortness of breath, dizziness, or abdominal symptoms.   He denies side effects from his 1st Covid vaccine.    He denies a history of significant health problems and states he takes no medications.     Exam revealed a middle aged male sitting comfortably in NAD.  Alert and oriented x3    PERRL, no photophobia, EOMI, CNs grossly intact.  RRR without murmur.  Neuro exam without focal deficits.   Normal gait.   Patient was monitored for about 20 min at which time he felt he could safely drive himself home - 4 blocks down the road.   He was instructed to take some Tylenol when he gets home and rest.   Call 911 in the event of numbness, weakness, vision changes,  dizziness, slurred speech or other severe symptoms.    He is supposed to work and plans to call in sick so he can rest.      I did mention his elevated BP which is probably isolated but he should make an appt with his PCP for a recheck of his blood pressure.

By that afternoon he still had the cramping feeling, and started drinking water as his wife is a nurse and felt that he may be dehydrated.  Throughout the week he had a Charlie Horse pain in his left calf, and felt that it was getting worse and not going away.  The whole week he went to work and on the 7th day it started swelling and went to Hospital after he got off of work, and he saw a resident who said that his leg was swollen and told him that she was going to schedule an ultrasound.  He had that on Friday on 4/16/21, and was scheduled for 4:00 but due to the pain went to the ER and gave him IV and checked his blood work.  The ultrasound showed that he did have a blood clot and prescribed Eliquis and gave him a dose while in the ER.  He told him that he would be on 2 a dat for 7 days  and then 1 a day, but did not tell him how long.  He is supposed to see the resident this afternoon for recheck.   He is still having pain and wanting to know where he is going to do from this point.    He does work out every day at his home gym and has not smoked, and now wanting to know how this is going to affect his life from this point into the future.  He also jumps rope 3 times a day and now not able to do this.

He had that on Friday on 4/16/21, and was scheduled for 4:00 but due to the pain went to the ER and gave him IV and checked his blood work.  The ultrasound showed that he did have a blood clot and prescribed Eliquis and gave him a dose while in the ER.  He told him that he would be on that for a while.  He is supposed to see the resident this afternoon for recheck.   He is still having pain and wanting to know where he is going to do from this point.    He does work out every day at his home gym and has not smoked, and now wanting to know how this is going to affect his life from this point into the future.  He also jumps rope 3 times a day and now not able to do this.

He describes really low energy level, nauseated throughout the day a lot, fatigue, feel sleepy a lot , so out of breath and started hyperventilated but it could be from panic attack he says.

He says it could be due to synthroid discontinuation which he stopped taking one year ago but started back the morning of 4/21/21 to see if that is what is the cause.

                                                He presented to the ER via ambulance after he had 3 witnessed seizures which included full loss of consciousness and rhythmic jerking lasting for an unknown duration.  En route apparently he was seizing and prehospital personnel gave him 5 mg IM versed as well as 5mg iv versed which did seem to abate the seizure.  He was apparently quite combative and has no prior history of seizures.  In the ER the patient was apparently having right sided eye deviation and was given 2mg of Ativan.  A stat CT of the head did not reveal any acute process.  Telemetry neurology was consulted.  During his work up the patient was found to have a urine toxicology positive for amphetamines as well as opiates.  Telemetry neurology recommended loading the patient with Keppra, initiating regular Keppra doses and indicated they believed the etiology of his seizures was polysubstance abuse.

                                                Patient came for his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Before giving the vaccine, I asked the patient if they had any problems with the first dose and they stated that they did not. After giving the vaccine I went back inside the pharmacy to throw away the supplies and his son-in-law called me over to take a look at the patient. The patient had his eyes closed and head tilted back and started shaking for a couple of seconds. I had my technician call 911 at this moment. The patient has lost consciousness and I took the patients mask off to assess and confirm that he was breathing which he was. Upon regaining consciousness the patient was disoriented and sweating. Unfortunately it was difficult to find out how the patient was feeling due to a language barrier. I monitored the patient until the paramedics arrived which they took out the EKG and injected him with an IV. His BP was 107/62, HR in the 70s, and not sure if I overheard correctly but bloodsugar of 163. The EKG report stated that the patient was having a STEMI but when they printed it out there was no ST elevation. The paramedics took care of the situation and took him in for further evaluation.

                                                My husband was sleeping the night of getting his 2nd Moderna Vaccination...  He, during his sleep, had a SEVERE Grand Mal Seizure with NOTHING leading up to it and NO PREVIOUS HISTORY WHATSOEVER of having ANY Seizures in his lifetime, nor ANY Epilepsy...  EVER! It was TERRIFYING, to me - I ran to his bedside (I happened to be in the livingroom watching television) after hearing loud grunts and a crash and came to find him convulsing, severely spewing blood and frothing at the mouth.  Grunting, convulsing, and thrashing.  Stiffening, arms and hands (both in a fist) tight and stiff in front of his chest, legs straight, rigid as a board and thrashing about spitting blood, eyes rolled back in his head.  As things began to becoming a little less severe, while waiting for the Fire Dept &amp; EMTs to arrive I felt his legs which were hit to the touch and his face was drenched in sweat! With NEVER EXPERIENCING Anything like this before, and after 30 years of marriage, I thought my husband was dying ???????? He did NOT go with the EMTs, since once he was awake and somewhat cognitive we realized he was over it for the moment and we&#39;re in a wait and see basis. He saw our GP first thing the next morning.

                                                after receiving the vaccine 4/20 and three weeks later I couldn&#39;t breath and called 911 and went to hospital and diagnosed with pericarditis. But the day before I felt like I had a fractured rib and it intensified that evening and I took pain medication, then the pain in the left side intensified and I could not breath it felt like a knife piercing and had to breath with very shallow breath into my upper chest and the pain was so intense.  I called 911 and they did an EKG, my heart rate went down to 30. One doctor gave me morphine to help me, they did test to check for blood clots and EKG&#39;s and blood test. I was also given Oxycodone.  Test showed that there was a virus that got into it that caused pericarditis.  I&#39;m taking Ibuprofen and anti-inflammatories to help. I&#39;m very active and never had health issues and believe this was a response to the vaccine.  First dose was given on 3/23/2021 Lot 047A21A and experienced Molluscum contagion a few days later, and this is a virus. I was prescribe a topical cream, Imiquimod a topical cream to put on it to break down the virus. Triamcinolone Acetonide cream was prescribed later and I&#39;m still taking it now and the site was oozing puss and bleeding.

On the 4th day, woke up in the middle of the night to elevated blood pressure (160/100) with skipping heart beats. Arrythmia was intermittent but persistant for about 14 days, interspersed with several bouts of elevated blood pressure lasting for about 1 hour. Sensation of pounding heart with skipping, but normal blood pressure, has lessened with time, but is still present.  Saw my GP about 10 days after the 2nd dose. Heart rhythm was normal during the visit, so no action was taken.

                                                I am submitting this report because I am hoping to help others with the vaccine and to see if the CDC can assist with any guidance for my treatment with  Cardiologist. I am glad to share any of my medical records if it?s helpful I had a heart condition in 2018 that was fully cleared and recovered over 2 years prior to the moderna vaccine. In Dec 2018 I had congestive heart failure (high heart rate, afib, and swelling). The congestive heart failure was resolved within a week with medication only, no stints or surgery. The recovery of my heart to a health condition was confirmed with a heart MRI on Feb 5th 2019. I still had afib that was confirmed cleared on Feb 12th 2020 by an office visit with my cardiologist. He recommended I continue medication and monitoring.  I continued in a fully cleared condition with no Afib or any issues for a year and 3 months up to my 2nd  moderna shot. I had an annual heart MRI on May 3rd 2021 showing no issues and no afib. I had a visit with my cardiologist who said the test results were great. On May 15th 2021 I had my second moderna shot. My shot was Moderna 025C21A, at Pharmacy. Within 24 hours I was in an afib condition with my heart rate between 90 to 100 bpm resting. I contacted my cardiologist. On 6/11/21 he confirmed the afib condition and the elevated heart rate.  He is now guiding me through procedures to clear my afib. I am quite concerned that my health had fully recovered and now have  heart issues directly related to the 2nd moderna vaccine. Any assistance you can give me, my cardiologist to help us thru this is appreciated.  I hope the information I am sharing can help others with the vaccine.

Went to ER on 5/5/21 where they discovered numerous DVTs in right leg and Pulmonary Embolisms in both lobes of lungs.  Heparin administered in ER and admitted for two nights to regulate dosage and to have echo cardiogram performed which also showed a thrombus in right atrium of heart.  Doctors said no other underlying cause of clotting and attributed it to the vaccine.  Now on maintenance course of Xarelto.

                                                Was extremely sick after the second shot with flu like symptoms.  On the second day, my blood pressure was 190 over 110 and still sick with flu like symptoms.  Got the blood pressure to come down by doubling up on high blood pressure meds.  Remained sick for 13 days.  During this time, was working full time (Office duties) and off hours working extreme hours to physical exhaustion on family farm.  On the 13th day, suffered severe seizures that broke my collarbone and shoulder to the point my shoulder needs to be replaced.  The broken bones were not from the fall when I passed out, as my brother caught me and took me to the ground.  No medical history of seizures with me or my family.  Right before the seizure I could only describe myself as feeling off, like I was in a slight fog and not clear of thought or sight.  My brother told me I had about 10 mini seizures while standing and holding on the tailgate of the truck and then one big one that knocked me out for about 15 minutes dislocating and breaking my should and collarbone.

The episodes have lessen as far as the heart palpitations. I spoke with the telephone triage nurse at the hospital and was told to report to the nearest ER and I did. The ER Doctor said that he couldn&#39;t rule it in or out that the symptoms were brought on by the vaccine. He consulted the records that were sent from the hospital and some follow up was set up. All medical records were sent back to the hospital to have them follow up on my symptoms.

My abdomen started hurting and on June 12 I started having diarrhea which lasted for 2 weeks (reminder that I also started Lexapro on June 11 and started Cipro and Flagyl on June 12).  I ended up losing 15 lbs due to loss of appetite and the diarrhea.  On June 19, I had a vagal episode where I passed out while standing up. Luckily my head landing softly. I had just drank a smoothy and felt a pressure/pain in my chest. After passing out and then coming to, I vomited the smoothy and found some relief.

Patient states it all began about 2 weeks after his first Moderna covid vaccine at mid/end of April. He developed exertional chest pain that felt like a squeezing. He was recommended a stress test at that time, but didn&#39;t have health insurance and wanted to wait until he was covered. He was put on a 5 day course of prednisone, that seemed to improve his symptoms and he felt back to baseline and was able to proceed with the 2nd moderna vaccine in the middle of May. Shortly after that, he developed intermittent dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness. It was difficult to take a deep breath in, felt like something was grabbing him when he tried to take a full deep breath. This has been becoming more constant over the last 2 weeks. Today, he was outside moving a lawnmower when his symptoms significantly worsened. He felt lightheaded. His wife convinced him to go to clinic, where he got a CTA that showed an saddle PE.

Prior to vaccination pt was working full time, active with no significant health concerns other than controlled blood pressure on 1 medication. After his first vaccine in the left arm he reported his arm was very sore, swollen, painful and red which lasted 3 days and he reported he could not move his arm due to pain. He reports for days after he then had extreme fatigue but then recovered and went on with his life. He got his 2nd dose of the vaccine on 6/4/21 and then was hospitalized on 6/16/21 with severe pancytopenia with pathology ultimately showing Acute myeloid leukemia, severe cellulitis of the L lower leg,  and  ultimately developed a left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis in that leg as well. Interestingly he injured his right leg just before vaccination and did not develop any cellulitis or poor healing  in that leg just a week before his first dose. He remains hospitalized in guarded condition as of 7/9/2021 currently receiving chemotherapy treatment with decitabine and venetoclax and has receving multiple transfusions of blood, antibiotics, steroids and now anticoagulation.

                                                Approximately ten hours after the vaccine, I began having what I consider an extreme reaction. Intense body aches, chills, headache, fever, sweating, and general feeling of being very unwell. Along with the expected symptoms, I had shaking that was not just from having chills, rapid resting heart rate that was running well above 100. My normal resting heart rate is in the 60s and sometimes even 50s.  I also had a feeling of &#34;deep, intense cold.&#34;  The symptoms gradually eased after the first 24 hours but persisted enough that I was in bed for three days.  After the three days, I struggled with extreme fatigue and felt like I was always freezing cold. I was also having strange changes in my heart rate.My heart would race and then slow down again. After about three weeks, I began to have palpitations which continued to get worse over the following months, especially with any exertion. The fatigue and cold feeling lasted for a few months, and my hands were always ice cold. I am still having the palpitations/arrhythmias. Around April, I felt like I was getting out of shape because of the fatigue and inability to do what I normally did. I decided to start increasing my activity, walking exercising, etc. in order to combat the fatigue and &#34;get back in shape.&#34; This caused an increase in my palpitations, chest discomfort and shortness of breath which caused me to go home from work a few times and to seek medical attention. I was unable to get right in to see a doctor so I purchases a device for my tablet so that I could try and capture what was occurring and show the doctor. I eventually saw my GP and was referred to a Cardiologist. I was having PVCs. and at this point I had on average eight per minute with episode of many more at times. This has continued and fluctuates in intensity. I think maybe it is slightly improving but sometimes I still have episodes of increased arrhythmias so this is not resolved and is still continuing and limiting my normal activities. The cardiologist ruled out Mi or ischemia as a cause. We believe there is inflammation in the heart muscle. I should note here that prior to this I have never had any problems with my heart. Not even high  blood pressure.

Even moving my eyes up to look at someone would cause a feeling of vertigo.  But, it did not happen after repeatedly lifting heavy objects (I work as a stock person). And did not occur when standing up, only when I would move my eyes or lifted my head.

I was immediately transported to the hospital by the fire department (feeling in my right side started to return while being transported to the hospital). I was admitted to the hospital and a series of tests were administered to find out the cause of my stroke. I was administered medication to reduce my blood pressure and cholesterol along with aspirin 81mg and Atorvastatin during my 3-day stay. I received a prescription for the medication upon being released from the hospital.

Several days after he complained of &#34;not feeling well&#34; and fatigue, but did not give more specific symptomatology.  On 5/17/2021 he had a sudden collapse at home and was transported to local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  Case accepted as medical examiner jurisdiction due to no apparent medical history and sudden death after vaccine administration.  Full autopsy completed on 5/19/21 revealed obstructive pulmonary thromboemboli as cause of death, with lower extremity DVT.  Both portions of the pulmonary thromboembolus and the DVT show organization, thus raising question of whether this process started before or after the vaccination.   No known history of thrombophilic disorder, recent injury, or prolonged stasis/immobility.  Not known to be current smoker.  See below for additional autopsy information.

                                                Approximately 3 minutes after the injection I began to experience palpitations and felt flushed.  My heart rate increased from about 70 to 110.  This lasted for approximately 5 minutes and then recurred about 10 minutes later.  After the second event I took Benadryl 50mg po.  I experienced palpitations and felt flush a third time about 5 minutes after taking Benadryl  lasting about 2 minutes.  Approximately 40 minutes after the injection I began to feel cold and clammy, this lasted about 35 minutes. My pulse was about 75 and BP 140/90 during this last event.  Approximately 90 minutes after the injection I went home and experienced intermittent chills for a few hours then I was asymptotic.

                                                On Monday, March 9th, I tested positive for the COVID antibodies and believe it was linked to an illness that I experienced last fall (COVID test was not administered at that time).  Approximately 16 hours after receiving the first injection of COVID-19 MODERNA I began to experience joint pain/stiffness, muscle soreness,  headaches, nausea, chills, sweats, malaise, heart racing, numbness to the fingers on my left hand, etc.  I became progressively worse until become bed ridden at 5:15 pm on Thursday, March 11th.  I remained bed ridden with symptoms becoming progressively worse until Friday evening, March 12th.  At that point, my condition began to improve.  I began to feel somewhat better by mid-morning on Saturday, March 13th.  My condition finally improved to ~90% by Monday, March 15th, with lingering muscle soreness and loss of feeling to the fingers on my left hand remaining.

At approximately 5:30 pm, my blood sugars rose in excess of 400 mg/dl, felt lightheaded followed by quick onset of high pressure and volume diarrhea. I was in my girlfriend&#39;s home and was barely able to get to the toilet in time. The diarrhea appeared pea soup green in color and consistency and very smelly.  Of interest, my girlfriend who also received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on the same date, time and location, was awaken at approximately 2:00 AM with the same rapid onset of diarrhea.  On the second day following the vaccine, we both had elevated temperatures of 101.5 and 102 lasting approximately 24 hours.

Maybe my previously generated antibodies amplified my symptoms?

                                                Woke up with A-fib (6:00 am) on 3/29/2021. Had old medication on hand Metoprolol tartrate 50 mg   Took 50 mg at 9:00 am and then at 9:00 pm.  Took same dose next day (3/302021).  Third day dropped dose to 25 mg every 12 hours; continued with that for a total of 3 days. Then dropped to 25 mg per 24 hours for 2 days total.  By bed time of same day A-fib started (10:30pm) heart beat was not in A-fib, but erratic - skipped beats, long pauses. Waking up the next day (3/30/2021) rhythm was mostly normal with occasional skips or pause. This has slowly stabilized to normal all the time  about a week after A-fib started. Note: I have had 2 pulmonary vein ablations. The last one was about 7 years ago. I have been in normal rhythm ever since except when I contracted the flu in January 2018. I was treated  at that time with the Metoprolol and normal rhythm was restored in about a day.

                                                A minute or two after patient received vaccine he was on his way to the post vaccination waiting area he passed out and fell against a display where he slid to the ground. Within a minute of this event and getting to the patient he was already conscious although lethargic and kept closing his eyes. Over the next 5-10 minutes he became much more responsive and eventually stood up and had a seat in a chair. EMS was already called and came to check on him and eventually they let him go and he indicated he was fine and continued to finish his shopping.

                                                In a nutshell, patient was fine, got the first shot of the Moderna Vaccine on 3/24/21, then began to exhibit many covid-like symptoms starting around 4 hours later but 3 times nasal swap tested negative for COVID19 including before and after vaccination. Suffered with various attempts at treatments and tests for approximately a month and then was admitted to the ER at hospital on 4/28/21.  Wife (former smoker who lives in same house and has lung problems) who took the vaccine at the same time from the same lot suffered minor arm pain, aches and pains and fatigue but was fine the next day.  Patient (59) had normal blood pressure and clear lungs in good health, non-smoker, good weight, exercises regularly and strenuously, good diet, rarely gets ill. He works as a ship?s captain and engineer and has worked in boatyards for years doing physical work. Has tintinnitis and in one eye, glaucoma drops but is on no other prescription medicines. Details: March: had nasal congestion, cough and suspected bronchitis, aches and pains, no fever, PCR tested negative for COVID19, and was treated with antibiotics (azithromycin and then a run of amoxycillin), proair, advair discuss a couple of days, various vitamins/minerals, over the counter cold/flu medicines. Seemed to work with most symptoms going away prior to Marcch 24, 2021. March 24, 2021 morning: Got first shot of the Moderna Vaccine at pharmacy. Lot 045A21A at same time as spouse. That morning had no cough and felt ok. Approximately 4 hours later, patient started to cough, felt congested, felt like flu/pneumonia, trouble breathing, aches and pains especially in joints, extreme fatigue, headache, (but suffered no loss of taste or smell throughout 3/24-present) took Theraflu and went to bed early, slept well. Following days, struggled with intensifying symptoms. Felt like the vaccine gave him covid symptoms without the loss of smell/taste.  Spouse experienced minor pain at point of injection, some fatigue, aches and pains which went away by end of next day 3/25/21. Spouse had some lingering cough left over from earlier bronchitis before getting the vaccine which cough/congested breathing continued with no noticeable change. [Spouse was also not adversely impacted by the second shot of Moderna vaccine a month later.) Apr Wk1 &amp; Wk2: Increasing difficulty sleeping due to lung congestion or suddenly waking up wide awake for no reason. At end of Wk2, had some minor tremors in muscles for a couple of days. Suffered from extreme fatigue, congestion, trouble breathing, nightmares, aches and pains. Took azithromycin run then a run of amoxicillin, proair, prednisone, albuterol nebulizer, occasional Theraflu or over-the-counter cold/flu medicines, vitamins/minerals (including heavier doses of Vitamin D, Zinc, C, etc.), probiotic acidophilus, tonic water with quinine or Perrier, melatonin 10mg and magnesium 500mg at night, occasionally a Unisom sleeping pill. Started to lose appetite where rarely hungry. Would force himself to eat anyway, but occasionally vomited it up. Apr Wk3 4/13/21: Patient got another PCR covid test which was negative, chest xray, blood work done at Urgent Care. Showed some elevated liver/kidney enzymes and low red blood cell count/anemia, vague thickening of the plura, swollen lymphnode in the chest xray, no sign of cardiovascular issue. (Some yellow flags but nothing flashing red.) Dr. recommended followup tests and bloodwork and that he get GI/Cardio/pulmonary workups w/specialists. Patient continued to take antibiotics, pregnizone, albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals, and occasional cold/flu/cough medicines, etc. Added SuperB Complex. One day he had hot/cold chills for a few hours. Apr Wk4: While lungs felt clearer, still coughing and now occasionally vomiting productively or dry heaves, insomnia grew into bigger issue with hallucinations not just with nightmares but occasionally during the day where it was difficult to separate reality from dream, trouble remembering, started to feel paranoid/irrational sometimes, trouble sleeping was not due to lung congestion but more due to panic-attack like heavy breathing or sudden central chest/sternum pain (maybe from coughs), aches in joints, but biggest problem was extreme fatigue and tiring when walking up a flight of stairs, etc. Took some Tramadol occasionally for pain relief (but never with aspirin, Tylenol or cold medicine). Could be sitting comfortably watching a mellow tv program but suddenly need to breathe really heavy, hyperventilating and felt need to standup and walk around until it eased. Extreme trouble sleeping. Most comfortable position was kneeling with body bent over a pillow on the bed. [He&#39;d never had panic-attacks/heavy breathing issues before the Moderna shot and doesn&#39;t abuse substances.] Wk5: 4/24/21 feet swelled up and turned purple on the soles. Went for a walk around the block and raised feet. No longer on antibiotics or pregnizone, only taking the albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals/probiotics, melatonin and a OTC cough/flu medicine before bed. Knelt for hours while trying to sleep. 4/25/21, feet more swollen with fluid and more discolored. When searched online, they looked like &#34;covid toes&#34;. Took no medicines except nebulizer and took only a couple of vitamins/calcium-vitaminD and before bed a beer, melatonin, magnesium &amp; nyquil. 4/26/21, feet less swollen and no longer purple except a small line on the side of one foot. Patient indicated he had not knelt when trying to sleep prone during night. But only got a couple of hours of sleep, nighttime hallucinations and panic-breathing attacks. Daytime inability to focus, extreme fatigue, aches and pains, quick to tire on any exertion, vomiting food or dry heaves 2 or 3 times that day, panic-like-attacks with need to heavy breathe/hyperventilate. Wheezing with occasional rattle at end. Coughs sometimes productive, sometimes not but lungs didn?t feel very congested and oxygenation/blood pressure was good. 4/27/21, went to work in morning and was able to perform but very tired. In early afternoon, came home, ate, took nyquil and nebulizer and tried to sleep. 4/28/21, felt much worse, feet and knees swollen, extreme exhaustion, felt miserable. Went to work anyway. Came home around 2pm, ate. Felt much worse so we went to the ER at Hospital. Spouse provided MMC with his medical conditions, medicines, the info on COVID IGG serology test and informed them of the chest xrays and bloodwork that had been done at the Urgent Care center 2 weeks prior. ER indicated he needed to stay overnight and they performed additional bloodwork, xrays, scans and MRIs. The ER doctor called in specialists in Nephrology and Cardiology to provide consultations.

In the hospital he was given an injection to slow his heart rate down, said that he drank a pot of coffee and then had another 16 oz coffee after that.

                                                So on April 19th I got the second Covid vaccine, I went to the urgent care on the following day at approx. 11:30 AM. They did an EKG they said it looked fine and they sent me on my way regardless of it hurting me real bad (my chest). When I woke up Sunday morning, there was a crushing pain in my chest. On the 25th I woke up, got dressed and went right over to the hospital. I was in so much pain I had to go back to the hospital. I was there from the 25th-29th, they said I needed to have an angiogram with a possible stint in my left artery. On the 28th they put that stint in and I left on the 29th of April in the afternoon at about 4pm. I still am not feeling right, my chest hurts not like it did then, but shortness of breath. I also have to take a blood thinner and a baby aspirin. I have new symptoms in both my arms, from my bicep to my triceps is very achy - it has never done that before. My arms are very stiff. I still have trouble taking deep breathes.

They tested for flu, covid and a full blood work and an MRI. 4 days prior to the vaccine my platelet count was 253000 and three days after the vaccine was 45000 and it continued to drop the next few days. My immune system destroyed my blood platelets. They gave me dexametasone, steroids for 4 days.

With in 2-3 weeks increase abdominal pain, and discomfort, I thought it was a Crohn?s flair, so I just tried to wait it out.  Early April I went to the ED, for eval and treatment , it was discovered via CT of abdomen I developed Portal Vein Thrombosis, admitted for anti coagulation, and further studies like JAK 2. Place on heparin, followed by lovonox SQ injections, and bridged to Pradaxa.  Symptoms returned after a couple of weeks, and persisted, ,back tp the hospital new CZt scans, showed increase in Portal vein thrombosis, but now included splenic vein thrombosis, and mesenteric vein thrombosis.  Went back on anticoagulation therapy, transferred to  hospital for Intervention Radiology procedure to have a portal vein shunt placed in, and thrombectomy of the spleen, and mesenteric veins. Had bleeding issues, returned to OR for a second IR procedure, and finally a 3rd procedure of splenectomy, blood transfusion for hemorrhagic shock.  Discharged on warfarin, and lovonox as needed

On 6/5, I developed a 5? x 5? irritated red patch on my injection arm. On 6/6 I awoke to no fever. I then noticed sores in my mouth and busies on my abdomen, left leg and left foot. I went to urgent care. They ran a CBC. My platelet count was down 30% since ,my last test a few months ago. My average was about 180,000 for the last 6 years. My test number was 127,000.  I have no history of a low platelet count. This appeared within days of the 2nd vaccination along with the sores and spontaneous bruising. A CAT and v,MRI were performed that same day. Those tests were normal.
