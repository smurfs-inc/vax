                                                On 1/12/20 resident woke up and was not able to stand in the E-Z stand. E-Z lift was needed. In addition he needed assistance with eating. At that time VS were stable, equal hand grasp noted, and no further concerns. Around 3pm resident became flaccid on the left side of his face and speech became mumbled. Hand grasp was equal at that time and VS were stable, but B/P was elevated compared to previous recordings earlier in the day. Family did not want him sent to the hospital and asked for comfort cares. Hospice referral obtained and he will be admitted to hospice in the near future. Resident&#39;s left side of face has improved within the last 48 hours. He remains total assist with all cares.

                                                Syncope; Shaking; Struggling to breathe; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 90-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included warfarin, ezetimibe, bupropion, finasteride, tamsulosin, furosemide, potassium chloride, rosuvastatin, and nitrofurantoin.    On 26 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 032L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, after vaccine administration, the patient stayed at the vaccination site for fifteen minutes to watch for any reaction, he had none, so he left. Later that night the patient began shaking and struggling to breathe, so 911 was called. At the hospital, the patient was diagnosed with syncope. He spent overnight in the hospital and had an echocardiogram the following day. No results were provided for the echo, but the patient was cleared to go home after a sixteen-hour hospital stay. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was unknown.  The outcome of the events, syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe, was resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 90 year-old, male patient, who experienced events of syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe.  The events occurred the same night after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

                                                My birthfather had an adverse reaction after he got his 1st Moderna COVID vaccine.  He lives alone and was doing well with some underlying conditions. The day of the shot was fine.  The next AM, he had vision changes and sudden numbness in his R arm/leg and fell after getting up.  ?The numbness went away pretty quickly, but the visual changes remained.  He refused to go to the ER/Dr.  The next week and a half, he was weak, tired, and couldn?t think as clearly.  ?He was brought to the ER? on Wed, 3/3/21 at Hospital.  He was found to have a low oxygen level, possible a-fib, fluid retention, emphysema, and aortic stenosis, in addition to his other health issues.  ?The Dr said his symptoms the day after the vaccine were a mini-stroke..  He was released from the hospital on Friday, 3/5/21.  On Saturday, Hospice came to see him, since nothing can be done for his medical conditions; however, they decided not to sign him up yet, since he I was told they didn&#39;t feel he needed to, at this time.  One of my sisters is staying with him during the day until he builds his strength back up.  Do you think his Mini stroke and health changes had anything to do with the vaccine? He will not be getting the second COVID shot.   ?We?re all caught between a rock and a hard place as far as what to do, esp for older folks.

Patient was started on Augmentin and has taken it for about 5 days but said the cough is worse and productive of clear sputum.  Patient in ER to get checked for pneumonia.  Patient denies a fever or chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea vomiting and no headache or dizziness. Transferred to another facility h&amp;pHistory of Present Illness:  94-year-old former smoker with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not currently on anticoagulation, coronary artery disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, CKD 4, prostate cancer on surveillance, TAVR 2/17, with a son who is a doctor and a caregiver who is a Radiology NP by his report, who presents in transfer from previous Hospital due to a large right pleural effusion.  He has had a cough for some time now, but thinks it may have worsened, at least per his caregiver, over the last 4-5 days.  He was seen by his PCP on February 9th and placed on Augmentin, but nothing changed.  He himself denies being short of breath, having any chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, change in appetite, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, diarrhea.  Of note, on a chest x-ray in June he had bilateral pleural effusions, and on an MRI in July to investigate a renal mass, he was noted to have a small right-sided pleural effusion.        On arrival to facility this morning, he was afebrile, normotensive, had a normal heart rate, sometimes mildly bradycardic, normal respiratory rate and saturations of 97% on room air.  Labs demonstrated chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, stable stage 4 kidney disease creatinine of 2.6, BUN 64, glucose 187.  Chest x-ray demonstrated a moderate right pleural effusion, noting that underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  He was also felt to have bibasilar atelectasis.  CT of the chest without contrast showed a large right pleural effusion with most of the right lower lobe being collapsed.  Superimposed infection could not be excluded.  He had a small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and a small pericardial effusion as well.  EKG and procalcitonin were not performed.  He was sent to our facility for thoracentesis.         On arrival here, vitals remained stable.  His bedside RN informed me that upon returning from the bathroom, he appeared to be a bit dyspneic, but the patient himself denies any shortness of breath or ?huffing and puffing?. 2/25 admEd to hospital admission

The patient&#39;s medical history was provided.  Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 22 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number 029L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient was hospitalized for a UTI from 10 Feb 2021 to 12 Feb 2021.  The reporter stated, &#34;after that, he&#39;s been kind of weak and everything&#34;.  The reporter indicated it was a &#34;low grade&#34; UTI and the patient didn&#39;t show any symptoms but then stated &#34;it actually had him collapse and he did that in between the two vaccines and spent two days in the hospital.&#34;   On 17 Feb 2021, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number 012M20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient received both planned doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, the action with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  Treatment for the UTI included nitrofluorine.  The outcome of the events were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded

On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 18-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (mini-strokes which have increased in frequency) (seriousness criterion medically significant), SEIZURE (placed on low-dose seizure medicine Aptiom 200 and Aspirin 325 to prevent further seizures) (seriousness criterion medically significant), WHEEZING (Wheezing), DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath), HEADACHE (Headaches) and MYALGIA (Soreness in arm). The patient was treated with ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID] ongoing since an unknown date for Seizure prophylaxis, at a dose of 325 dosage form and ESLICARBAZEPINE ACETATE (APTIOM) ongoing since an unknown date for Seizure prophylaxis, at a dose of 200 milligram. At the time of the report, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (mini-strokes which have increased in frequency) had not resolved and SEIZURE (placed on low-dose seizure medicine Aptiom 200 and Aspirin 325 to prevent further seizures), WHEEZING (Wheezing), DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath), HEADACHE (Headaches) and MYALGIA (Soreness in arm) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 17-May-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: mini-strokes (abnormal) mini-strokes were confirmed via MRI.         The patient&#39;s caregiver reported the patient stopped taking amoxicillin 875-125 prior to receiving the second dose of the vaccine. After receiving the second vaccine, he began to experience a repeat of symptoms similar to those after the first dose which were described as a number of mini-strokes which increased in frequency. The patient was treated and released in an emergency room (less than 24-hour stay). It was reported the mini-strokes occurred within 24 to 72 hours post-vaccination.
