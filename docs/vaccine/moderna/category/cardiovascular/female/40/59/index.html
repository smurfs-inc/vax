I went to the bathroom and went pee and got my arm back in my long sleeve shirt under my scrub top. I wasn?t anxious about getting the vaccine. Then I went to sit down and be monitored. After about another minute I felt very weird like a warm feeling going all over my body.  I started pulling my mask away from my face to get a deep breath. Then I broke out in a sweat from head to toe. I think I became pale (I apparently didn?t look good).  I started feeling more ?weird? as I had never felt this way before and I stood up to walk because the nurse there wanted me upstairs near the ED but I was weak so I sat down and had tunnel vision. After that it?s a bit of a blur. After I stopped sweating I got very cold and shaky but vitals were ok.  It scared me because I have never had a reaction before to a vaccine.

                                                After an hour of receiving my vaccine, I started feeling  a little jittery, my heart rate went up to 113. I felt very short of breath. worst when walking and talking that improved with me sitting. Nausea with lots of drool. Around 4:30 I started feeling body aches . Then at 5 on my way home, i started feeling extreme pain in my joints, to where i couldnt hold the steering wheel tight. Around 7:30 I started having shaking and aching. Around 9:30 I ate potatoes, and took motrin and it helped a little. I felt weak and washed out like I ran a marathon.  I was still feeling fatigue and wiped out, I had no energy.  I took my pulse ox and it was 95-96.  I am now having muscle pain at the injection site, and injection site is very sore.

After getting the shot, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and drank some water then waited 20 mins. When I left to go back to my department, I started getting dizzy and coughing. I sat down in my department and could not stop coughing so I went to the ER department. My eyes were swollen, I had a rash from my arms and legs all the way down my body. I had hives on my face and my eyes were swollen. I was coughing and wheezing. the ER RN started an IV and I was given steroids, diphenhydramine, ondansetron and IV fluids. I was also given some cough medicine. I was monitored for a few hours and before I left - they gave me hydroxyzine for the hives and itching. The PA also ordered meds for me to take at home.      - per patient report

Within the first hour I felt dizzy and I was going to pass out and nausea. I completed the rest of my shift, not sure how I did it.  I woke up in the middle of the night with a head ache and not feeling well. On the 24th I started sweating and dry heaving very bad and had no temp. I was in and out of the bathroom the entire shift.  The next day  (25th)I woke up and thought I had the flu, my lymph nodes in my throat had swollen and I just felt bad  the entire day.  The fatigue and exhaustion was un believable.  By the 28th I started to feel much better. Then everything returned back to normal.

                                                One hour after my shot I started with dizziness and  I felt like I was going to pass out. I felt like my blood pressure was low, but it was really high 160/90. My heart rate was up in the 160&#39;s. This continued all day the first day and still continues randomly to today. Yesterday I had a random migraine , and today I am running a 100.2 temperature.

Patient&#39;s mother-in-law (MIL) was working as a MD today. About 2:15pm, the MIL notified a staff RN in the clinic that her daughter-in-law (patient) was c/o of tachycardia. The patient called her PCP who recommended she use her prescribed epi-pen and go to the ED. The MIL told the staff RN that the patient had a history of allergies and carried an epi-pen. The MIL left the clinic at that time and we have not heard any update from her or the patient. In Item 21, I selected &#34;Emergency Room,&#34; but do not know for certain if the patient went to the ED.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I went into a waiting room for the post-vaccine 15 minute observation. Approximately 2 minutes after sitting down I felt a sensation that can be described as a wave through my body. It only lasted for 10 seconds; however, it was immediately followed by a rapid heartbeat. It almost felt as though I might pass out (I have never passed out before). I alerted a nurse, and she monitored me for the 15 minute duration. After about 2 minutes, I felt &#39;normal&#39; again.

Racing heart began within the 15 min waiting period but I interpreted as anxiety.  Other symptoms began roughly 3 hrs post-vaccination.  Remedy was to leave work and go home, lay down in bed, and wait.  After a few hours symptoms mostly resolved, but face still feels strange (slight numbness and slight tingling).

                                                This facility staff member received her first dose of the MODERNA COVID-19 vaccine (Lot037K20A/EXP 6/22/21) at clinic at approximately 9:15AM on 1/14/21. She initially answered &#34;no&#34; to any allergies on the VAR but revealed to the pharmacist reviewing the VAR that she had experienced an allergy to food and contrast dye that required an epi-pen and hospital attention. She did not offer additional details and explained that she had tolerated other shots (including the 2020 flu shot) without incident. I advised patient to remain for a 30 minute monitoring period post-vaccination due to history of allergic reaction. Patient presented with some anxiety before the shot and immediately started to complain of feeling &#34;sick&#34; and said she was having trouble breathing due to chest pressure. We advised patient to remove her mask and provided her with water and a trash can though no vomiting occurred. After 15-20 minutes, patient still complained of chest pressure and difficulty breathing. When asked if she was experiencing any itchiness or throat swelling, patient said she did feel some throat swelling so she was given 25MG of Benadryl. After an additional 15 minutes, patient&#39;s condition seemed unchanged (not worsening, not improving) so the facility&#39;s nursing team was called to evaluate patient. Patient said she was still experiencing difficulty breathing and throat swelling so nursing advised use of EPI-PEN and patient consented. I administered a dose of 0.3MG (LOT0FM4066/EXP 02/2022) to the right lateral thigh and nurse called for EMS. Immediately after injection, patient&#39;s eyes fluttered and she seemed to be on the verge of fainting. Nursing checked her oxygen saturation which was 100%. Patient reported no improvement after 5 minutes so another EPI-PEN 0.3MG was administered to the left lateral thigh. Nursing also gave the patient 81MG chewable aspirin due to the patient experiencing a stroke last month. EMS arrived a few minutes after the second EPI-PEN dose and patient was transported to the hospital for evaluation. Facility reported that patient went home that afternoon but did not provide details. Based on my assessment of patient&#39;s symptoms and behavior, I feel it is likely that she experienced either an acute panic attack or anaphylaxis due to vaccine administration. I called the patient today (the day after the incident) and she confirms that she received treatment for an anaphylactic reaction to the Moderna COVID shot and is doing well without any lasting adverse effects.

By 3:30 on 12-31 my neck quickly swelled up, my throat becoming sore, glands swollen, headache, and fatigue were my first symptoms. An unusual symptom occurred from day 2-6. My facial skin did not hurt unless I applied pressure. When I applied pressure it felt bruised and highly sensitive but didn&#39;t hurt unless pressure was applied.  I also developed a small sore along my gum line on the bottom right front of my mouth.  Both of these symptoms disappeared after day 6. 7-8 days after receiving the vaccine my neck, jaw and shoulders became extremely stiff, including a runny nose. This symptom has persisted and is the worst of all symptoms (jaw and neck stiffness and sore throat). On day 12 in addition to the ongoing sore throat,  and stiffness in my neck and jaw I developed white spots on my right tonsil.  3 days after the white spots disappeared, but the red sore throat is current. On day 20, I developed 2 more sores on the right side of my mouth. One on the bottom gum line and one on the top right gum line (this feels like a canker sore). Today I have a slight earache in my right ear.   NOTE: I tested positive to COVID June 2020. I ended up taking 1 month off work due to persistent symptoms. I still cannot properly smell and taste, and I can smell water.  Occasionally, the brain fog from COVID comes up but that is more rare.

                                                On January 4 at 2:00 pm I suddenly started to bleed from the nose from the left nostril and then from both. The event lasted more than 35 minutes so I had to go to the ER. The diagnosis was Epistaxis. I was discharged because at the time of the medical evaluation I removed a large clot from my mouth and the bleeding stopped.  Appointment with primary physician for diagnosis and appointment with ENT was ordered. On January 5 at 4:15 am I had another episode of nasal bleeding lasting 25 min. After removing a clot through the mouth, the bleeding stopped. At 4:00 pm I presented Epistaxis again so I had to return to the Emergency Room. I was reevaluated and the instruction was to visit the ENT and Afrin prescription for three days and Claritin D q 12 hrs PRN. From January 6 to 9, I began to eliminate a serous-bloody vaginal discharge. That began with the elimination of a clot and progressively diminished day by day.  January 11, 2021, the ENT evaluated me and indicated that it did not observe polyps or anatomical problems. I had not previously prolonged nosebleeds. Previously two minor episodes happened to me, a year ago that resolved in less than 7 minutes. I didn&#39;t have a cold or any other symptoms.  I want to raise the flag because it was a strange event that occurred after the vaccination and that I had not experienced before in that way.My next dose is January 29, 2021. I am awaiting clot test results

                                                Patient received her vaccine and was taken to the observation area to be observed for a 15-minute period. In the observation area, she immediately reported &#34;feeling funny&#34; and was noted to be &#34;sweaty&#34;. The advanced practice nurses and pharmacist were called for assistance immediately. She was placed on a stretcher, had her legs elevated, and was moved to a quieter area. She was responsive to commands and her vitals at this time were as follows: blood pressure 96/56 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 96%, and heart rate in mid 60s.  She did not require treatment and within several minutes of lying down on the stretcher felt better. She did not have any rashes or swelling, and she denied difficulty breathing. She was observed for about half an hour in this area and was also evaluated Emergency Medical Services who had been called. It was suggested that the patient should visit the Emergency Department for observation but she refused as she felt better and due to concerns of being exposed to Covid-19. We were able to walk with her escort her to the exit area at the end of the observation period.   We questioned her about potential allergies again and she denied a history of allergic reactions. The advanced practice nurse evaluating the patient suggested this episode was consistent with a vasovagal episode and that anxiety could have also played a role.

                                                5 minutes after I the vaccination I got light headed and heart palpations were felt in my throat, elevated BP of 148/92  which continued to increase to 159/109 which then  Rapid Response was called in and I was transported to ER for about 4hrs.  2 EKGs - done 1st showed PVC, and Cardiac labs were drawn and was continued monitoring with elevated BP.  About 3hrs later ,the 2nd EKG was done which looked better and I was released.  I was advised I could return back to work on 1/1 but I still felt bad and had continued palpations and wasnt able to go bk to wk until 1/5.  I did return to work on 1/5 and at 1:30am I got up and felt lightheaded and the palpations returned.  I went to healthcare facility and got my bp taken which was 174/92 so I went to the ER.  I was given presnisone  and within the next 45min the palpations began to lessen and BP began to decrease. I was also prescribed a 7day course of predinsone and removed from work until 1/9.  I had a virtual visit on 1/7 with my physician in which I showed her the injection site which was still very red, painful and bruised so she prescribed Bactrim and Benedryl causing her to further remove me from work until 1/14.  I had a in person follow up appt on 1/14 which by that time all symptoms had subsided. My BP was back normal at 97/72 and my arm symptoms had subsided as well.  An in office EKG was done which was normal.  But from 1/6-1/14 the heart palpation and elevated BP remained.  Although I will say they did lessened throughtout that time it was extremely hard on me during that time frame .

The patient&#39;s medical history included a propensity for fainting and low blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient got dizzy, had nausea, a little vomit, and fainted to the floor. She reported feeling dizzy, hot and sweaty.  Patient did not take medication to treat her symptoms.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, fainted, dizziness, felt hot, nausea and vomiting, and sweaty were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 40-year-old female patient with medical history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the unlisted event of Syncope which was considered medically significant. Additionally, the patient experienced the non-serious listed events of Nausea and Vomiting, and the non-serious unlisted events of Feeling Hot, Dizziness and Hyperhidrosis. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. We would note that the patient&#39;s history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure could be also contributory.

Began profusely sweating drenching my clothes. Nausea began. Went back upstairs sat on my bathroom floor due to nausea/ dry heave. All of a sudden SEVERE abdominal pain began 10/10. Cried for my husband. Dripping sweat gave me a cold rag and foam large diarrhea began. Still 10/10 pain in abdomen. Felt like my lower abdomen was getting ripped out.  About 45 minutes or so later still 10/10 wanted to go to ER. I could not stand. If I stood my legs and body felt like I wanted to curl in a ball on the floor. He called an ambulance. I was pale as a ghost, no fever, normal vital signs. Went into full reynauds flare from body stress. Ambulance was unable to get oxygen sat and glucose at the time due to flare. Arrived at the ER labs drawn. WBC 10.9 and Glucose 194. I am not or never have been diabetic. Vaccine related. Like a lightswitch all symptoms stopped except sweating hot and cold spells, sore arm and drowsiness. Discharged at 6am

I was rushed to ER where the medical staff fought to stabilize me and administered three doses of Adenosine to control my heart rate.   Since 01/02/2021 I have been battling to control my heart rate with Propranolol. I have been to the ER multiple times weekly and have had numerous appointments with specialist at medical center--they are unable to diagnose me. They cannot find a reason for Tachycardia. Gastro, Endo, BH and Cardiology at medical center have many test, scans, echos, bloodwork and are unable to find cause let alone a solution.

The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

I took 2 advils which relieved the fever and body aches On Saturday and into Sunday, I continue to have an over arching malaise, I do not feel healthy.  I feel like my body is fighting something, I developed a slight sore throat and my head feels heavy and foggy. I&#39;ve continued to take advil.

                                                12/31/20 10:30a Vaccine given 10:48a Left the vaccine observation room 11:30a Started feeling warm like maybe my temp was increasing, face was red 12:00p had what felt like an adrenaline spike through my body became hot and jittery feeling. 12:30p The spikes started coming in waves, like a full body hot flash. Was very shaky and my tongue felt itchy and tight; not swollen just tight 12:40p made it home and took Benadryl 1:00p symptoms dissipated, ate a chicken salad sandwich thinking that would help with the jittery feeling. 1:25p The whole body flash came back and the tightness in the tongue increased. 1:27p Called employee health for information on this type of reaction. Wanted to call me an ambulance, I declined. After much discussion they suggested I come back to the vaccination observation room where they have epi, then decided it best that I go to Urgent Care. 1:40 on the way to town I told my husband to take me to the ED instead as my bottom lip felt swollen and tight, and my tongue felt thick like it was a bit swollen too. Was not short of breath, airway did not feel compromised, breathing normal, and heart rate normal. 3:01 Was given 40mg Methylpredinisone (solumedrol) &amp; 20mg famotidine (Pepcid) given- immediate improvement in tongue thickness and swollen lips. 440p 50mg Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 10mg loratadine (Claritin), &amp; 40mg prednisone given prior to discharge 8:20p Top lip started to swell just before my next dose of Benadryl 8:30p Took next dose of Benadryl, once it kicked in had quick resolution of lip swelling 9:00p joint pain started setting in, was uncomfortable but not too painful 1/121 Joint pain is still present but not uncomfortable. Injection arm a little sore, no redness or swelling at site of injection. Swelling of mouth, face and tongue is persistent as it nears the 4-hour mark for 50mg of Benadryl. 1p ate a couple of bites of chicken fried steak, face is increasing in redness and swelling, and mild tongue swelling. At max dose of Benadryl per box states to only take 6 doses in a 24 hour period. 2p Mouth and face swelling not relieved with Benadryl 2:52p checked into ED for 2nd time. 4:08 Given 10mg dexamethasone (decadron), 20mg famotidine (Pepcid), 10mg montelukast (singular) Swelling improved. 5:54p Potassium low on lab work given 40 mEq of potassium chloride 6:00p discharge with scripts for famotidine, epi pen, montelukast 7:00p taken 25mg of Benadryl 8:20p lips feel mildly swollen again. 8:45p next dose of 25mg Benadryl. Did not have complete resolution of swelling but did improve. Mild hives, swelling of hands and feet. 1/2/21 All joint pain is gone, and injection site pain is only noticeable if someone bumps into my arm. 6a 25mg Benadryl &amp; Pepcid 10a 25mg Benadryl 2p 25mg of Benadryl 3:30pm felt fine all day with only mild swelling and redness to hands, ate chicken nachos. Face became very hot (like my face was too close to the oven when I open it), redness from eyes down, lips swollen, mild itchiness too the tongue but nothing too concerning. 4p 25mg Benadryl I strongly believe the exacerbating factor is eating as all times the symptoms increased in intensity I had just eaten. After discussion with Dr. will be cutting out chicken (chicken was eaten before all 3 instances) and all other meats until complete resolution of symptoms and will avoid any inflammatory foods such as nuts, berries and shellfish. 7p 25mg Benadryl &amp; Claritin taken 7:30p ate a banana, no reaction 8p Singular taken 9:30p put Vaseline on my lips, face &amp; ears flamed hot and swelling and redness followed. 9:45p took 25mg Benadryl 10:25p tongue thick feeling 11p took 25mg Benadryl tongue still feels thick 1/3/21 Fevers 101.6 and chills started in the night Face and lips are permanently swollen and red despite all the meds I?m taking.Lymph nodes are all swollen. I?m too afraid to eat for fear of more swelling while my face is already so swollen.

Patient&#39;s arm became red and very swollen on two separate occasions after receiving flu vaccine but patient did NOT experience difficulty breathing, respiratory distress, throat swelling, shortness of breath, or anaphylaxis. Approximately 11 minutes after receiving Moderna vaccine, patient complained of warmth and redness at injection site. Immediately after this complaint, patient began to faint and complain of difficulty breathing and pain when breathing. Rapid response was called. Patient continued to complain of painful inspirations and difficulty breathing. EpiPen, albuterol inhaler, and diphenhydramine IM were administered. Patient improved and was transported to emergency room for further monitoring. Patient improved in emergency room and was discharged sooner after.

I felt mild pain in my arm in the evening of the 31st and then the pain started from my elbow to my neck on my right side. I went to sleep and woke up with general malaise, chills, body ache, sore throat, headache. the same feeling I had when I had covid, a heaviness in my chest, almost like a shortness of breathe. I was flushed and felt feverish although I never had a fever. The symptoms lasted all day.  On the first also my arm pain was severe, I could not even lift it the whole day. I went to sleep on 01/01 and when I woke up on 01/02 the symptoms were all gone. I took Tylenol 3 times to help me with the symptoms. 3 grams total in 24 hrs.

She thought she&#39;d be alright- but 5 minutes after the vaccine, she got very pale and lightheaded. Staff eased her onto the floor (she did not faint or lose consciousness) and staff raised her feet up on a chair. Then after about 5 minutes on the floor, we had her sit up and helped her to a cot- continued to lay down another 15 minutes. She also had not eaten or had anything to drink yet that day (she was vaccinated at 11:15am). Given apple juice, which also helped her body recover. No injury was sustained.

By late afternoon/early evening, my arm was a bit sore and later started to feel warm near the injection site.  However, I otherwise felt fine.  At 9 pm, I suddenly became very dizzy and passed out for several minutes. When I regained consciousness, I felt a little short of breath, which resolved within 20 minutes or so. However, I was also extremely nauseous, which got worse any time I tried to move. This continued for several hours.  I also alternated between being very warm and chills during this time - it was like waves of heat. I did not have a fever. Later, my head began to hurt and I took tylenol to help with that. I also had diarrhea. These symptoms began to gradually lessen after a couple of hours and I was able to fall asleep around 12:30 pm. I woke up hot and sweaty several times throughout the night. The following day, 1/6, I was very tired and had a headache and could not eat much, but otherwise felt much better.

I had significant soreness in my left arm where I received the vaccine, radiating down to my forearm. At approximately 7-8pm, I felt extremely cold.  I then noticed I had a flat, red rash on my face, chest, upper back, and shoulders.  There was no difficulty breathing, swallowing, or associated itching. My temperature was 99.0.  I went to bed at approximately 10pm, with no change in the rash.  I woke up the next morning at about 6am.  The rash was gone, and I felt well.  On 12/31, I developed moderate itching in the area of my left upper arm.  I noticed swelling, redness, and warmth in what felt like the exact area where I received my injection.  This continued into 1/1 except the itching had resolved, and I felt point tenderness as well as a cool, tingling sensation in my left upper arm. On 1/2 there was a shadow of redness in the area of my left upper arm, but the warmth, swelling, and tingling sensation had resolved.

                                                I woke up from sleep with severe chest pain at approx. 0400. It was sharp and radiated up to the left side of my neck. The pain was worse with breathing whether I was sitting up or lying down. My heart rate was 150 initially, but came down to 110&#39;s after a few minutes of waking up.  My heart rate did not decrease with rest and the chest pain was not going away, so I drove to the emergency room to be checked. Before I left the house I used my albuterol inhaler once to see if it would make the chest pain and tightness any better.  I received an EKG, mylanta mixed with lidocaine, IV pepcid and IV torodol to help relive the pain. The pain eased some (was a 8/10 when I awoke to a 2/10 after treatment). My blood was drawn, a chest x-ray was taken and the provider informed me all of my lab results, chest x-ray, and physical examination was normal. My EKG showed tachycardia and my heartrate did not drop below 100 beats per minute throughout the whole ER visit.  My BP at the highest was 151/94.  I have never had a problem with a fast heartrate or high blood pressure in the past.  I was discharged with a diagnosis of pleurisy caused by a cough I have been having.  I spent the rest of the day with chest pain and left arm pain from the site of the vaccination.

At about 2:00 am I suddenly awoke to severe nausea and thought I was going to vomit, but it didn?t come up.  Then, I felt like I was going to have diarrhea.  No BM.  Went back to bed eventually and continued to have chills and hot sweats back and forth. Nausea and stomach turning feeling  off and on.  No fever.  Normal temperature.  1/8 stayed home from work due to nausea.  Off and on during the day today and some light chills about 5 times so far.  Some headache and possible shoulder stiffness.

Did fine with injection, sat down for observation, 8-10 minutes later started feeling sweaty, then passed out. Woke up on the floor with nurses around me feeling tightness in chest, numbness in fingers, body shaking off and on, started to feel like tongue was swelling. Nurses gave IV fluids,  oxygen and 2 Epi-Pens. Transported by ambulance to Buffalo General Hospital. Symptoms resolved not long after arrival at hospital. Remained in EMT bay hallway for observation., seen there by ER doctor. Another EGK done, additional half bag of IV fluids, released after 4 hours observation.

                                                I received the vaccine at 12:59 pm and at 1:05 pm my heart began to beat rapidly. I felt heat rush into the left side of my head, I was extremely light headed and couldn?t catch my breath. I asked if there was a nurse that could help me. There was 1 paramedic watching everyone. I stepped outside, took my mask off to catch my breath. One staff member accompanied me and sat next to me. I began to shake in my legs and arms involuntarily, my heart kept beating and I just tried to do deep breathing techniques to catch my breath.  The paramedic came outside and asked if I wanted help. I declined his help and I called my husband who was sitting in the car to help me walk to our car. At 1:15, my heart was beating less rapid, I walked back to the car and as my husband was driving us home, my heart began to beat rapidly again, I felt burning and heat in my head and I began to shake in my arms and legs. It lasted about 10-15 minutes. We got home and I could barely walk into the house because I was so weak in my legs. I went to bed where my heart began beating back to normal after 1 hour or so.

Within about 60 seconds of receiving it, my heart started pounding hard and rapidly and I let a nurse know. She took my vitals and my heart rate was very high, as was my blood pressure. My O2 was fine. I had some tightness and heaviness I my chest. I felt flush in my cheeks, but did not have hives. The nurse said my color was very pale. I was warm, given an ice pack, and then a bit later cold. At one point they wanted me to go to the Emergency Department, which I refused (perhaps stupidly). I&#39;m not sure I was thinking clearly. I was trying very hard to stay calm and relaxed. My blood pressure was very elevated for about an hour and a half. They finally let me go home when I was 140/95 (my usual is 110 over 70 ish). I had some tongue tingling at home, very briefly.

                                                Right at the 15 minute mark I developed a full body sense of warmth followed by tremors and my HR rose from 70 to 138 very rapidly.  My mom was on the phone with me and stated I didn?t quite know what I was saying to her and she became worried.  The RN came by asking how I felt and I told her I was jittery and decided to wait at the site a few more minutes.  The sensation passed after about 3-4 minutes and then I felt ok.  I drove home and showered.  The rest of the night I would get random bouts of tachycardia and felt overall not well.  Also a small amount of chest tightness.  I also noticed things such as climbing by stairs cause me to become winded very fast and my HR would elevate rapidly.  Today I woke up and am feeling almost normal. HR has not been elevated but when I ate I did notice a small amount of lightheadedness.

At 3 am that morning , I had 102. fever. By the time fever broke, my arm had a goose egg the size of an actual egg.  The fever continued off and on the next 24 hours. The next day, my arm was swelling more about the size of a lemon. My whole arm was swelling. I then called my ER doctor. It felt like a hard lump. The fever I had again 102.3. I took Tylenol and Motrin and could not break fever. My heart rate went up to 125 from the fever. The next day, I felt achy, chills, nausea and then they subsided. It took about a week for the arm swelling to resolve.

                                                A day after the shot I was in the shower and started experiencing exhaustion and shortness of breath. I also had tachycardia. I proceeded not to feel well they?re very next day. Then on Friday I was dizzy and a coworker said that I was flushed and I wasn?t feeling well. I proceeded to go see patients and while examining a patient I became very dizzy and lightheaded while bent over and almost passed out when I came up.. at that time I decided to leave work and go to my PCP. Orthostatic?s were positive and EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and an echo is ordered. Echo was normal. Throughout the week I continued to have tachycardia and shortness of breath with any type of exertion. I left work this morning and was tested for Covid because of my symptoms.

                                                After over a week post vaccination I have noticed redness under the vaccination site that was warm to touch. Also noted significant discomfort and soreness in the armpit are and around the shoulder of the vaccinated arm. After palpating, I could locate several enlarged lymph nodes that were tender. The arm still has swelling and redness, however, lymph nodes are less tender although still sore.

Low grade fever noted approximately 8 hours post vaccine.   I took acetaminophen.  Headache, fatigue, and fever/chills resolved within about 48 hours.  Nausea and arm discomfort persisted for about 5 days.   After approximately 48 hours, I noted vision changes, blurry up-close vision.  This change might have occurred sooner, but it was not until this time that I felt well enough to really read.  The change in vision led me to seek further evaluation in the emergency room on 1/16/2021.

                                                Approximately 5-6 minutes after receiving the injection, I felt palpitations and my heart racing. I thought it was anxiety due to receiving the vaccine (though I had never had symptoms like that ever before), so I started deep breathing to try to calm down.  It continued to worsen but then stopped after approximately 2 - 3 minutes after deep breathing. I did not check my pulse during the episode but it felt like a regular rhythm, just elevated rate.  No medical attention or treatment was needed.  My heart rate was elevated for approximately 20-30 minutes afterwards (around 100bpm; my baseline is in the 70s).  During the episode, it felt much higher than 100bpm. I have had no further symptoms since then.

One day after my 3/4 of my upper arm  into my  axillary area became red, swollen, warm to touch, tender to touch, firm and itchy.  My axillary lymph nodes were also swollen and tender to touch.     My first vaccine was on 12/23/20. Several days after a small area around the injection site became swollen and itchy.  I also had a small palpable lump under my skin at the injection and my skin had a small area of hyper pigmentation for ~2 weeks. Again the area was much smaller and I did not think it would be considered an &#34;Adverse&#34; effect. I was also unaware that I was several weeks pregnant at the time of my first vaccine. when I went to the doctors office on 1/23/21 I was told I was 7.5 weeks pregnant, there was no heartbeat and I had miscarried.

She was assisted to the ground in a supine position and given one EpiPen injection, with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. Upon arrival to ED, she does endorse some diffuse itching over her body, but airway is asymptomatic. She denies taking Benadryl, Zyrtec, or any other antihistamines today.  o Of note, on the day of her first vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, she had gradually developed symptoms including severe fatigue, muscle aches, and headache. The following day, she also developed increased redness, hives, and similar itching to her presentation today, which she describes feeling like &#34;bugs crawling inside.&#34; She subsequently had a virtual visit with her PCP on 1/7, who prescribed her an EpiPen and Zyrtec. She has had resolution of these symptoms and has had no other complaints since.

I?m now allergic to soy, yeast, wheat, coffee, casein (dairy) peanuts, green beans/ legumes, eggs, onion and celery. I?ve had a huge rash that broke out on my left arm that started at the spot where I received the injection.  Now I?ve been experiencing my mouth and tongue swelling to the point that my throat has closed up. I?ve been hospitalized as air wasn?t going through my body. I had to inject an Epi-pen in my leg, and be taken to the hospital. I?m currently on high dosage prednisone, Benadryl and several other meds to address the swelling in my tongue that happens daily. I am desperate to find out if there is anyway to stabilize anything that vaccine had in it to see if this condition will get better.

                                                Onset of leg weakness and instability that has progressively worsened. Constant imbalance noted more in standing and with walking resulting in feeling like I am &#34;rocking on a boat&#34; constantly. Increased sway in static standing that is more pronounced with rotational movements, eyes closed, and decreased base of support. Ataxic movements and lateral veering with walking at times. Episodes of low blood pressure/significant decrease in blood pressure from sitting to standing, tachycardia, and resting tremors in the hands that are intermittent in nature. Feeling of head being &#34;in the clouds&#34; constantly where something is not right.

Had 5 episodes while there. Also, had tightening in chest and what felt like a heart attack. Been resting, still very tired and swollen nodes in my neck and sore throat as well as aches. Also, might be developing thrush. Didn&#39;t run a fever and Ive never had an allergic reaction  before this.

Narrative: Per patient: &#34;So I received the injection in my left arm and now have a itchy, sore knot at the injection site. That&#39;s not the issue. My nodes under my arm are swollen and painful for which I&#39;ve been taking NSAIDs with little relief. &#34;Really noticed it Saturday [1/2/21]. Been using a warm compress which helps a little but not much. Haven&#39;t seen anyone yet.&#34;

                                                Post vaccine next day i had scapula pain and chest burning, as the days went the chest burning became more intense. Thought maybe covid,  took test and it was negative, so now 7 days post vaccine still chest burning and scapula pain is intermittent. Contact pcp, going for bloodwork and chest xray. Outcomes to be determined. Pcp believes this is a vaccine reaction.

                                                Thursday night shortly after the vaccine I was exhausted and headed home to go lay down. While driving, I developed a severe headache. I went home and went to sleep really early. Friday morning, woke up, went to work. Extreme lethargy and severe headache. Left work early (2 ish) with joint pain, headache, lethargy. In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and &#34;buzzing&#34; throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled. Still lethargy and dizzy yesterday but no joint pain, no nausea. Now, Monday morning, still dizzy/lightheaded. Symptoms are subsiding, but not gone.

By that evening my headache was still there and I had the chills and felt exhausted. For next three days after I had a normal headache on and off accompanied by nausea. Tylenol slightly relieved the headache. The last few days I have been feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; but the headache is gone. I noticed my lymph nodes were a little swollen which I am thinking is what caused the headaches.

                                                I felt very heavy (especially my limbs) and had a slight headache on Thursday (the day after receiving the vaccine).  This feeling continued into Friday morning when I nearly passed out (blacked out and collapsed for a split second) as I was crouched position for approximately 10 minutes at work.  I felt dizzy and slow moving for the next several hours.  My blood pressure was rated as normal, blood oxygen normal, and pulse slightly low by a nurse on staff who took my vitals after the episode.   My temperature, which had been 97.8 prior to the event that morning (typical for me) was elevated during this time to 100.2 and returned to normal after approximately 4 hours without medication.  I was fatigued, so I slept for approximately 4-5 hours that afternoon and began feeling better the following day (Saturday).

                                                On the 1st day, I had a migraine. 2nd day (29th) fever, chills, nausea, vomiting - woke up with it and that lasted about four or five days And I had meds to treat it.. Went to work but had to leave work - acutely ill. When I went home, I had a rash across my abdomen. On the 30th I went to urgent care, I had a rash across my neck when I woke up. Rash kept spreading. They gave me a prescription for steroids and a cocktail of meds to reduce spread of rash. Watched me for 30 min to make sure I wasn&#39;t having airway restrictions and they sent me home. Had it for a week and a half. Went to PCP and came up with an action plan to get my next shot.

The patient&#39;s medical history included allergy to shellfish, bee sting, and mushrooms. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 31 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 31 Dec 2020, five minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced anaphylactic shock. Some of the symptoms experienced included chest tightness, difficulty breathing, throat swelling, and weakness. The patient was transported to the hospital by the emergency medical services (EMS). Treatment for the event included epinephrine several times.   On 01 Jan 2021, the patient experienced extreme fatigue, tightness in sternum, and weakness at home. She returned to the hospital where she was admitted. It was noted that a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed atelectasis. The patient also experienced extreme bilateral leg weakness and difficulty walking. The patient was advised to be placed in a nursing home/rehabilitation center.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome for the events, anaphylactic shock, extreme fatigue, tightness in sternum, atelectasis, extreme bilateral leg weakness, and difficulty walking, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 42- year old, female patient with medical history of allergy to shellfish, bee sting and mushrooms, who experienced a serious, unexpected event of anaphylactic shock, chest discomfort, muscular weakness, gait disturbance, fatigue, and atelectasis.

My left arm was significantly sore all day, pain from my shoulder to elbow and into my armpit/chest.  On Wednesday, Jan 20th, I noticed a red mark, oval in shape, about 4 inches from the injections site that became warm to touch.  During Wednesday and Thursday, the red mark got larger, wrapping around the outside of my arm and slightly swelled.  It is still warm to touch but not as red today (Monday 1/25). I have applied ice to it twice a day for 20 minutes at a time.

                                                Around 730-8 I got a really bad headache. Throughout the night my back tightened up and my hips. I got up tp get ready to go to work, I felt really  light headed while I was brushing my teeth but went in to work. I started felling shortened of breathe and achy. I started feeling  bad and told my Head Nurse and he took my BP and I have a fever. My heart beat was rapid. I went home, slept and had no appetite . The I ended up going to the Hospital  my chest was hurting bad in my lung area, everything about me just hurt I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  They did xray on my lungs, they were clear, my BP was still high, my heart rate had calmed down. They had me sit and relax. The next day I woke up and was ready to put my scrubs on, it was like nothing has ever happened to me. I felt worse with the vaccine then I did when I got the Covid, all I had with Covid headache.  Everything hit so rapid and fast after the shot.

                                                Right arm was sore to move and had armpit tenderness the first week. At the end of the first week I started to notice some redness along the injection site. The armpit began to swell about midweek after the vaccine as well. I began to use ice and ibuprofen to relieve the symptoms however yesterday (1-26-2021) I noticed that the redness was really starting to get worse and contacted my physician. Sent pics via patient chart and he suggested to keep doing what I was doing. This a.m. (1-27-2021) the redness was more apparent (quite warm to the touch too) and starting to broaden down my arm. Called Dr, had a visit. He recommended prednisone on top of icing and ibuprofen. Suggested I let CDC know as well.

                                                I received my second dose of the moderna vaccine on a Sunday at 10:30 am in my left deltoid.   Symptoms started with chills and swollen supraclavicular lymph nodes around 10:30 that night, and progressed to body aches,  joint pain, muscle pain,  and a low grade fever.   I was unable to sleep due to chills and pain.   The muscle pain would radiate down my arms and legs, and I would sometimes have a pinpoint sharp pain in the bottom of my left foot.  Symptoms persisted the next day, and also included extreme fatigue, nausea, and enlarged and painful axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  The  supraclavicular lymph nodes were large enough to visibly see.   A round rash/redness started around the injection site started on Monday as well.   This also occurred with the first vaccine, but is much larger this time.   Most symptoms had resolved as of Tuesday, except for fatigue and the rash which are still on going.

On 12/25/20 I was walking downstairs when my husband felt I didn&#39;t look normal. I fell off the bottom two stairs sustaining injury to both feet. I was able to get myself up to standing position and then sat down. My husband reports that a few minutes later I had what he described was seizure activity for about one minute/stopped breathing and he called 911. Due to COVID visitor restrictions my husband was not allowed to go to the ER with me the night of the incident.  I had full work-up with labs, EKG and head CT that were unremarkable  at Medical Center.  I had an appointment with my primary care physician on 12/28/20 and was referred to neurologist. He did an exam, ordered MRI and sleep deprived EEG. My MRI was completed and reported as no abnormalities. I have the sleep deprived EEG  scheduled on 1/11/21. I have continued pain/physical therapy on both feet/ankles from the date of the incident.

                                                about 2 minutes after receiving the shot I felt like I was having an allergic reaction in my chest area. My lower esophagus got extremely tight and then it worked its way up to the back of my throat. It felt like there was a lump in the back of my throat, along with burning in my throat. This same reaction also occurs when I eat certain foods I&#39;m intolerant to. I felt very dizzy right after as well. After exactly one hour my throat symptoms went away but suffered from residual effects for the next few days.  The next day I couldn&#39;t lift my left arm(which went away 2 days later), I was out of breath with everything I did, dizzy, muscle cramps, chills, body aches(as though I had the flu) and had extreme fatigue. All of theses symptoms lasted for the next week almost two.

                                                I received Moderna dose 1 on December 29th, 2020 around 10:30 a.m.  I did experience chills, body aches, extreme fatigue, pain and swelling at injection site for about 36 hours.  However, symptoms seems to resolve after a couple of days.  On Tuesday, January 5th around 5 p.m. at the injection site in my right arm it began to itch.  By 9 p.m. I had a huge red circle around 3 inches in diameter around the injection site, it was sore, swollen, warm to the touch. itchy and lymph nodes under right axilla were swollen.  I contacted my Dr. immediately the morning of Wednesday, January 6th and after assessing me she felt it was a skin infection. She prescribed Doxycycline antibiotic and Zyrtec by day, Benadryl by night.  I began the antibiotic treatment with first dose on 1/6/21 at 1:30 p.m., dose 2 9:00 p.m. and dose 3 on Thursday, January 7th 2020 around 8:00 a.m.  I have responded well to the treatment and already my arm is much improved.  My Dr. felt it could have been the technique of the administration of the vaccine that caused infection.  However, I wanted to report in case anyone else with this batch also experienced similar response.

The injection site was also very red, raised, itchy, and hot to the touch.  By Monday morning 1/4/21, nothing had changed taking ibuprofen and I consulted with a female GI doctor I work for.  She recommended that I see me PCP.  I was able to get in that same morning to the PA, and she called the Dr for further consultation after examining me.  He advised not getting the second dose of the vaccine and prescribed mthyprednisolone (medrol) 6 day pack.

                                                The patient had a previous reaction to a flu vaccine.  She was treated for Bell&#39;s Palsy related to the flu vaccine 3 years ago.  The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

Pain and swelling moved down into armpit and below followed by extreme itching.  Swelling and pain then moved down to left elbow. Then I developed throat itching, difficulty swallowing and wheezing. I also developed joint pain in opposite shoulder. I  immediately took 600 mg Ibuprofen and 50 mg Benadryl .  Itching, redness, and wheezing, and difficulty swallowing resolved about 30 minutes after taking the medication.  Next morning (today) I still have pain and swelling around injection site. Pain in left elbow and right shoulder joints. I still have moderate pain and edema below left armpit.

                                                I was fine the day of the vaccination.  I started feeling bad overnight - got a headache and arm got sore.  When I woke up in the morning to get ready for work I felt very weak.  I walked into my bathroom and lost conciousness.  I woke up on the floor and had hit my forehead on the tile floor.  I was confused when I got up, and proceeded to get into the shower.  I then passed out again in the shower and hit the back of my head against the shower wall.  My husband found me as I woke up on the shower floor.  He called my doctor and took me to the emergency department on doctors advice.

Around 5pm I began developing a headache.  At 6:30pm I developed a 101 degree fever, and took ibuprofen 600mg, my headache was more severe, I had chills, body aches and my left clavicle became swollen.  My heart was pounding and I felt short of breath.  The racing heart and breathing resolved by 8pm.  By 1am on January 15th my fever was 101.8, I had significant swelling in my left arm, left shoulder, back of my neck, upper back, and back of my head.  I had a severe headache.  I took ibuprofen 600mg at that time.  The swelling improved by 3am.  By 8:30 am my fever was 100.7.  I took 600mg of ibuprofen again and by 9:30am my temperature was 99.8 degrees.  I continue to have a mild headache and fatigue.

                                                On 1/15/20 at 10am, i noticed my L arm at the vaccine injection site was itchy and felt like it had a couple of raised bumps.  I was at work so i didn?t look at it until i got home after 5pm, when i discovered a blotchy rash around the injection site,  around 2 inches long by an inch wide.  It was itchy.  As the night went on, it grew larger, became more raised like a welt, and became painful/tender.  It was also still itching and burning, and hot to the touch.  I didn?t take my temperature but i was very cold and have felt fatigued for two days.   I applied ice, which seemed to help some, and took Benadryl.   It has grown a bit larger overnight.

Tingling and numbness would switch from right side to entire face but mostly on right side.  Headaches and noticed increased heart rate two days after vaccine. One week after vaccine numbness and weakness extended down right arm and leg, able to move leg just felt &#34;weak&#34;.  I thought I was having a stroke or TIA. Made an appt. with the NP and she did full neuro exam and everything came back normal.  Also, made an appt. with my PCP.  Still continued to have headaches and weakness improved. Did get a COVID test since was still having headaches and it so long since vaccine, received test 1/12/2021 and it was negative. This past weekend was the 1st time I felt &#34;pre vaccine&#34; 17 days post vaccination. I am truly hesitant to take my 2nd dose scheduled on 1/26/2021.

                                                8 mins after receiving first dose, I became very dizzy, my heart rate increased and I started sweating.  I never passed out and remained sitting.  The episode lasted 1-2 minutes.  I did not need assistance.    Then 2 -3 hours later I had the exact same episode and reported it to the downtown clinic and they only urged me to self monitor or report to ER if needed.  Those were the only 2 episodes.    My blood pressure was elevated that afternoon but was very low for 3 days and I did not take my atenolol for those days.

EMS was called during this time period. At 3:49 PM, patients lips and mouth started to swell and patient couldn&#39;t breathe. At 3:50 PM, a second epi pen was given and patient could breathe easier. EMS arrived shortly after and was taken to emergency room.

                                                She received her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 7:30 AM on 1-22-21. At 9:15 AM, she felt lightheaded, her heart was racing, and vertigo.  She had a nurse check her blood pressure and it was 101/65 and her heart rate was 138 bpm.  She felt presyncopal so she went to the ED for evaluation.  By the time she got to the ED, she felt her throat was scratchy, and when she would lie down flat she felt her throat was occluding.  She notes that she is s/p tonsillectomy in 12-2020, and considered whether that was playing a role in her symptoms, but she had not had any of those throat symptoms for 1 week prior to getting her COVID-19 vaccine.  In the ED, she was given IV medications and IV fluids.  ENT was consulted.  Her symptoms got better with medications, she is still experiencing some throat dryness but otherwise is feeling back to her usual self.  She never had any rash, flushing, itching.  She had a little tenderness at the injection site only.  She never had any difficulty breathing, lip/eye/tongue swelling, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, vomiting/diarrhea/abdominal pain.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine I began to feel light headed, dizzy and my heart rate was climbing. I wear an Apple Watch and notice my heart rate was steadily climbing. I asked the exit secretaries to be seen by a nurse and as they were getting a nurse my heart rate reached 169 and I was feeling faint and beginning to shake. When the nurse came she noticed how white my hands were and my breathing was becoming labored. The nurse called a code white and an ICU nurse and respiratory specialist arrived to assess me. I thought I would pass out and they had me lay on my back with legs up. They tested my blood sugar and were assessing my vitals. My breathing was fast but I was still able to breathe. My heart rate started to slow down but remained somewhat high. they helped me into a wheelchair and escorted me to the emergency department. I was assessed for cardiac concerns and labs were taken. After a couple of hours in the ED the dizziness started to subside but I had excessive thirst and dry mouth and slightly swollen tongue. I had feeling of butterflies in my stomach off an on. My heart rate stabilized and I was cleared to go home after four hours.

The symptoms continued to worsen each day, and on 2/09, I vomited and went to the clinic.  I tested negative for Covid-19, (both the rapid and 3 day tests), negative for the flu, negative for strep.  I started taking Excedrin for the migraines, and it helped, but prior to that, no medicine was working.  I continued to rest and take Excedrin.

These symptoms continued to slowly improve, but I had them through 2/19.

                                                At 3pm, I started to have a small allergic reaction.  Symptoms started with sweaty palms, my tongue  felt strange, my body felt weird particularly from my  knees to my toes and I was easily winded moving around.  Symptoms slowly progressed until I went to the dr and was prescribed prednisone and benedryl.

Went to urgent care and they did an EKG which showed A-Fib, so I was sent to the ER and from there, I was transferred to an ICU at a different facility . I stayed  until 1/8/2021. No cause was found and no history of A-Fib or family history.

                                                The day after I received vaccine I had severe arm pain at injection site, my body was achy , and fatigue. These symptoms resolved after a few days . I then had dizziness, nausea, unbalanced when walking, chest pain, feeling like my heart was racing,  palpatations, muscle weakness in my legs, and brain fog. The unbalanced feeling, dizziness, weakness ,and occasional palpatations remain. I had a covid test done on 1/6/2021.I had sinus pain started on 1/8/2021. I am being treated for possible sinus infection with Augmentin that I started on 1/11/2021 but my symptoms are still present . I have been unable to work because when I walk I feel dizzy and unsteady.  I have follow up with my primary doctor on 1/18/2021.

They&#39;re all mobile.No other symptoms to speak of.  No fever, no sore throat, no redness/swelling anywhere. Some mild baseline tiredness. I had some soreness in upper arm the first few days after the vaccine , some vague right shoulder/upper back pain last weekend that I attributed to muscle strain from overuse. I noted the 2 larger 1cm lymph nodes by mid-right clavicle 4 days ago, and the 2 smaller 0.5cm right sided lower cervical chain LNs 2 days ago.

The next day the arm was still very sore and I had very little energy and total body aches.  I self medicated with 600mg of Ibuprofin several times through out the day.  My injected arm was 4 degrees warmer on the surface than my non-injected arm; as measured with an infrared thermometer.   I felt like when I had actually had Covid 91 days prior.  The next day I was about half as bad as the day before, and I was able to return to work on Monday.  The injected arm remained sore for more than a week at the injection site.  I also experienced some swelling of lymph nodes under my arm.

Right arm at site of injection 1 week prior was acutely hard, elevated, red, warm and tender to touch.  I immediately took a benadryl and 5 mg predniosne tablet, water, elevated position to rest. Swelling of lymph nodes in neck improved and gradually resolved 3-4 days later. Right arm redness and size of affected area doubled over the next two days, but then started improving. Resolved in about 8 days.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; Angioedema; Shortness of breath; Wheezing; Fast heart rate; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 44-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced an anaphylaxis reaction, angioedema, shortness of breath, wheezing, and increased heart rate.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 20 Jan 2021 at 18:00, approximately 10 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection, the patient began to have tongue swelling. She was given diphenhydramine and epinephrine by epi pen. She went to the emergency room where she displayed symptoms including a fast heart rate, wheezing, and shortness of breath with an angioedema or anaphylaxis like appearance. She was given more epinephrine, famotidine, scheduled diphenhydramine at 50 QAs intravenously (IV), IV steroids, was intubated and placed on a ventilator. She was on the ventilator for approximately 18-20 hours following admission. She eventually responded to a high dose of dexamethasone. She was also given duonebs for her shortness of breath, regular sedation for the ventilator, and a dose of ketorolac. Consent was given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events were unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44 year old female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred approximately 10 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration. She was treated with epinephrine, famotidine, diphenhydramine, IV steroids, intubated and placed on a ventilator.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                First I got a headache, then I felt extra mucus in my throat. Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn&#39;t able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn&#39;t believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn&#39;t seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it&#39;s on record at the hospital that that&#39;s what happened the first time. It wasn&#39;t the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn&#39;t as good as last time, either. Apparently they&#39;ve been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn&#39;t offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that&#39;s what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there&#39;s a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I&#39;ll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we&#39;ll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it&#39;s taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot. I&#39;ve had problems breathing, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, flushing, fever/chills, and in general just felt like I had the flu.

                                                Slight right  facial numbness half hour post administration lasting 30 mins. Chills and Rt arm site pain and swelling on the first night. 2nd night, chills and increased swelling, pain to right arm site with slight weeping, warm to touch and redness. Throughout the first two weeks, I would have intermittent chills and right arm site redness, swelling, pain, warmth was gradually getting better but did not have any fever the first 13 days.  The night of 2/15/2021, I felt the chills, body aches and went to sleep. All night I felt I was about to get a fever. I was in bed until 1pm the next day on 2/16/21 when I started to have the severe tremors with my chills, back spasms, abdominal pain, and nausea. I got out of bed, took my temp and it was 101.5 F orally. I tried to take Tylenol but I could not because as soon as I sipped some water, I started vomiting yellow emesis first and then later on I was already vomiting greenish bile. I was getting weaker, lethargic and my tremors and chills were getting worst as well as my back spasms and abdominal pain. My husband, then brought me to the ER around 2:30-3pm. I was admitted in ICU for septic shock with unknown source on that day, 2/16/2021. I was on levophed drip via right chest central venous catheter for 48 hours and was given multiple antibiotics until discharged to home on 2/20/21. I developed red facial rashes more prominent to the right side on the second day of admission. Two days after discharge, I had headaches for two days with right shoulder pain. But, on the next day which was the 3rd day post hospitalization, I broke out with generalized reddened, raised, itchy and burning rashes. My husband brought me back to the ER on that day on 2/24/21. ER MD loaded me with dexamethasone steroid IV and Benadryl IV and sent me home with oral dexamethasone and anti-histamine orally. I saw my primary MD on 2/26/2021 for hospital follow up and referred me to Infectious disease MD and Endriconologist. On March 3rd, I was started on insulin SQ due to my blood sugars running 300?s to almost 400. As of now, my MD is still adjusting my insulin dosage due to persistent high blood sugar readings of 300-400 mg/dL.

                                                On Jan 31 woke up feeling like everything was spinning. Then on Feb I only had it a little spinning on Feb 2 the spinning was so bad ended up er. Said they thought vertigo. That week pulse was going up and blood pressure spikes started. I also started to not see things as clear getting bad pressure in face and forehead. I then had ent do epley maneuver that helped with spinning. However feeling like I wanted to spin would still happen even though I wouldn?t spin. Headaches on and off everyday couldnt sleep right for weeks. Pulse and blood pressure still going up. Then I never had this anxiety that started. Heart doctor put me on a beta blocker that?s been helping. I am 8 weeks from first shot and still not myself. Been on beta blocker for a little over a week starting to feel better bc pressure and headaches are under control. I have been to neurologist also. No one can really explain. I did get the second dose bc doctor said to on Feb 24th. I was fine till I took the vaccine on Jan 27th

Day 2: residual headache (50%), tiredness, weakness, sweating if doing things, residual knee joint pain, sense of smell/taste returned and heightened. Day 3: residual headache (25%), still not 100%, residual knee joint pain. Day 4 (today):  residual knee joint pain (comes and goes). I realize that these are not symptoms of an allergic reaction, but severe side effects.

                                                Patient had chest pain post administration of vaccine.  Patient attributed this to heartburn after eating a large meal just before getting her vaccine (though she didn&#39;t typically get heartburn). Since the pain continued to persist her BP was taken and was 160/110.  Patient said it may also be nerves but she didn&#39;t feel particularly anxious.  She also stated she hadn&#39;t had her BP medication that morning.  Patient took a couple of Tums and her BP was rechecked a few times.  Each time the BP stayed above what the patient said was her normal even without BP medication.  Due to the persistence of her hypertension and chest discomfort she was taken to the ED to be evaluated.  Once patient was in ED she had an EKG, CBC with diff, CMP, and troponin.  Provider eventually ruled it as an anxiety reaction (not cardiac related).

About 1 pm was sitting at my desk when felt flush and neck hurt. Noted rash across neck and upper torso, swelling at lymph node L side neck area. Area was painful to light touch. Pt (self) went to urgent care to be further evaluated by someone else other than patient, once there began to get worse.  All over tingling but significant at fingers, toes and mouth lips. Unable to talk clearly, but never  became confused. So tired unable to stay awake; difficult to rouse. No difficulty with breathing; Epi was not needed or given. Transported to hospital via EMS due to inability to stay awake and difficulty speaking/unable to stand without assistance. It was very hard to talk - to get the words out - but I never did have any decline in mental thought process and was never disorientated. Looked intoxicated however.  At hospital when pt transferred from stretcher to bed, pt doubled over due to abdominal discomfort - it was where the EKG stickers were. All reflexes noted to be hyper - MD kicked on accident when checking reflexes. the EKG stickers felt like being punched or slapped. Needed assistance transferring. All over numbness/tingling noted. Breathing never affected. Symptoms resolved after a few hours.

                                                6 days post vaccination (12/23/20),  I developed painful supra clavicular and axillary lymph nodes.  On day 7 itching, hive like red area over injection site, left upper arm. I made an appt with PCP as a precaution.   She thought the area over the injection site could be an allergic reaction or wants to monitor for potential cellulitis.    Lymph nodes are possible immune response to vaccine.   Day 8 area slightly larger and more painful area over injection site.   Have sent  message and picture to PCP. Lymph nodes still enlarged and painful.

Pt. evaluated by their in house medical team who administered a Benadryl injection to the right arm, unknown dosage. The pt. told me the nurse on staff measured her SPO2 at 86% and wanted to call 911 for transport to the ER. Pt. reports she refused and left work to come to the urgent care clinic where I evaluated her. She is concerned that she could be having a panic attack vs. allergic reaction. Her itching arm and metallic taste has resolved but she feels chest pains on the left side of her chest and her left arm feels heavy.

On Jan 4 2021 my bp and pulse were elevated, I had increased chest burning, headache and was admitted to the hospital to rule out MI.  The ct scan showed mild pancreatitis, endoscopy negative. I didn?t have a period for the month of Jan and I am neg for pregnancy. I continue to have esophageal, chest and back burning. I feel better now. I am scheduled to have my second vaccine Thursday Jan 21st and I am nervous. Not sure if this is an adverse reaction or coincidence.

At 6pm,  started with feelings of being flushed all over body with tingling in extremities to include face, tongue, throat felt like it began to swell with voice beginning to get raspy. Begininng of chest tightness. By 7pm  marked shortness of breath with increased chest tightness, more difficulty swallowing , raspy voice and oxygen saturations dropped to low 90&#39;s . Complete activity intolerance. Injection site had rash extending over entire upper arm and  forearm that was hot, raised and painful.  Took 50mgs Benadryl, multiple doses of rescue inhaler (albuterol) due to difficulty breathing following by steroid based inhaler (3 doses).  Sx continued through night and slowly improved. At 5 am took another 25mgs of Benadryl and took repeated doses of albuterol and steroid inhaler for 48 hours. (normally don&#39;t use at all). Oxygen saturation level returned to normal within 8 hours. Rash resolved with persistent Benadryl use x 2 days.  Due to lack of insurance coverage did not go to ER for Tx as recommended. I am a front line nurse so monitored at home.  Contacted MD via messaging system  MD has stated I cannot receive vaccine number 2 due to risk for complete anaphylaxis.

Patient was admitted to hospital in observation status.  She was stable overnight. She did have one episode of itching and nausea, she was given diphenhydramine and Zofran and these symptoms resolved. Patient was monitored until around 1PM the day after event and was released to home in stable condition.

It hurt to reach out to grab steering wheel. I felt very tired. I checked my temperature - 100.5. I got really cold and shivering at about 6:00 pm and I could not warm up for about 2 hours. It went to 101.5. Horrible pounding headache and dizziness. I started having stomach issues and diarrhea but didn&#39;t vomit. That went through the night - I felt like I had the flu. Back of my  neck was really stiff and achy - from shoulders up to the back of my skull. I didn&#39;t sleep much. I woke up completely soaked in the morning. My fever had broken. SUnday, I felt a little better. Dull headache ( it came and went). My temperature would go up and down -96.8 - to 100.1-ish all day. When my temp went up I got a headache and fatigue and down my headache would be better. Rolling every four hours. Monday, I stayed at 99.2 to about 100.2. Stayed at that the whole day. I was really tired. I had trouble thinking and concentrating. My arm was feeling better by Monday. Monday afternoon, about 1:00 my fever went to 100.5 and I called the nurse then. She told me to call my doctor&#39;s office. They sent me to a call to a triage nurse and she advised me to get tested for COVID. So Tuesday morning,  the 12th,at 9:00 am - healthcare clinic - the results were negative for COVID. Tuesday, I was feeling a little better - fever stayed around 99.2 to just over 100 and the headache was dull. I wasn&#39;t quite as tired. Wednesday, I was feeling better - like I could go to work but I didn&#39;t because of my fever the day before. I went to work on Thursday or Friday. The whole next week then I was better and felt fine. I got the second dose February 1.

I then went to urgent care and on the way there my heart was pounding and racing. After I was admitted they told me that I had tachycardia and my blood pressure was high (I do not usually have high blood pressure). They did an EKG at urgent care and noticed small changes. I was then sent to the ER and was given IV Benadryl and oral steroids. I was put on a heart monitor, and they were able to get my heart rate to go down, but a few hours later it jumped back up. At that point I was referred to a cardiologist and given a prescription for steroids, and then I was discharged. I saw the cardiologist 2 days later, during those two days I still experienced red hot spots on my arm, shortness of breath, Tachycardia, and shivering. When I went to the cardiologist, they did another EKG and said I still have tachycardia and did some bloodwork. The results of the bloodwork were normal and the cardiologist diagnosed it as an unspecified delayed severe allergic reaction. I am still experiencing symptoms and still having to use Benadryl and steroids.&#34;

                                                Following the vaccine I was slightly dizzy, after 25 minutes my chest started to get tight, had difficulty breathing, racing heart rate, some constriction in the throat.  I was taken to the ER, used Proair inhaler on the way to ER to ease breathing,  O2 sat slightly decreased but returned to normal in the ER.  Due to difficulty breathing, I had some increased anxiety which lessened after breathing became easier.  Nebulizer treatment given in the ER.  Benadryl 25mg taken.  Rash on L arm and upper chest, burning and pain in L arm.  Benadryl taken for 2 days due to returning rash and burning in arm.  Nebulizer treatments every 4 hrs on the day of the vaccine due to continued tightness and difficultly breathing.  The following day I had fatigue, slight fever, pain of 7 out of 10 in L arm, headache, neck and muscle pain.  Followed up w/ primary care physician on 12/29/2020, he advised not to take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  L arm pain lessened to 4 out of 10 on 12/30/2020.  L arm pain dissipated on 12/31/2020, but headache, neck pain and fatigue continued through 1/1/2021

                                                After taking Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA: About 10 minutes after injection, I noticed a slight lightheadedness, slightly increased heart rate yet I was already anxious, and a very faint tingling in lower lip and end of tongue. Between 1-2 hours after injection, I noticed a little bit of a scratchy throat,  increased thirst, and mild headache. No treatment required.  I took Benadryl and Tylenol when I returned home from my shift at work about 4 hours after the injection. The next day, 1/3/21, scratchy throat had disappeared.  I felt tired, slight fever of 99.5, increased thirst, and very sore arm.   On 1/4/21, I just have slightly sore arm and a little tired with no fever.  I took Tylenol.

This only lasted for approximately a minute. I sat and waited for about 30 minutes before I left. When I got into my vehicle I noticed that my chest was really tight and I called my husband to talk to me while I drove home. After arriving home and not feeling like my chest tightness was a normal symptom I called my daughter who is an RN and she checked my vitals which were fine. She told me that I should continue to self monitor and if I got any worse to go to the ER. My symptoms chest tightness did not get any worse and felt a little better by the time I went to bed between 10-11pm. The next morning I woke up to get ready for work and felt a lot of the common symptoms like:  Fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and my arm was sore. The highest fever that I recorded was 102.4.  I still have a fever as I am filling out this form. It is 100.2 and I took 2 Motrin an hour and a half ago.

                                                Two hours after the injection, I started to not feel &#34;right.&#34;  My head felt heavy, I was getting a little dizzy and all I wanted to do was to lie down.  By the third hour, my body completely shut down.  I was so tired I had no energy to move, to talk, and even breathing was difficult (not because I couldn&#39;t breathe, just that the effort was difficult).  I was dizzy, nauseous, and lost my appetite.  My temperature was elevated, 98.5, but no fever.  I slept for 5 hours as if in a coma.  Woke up to drink water, felt total-body aches, and slept the rest of the night again getting at least 12 more hours of sleep.  At some point during the night, I had chills so bad my body was shaking uncontrollably.  I had 2 layers of clothes and 3 layers of blankets and could not warm up.  Day #2 (today), I have a tremendous headache, dizzy, nauseous, my heart rate is abnormally fast and I am out of breath.  My resting heart rate is typically upper 50&#39;s and is currently averaging in the 70&#39;s, jumping into the 90&#39;s often.   Sitting up, my heart rate is between 80-100 (which is typically my rate when I exercise).  When I stand up or walk to the other room, my heart rate is around 115-120 (typical of when I am running/sprinting or participating in taxing exercise).  Along with this, I am out of breath as if I am exercising, although I am barely moving around. All I am doing is laying down, only getting up to go to the bathroom and my body feels like I ran a marathon.  Breathing is difficult even at rest.

I also had some symptoms that I don?t think are common.  My arm muscle was twitching and my pinkie and ring finger were tingly and cold. All went away after a couple days.  Day 8 discovered a lump on my arm where the injection site was.  Was red, hot and a little itchy fingers tingly again.  Saw doc on day 9.  Gave antibiotics incase of cellulitis/infetion but not sure the cause.  Now that is 90% cleared up.

                                                Just prior to 5P had left arm pain -that traveled to my hand. At 5PM driving and heart rate went 128 - most likely higher (registered on iwatch). This is abnormal for me as my heart rate is typically in high 40&#39;s (marathon runner).  Along with the rapid heart rate felt like throat was closing - like a reaction caused by an allergy.  The rate rate stayed like that for about a minute or two followed by severe chills (chills can be described like when a person comes out of the OR).  I felt like I was coming out of my skin and became dizzy. I became nervous and called 911.  In discussion with the 911 dispatch everything subsided and decided I would continue driving with an intent to going to Hospital.  About 10 minutes later, prior to getting onto I95 the same cycle with increased heart rate followed by chills occurred again for about the same timeframe.  I do not know how far apart the cycle was occurring other than I ended up calling 911 again and Ambulance was dispatched while I was on I95 and I had pulled over.  Approx arrival of ambulance was about 6P Once in the back of the ambulance, I showed no arrhythmia and heart rate was now in the 70&#39;s, however I was still having the chills.  Decided to drive home after waiting about 20 minutes in the back of ambulance with no further issues of the tachycardia. Once I was home I continued with chills and a high fever throughout the night.  The fever did not go away until about 48 hours. The chills went away by the following morning. Thursday and Friday have had chest tightness and the feeling of needing to take large breaths to expand chest.  Continue to have moderate headache.

                                                During the 15 minute observation period post-vaccination, patient was noted to have hives on her neck. Patient was taken to ER. Arrival Vital Signs were WNL. Patient c/o itching, erythema, swollen tongue, changed voice, breathing &#34;a little tight&#34;.  Epinephrine and DuoNeb ordered. Seizure like episode at 02.04.21 at 1240 BP 209/81, HR 111, RR 24, Pulse Ox 100% on 15% Non-rebreather mask, Rectal temp 98.4 ED MD wrote:  &#34;At approximately 12:40pm this afternoon the patient was having what appeared to be a seizure versus severe rigors.  She was not verbally responsive and appeared to be apneic with her head shaking in her arms flailing rigidly in an up and down motion.  Symptoms lasted approximately less than 2 minutes and patient was not postictal.  She was not incontinent.  Blood sugar is in the 180s and her rectal temp is normal.  I believe this patient is having a severe reaction to her moderna vaccine that she received earlier today.  Her 1st vaccine was January 7th and today was her 2nd vaccine for COVID.&#34;  Teleneurology consult conducted, no documented recommendations. Patient was transferred to higher level of care.

Per staff, she was wheezing initially. She was taken to the triage area, supplemental oxygen applied, vital signs obtained: BP 164/98mmHg, HR 97, RR 21. O2 saturation initially marginal (87% on RA), corrected with 6 Liters of NC supplemental oxygen. BP stable in the 140-160&#39;s/80&#39;s range. HR initially in the 90s, then fluctuated between 100-120&#39;s subsequently. She was observed for 30 minutes, during which time she had 5 episodes of intermittent tachypnea, c/o feeling hot, dizzy and chest tightness. Patient states that she has h/o anxiety and ADHD, taking Adderall and Prozac. She had prior anxiety attacks but this one does not feel like anxiety per patient. She further reports that she had some reaction to her 1st dose of Moderna vaccine (on 1/9/2021) with headache, fever, hallucination, tiredness, loss of taste and smell on 1/10/2021.  She was given 2 puffs of albuterol inhaler without significant improvement at 15:45pm. At this point, given no notable resolution of her cyclic tachypnea, EMS was called at 15:50. Care was transferred to EMS at 15:53.  During this entire episode, there was no wheezing, no rash, no hive, no stridor. She was maintaining normal sensorium, talking to staff throughout, drinking sips of water.

                                                Fatigue - I was unable to work that day. I was so tired. Pain - in my arm to the point that when I moved my arm I felt like I was going to pass out - it hurt that bad. I felt nauseous like I would vomit. I didn&#39;t vomit. Had a headache on day two (I have been having headaches since I had COVID in July 2020). I took Tylenol for that severe headache and that helped and it was just that one day that it was severe.  The worst, was my heart - increased heart rate - anything I did just was difficult on my heart. My heart - was having a hard time - standing, brushing my teeth - was exhausting for my body. That type of exhaustion went on for five days. I was able to feel better by day 11. But my heartrate is still poor. Depending upon what I did - 10 to 30 beats over my normal - just normal work. 40 beats over when I&#39;m attempting a more intense exercise. A slight jog puts my heartrate to 180. My heart rate still hasn&#39;t subsided yet - it is still above average above post COVID ( I had COVID in July of 2020). My heart rate was still at an elevated rate post COVID but worse after the vaccine. I have chest pressure now - like someone sitting on my chest - that started day two after the vaccine. Even when I&#39;m resting, I have chest pressure - it comes and goes and there seems to be no pattern as to why. Didn&#39;t have a doctor visit this second time yet. I treated with Tylenol for the pain at the injection site and for that headache and then I just rested my body.

                                                Patient&#39;s received 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine Friday 3/12.  Her husband reported she had not unexpected fatigue,  malaise, and fever for 1 day but better after that.  On Monday she began complaining of shortness of breath.  This progressively worsened and she started having presyncopal episodes.  On Saturday she was unable to come down the stairs in the house so husband planned to take her to the hospital but she stood up and passed out and woke up quickly.  He decided to call EMS.  By the time she presented to our hospital she was cyanotic and agonal breathing.  On moving her from EMS stretcher to ED bed she had PEA cardiac arrest.  She underwent mechanical device CPR with only brief (&lt;1 min) ROSC x1.  She at some point did have a shockable rhythm.  Cath lab was notified and she was taken emergently to the cath lab with ongoing mechanical device CPR.  Peripheral VA ECMO was placed after about 1.5 hours.  Pulmonary angiogram was done which showed massive saddle PE with near complete obliteration of the right pulmonary tree and some filling defects in the left tree as well.  At that time she had severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 24.  She also had no gag or corneal reflex, minimally responsive pupils, and no response to noxious stimuli.  Mechanical thrombectomy was attempted with some result.  She was transferred to the SICU with increasing pressor requirement, and DIC.  Ultimately, the venous catheter of the ECMO circuit malfunctioned thought to be secondary propagating IVC thrombosis.  Family decided to withdraw care and she passed away.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving injection in right arm I felt a BOOM flush all over my body like I just had an IV Contrast.  Then I became dizzy, my heart started racing, I started cold sweats and felt tightness in my mid upper chest to the base of my throat.  The ED RN on site took my BP and HR and had me lie down because I felt that I couldn&#39;t breath.  She called paramedics who took my BP and HR, then did a 12 lead EKG.  They transported me to the ED.  I was worked up for cardiac, lung, chemistry.  My troponin-HS was slightly elevated and a cardiologist was called.  He did an echo on my heart, liver and right kidney -- normal.  Chest X-ray was normal.  A second 12 lead EKG was done, normal sinus.  Hematology, Chemistry was normal.  Was in the ED from 11:30 to 4:00 p.m.  Advised by ED Doctor, and Cardiologist, that it seems the stress of the anaphylaxis reaction stressed the heart which caused the spill of troponin.  Advised to see my cardiologist and get a stress test.  I have already informed my Primary Care Doctor and he has prescribed me an EPI-PEN to carry.  I have no history of allergic reactions/anaphylaxis reactions to vaccines.  I am up to date with all other vaccines and just had my yearly flu shot in November 2020.  This was my first allergic reaction/anaphylaxis reaction to a vaccine.

Headache, fatigue, joint pain, lymph nodes under arm were very painful for about week. And of course pain at injection site. On 09 Jan 2021  a red rash appeared and itching. It is also warm to the touch on left arm at or around the injection site. (concerned about this sense it appeared a week later.) Did not have this for a week.   After all the symptoms went away.

                                                about a week later 1/7/2021 I woke up to about 10 large hives that looked like burn blisters and sore, swollen lymph node under right arm.  I had been treating the hives with alcohol and anti-itch cream along with Ice packs. As of today 1/11/2021 the hives and swollen lymph node are gone and I feel much better. I reached out to the CDC and they could not explain what the reaction was about nor have they heard of the symptoms. I called my PCP and I&#39;m waiting on him to call me back. I am not sure about getting the second dose due on 1/28/2021.

                                                Pt sent me an email stating she had a sore upper arm, in the muscle, where she got the covid vaccine on 12-31-20 on the left deltoid.  It lasted about two days. She stated then that her lymph nodes under her arm on that side got really swollen and sore.  That started after the muscles soreness at the injection site dissipated. States it was fairly significant and that she could see swelling for a few days and feel it for several more, up to six more days.   States the lymph node swelling was probably the worst Jan 4 ? 6, and was still noticeable on Jan 9.  By Jan 10 is was basically gone.  States she has also noticed some very mild, intermittent itchiness on that shoulder near the injection site in the last few days. Pt states it used to be hard, warm and hot but has since decreased leaving her with some itchiness.

Stayed in bed for two days. Third day at 4:00 am - no headache that third morning - blood pressure was back to normal. Headache came and went for next five days on different side of head.

This started several days after the vaccination.  My doctor recommended that I take Benadryl.  I took one Benadryl the night of 1/6/21 but the redness did not abate.  I applied topical Benadryl twice a day for the next 2 or 3 days and the redness is gone.  The lymph node is still noticeably swollen but otherwise fine.

At approximately 1:00 a.m. on 1/26/2021 I started waking up a lot and couldn&#39;t get comfortable.  I tossed and turned and body aches began and quickly worsened.  My knees, thigh bones, hips, pelvis, lower back, and shoulders all hurt like I had been beaten with a bat.  I took a sick day from work due to the severity of symptoms.  I had no fever, but did have hot flashes periodically throughout the day.  I was dizzy upon standing, had nasal congestion, and sever fatigue, and developed a moderately bad headache later that day.  I went to sleep at 10:30 p.m. on 1/26/2021 and slept through the night.  Upon waking on 1/27/2021, I felt much better.  I still have some lingering fatigue and stiffness but not enough to interfere with my normal routine.  I was vaccinated in my left arm and today, 1/27/2021 I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit that are quite sore.

I began to get little red dots on both of my lower legs a total of about 10. They began really light and over the night got brighter and bigger. I went to the doctor the next morning and was given a prescription for a steroid and antibiotic which I first took at 2000 hours on 12/31/2020. By the next evening my dots began to get lighter. As of today all but one have faded away. The one I have is really light. I did have some of the usually listed symptoms, slight headache, runny nose, hard to breathe.

                                                I got the vacine today.  Unfortunately I did have a reaction, and had to cancel my patient load at work for the day.  They said if you have food allergies you might have one, but I was willing to risk it.  They observed me for 30 min after.  After 15 min it felt like I was having a mild panick attack, but I?m used to that so I just breathed through it.  Coughed a few times.  After 30 min got up and was whoozy/dizzy, but shrugged it off, got my card and walked slowly to my car, drove 5 min home.  By then my hands were shaking hard.  It was like being shot with a crapload of adrenaline.  I called my sister and when I talked I started sobbing.  I don?t know, I just couldn?t stop.  But I knew it was just the adrenaline and if I could calm down, I?d get thru it.  She was awesome bc she kept her voice soft and low when she spoke, which helps.  After 3 hours it has calmed down and I?m just really cold and exhausted and nauseous and only a little shaky.  Being quiet and calm is helping.  Also sitting on a heating pad bc it?s 74 in my apartment and I?m freezing cold.  I?ll be ok by end of day.  I got the Moderna vacine and I?m still glad I did and thankful I could get it....but to those who are getting it...symptoms are that it feels like being shot full of adrenaline, you get a panic attack, but my O2 actually went up, not down.  Chest pain, panting, high anxiety, shaking, nausea, dizziness.

                                                Upon waking the next day I suddenly felt very ill, I was short of breath, had chills and was too weak to care for myself.  I had been diagnosed with COVID in June and was very ill with that.  This felt exactly like I did when I had COVID.   Throughout the day I ran a fever around 102.  My ability to think or care for myself was greatly impaired.  I continue to fight fatigue and brain fog.  I then developed several cold sores outside and in my mouth.  I continue to battle fatigue and weakness but am improving and now back to work.  I do not plan to get a second dose as I am afraid of a stronger reaction that would require emergency care.

A CBC was obtained which revealed an H/H of 12.2/36.1 and a platelet count of 1 (not 1K, but 1 platelet!) and this was confirmed on smear review.  She was immediately sent to the Hospital ED and repeat CBC confirmed the critically low platelet count.  She is currently hospitalized and she has received platelet transfusions but her platelet count is still critically low.  She is also receiving steroids and immunoglobulin and is under the care of MD (Heme/Onc)

                                                7 days after  vaccine administration, my right shoulder began itching and several large red welts appeared. I took Benadryl before bed and that alleviated some itching. The following morning I had a 4 inch by 6 inch area of redness like a sunburn on my shoulder. The skin is hot. My husband who is a physician described the area as indurated. I was able to go to work. I used ice packs for the itching because Benadryl is sedating. Friday evening the shoulder continued to be red and indurated and hot. Saturday AM the shoulder has a center area of white with decreased sensation of hardness. There is a dull ache and the skin is hot.

She went to check on her at 2:00 PM when she found her in the hallway very pale/gray, bradycardic, and hypotensive. The nurse said she appeared to be postictal and hallucinating. They immediately called 911 -and she was transferred to the hospital and to my knowledge she is still there. RN will keep me updated.

Got out of bed to get Motrin and had 2 syncopal episodes. On the 2nd syncopal episode during the fall I hit my chin on the wall and put a hole in the wall. ED on 1/31/2021- unable to determine on facial CT if mandible was fractured due to the amount of swelling and blood pooling in the area. Treating as if is fractured: tetanus shot given, 10 days of antibiotics, and follow up with oral facial surgery if needed.

                                                The day of the injection, approx. 3-4 minutes after getting the injection, I almost passed out.  I became hot, sweaty, dizzy and my head starting to buzz.  The nurse on-site provided me a couple cold packs and after about 30 minutes, I felt better. The nurse described my response as a &#34;vascular&#34; reaction.  Later that night, I got a headache and night sweats and bouts of nausea.  They only lasted a day.    Approx. 10 days after the injection,  the injection site became red, swollen, itchy and uncomfortable to the touch. Then it traveled down my arm and created a large red, swollen, itchy area on my entire upper arm.   I advised my doctor and she provided me a Rx for a topical steroid and oral steroid.    After 5 days of treatment, it is 90% better.   The injection site still hurts.

                                                7 AM 3/25/2021 - Patient called out to husband from the bathroom where she experienced a syncopal event, then passed out.  An ambulance was called and she was revived for a short period of time.  She was taken to Hospital where she coded 3 times.  She was then life-flighted to second Hospital.  According to the hospital records, tests conducted over the course of several days determined that she had no neurological activity.  Initial reports in the records indicate pulmonary embolism, cardiac and respiratory arrest.  She was on life support for the remainder of her time.  Organ donation is being pursued at present and results of this are pending at time of this report submission.  Date of death is unknown until organ retrieval is accomplished.  Family will be contacted in the next few days to ask further questions about any other kinds of vaccine-related reactions that may have happened more immediately to days after the vaccination on 3/17/2021.  A co-worker thought that she had shortness of breath for 3-4 days before this critical event occurred on 3/25/2021.

Approx 10 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose # 1, patient was still in vaccine clinic area and complained of dizziness, palpitations and flushing.  I observed patient fanning herself with papers.  She was escorted out of the immediate clinic room, and assessed by paramedics present as having an anaphylactic reaction.  Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV given in clinic, Rapid Response was called overhead and patient immediately transported down the hall to the Emergency Dept. In ED, pt was noted as having swollen tongue, large areas of erythema on face, arms and chest, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (per ED physician notes).  Pt reported being hospitalized in ICU with COVID disease more than 3 months ago, including intubation (not treated at this hospital), and has been back at work since August 2020.  ED physical exam noted bilateral wheezing and patient in acute distress.  In ED, pt administered racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL via neb, epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV and epinephrine 5 mg/250 mL IV drip (started at 0.118 mcg/kg/min).  Acute symptoms reported to resolve in ED.  COVID test was negative.  ED physician discovered that pt had history of multiple medications, including previous anaphylactic reaction to radiocontrast dye requiring intubation (which was not disclosed on the vaccine screening form).  Pt admitted to Telemetry floor for observation.   Overnight course was unremarkable, and patient was discharged the following day with prescription for Prednisone taper and prescription for Epi-pen.  Advised not to return for second dose of COVID vaccine.  EMR updated to reflect possible anaphylactic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

Patient received her COVID-19 vaccination on 12/30/2020 around 1PM. Immediately after the injection in her left shoulder, she began to feel warmth and numbness in her left shoulder, arm, neck, face, and chest. She reports later experiencing nausea, palpitations, and left arm weakness. Her symptoms persisted, and her family noted a left sided facial droop which prompted her ED visit.    In the ED, patient was noted to have some left sided facial droop and left arm and leg weakness. CT head and CTA showed no acute abnormalities. Tele-neurology was consulted who recommended admission to rule out acute stroke.  Ultimately, work up was negative and symptoms resolved.  Symptoms appear to be related to the vaccine.

I told RN, the nurse who gave me the injection and I was told to lay down on my back and she lifted both of my legs perpendicular to the floor. My hands and feet were tingling. My blood pressure was taken and the first reading was elevated and hear rate was 102. I was given a can of apple juice and I felt better after drinking it. Since the blood pressure cuff was too large for me, I was able to go downstairs to urgent care and get a reading with a smaller cuff. The last BP reading was had lowered and I was able to leave. I did not feel well for a good 45 min.  My left arm was very sore for the first 48 hours. It did not go away for at least 5 days.

                                                moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Tachycardia sudden onset 4 minutes after injection (6:09am). Arms and legs cold and weak. Generalized weakness. BP 167/78, o2 sats 100%. Tachycardia lasted about 10-15minutes and resolved to HR 88 and BP 138/78.  Still left with overall weakness, malaise, cold feeling. No other symptoms.  Released from the facility at 6:48am.  Drove 2 blocks to my husband&#39;s workplace (hospital). Had diarrhea x 2, dull diffuse headache, odd feeling and malaise that persisted. Sudden onset of terrible feeling, the need to get to the ER at 8:36am. Had a bathroom visit to urinate. By the time we got to the ER the intense malaise improved. I sat in the ER lobby not wanting to be admitted to the ER (didn&#39;t want to be having a vaccine reaction). I stayed in the ER lobby. Symptoms completely resolved at 9:45am. I stayed there for 30 more minutes to be sure and then drove home with no other symptoms but Left arm soreness. Tachycardia never returned after the first episode. No rash, no itching, no swelling, no dyspnea. Just felt toxic. Then it resolved completely at hour 4.

In ED became responsive, reports numbness in both arms and short of breath.   Received Benadryl complete assessment, doesn&#39;t appear to be an acute allergic reaction.  ECG &amp; vitals were okay. Patient observed for 4 hours and seemed to improve so discharged.

                                                Thursday January 7, 2021: Developed a hard lump around the injection site (A week to the day later).  Friday January 8, 2021: Arrived at work and around 9:30 felt short of breath. Had pulse and oxygen checked anyway; Pulse 99 (down from 107) and Oxygen 99. Dismissed it as being in my head. Proceeded through my day and it persevered.  After lunch, still felt short of breath. Contacted Infection Control nurse and was advised to leave work as it was also a COVID symptom.  Went home around 12:15; felt fatigued. Slept all day and night. Saturday January 9, 2021: Minor sore throat, feel as if coming down with a cold.  Back of sinuses felt hot upon breathing.  Bump at injection site gone completely (I massaged it Thursday and Friday). Minor discomfort with breathing; barely noticeable. In the afternoon time around 2pm, sudden and urgent diarrhea that lasted into the evening hours at bed.  Top of stomach burning (inside body). Diarrhea stopped, but nausea remained.  At bedtime, still felt as if coming down with a cold. Sunday January 10, 2021: Woke up feeling as if I was getting over a cold.  Nose stuffy on the side I slept on. Throughout the day, had the sniffles as the stuffiness went away.  Stomach still off; feeling nauseous.  No diarrhea (no bowel movement at all).  Throughout the afternoon tightness in chest/shortness of breath returned.  Towards the evening time still felt as if getting over a cold.  Contacted Human Resources and voice appeared hoarse. Ended phone call.  Touched my face and noticed a huge lump on my chin that felt like the lump at injection site.  Felt like a cyst. About 20 minutes later began to have difficulty swallowing; throat felt tight.  Drank a bottle of water and took two allergy pills with antihistamine.  An hour and a half after taking these,  tightness in throat is still present, but has not progressed any further; in fact, it appears to be slowly fading away.  (It&#39;s more like the feeling of having a &#34;lump in your throat&#34; (but I can&#39;t physically feel a lump).  The lump on my chin has noticeably diminished in size and is less painful to the touch. COVID test is scheduled for 1/11/21 at 10:30am. It feels as if my body is doing a &#34;systems check.&#34;

Patient was told that it was an anaphylactic reaction and shouldn&#39;t have been managed at home as a child by nurse and should have been taken to the hospital. Patient was told they would be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. Within 2-3 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient reported tingling or burning around the site of injections. Within 5 minutes they stated to be feeling tired and that their arm had felt numb. After this the patient began starring into the distance and was unresponsive. Called for help and advice by turning around as patient had syncoped. Got nurses and other team members attention and had an epi-pen ready just in case it was needed. Patient began having notable distress with respiration and administed an epi-pen. Advised for a nurse to call EMS for patient and crash cart/oxygen was also obtaine dby the facility. Oxygen was required. Patient was not responsive after the first dose and was given a second as they remained un-alert with notable distress.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine, I awoke at 4am to severe pain, swelling, and stiffness at the injection site.  By 7am I was feeling nauseous, lightheaded and my arm was very stiff, itchy and swollen at the injection site.  I took Zyrtec D thinking that this was a delayed allergic response to the vaccine.  By 10am the symptoms were worsening and my lymph nodes in my left underarm and in my neck were swollen.  I called my physician who had me add another dose of Zyrtec and Motrin.  These symptoms worsened over the course of the day including tingling in my left arm and hand, numbness in my arm and hand until approximately 730pm when I was finally able to eat something and keep it down.  I went to bed exhausted, still with stiff upper arm and feeling general malaise.  I awoke this morning (1/20/21) at 6:45am and my arm is still stiff and swollen.  Other symptoms are resolving and I have been able to eat.

Within 36 hours I developed a &#34;rash&#34; that was later diagnosed as petechiae. Labs were ordered immediately and my platelet level was 66,000. The hematologist that was consulted with had me report to the emergency room for further tests. I was informed not to injure myself in anyway with a count that low or I could hemorrhage and die.

The night of the injection my arm hurt, a bruise was present and a large lump (1 inch by 2 inches) was present. Blood was also in the band aid ( 1 drop) applied to the injection site. The night of, I had shortness of breath, and severe right eye socket pain. I also had tenderness on the right and left side of the tongue. The injection site swelling and tongue pains were significantly reduced by 01/24/201.  On 1/26/2021 I visited my eye doctor who took pictures of my eyes to confirm no internal injury since pain around the sockets was still present . I have been prescribed eye drops. If the pain does not go way as of 1/28/2021 I will revisit my eye doctor.

                                                Was performing a COVID vaccine clinic at a skilled nursing facility.  The patient states that at approximately 5 minutes after admin of her second shot, she started feeling short of breath. The nurse ran over to monitor her and take her BP. I arrived as well to monitor. Her breathing appeared fast and labored but patient was alert and oriented. She had no localized reaction to the vaccine. The patient&#39;s lungs were auscultated and were clear. Her glucose was checked, it was &#34;low&#34; for the patient at 80.  She stated the center of her chest was radiating pain and her hands went numb. Her BP was 161/93 and HR 65 and OSAT was 94 but this was close to her normal range. Epinephrine was not administered - but instead diphenhydramine 25 mg. The patient reported feeling better at 12 minutes post immunization and her breathing improved. Her chest pain went away and numbness went away. The patient also ate a donut and drank a glass of water at this time and stated she felt much better. Her BP again at 15 minutes post immunization was 158/96 and HR was 61 and OSAT was 100. Monitored patient for 20 more minutes and no other issues were experienced. The patient is being paired with a nurse from the facility to monitor the rest of the day.   After discussing with the pharmacist who reviewed the consent forms, it was noted that the patient marked yes on the portion that asks the patient if they&#39;ve received a blood transfusion in the last year.

                                                I had a fast heart beat that started about an hour to half hour after my shot. My heart rate was at 120 BPM and I called 911. The highest my hear rate  went was 140 BPM. The paramedics but me on an EKG and my heart rate dropped to 116 BPM. I was not admitted to the hospital, and after the paramedics left I was able to go back to sleep.  I had heart palpitations for the next 8-10 days after the vaccine. I saw a cardiologist and they didn&#39;t find anything out of the ordinary, and then I saw an allergist and I&#39;m following up with him soon.

                                                My left arm was very sore , red and hurting pretty bad. I went to bed around 10:00pm thinking everything was ok and it was a normal reaction. Woke up around 1:30am arm hurting so I got up to get some more tylenol. I immediately felt sick to my stomach (both ways) and I passed out and broke my nose.  I was coherient at times and other times I could not seem to answer any questions. My husband got me to the ER and they took my blood pressure 4 or 5 times and the nurse said &#34;I can&#39;t get a blood pressure&#34;. Another nurse came in and said we will take this one ! My blood pressure had bottomed out and caused all sorts of things going on. I left ER after 4 1/2 hrs. with a BP of 107/57 but I am not sure how low it got! At one point my husband looked at monitor and my bottom number was 39 but it is all a blur to me. As of today I still feel week (heavy arms) and I am concerned about taking my second dose!

I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

                                                Neurological response/trigger  - severe leg pain and weakness in both legs. Extremely difficult to walk and not able to climb stairs.  Disrupted sleep (woke up in pain throughout the night). This lasted for a couple of weeks, the worst (debilitating) being 48 hours from initial onset.  I also had difficulty breathing and nausea about 15m after injection which lasted for about 24 hours, then subsided.   I contacted my neurologist, Dr., early next morning, and notified her of what happened and she advised that I increase the dosage of gabapentin until symptoms resolved. After 48 hours, I began to walk without experiencing so much pain and weakness, and it slowly subsided over the course of a couple of weeks. I still experience flares of pain in both of my legs periodically.

As a couple of days went I got more and more spots. Sent pictures to my Dr - Pityriasis Roseola - Went to see dermatologist - he diagnosed me with the same thing (January 19th). He gave me cream for it - it was all over my entire body by the time I saw him. It was like a red petechiae rash over my whole body. I usd the cream as instructed per doctor. The following week on that Monday, I was short of breath and not feeling right and I worked. But next day I only worked a couple of hours and went home. I started having vomiting and diarrhea - I went to the ER twice - 1st time they diagnosed - Viral infection - and they discharged me and didn&#39;t give me anything but told me to rest and they pushed fluids. The second time I went - they gave me medication and they said it might help with the pain in my  abdomen. They didn&#39;t do much. I had gone to ER - was there for four and half hours waiting to be seen but didn&#39;t get seen. Two days after second ER visit - I went back to the hospital  on January 26 and was admitted for heart failure and that is when cardiac symptoms occurred.

I had nausea, vomiting, fever of 103.2, had trouble breathing, felt like someone was sitting in the middle of my chest, left side of my body was numb, weakness, migraine headaches, and muscle aches in neck and shoulder.  I went to bed after I took Tylenol and nausea medicine. I woke up at 4 am the next morning and told my husband to get the girls (our daughters) up and that i needed to go to the hospital. When I got there they did a chest x-ray, blood work and gave me a breathing treatment. I was admitted to the hospital. While I was there they gave me IV fluids and medicine for headaches and nausea medicine. I was released about 2:30 in the afternoon on Feb 26th. I still have muscle aches  and head aches. I have noticed my memory is real short, I have trouble remembering things from yesterday.

Initial symptoms lingered over 14 days.  On 2/25 was prescribed 20mg prednisone for 5 days which resulted in slight improvement.  Then continued to slowly decline again with increased fatigue, chest pain,  more shortness of breath.  Saw pulmonologist on 3/10.  Referred to cardiologist and echo on 3/11 with concern for heart failure.  Echo on 3/11 showed acute right sided heart failure, new diagnosis.  Cardiologist and pulmonologist both state that I reacted with severe symptoms to first dose of vaccine but recovered.  2nd dose I just could not recover from and with my compromised lungs from post-acute covid syndrome, wound up with heart failure.

                                                Ten minutes after vaccine administration, I experienced a tingling sensation at the injection site (left deltoid), which rapidly spread into the surrounding tissues, up my arm, and into my chest. My heart started to pound forcefully. I became tachycardic 110?s-120?s (my usual pulse is 60?s) and hypertensive 170?s-180?s/80?s-90?s (my usual BP is 100?s-110?s/60?s-70?s). I never felt faint or anxious. Approximately 20  minutes after vaccine administration my pulse came down to 100?s. I remained hypertensive. At one hour post-vaccine, my BP was 178/98. I was then transferred to the ED. At 90 minutes post vaccine my BP was 180?s/80?s and pulse was high 90?s. The BP gradually came down. I was discharged home three hours post-vaccine with BP of 140?s/80?s and pulse in the 90?s. The next morning, my VS returned to normal: BP 106/62, pulse 67.

Felt like when I had mono. Had headache, back and neck aches, fever of 100.2. Felt like glands were swollen. After 4 hours, symptoms began to subside, but still mildly present. Fever subsided and was gone from 11AM on. Injection site pain still present with redness. Skin felt very sensitive on the arms Today, 12-31, felt good, no fever, slightly tired, but good enough to work. Came to work and when in the process of writing this RL, I was reviewing the side effects and looked at my injection site. It looked red so I asked a coworker, who thought it looked like hives. We had our medical director and PA look at it and although they didn&#39;t feel like it looked like hives, I developed hives on my chest, neck and chin while they were in here. Called employee health who recommended either PCP or urgent care. Went to urgent care. During visit, hives began to subside, had 99.6 fever at the beginning of the visit, 98.7 at the end of the visit. Rapid COVID test was negative. Received inhaler for asthma and returned to work at 1245 today.

                                                About 1.5 hours after dose administration, patient began to feel lightheaded and weak, unable to stand up.  He then noticed a rash on his forehead, chest, arms and back of neck.  He had no swelling of the lips, tongue or throat.  No shortness of breath or wheezing noted.  VS 157/110, 101, 20, 97.7.  Pulse ox 99% on room air.  No acute distress, but a little anxious.  No oropharyngeal erythema or swelling seen.  Lungs clear to auscultation.  Skin revealed red macular rash on the face.  Other areas had faded.  Benadryl 50mg po given with good effect.  Weak feeling subsided quickly and hives began to fade.  Repeat vitals over 30 minutes were largely unchanged.  He was allowed to go home with instructions to contact his PMD and to use Benadryl 50mg po Q4H PRN.  If he develops any signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis he should call 911.

                                                I received the shot and about one minute later I felt a little dizzy and light head.  They sat me down and about couple minutes later I felt my heart rate racing and felt flushed.  I reported how I felt the the staff and they put me in a recliner.  The rapid heart rate went away about a minute later.  I stayed at the vaccine clinic for total of 35 minutes after the shot.  They made sure I felt o.k. before I left.  I didn&#39;t have that feeling again.  I felt fine the rest of the day and today.  I have had that same feeling before not from vaccine.  I have never had reaction to vaccine or medications.   2 years ago I thought I was allergic to avocado or avocado oil because I had a couple of incidence of having that same dizzy fast heart rate feeling after avocado oil.  I went to an allergist and got tested and was negative for avocado and he also tested me for shell fish because I have had history of being itchy after eating shellfish.  I was negative for both.  I haven&#39;t had that same reaction for several years since that incident.  I have been able to eat avocado and shellfish without problem.  I don&#39;t really know if this is an allergic reaction or an immune response to the vaccine.  I am going to see my allergist on 1/6/21 see what he thinks.  I am wondering if I should get the second dose.

                                                Began with tingling down my right arm, and I became a little shaky.  Drank some water and the shakiness continued to get worse.  Went to the restroom and felt like I was going to pass out.  Tingling came back  across my upper body (chest level to shoulder level), I began to shake excessively, my mouth got very dry and my skin became splotchy.  I was breathing hard like I had just ran flights of stairs.  Nurses were called and I was given Benadryl and taken to the Emergency Room at a neighboring hospital where they hooked me up to I believe heart and BP monitors.  My blood pressure was very high and my heart was pounding so hard.  Was given steroid pills.  All day I urinated excessively and my heart pounded hard.

                                                I started to have mild symptoms (malaise, flush feeling and then numb, tingling, weak hands followed by joint pain) in the afternoon of 1/7. The symptoms progressively worsened into what my husband (an immunologist) called an intense hyperimmune response. I had severe COVID symptoms (intensified from my experience having the virus in Sept): fever 100-102, flushed face, intense muscular and some neurologic symptoms--joint arthralgia and myalgia, headache, shivers/rigors, extreme weakness (especially my hands) and later I could barely stand or walk, glandular pain with minor swelling (axillary and neck), nausea, and my hearing was temporarily diminished--nearly lost for a few minutes; tylenol 500 mg taken the night of 1/7. The intense symptoms have subsided. Currently I am tired, weak, achy, and afebrile (last ibuprofen 200 mg taken last night). My hands remain weak.

                                                About 12 hours after vaccine, I had high fever of 102, severe body aches, severe chills, minimal nausea, even with two extra strength tylenols.  I went to the restroom around 5 am and had lightheadedness and FAINTED.  My husband helped me up and helped me to bed.  I was still mildly lightheaded for about 30 minutes.  I took two extra strength tylenols and two Advils.  My fever broke about 30 minutes later.  I slept.  Then about 2 pm had fever and aches again, but took two Advils and fever broke.

She developed a rash over her trunk and extremities that was warm and pruritic. She was given 50mg po benadryl before I evaluated her. When I saw her she was not in extremis, respiratory distress or with audible stridor, but did appear uncomfortable. She denied any lip swelling, tongue swelling or throat closure, however did note that her heart was racing and she was having chest heaviness. The patient&#39;s lungs were clear and there was no audible wheezing or signs of cyanosis. Pulse ox was 100-110 HR, with O2 sat 97-100%.  Did not appear to be an anaphylactic reaction at this time.  She was brought to the ER for further observation

                                                symptoms started about 20 hours after vaccine- extreme muscle aches and joint pain to the point movement of any kind was unbearable. Extreme chills, headache, nausea - I took Advil and Tylenol every 4 hours and nothing eased the pain. After all day of suffering I started to vomit and have severe chest and stomach pain and went to local ER.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021 I woke around 4:00 a.m. cold and shivering, my neck and head hurt. I took my temperature orally (the only thermometer I had at home), it was 101.9.  I took Tylenol, it helped a little. I was lethargic throughout the day. My head and neck hurt all day and into Sunday, even with Tylenol. I did not sleep well Saturday to Sunday, started coughing, but only when laying down, (maybe allergy related?) so I sat up and slept in a chair. I woke up Sunday without a fever, no Tylenol, but still had achy neck and a slight headache. I did continue to take Tylenol because my neck and head still hurt.  But I was able to move around, a little, if I overdid it, I had to sit.

It feels like I drank a lot of caffeine, but I haven?t.

Extremely itchy eyes, palms of hands, soles of feet, progressed to shortness of breath, Bradycardic, oxygen saturation in 80s even after administration of IM epinephrin, hypotensive, swollen face, neck and tongue, severe vomiting. EMS transported me to hospital mentioned above. IV started in ambulance where IV epinephrin, IV fluids, IV Benadryl, IV solumedrol were all given prior to arrival at the ER. ER then administered more steroids and anti nausea meds and sent me home after observation and stabilization with prescription for epi pen and prednisone.

                                                After the injection , I had the usual sore arm for several days and was tired.  On day 3 (Jan 6), I felt very dizzy while teaching at school. I did not pass out, but I had to sit down. My blood pressure was elevated. This feeling continued on and off for several weeks after the vaccine. The main adverse event was the vaccine red arm. On day 8, (Jan. 12), my vaccine site got red and swollen again. It was 5 cm by 8 cm. It became hot and swollen and itchy. My primary care doctor did not know what caused it. My school nurse did not know. I was able to contact the father of one of my students who worked in the Medical Center who advised me that it was just an allergic reaction. Days 8-10 had the most symptoms. It slowly went away after that.  I treated it with topical hydrocortisone cream several times a day. It helped soothe the redness and itch. By Day 15, it was gone.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product was not provided.   On 07Jan2021 (previously reported as 16Jan2021), approximately one week prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 025L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  A week post vaccination, she had a thick painful cord down injection arm and was misdiagnosed with tendonitis. After a second opinion, she was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. On 01FEB2021, an ultrasound confirmed a blood clot and subsequently, she went to the ER. A computerized tomography (CT) of the lungs ruled out pulmonary embolism. Based on these events, the patient chose not to get the second shot.  Treatment included rivaroxaban and follow-up with hematologist.   The second dose of mRNA-1273 was discontinued in response to the event.   The outcome of the events deep vein thrombosis and chose not to get second shot were unknown.   Follow-up information received 08Feb2021 included additional event, date of first dose was updated from 16Jan2021 to 07Jan2021, diagnostic test and treatment.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 50 year-old, female who experienced deep vein thrombosis. Treatment included rivaroxaban and follow-up with hematologist.Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. The causality for the event of intentional dose omission is assessed to be not applicable.

                                                After receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine on 1/4/21 at 8:30 am, all was well and I returned to work.  As the day went on the only encounter I had was soreness at the injection site.  But, the next day, Tuesday 1/5/21 @ around 10:00 in the morning while showering a notice that I had lump that looked to be swollen under my left arm where the injection was administered.  I thought it was the medicine working its way through the body, and would resolve in a few days.  But on today, Thursday 1/7/21 it is still there.  So since I had to work today, I decided to go to Medical Center at my job for someone there to witness what was going on.  Person, from Medical Center gave me the number to the hotline and advised me to call immediately.  So I returned to my floor and placed the call.

I went to bed with no issues then within a short time I felt an instant burning in my stomach...before I could make it to the bathroom....I began vomiting uncontrollably...this lasted for 3 hours. I had 1 bout of bathroom issues but that was it. I thought I was going to go unconscious because I couldn&#39;t stop to catch a breath. Each time last about 7 minutes. As soon as I went back to bed....I got that feeling and had to rush back to the bathroom again. Today  (24 hours later) my left arm is extremely sore. (no swelling or redness------very tight and sore to the touch). I cannot lift my arm  more than 50%.

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving my injection on Thursday, I noticed my upper lip felt like it was swelling.  Over the next 30 minutes, I felt the same in my lower lip and cheeks.  I took 50 mg of Benadryl at that time.  I slept for nearly 20 hours after that.  On Friday, I experienced severe body aches from head to toe.  I felt somewhat better Saturday.  I woke up Sunday with nausea and dizziness that lasted all day and evening.  I woke up feeling better Monday morning but noticed 2 enlarged lymph nodes above my collar bone and pain from my R deltoid, across my shoulder and into my lower neck.  It is Tuesday and and the lymph nodes are painful to touch and I&#39;m experiencing 5/10 pain in my upper arm, shoulder R side and back of neck and above my R scapula.  I am considering calling my PCP.

I was answering the text messages and there was not anywhere to document what was going on because I felt fine.  I stopped getting the texts today so I couldn&#39;t talk with anyone about how swollen my lymph nodes under my arm is. I have not been able to get anyone on the phone to ask what to do.  It is a very strange coincidence that my nodes are swollen for the first time in my life and the only thing that is different is that I received the vaccination.

I got up and has a buzzing sensation all over my body. I walked over the the nurse station and told them I was having a reaction, nurse took my vitals my HR was 165 and my BP 170/120.  They took me upstairs to observations and eventually my BP came down a bit. Later that evening it was 160/105. I though I was having chest discomfort. I went to the Emergency Room. They did an EKG which was normal, so they sent me home.  It took my BP another 12 hours to be within a normal reading.  Within 24-36 hours things came back to normal I had recovered.

Kept up and got more pronounced throughout week and started feeling burning sensations in both arms through Feb 15th. Self referred to Neurology on Feb. 16th.  Feb 17th, began to feel worse, spreading to both legs feeling weak, burning sensation, fatigue, and began feeling VERY foggy brained.  Have been sleeping a lot, but legs and arms go from burning sensations, weakness, to cold sensations, and achy right leg thigh muscle, to this moment.  Brain fog and fatigue seem worst in morning.

On Sunday the 21st, I have a large lump under my right jaw bone  which I?m assuming is another swollen lymph node. The lymph node above my clavicle is tender To the touch and has not reduced in size.

She felt awful within an hour of vaccination and persisted with symptoms for 2.5 days.  She described it as being out of it, headache, fever, chills, profound body aches, weakness and dizziness with palpitations.  She could not get out of bed for a day.  She literally thought she was going to die given the severity of her weakness.  As quickly as the symptoms occurred, they left her on March 7th, 2021.  She went to work on March 8th and noted similar symptoms to prior ITP flares - petechiae on legs, gum bleeding, fatigue, mild headache.  She also noted dark urine but no frank blood.  Since being admitted and receiving steroids, she is feeling improved and petechiae are lessening.  She also noted mild mouth ulceration to lower lip along with oozing.

My chest felt heavy but I think that may have been slight anxiety because it was a scary feeling and I did not want to be the person who needed EMS assistance.  I rolled down my window, took off my mask and took deep breaths of fresh air.  I slowly started to feel better.  At 30 minutes I felt much better and after an hour I was back to my normal self.

Once in the observation area, cg became nauseous and raised her hand to report.  Cg was sitting in one of the back rows so observation RN came to her.  Observation RN was walking cg to lower level when she experienced syncope and fell forward down several steps and to the right hitting the front of her head and right shoulder on the wall.  Cg was unconscious for approximately 30-45 seconds.  Once alert, cg responded appropriately to questions, but slowly.  Vitals were 120/82 P 107 at 0915 and 150/84 P 96 at 0920.  Cg had 2 events of uncontrollable bilateral arm shaking lasting approximately 5-10 seconds.  Rapid Response Code was called and cg taken to ED at 0940.  C-collar and back board was used to transfer cg from floor to stretcher. Unknown at this time if caregiver was admitted.

                                                My first symptoms were expected-- sore arm and slightly tired feeling -- a few days later my shoulder itched where I got the shot. Then a week later, two things-- and one is PMS. Obviously not the shot but I mention this as it is possible that these side effects are related to the PMS. On Sunday 1/3/2021 I was experiencing breast tenderness PMS and that extended under my arms and by the end of that day my glands were swollen and hard in my right armpit. The next morning, they were still hard and swollen and the glands are still today. While I often have breast tenderness, I have never had swollen glands or painful underarms as part of this. Also yesterday 1/4 my right shoulder near where I received the vaccine was i was itchy and it continues to be and red and also hard there... I don&#39;t want to overplay any of these symptoms and they might well relate to PMS but I think in this instance particularly with the very painful swollen glands on the right underarm it&#39;s important to report them

Similar to vasovagal experience without nausea at that time.  Staff took me to nursing station, and I felt better within 10 minutes of laying down on ice pack, drinking water.  Stayed there for an hour and got  a ride home in case.  Blood pressure was very elevated afterwards for several hours.

On 1/1/21 the pain had gone and still had no redness or swelling at the site. Then on 1/7/21 around 1400 I noticed it was itching at the injection site and there was a 1cm area of redness and induration. By 2100 on 1/7/21 the redness and induration had grown to 5-6cm and area was warm. On 1/8/21 by 1500 the redness and induration had grown to 8cm and redness starting to go down the arm. At 1900 the area is still about 8cm and now left axillary lymphadenopathy has developed. I am a NP and am watching it, I will seek treatment tomorrow if no improvement or if it worsens.

                                                Throat tightness; not feeling well; Upper chest pressure; A spontaneous report was received from a pharmacist concerning a 52-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced throat tightness, upper chest pressure and was not feeling well.  The patient did not have any relevant medical history. The patient denied any previous history of adverse reactions to vaccines. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Dec 2020 at 09:40 am, approximately five minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 9:45 am, the patient experienced throat tightness and not feeling well. The patient was pale and hypertensive. She was carried on a stretcher and placed on oxygen. Rapid response team was called in and treatment with intravenous (iv) fluids including iv push of famotidine at a dose of 20 mg was initiated. Patient was transported to the Emergency Department (ED) for further evaluation. Additionally, the patient received iv treatment with methylprednisolone succinate at a dose 125 mg and diphenhydramine at a dose of 25 mg. Throat tightness and upper chest pressure were reported to be relieved. The patient was discharged with prescriptions for oral prednisone, famotidine, and diphenhydramine to be taken as needed for recurrent symptoms.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events of  throat tightness, upper chest pressure, and not feeling well was not reported.   The events, throat tightness, upper chest pressure, and not feeling well were considered resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 52-year-old, female subject who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 039K20A), experienced the unexpected events of not feeling well; upper chest pressure and not feeling well. The onset of events occurred 5 min after the first dose of vaccine administration. The reporter causality assessment for the events was not provided. Due to the temporal association between the events and the administration of vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, and the events are assessed as possibly related to vaccine.

                                                MADERNA COVID-19 Vaccine EUA ; Within 6 minutes, experienced warming feeling through chest followed by light headed and dizziness, followed by immediate sensation of nausea. Then lost awareness and surrounding noise sounded as if I were in a cave, echoes and non-discernable. Lost consciousness for several minutes.  Next recollection was regaining awareness, clothes soaked with sweat. Was lying on a bed with no recollection of being moved to the bed. Shakes and feeling of distress. Experienced shakes and a tingling sensation for approximately 15 minutes. Once that subsided I experienced chills for the better part of an hour. Would like to add, I have no phobias of injections and regularly have blood samples drawn for medical evolutions with my primary care physician.  Was counselled by administering physician to go home and skip work.

She was tachycardic and hypertensive but was severely anxious as she has a lot going on in life right now and has been anxious all day. EMT offered to drive her to the hospital but she refused and thinks it is due to anxiety. Employee was told if she still feels heart rate and blood pressure are high later today she should call primary care doctor or go to hospital. She left after about 45 mins of being evaluated feeling better but still anxious. Heart rate 119 and blood pressure 150/90.

                                                this is a report of my personal experience I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine Wednesday January 20th at approximately 4:30pm Cox North. The injection was painful, the person administering the injection inserted the needle VERY slowly, and then pressed the plunger VERY slowly. However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt &#34;funny&#34; mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised &#34;bed rest and hydration&#34;) I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up. I was unable to remain upright, but could sit in a recliner at that time. I was unable to hold a bottle of water on my own until approximately 2pm. I had no headache, no fever, no nausea (after the initial 5am experience) but DID experience extreme muscle weakness until approximately 2pm Thursday January 21, 2021. (too weak to chew food) Friday January 22nd, I felt &#34;fine&#34;, but still mild tiredness. ( I was told by our office manager that I should fill out an RL to report my experience)

                                                Moderna covid-19 vaccine eua. About 15 min after injection I felt hot (very unusual for me), then dizzy,  racing heart, weak then very nauseous.  I told the nurse.  He asked me to lay down.  I did not get worse.  After 20 min or so I sat up and did not feel worse.  Just stable nausea and dizzy.  I asked if I could leave.  After verifying I had people at home I was allowed to go.  I felt exhausted and nauseous for the rest of the day.  I was confused the next morning about what day it was and had some hives at injection site.  I felt normal after figuring out what day it was.  I walked 8 miles and aside from the hives at the injection site was normal.  One week later I had headache, exhaustion and had an uncomfortable rash at the site.  The rash is still on my arm.    Should I get the second dose?

Worst part was, I had like a tingling and burning sensation that radiated to my extremities legs and feet. Sweating in feet that came in waves. I felt like my skin was on fire, like I was too close to a heater. Waves of numbness and tingling that was constant that lasted for approximated 5 days. Bad taste in mouth like a metallic taste. Blood pressure was extremely high. Worse at night. I went to ER on 1/3/21, because I was still having waves of burning and discomfort that was raising my blood pressure. I thought after 72 hours I would be better and it did not so this is why I went to ER.  Day 5, I had lost of taste, runny nose, light nausea. By day 6, the cough turned into itchy throat discomfort. Day 7 low grade fever. Day 8, everything started to subside.

However, the side effect that is more concerning is that, about four days after the shot, I noticed that the area around the injection site, other than the bruise, was inflamed. The swelling and heat have gone down a bit, but there is still indication and a feeling on inflammation about the size of my palm around the injection site.  Also, I have still been suffering from some fatigue. I usually sleep well and wake up refreshed, but since the shot, I wake up still very tired, and I have been getting enough sleep.

Rash went away.  SOB lasted off and on for several days. Heart rate was off when I was working out for a couple of weeks.  I work out  so we wear heart rate monitors.  Heart rate did not recover as quickly as normal during my workouts. Took a couple of weeks for this to get back to normal for me.  Just really felt &#34;off&#34; for awhile and not like myself.  Did not feel comfortable getting second shot because of the above symptoms.

Some hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills, headache, started vomiting and my blood pressure started bottoming up that is when I was rushed to the ER. I was admitted and stayed 2 days. They said it was not related to the vaccine. First they told me it was sepsis. Then they told me it was pneumonia, not sepsis. Then said it was a bacterial infection. I sincerely do not know what I had. I am doing better now. My PCP did not recommend me to receive the second dose.

Took benadryl 25 mg with each episode.  At 6:15 am I passed completely out at sink, hitting my head hard on hardwood floor.  Went to ER for scans.  All scans were clear of brain and chest, awaiting heart results, with further testing for allergens coming up.

My arm was not even hardly sore in the two days that I did not feel bad; I could feel the injection but it was not painful like previous vaccines that I had received.  Before the vaccine I called my ex housemate who is a trauma nurse practitioner and she advised me to take tylenol and not aspirin after I get the vaccine; I did not administer 1000mg tylenol and benadryl (50mg) to myself until bedtime that even after my symptoms began)

                                                Resident had the COVID vaccine 12/30/2020. 12/31/20,  resident has been in bed all shift. Staff became concerned when resident was not easily aroused. Resident displayed signs of tremors, twitching, confusion, in and out of consciousness, low O2 sats, elevated pulse and fever, fatigue and weakness. Writer called NP. NP stated this is most likely a reaction d/t the COVID vaccine. She gave orders for Benadryl 25mg IM x1 now and Tylenol 1000 mg now. NP also stated resident will not be getting the second dose of vaccine. Will continue to monitor and update NP if worsening symptoms.   After receiving Benadryl and Tylenol at 145pm, resident began to appear as though she was feeling better and was talking to talk, fever had gone down. Tonight resident is not easily aroused, lethargic, continues to have tremors and twitches, almost appearing as convulsions. When asked if she knows where she is or what day it is, resident can properly answer. Resident denies SOB but staff has noted loud squeals while breathing. NP was updated and gave new orders to give Benadryl 25 mg IM x1 if needed and Ok to send resident to ED. Resident currently refuses to go to the hospital. Will continue to monitor. BP 152/112, P 116, T 99.1, O2 87-91. Resident&#39;s O2 at 1205am was 80% on 3LPM. Resident unable to be aroused from sleep by writer. NAR called to assist. NAR could not arouse resident. Writer and NAR attempted to reposition resident and resident&#39;s breathing became more labored. Resident turned back to previous position and writer called on call MD at approx. 1220am. MD returned call approx. 1235am with orders to send resident to ED. 911 called and ambulance arrived about 1245am. History of present condition given to EMTs and they stated resident would be going to Hospital. Writer has attempted to contact Hospital ED x3 but have been unable to get through. An EMT did just call to clarify when vaccine was given, what symptoms have been present and when they started. She said she has everything she should need and she will let Hospital ED staff know to call if they need anything else. Writer will again attempt to contact them though.  Resident&#39;s temp was 97.5 and BG 128. When EMTs arrived they got an O2 reading of 60%. Resident did open her eyes a couple times during transfer from bed to stretcher and while stretcher was going outside but no responses from resident were made.

All mild and expected as possible side effects.  No concerns.  Symptoms continued and by 1/5; all symptoms had move to severe level and are still occurring today 1/8.  Temperature spikes to 102.8; chills, severe headache especially in eye sockets, body aches, and heaviness in chest.  Could not work on 1/7 and only for a bit on 1/8 (working from home).  Became concerned and was flu and covid tested on 1/7;  both negative.  I was retested for Covid on 1/8 and still negative.  I am not sure if maybe I am sick with something else and this is coincidence or if I am just experiencing issues from the vaccine that are a little different from others?

I went to occupational health at work. They game me hydrocortisone cream 1%.  1/9/2021 I woke up to swollen red arm, warm to the touch. Reddened area grew outside of pen marked area. Began having tachycardia and an increase in blood pressure and headache. I made an appointment with online doctor who said to monitor BP and if higher seek medical attention. Got off phone and felt dizzy. Took my blood pressure again and it was much higher so I went to the ER. ER determined it was reaction to vaccine

Usual &amp; expected solicited SEs: fatigue, soreness, feeling &#34;off,&#34; transient headache, chills sx Day 2- strong R arm pain, cannot lift R arm.  Metallic taste in mouth and tingling tongue persists.  Also same usual Sx as day 1 plus mild nausea.   Felt really crummy.   Day 3- Still moderately strong R arm pain, can only partially lift arm over head, cannot straighten over head.   Strong fatigue continues, mild nausea.   By this day I recall having some unusual Noc . calf cramping.   Sx certainly improved after 72 hrs but some did continue up to 7 days.   Cramping returned as did odd R ear/jaw/throat nerve pain.  Scratchy throat.  Fatigue persisted, gradually improved.  I believe the non-standard SEs may represent an allergic reaction.  I deem this mild to moderate, as I was unable to perform daily functions at times.  I would like to be able to talk to a professional as to whether a second dose is recommended in my situation.  I am concerned to know if previous allergic reactions suggest increase likelihood of future and possibly worsened reactions.  Note: I have been unable to access my Vsafe reports today to confirm exact time frame.  The above is to best of my recollection.

                                                Ten days after the vaccine injection my arm started hurting and swelled to the size of a baseball at the injection site. The lump was hot to the touch and had a large red circle about 3&#34; in diameter. I had tightness in my chest and a headache.  I had took two Benadryls every eight hours for three days, since it seemed to be an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  At this date/time I don&#39;t have any further signs of an allergic reaction.

Symptoms did not resolve after a few hours.  ~ 3 hours later, took Benadryl and bronchodiolator and symptoms improved.  Also since injection have had mild GI distress gradually improving.   Reporting now because I learned reaction could be worse to second injection, and 30 minute observation period would likely be prudent.

                                                I was sitting quietly looking waiting for the observation time to finish and started feeling that my heart was racing, felt like it was over 130 but hard to count.  Had some water, moved closer to the staff that were administering doses and told them I felt weird and my heart rate was fast but feeling ok.  Would let them know if it got any worse.   I started to think I was having either a reaction or worrying about the side effects, etc. and willed myself to calm down.  It felt like an adrenaline rush and did not last longer than a few minutes.  I didn&#39;t report it  to VAERS at the time thinking it was &#34;just in my head&#34;.   Thankfully it went away and I did not need any treatment.  Just felt a little shaky and glad that it went away. Only other side effect that I had was a sore arm for a couple days.  Looking at the CDC website since then, I am not sure if I should get the second dose and would like advice on this.

I looked down at my arm and seen a red welt from my elbow to my wrist in my left arm and a fine red rash beneath skin on right arm.  I looked up at the pharmacist and he said at 12:40 he had already placed a call to have another pharmacist come to look me over.   I then noticed that my heart seemed to be racing and feeling winded.  I figured this was my anxiety and just tried to relax.  The second pharmacist arrived and we walked to the ER.  I was very winded. They took me to a room and checked stats.  after 3 attempts taking my BP and using two different cuffs, she said my BP was 190/90 where it is typically 120/70. I drank lots of water and they monitored me for almost an hour and gave me another Benadryl.  My BP came down to 180/82 , breathing was easier and itching was decreasing so I chose to return to my station and I took one more Benadryl.  The following day: woke up with head ache in rt eye and fuzzy vision all day, mild sore throat, mild body aches, queasy stomach, fatigue and runny nose.  Took a Pepcid for stomach, Tylenol/Advil duo for sore throat, headache/body aches, drank lots of water and rested.  Following day most symptoms resided, still  slight sore throat, rt eye blurred vision, coughing, sneezing and runny nose.  everyday since, symptoms continue to decrease.

Had our dr check it out. My dr wanted to see me .Found  It was lymph node that was activated. No treatment. Very sore; whole region around the lymph node really sore and tender to the touch  Had a hard time lifting arm up because it would slide under my clavicle and it really hurt. . Now it is down to the size of a pea. can still feel it  but the pain has subsided. My doctor has seen 12 people so far who has had that reaction.

                                                The patient received the vaccine at approximately 1:30. They were observed for the standard 15 minute wait time at which time they complained of some mild numbness to their arm. The patient felt well enough to return to work after the 15 minute observation time. They returned approximately 20 to 30 minutes later complaining of more numbness and some dizziness. She (the patient) was told to continue to monitor symptoms and alert anyone of worsening side effects or symptoms. The patient returned to the room again and was now complaining of nausea. She was offered Benadryl but patient refused stating &#34; I cant have Benadryl&#34; after multiple times of the pharmacist(s)  offering Benadryl. Patient stated they sometimes take Claritin so they were instructed to take it and lie down in an area where staff could monitor her. At about 3:30 another staff member came into the vaccination room and alerted the pharmacist they were having a hard time keeping to patient awake.  Upon arrival at the patient&#39;s side they were coughing and seemed to be in a state of drowsiness. They were linked to a vitals monitor by the staff. BP: 170/110 O2: 96-100% HR between 80 and 90.  Approximately 2 minutes after arrival at patient&#39;s side 911 was called. Pharmacist retrieved the Epi-Pen and was on standby if administration was needed.  The patient was moved to a chair and vomited multiple times over the course of a few minutes. The Patient was able to vocalize and stated they felt &#34;aweful&#34; and has some difficulty swallowing, and when asked if they were short of breath they stated &#34;a little.&#34; Over the next 5 minutes (approx.) the patient&#39;s BP went down to 152/90&#39;S and O2 saturation was holding at 97-100%. Epinephrine was not administered during this time as patient was breathing and did not appear to have hives. Emergency medical services arrived about 5 minutes but within 10 minutes after the call was placed. EMS then took over care  for the patient. EMS was told of condition and that epinephrine was not administered at this time. After patient assessment by EMS they also declined to use epinephrine. At around 3:40 the patient was transferred to a transport bed and was taken away by ambulance.

All these symptoms lasted for the whole night but did not get any worse though.

                                                Vaccine given at work left arm on Friday 1:45 pm and felt like tight Blood Pressure cuff  on my arm within 30 mins. This was constant pressure that lasted until I slept that night.  went home after work, ate dinner, then sleep with my CPAP. Slept late, woke up 1:40pm with entire left arm numb, but still able to move it. (sleeping on right side) and numb tongue that felt swollen. Stroke?  I got up and as time progressed over next 30 mins or so, I started coughing more, felt like sore throat, itchy, having trouble clearing my throat, some trouble breathing, tongue didn&#39;t look swollen, but it felt like scotch tape underneath my tongue with someone slowly pulling tape off. with top of tongue swollen and heavy.  2:25pm I took 25 mg Benadryl oral tablet and called 24/7 RN hotline and was told to go to ER and take another 25 mg Benadryl tablet which I did. I arrived at ER and was really coughing hacking repeatedly. Short of breath, kept trying to clear my throat. Seen in triage. No meds given, this was? &lt;20 from time I took Benadryl.  About an hour later I did have about 15 mins of feeling like I was wearing a very snug neck turtleneck with 2 brief cool sensations going down the middle of my throat and down both sides of my upper chest.   I felt better when I kept my neck very straight versus looking down.  I was later seen again and felt 75% better, given Dexamethasone and Pepcid.  Discharged home. around 6:30pm.  Took Benadryl 50 mg again 10 pm same night.

The following day around 3 pm I began to have chills and felt like I had the raid heart rate again.  By 5 pm I was beginning to feel really bad, I was freezing, chills and my heart rate was now extremely fast, I was having trouble speaking complete sentences, my husband drove me to the emergency department.  I had a very high heart rate and high fever, I was admitted and in the hospital until Sunday afternoon. The diagnosis was pneumonia,  I don&#39;t really believe this, as I felt fine and had  no symptoms prior to the onset of the fever.

Tried to take Tylenol - it didn&#39;t take it away -  maybe slowed it down but then it came back. Thursday morning - I woke up really sick - joints hurt, hot and feverish and I called ambulance. My temp was over 100 degrees. They took me to ER. They took my temp there and it was 101.6. The Dr. requested morphine and I was given that for the pain. They observed me for awhile and sent me home with Tylenol with Codeine (300 mg). The morphine helped and I came home and I went to sleep and the next day my pain was not as bad as it was the day before. I was able to start moving around even though I was still achy. By third day I was feeling better. By fourth day, I was doing a lot better and the pain had gone back down. Felt shortness of breath when I first got symptoms and was using my inhaler. My shortness of breath lasted a little longer - for about a week. Had a Telehealth visit with doctor to refill meds if I needed it.

About an hour later while watching TV, a hot flash/flush came over my head and upper torso. I noticed bright red checks and nose which resolved within a couple hours (without any intervention). Temp was elevated per touch, and clammy. Blood pressure was elevated for several days 160-180s/86-100. A small scar on my finger from cyst removal 7 wks prior became inflamed and red w/ burning/tingling for 3 days.   Anticipated SE did included head ache, sore arm, fatigue and sleepiness for 2.5 days. (previous vaccines only resulted in sore arm--all other SE above (esp becoming possessed with fury), were new experiences.

                                                Approximately 3 hours after shot I became nauseous, intestinal cramps with diarrhea.  Approximately 1 day later began having breathing issues.  Not like an asthma attack.  Just could not catch my breath, coughing trying to get air. I could not speak on the phone or in person without coughing to get air in my lungs.  I started using an inhaler but it was not helping.  I began using a Nebulizer; this helped slightly at first.  On Feb 20th (I got a new box of meds for the nebulizer) since then I have gotten another box of nebulizer meds on March 3rd.  I have used half of this box now.  Also, on March 3rd, my doctor called in for a new inhaler, which started with 200 sprays and as of today I have 15 left.  This has been going on for over a month!  I have been using the nebulizer every morning and at night but still would wake up 4-5 times during the night to use my inhaler.  I have difficulty feeding my horse without almost collapsing from lack of air.

                                                Within 30 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I experienced mild chest tightness and a mild cough. Later that day I experienced fatigue, headache, and chills. The next day I felt like I had the flu but went to work anyway.  I became lightheaded and nauseous at work and was sent home.  I spent all day in bed with a fever of 100 degrees, chills, and fatigue.  The fever persisted until about 10 pm, at which time I began to feel better. My arm is also extremely red and sore at the injection site.

                                                On day 11 post vaccine administration, I started to experience an irregular heart rhythm.  I went to the ED at my place of employment and was found to be in atrial flutter.  Just prior to them administering a medication (metropolol), I spontaneously converted back to sinus rhythm.  I was sent home and told to follow up with my PCP or go to the ED should it return.   The following evening around 515 pm, I went into the same type of rhythm so went to the ED for evaluation.  I was again found to be in atrial flutter after a repeat EKG was done.  About two hours after arriving, I was cardioverted and my rhythm returned to sinus rhythm. I was discharged home and continue to be in sinus rhythm and am now on blood thinners.

                                                Patient vaccinated on 1/22.  The next morning (1/23), patient experienced diminished sensory and motor function in left arm and leg, as well as facial numbness.  Presented to the hospital on 1/24, and was found to have a small stroke in pontine medullary junction.  Discharged on 1/25.  There is some suspicion that her COVID infection in December may have precipitated this, and patient is currently being evaluated for coagulation disorders, primarily antiphospholipid antibody testing.  It is unlikely that the vaccine contributed to this, but given close timeline between the two, filing this report.

                                                First three days was just muscle soreness and fatigue.  On day 4 I started having tight chest and SOB while snowshoeing, which I did not have the day before on same activity.  That night I woke up with SOB and tightness in my chest and severe pain in area of my heart.  I could not lay on my left side.  It seemed like I was having heart attack symptoms.  Barley slept but upon waking my heart rate was 94 and the pain remained in LT Axilla area.  Took it easy for day and that night again had trouble sleeping, SOB but not as bad.  Woke up with excrutiating pain radiating up the base of my RT skull.  Was concerned about blood clot potential??  Had SOB when walking up stairs.  My throat hurt when bending over, as if my esophagus was crushing.  Friends said my face looked puffy and I felt bloated.  Landed up reporting to ER at the Hospital on Monday, Feb. 1st as directed by my PCP.  Hospital was told I had just had 2nd dose of vaccine, but did not think it was related.  I will mention all tests below, but upon arriving home on Feb. 2nd, I discovered a rash breaking out on underside of my LT upper arm, LT inner thigh and LT lower leg.

On day 2 my lips began to swell and were itchy, by day 3 they were very swollen, took benadryl every 8 hrs and by day 5 today they are fairly normal but still sore. My arm also swelled and spread to arm pit and was very hot and red. The redness has mostly gone, the swelling has lessened but not gone. Still sore and itchy. Still pretty run down and no energy. My cousin and I live together and were vaccinated at the same time and both had these symptoms except the lips swelling.

The nurse could see me turning red and feel the heat on my body. My BP and HR were also high. After those symptoms started leaving I became extremely cold. My hands stayed so cold they could not get a reading on my oxygen level. I did not feel short of breath at any time. I had a total of 4 episodes like this with each one being smaller and leaving sooner. They gave me juice and a graniola bar, kept checking my temp and blood pressure. After an hour to hour and half I was released to my son and husband. I took a benedryl whenI left.

Slightly warm and SUPER itchy. Day 9: Injection site still red, although slightly less so, slightly warm , and barely itchy.

                                                On 1/8/21, the day after the vaccination I developed a headache, nausea, fatigue, chills and cognitive impairment.  I quickly started vomiting  which was intense and persistent.  I had no food in my system so vomiting was mostly dry heaves, bile and what ever water I could drink.   Shortly after the vomiting began, I believe I passed out, fell and hit my head on the floor.   I don&#39;t remember falling but my husband said he heard the fall and I developed a large lump/bruise on my forehead.  The persistent vomiting lasted about 4-5 hours and other symptoms gradually improved.  1/11/21 I still have a milder headache, slight nausea and some fatigue.

My speech was Ok, my BP was monitored and was  a little elevated, nurse thought I was a little anxious because of my symptoms, BP was checked again about 10 minutes later and it was normal, they listened to my lungs to-all seemed to be well, except for these changing sensations going up my face, and lip. I stayed for about 20 minutes more, and returned to my office. Throughout the day changing sensations/lip area-that evening, my family said my lower lip was  drooping slightly downward-it seemed a bit swollen as well.  I checked in with the Covid Vaccine Clinic Wed. 01/13/20 in the AM as asked, and let them know i was still having symptoms in my lips, and felt slightly swollen on the one side.   It is 1/13/2020 @ 8:45PM and my bottom lip still feels strange(fluttery/tinglingly-not quite numb in sensation/  my cheeks/chin have intermittent differences in sensation

                                                Patient is a 55-year-old female who had presented to the vaccination clinic this afternoon to receive her COVID-19 vaccine.  She does have a history of migraine headaches and other comorbidities as described below.  Has had reactions to a number of medications, mostly narcotics as noted in her allergy list some of which could in theory be compatible with urticaria.  Does not have true anaphylaxis in her history. Today at about 15 minutes after administration of her COVID-19 vaccine she began to rather precipitously developed an itchy crawling feeling in her skin, nausea with retching and some shortness of breath.  She did not have the sensation of her throat closing off.  Did not have coryza.  Within about 10 minutes she did develop difficulty with speech that she says is typical for her migraine headache.  She received, in the vaccination Clinic, epinephrine 0.3 mg subQ, 125 mg of Solu-Medrol and 50 mg of Benadryl all IV.  An IV was started and a 500 mL bolus of saline was initiated.  With this she was then transferred to the emergency room for further evaluation.   In the emergency room she did develop chest heaviness but no palpitations.  She was not dyspneic.  Her nausea and vomiting by then had seem to resolve.

My general resting heart rate is between 60-65 bpm and over past two days my heart rate has spiked for several minutes at a time to 80-90 bpm even when sitting or asleep.

The patient reports undergoing her 1st COVID-19 vaccination recently and did not experience any reaction with this whatsoever. However, she received her 2nd vaccination yesterday and initially felt well, but awoke this morning with the feeling of &#34;an elevated pulse&#34;, along with fatigue, nausea, nagging diffuse headache, left flank/low back pain, and soreness surrounding the vaccination site. No redness or significant swelling around the site. Also notes a brief episode of RLQ abdominal pain described as &#34;cramping&#34; earlier this morning that has since resolved. She has tried taking 500 mg Tylenol at 0800 without relief in her symptoms. No fevers, chills, dysuria, hematuria, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Patient reports being recently diagnosed with thyroid disease and began taking medications for this about two weeks ago. She denies any past medical history otherwise.

I continue to take prednisone 20 mg daily per doctor.  On Monday, telemedicine visit with the pulmonologist, he increase to 60 mg, Ribcage tightness relieved about 1 hour and 45 minutes, back to tightness again.

Severe Chills, Shakes and could not get warm, but no fever until midnight, 100 degrees), when I took 2 NyQuil and went to bed. 6am next morning, no fever but still felt achy and weak. Took naproxen at 2:15. Still achy and temp was up to 100.6 at 4pm and took 600 mg ibuprofen. Temp up to 100.8 at 5:20 and took 1000mg of acetominophen at 5:20. Took Nyquil and went to bed around 10pm. Second morning temp was 99.4 and never went up after that. Tired and achy most of the day but a switch flipped around 4pm and I felt back to normal. Today was day 3 after injection and feeling 100%. Vaccine side affects were worse than when I had COVID in July but will do it again in a month.

                                                On 1/2/2021, about 45-60 mins after receiving the vaccine, I had mild right sided throat swelling.  It didn&#39;t seem to progress so I wasn&#39;t concerned.  I also developed the typical immune response (headache and sore arm) later in the evening on 1/2/2021.  On 1/3/2021, I woke up with a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and mild shortness of breath.  These symptoms continued on 1/4/2021, however, the symptoms were improved when I woke up on 1/5/2021.  On 1/7/2021, I received an allergy infection.  Within 24 hours I re-developed a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath (all vitals were stable).  Since I had no improvement in symptoms, I consulted with a physician and was placed on antibiotics and advised to continue with albuterol inhaler.  I&#39;m now slowly improving with my symptoms.  I reviewed this information with my allergist and they have advised me to not get the second Moderna vaccine, in case if what I experienced was some form of a mild-moderate allergic reaction.  I personally feel it is also quite possible that I could have had onset of an upper respiratory infection just after receiving the Moderna vaccine, and this may possibly not have been an allergic reaction.  Since this was not the normal course, I felt it should be reported regardless.

                                                Got the vaccine at 3pm on Friday, I could not sleep all night, I woke at 2am with chills and uncontrollable shaking.  I took my temperature in the morning and it was over 101.  I took tylenol but my fever never went below 99.9 all day.  No energy, stayed in bed all day.  Elevated heart rate, chills, breathing did not feel normal.  Body aches, headache, nausea, severe pain at injection site, today 5 days later, I still have underarm pain.   I had Covid in October and was told it was ok to get the vaccine as long as it had been 90 days since I was sick.  I felt like I had Covid again after having the vaccine.

                                                The patient received her first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on 12/29/2020.  However the patient was diagnosed with a positive COVID-19 test on January 4, 2021.  Patient complained of nausea, vomiting, back pain, and sharp chest pain.     On January 13, the patient presented to the emergency department again with shortness of breath and sharp, stabbing left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and right side. Initial work up ruled out cardiac etiologies. CTA chest demonstrated COVID-19 pneumonia.    The patient complained of bilateral lower extremity weakness which had been progressing since her COVID-19 vaccination, per patient report.  However, during her hospitalization the patient&#39;s bilateral lower extremity weakness began to accelerate.  On the 13th, the patient was able to ambulate to and from the bathroom herself.  Then on January 14 the patient required maximum assistance. Neurology was consulted and work up initiated for suspected possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) secondary to recent COVID-19 infection.    On January 15, 2021, the patient became obtunded and unable to protect airway.  She was emergently intubated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to GBS. Neurology started GBS treatment with IVIG. Patient also developed NSTEMI and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient remains critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation.

The rescue inhaler helped reduce the effects but did not fully eliminate them. The Symbicort Inhaler also helped with breathing but not chest tightness. Although not severe, effects continued to linger 10 hours after injection.

I got up and took one of my blood pressure medications. It&#39;s slowed down but I was unable to sleep due to feeling jittery and my heart pounding hard. The next day I felt exhausted my stomach hurt. I have had a sore throat the worst being on the Thursday following. Today Friday things seem to be subsiding.  However my concern is not to get the second dose if I had such a bad reaction the first time I definitely will have a heart attack the second time.

She was feeling tired, slightly nauseous and very low energy. At about 4:50 PM that day, patient got up to walk to the pantry after eating some peanut butter toast. She suddenly stopped and shut her eyes and froze and then she began having a seizure (and she has never had a seizure before and seizures do not run in her family). After the shaking from the seizure ceased, her body tensed up and she fell flat backwards and she hit her head on the refrigerator. She then was going in and out of consciousness, she had a big laceration on her forehead and was bleeding rapidly. I, her daughter, witnessed this and then at 4:54 PM I called emergency services and paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Later that evening, the family was notified that the patient had bleeding in her brain, a concussion, a forehead laceration that received 15 stitches and a broken neck (C2 fracture). She was taken to the hospital that evening on February 8, 2021. Patuent experienced a second seizure while at the hospital during a CT scan. Patient later was able to come home February 11, 2021 in the afternoon. Patient now has to wear a neck brace for up to 12 weeks, cannot drive, cannot work for up to 12 weeks, and is still recovering cognitively from the concussion.

                                                About one minute after receiving the injection, ( approximately 9 AM) I felt my heart rate increase to about 100 bpm, and I just did not feel right.  I told the nurses I didn&#39;t feel right, and I sat down for about 10 minutes and drank 3 glasses of water.  Initially I felt better, but then I felt weak and &#34;not right&#34;,  so I lay down on a cot for approximately 40 minutes.  My B/P was elevated (165/95), which is very high for me.  I did not have any trouble breathing.  I continued to drink water, and eventually my B/P lowered, and I felt better.  I took an antihistamine (10 mg Zyrtec) when I arrived home at 11:00 AM, and felt very tired until about 3:30 PM,  when I felt just about back to normal.  I was assessed by an ER physician at the clinic site.

                                                8 DAYS AFTER COVID 19 INJECTION I DEVELOPED A LARGE RED WARM TO THE TOUCH LUMP ON MY ARM WHERE THE INJECTION WAS GIVEN. MY ARM HURTS AND THE PAIN GOES DOWN MY ARM. I HAVE BEEN SHORT OF BREATH A BIT AND A LOT MORE WHEN I RUN OR GO UP STAIRS. I HAVE HAD &#34;CHARLIE HORSE&#34; LEG PAIN  X 4 IN LESS THEN A WEEK. I FEEL A BIT NAUSEA AND DIZZY. THIS IS NOT AT ALL NORMAL FOR ME

                                                First shot of Moderna vaccine.  Had the shot and waited around 35 minutes and I felt fine.  I left and was a few minutes down the street and my lips started going numb. I turned around and went back to the hospital where the shot was administered and they had me see the emergency room doctor.  My throat did not start closing, my lips just were numb.  I have had serious reactions before and they start with the lips usually so I was concerned.  My blood pressure was high as well as my pulse.  The doctor gave me prednisone and benadryl and I was feeling good after 15 minutes.  I was in the ER 45 minutes to an hour and then was released with a script to take prednisone and benadryl for the next 4 days.and to come back if I got worse.  I never got a rash or anything else, just the numb lips and increase in blood pressure.  I did have a bit of a headache as well.  I am at work now (the next day) and feeling fine.  I did speak to my doctor and she did advise me not to get the second shot in the vaccine series. .

                                                I had underlying body inflammation prior to getting vaccine, but otherwise no illnesses or issues.  Two days after vaccine I came down with a UTI.  Another 3 days after that my body went into an acute inflammatory response.  I had extremely pronounced pinkeye (first time ever) followed by acute gout flare-up (first time ever) followed by extreme edema in lower extremities (first time ever).  I&#39;m being treated with steroids, but these issues have yet to resolve.  I have not been able to work since Jan 4.  I can only stand for a few minutes and walk a short distance with the aid of crutches.  In all of my life, I have never had pinkeye or gout or edema, or a UTI for that matter.  I am a healthcare worker and I&#39;m needed back at my job asap.

                                                15 minutes after initial injection, dizziness and dry mouth began.  Lasted approximately one hour.  3 hours after injection, broke out with rash and began itching, throat became tight.  I called my PCP who suggested a solumedrol injection along with Benadryl.  I choose to take 20 mg Zyrtec and call 911 if respiratory effect declined.  Had extreme lethargy all day.  Presently, short of breath, aches and such similar to side effects mentioned.

I asked my supervisor if I could leave work bit earlier because I did not feel well.  I went to the break room, sat down when I started feeling lightheaded and passed out in a chair. I had a syncope.  Under my right and left arm, my lymph nsodes felt inflamed  and the ER doctor said they were not inflamed but upon palpation were tender.  I was put on oxygen, my BP was extremely low.  My BP resumed to come back up within a few minutes.   At this time Iam still having trouble with my lungs, Iam on an albuterol inhaler as needed.  I had a folllowup with my PCP on 01-13-21, she extended treatment for Azithromax and  continue with Albuterol inhaler.

                                                Patient felt unwell and had a fever on Wednesday (1/27) and went home early from work. On Thursday morning (1/28), she threw up once and then laid down to rest. Her son reported seeing her that morning with the episode of emesis prior to her getting on the couch. Son reports that when he came home at 5pm, she was asleep on the couch. Teenage daughter reports patient had been asleep on couch all day. Son tried to wake patient up and she was disoriented and lethargic.  Daughter (reporter) was contacted to come see patient and on arrival to house (5;45pm), noted patient was confused, lethargic, febrile (104), and hypoxic at 83% on room air with portable pulse oximeter. Patient was able to stand and ambulate to car with assistance and was driven to Emergency Department for evaluation.   At emergency department, patient was hypotensive 80/40s but was able to increase blood pressure with 3 L of normal saline to blood pressure of 90/50s. See all tests performed and results below.  Patient received antibiotics, anti-virals and tylenol for fever of 102.7 while in emergency department. She was admitted to ICU that evening at approximately 11pm and had a foley catheter placed overnight due to decreased urine output. patient continued to have low blood pressure through morning of 1/28 and was placed on levophed for blood pressure control at approx 10 am. Her blood pressures continued to improve through afternoon and levophed was titrated down and then discontinued around 4pm.  She continued to received antibiotics for 24 hours after initiation and continued acyclovir during course of hospitalization and is still receiving doses on 2/2. Patient&#39;s initial mental status was confused, lethargic, and unable to communicate. She was intermittently oriented to herself only and would not follow commands. She would localize painful stimuli. Her mental status began to improve on Saturday when she started to become more awake but was still unable to follow commands or communicate clearly. She was moved from ICU to IMCU (step down unit) on Saturday once mental status was improving and blood pressure was stabilized. Her mental status continued to improve from Saturday 1/ 30 to Tuesday 2/2 (current). She began to have diarrhea on Saturday afternoon that continued through Monday and occurred every 1-2 hours. She was unable to stand or move body on her own and had to be assisted by staff to be cleaned. She remained awake and alert and was able to get up and walk on Monday and began to eat. She continued acyclovir treatment pending HSV meningitis panel PCR results (still pending currently 2/2). Mental status not currently at baseline but continuing to improve. She is also still experiencing generalized weakness. Hospitalist team and infectious disease doctors report she should be discharged tomorrow (2/3).  No source for confusion and hypotension has been found at this time. Physician team think HSV is unlikely but awaiting final diagnosis until test is resulted.

I have COPD and use home oxygen as well as portable on the rare occasion that I leave the house since COVID 19.  I&#39;ve also had a thoracotomy and thoracentesis in 2019. But my oxygen never drops that low. We turned up my oxygen, I used my rescue inhaler, and we started a breathing treatment. None of it was helping and I felt like I was suffocating. My husband called emergency services. The EMTs got me on oxygen with a face mask and gave me IV Magnesium in the ambulance. I was breathing better by the time we got to the ER. They gave me additional medications and oxygen there. They took a chest X-ray too, but said it looked clear.

                                                A few hours after vaccination, I began to feel like I was getting ill, with fatigue and headache. I also experienced swelling at site of injection, along with hives on my face and neck on the same side as the injection. I had swelling in my neck, throat, tongue, lips, ears and eyes with some tingling. There was a red pallor on both of my cheeks. I also had slightly labored breathing. I took antihistamines and tylenol which helped reduce the symptoms within an hour. If I did not continue to take these round the clock for the next 4 days, the symptoms would get worse. Toward the end of the day, symptoms worsened regardless of antihistamine or tylenol and continue to do so as of yesterday, 1/3/2021. Symptoms have gotten better over the last 4 days. Its hard to say if I am fully recovered as in the evenings when I&#39;m more fatigued, I still have the tingling and mild swelling although the redness and hives have abated.

                                                Felt slight warmth throughout body about 5 minutes after vaccine. Disappeared 2 minutes later. Arm started to feel sore as the day went on and was very sore by nighttime. Next day, arm started to feel better and over the next 3 days was no longer sore.  On the morning of the 30th, woke up feeling fine, took a 3.5 mile walk and felt fine. Around 12:30 pm, experienced sudden pain and a burning sensation in the chest and both upper arms. Thought it was possibly heartburn ; took a Prilosec. The discomfort (mild but steady) continued so checked blood pressure which was 141/91. Called cardiologist and went to emergency room per instruction, around 1:30. Admitted overnight with the diagnosis of a mild heart attack and performed a heart catheterization where they found no major blockage. One artery noted 30% blocked but that overall heart function looked good. Discharged on 12/31/2020. -reported by patient via email, on 1/3/2021 @ 4:49pm

                                                2-3 minutes after the vaccination I developed a very fast heart rate, had a strange taste in my mouth, and for a brief second I thought my throat would close in.  I was immediately taken to the ER and monitored for about 2 hours.  During that time I had about 4 episodes of my heart rate going very high. I was told 120-150 beats/m. I was also told that I had PVC&#39;s and PAC&#39;s. I was released after 2 hours and had  another episode of a  fast heart rate on my way home. Since then I have had daily episodes of fast heart rate but not as long and not as intense.  Last episode was 2 days ago.

                                                Pt had just been sent to observation area from vax station and reported that she was feeling &#34;very warm&#34; and that she was experiencing some &#34;heart palpitations&#34;.  I was called over to assess her. She was flushed in the face, BP was 134/80 with pulse of 80, regular.  She denied shortness of breath or chest discomfort.  She was wearing a warm sweater and hat, so we removed the hat and transferred her by wheelchair to a cooler area.  She was still feeling weak, so we initiated a 911 call for EMS evaluation.  EMS arrived on site within 4 minutes and performed evaluation.  Pt was less flushed and stated she felt much better. She was not transported. Left clinic with her husband.  I called her today to follow up.  Other than some site tenderness and feeling &#34;a little light headed&#34; this morning, she feels fine.  She stated that she took ibuprofen for the injection site tenderness.  Her entire episode at the clinic last about 12-14 minutes from onset to time she left with her husband.

Then on Tuesday, 01/12/2021 I started with diarrhea at 11AM.  I called work and explained that it was a side effect of the Covid vaccine.  They still would not let me go to work even though I was covid negative.  I took 2 Imodium tablets. I will email you tomorrow, 1/13/2021 and continue to monitor.  Yes I am a RN.

                                                On 12/31 finished having dinner. Thought sudden slight shortness of breath may be do to appetizer type foods we had. Drank water to help subside it with little effect. Went outside into cold air. Still had some slight shortness of breath. At 8PM continued to my other daughters home( where I&#39;ve been going since pandemic) upon sitting there still felt slight shortness of breath but again manageable. We left at 11:30 as my breathing never really got better or worse. When I arrived home I Took my PROAIR-HFA inhaler that I use PRN. My symptoms resolved and went to bed. On Friday 1/1 I had again slight shortness of breath with no real excertion.  On 1/2 I went to work at Hospital in neurology dept. I was pushing collector up to SICU unit and then to M2 unit. On arrival to M2 I felt very winded and took my inhaler with results.  I then called my manager to make him aware that I was having dilemma do to fact that I didn&#39;t want to call Covid hot line as I felt symptoms were from vaccine not Covid!  I was put out of work by Covid hot line had test on 1/4 and negative results on 1/6. My symptoms seemed to subside on 1/6. I returned to work on 1/9 and am pushing collectors and patients with no symptoms

Then on 1/8/21 I woke up to pain in my left armpit.  I had a large lump there that was painful to touch.  I am sure it is a swollen lymph lode.  As of todays date 1/13/21 the pain is gone but swelling is still there but has gone down a lot and no longer painful.

Only worked 1/2 of day of  work- and not a full 8 hr shift on my scheduled shifts. But going back now full time. Blood type RH Negative.

Anaphylaxis is often referred to as slow roll and without the typical face swelling and rash. It is more subtle and can be harder to detect.  And that was my experience: as follows: I became faint and briefly passed out within 2 minutes of injection. I stabilized quickly within a 30 minute hold although developed increasing nausea, I and med tech was satisfied that it might just be my dysautanomia. I spent the evening with severe headache vomiting as passed out again. I experienced throat tightening but not full closure. The next day I had flue like symptoms that I assume were normaland vaccine related. When this passed in the evening I again suffered nausea and dizziness, vomiting and throat tightening when I tried to eat.  These symptoms were not similar to the flush feelings earlier in the day. The symptoms ebbed and waned for 2 days with increased frequency as I took chromalyn , Benadryl with some effect at first and ate with great care as not to introduce more allergens.  I had increased chest pain,  sweating, fainting, throat tightening became severe Benadryl was not effective. I was having trouble swallowing. I was forced to us an epi pen and call 911. This  is a typical anaphylactic response for EDS&lt; Mast Cell patients. It became clear that I could not get past this on my own and the symptoms were increasing. I started to shake with chills and feared shock as my chest pains increased. The epi pen injection and hospital visit via ambulance occurred Monday 1/25-1/26. I became very faint during the Ems intake with the techs having to hold me up to check vitals etc.. My HR dropped despite the EPi. At the ER I was given IV steroids,  IV Benedryl and Potassium,  tablets and fluids throughout the night, admitted for evaluation.

During the night, early 01/28/2021, I got up and had horrible cold chills that actually hurt.  I have never felt anything like this terrible feeling.  I took Ibuprofen and drank lots of water and returned to bed.  I was drenched with sweat when I awoke for the day.  I felt fair the 28th when I went to work and by that afternoon, my temperature raised a degree up to 100.3 with feelings of general malaise.  I continued to take Ibuprofen.  I took Ibuprofen during the night on the 29th and again had broke a fever; the neck of my pajamas were soaked.  My left deltoid is still very painful as of the 29th as I type this.  Swollen, hard with red area in the center.

                                                Side effects started the same day I received the vaccine, which were reported on the V-safe app.  Started with very sore arm, within 24 hours progressed to extreme fatigue, joint and body aches, loss of taste and headache. I also experienced some mild nausea. By Wednesday evening, I began to experience heart palpations which I listened to as a nurse which sounded like PVC&#39;s. I have never had this happen to me before. I assessed my vital signs and noted that as the arrhythmia progressed, my O2 sat level began to decrease and my pulse began to increase. I could hear a definite pause in my heart rhythm. Within an hour, I had chest pain in the area of my left chest over my heart which progressed into a feeling of pressure as if someone was standing with a foot on my chest. As time went on, this sensation radiated into my back at an angle from left to right. It was at this point that I had my father take me to the emergency room. When I got there, my pulse was in the low 100&#39;s and my blood pressure was 230/130. I have never had this happen to me before. I ended up on a nitroglycerin drip. My magnesium level was low and my sodium level was low normal.   I was kept in the emergency room until Thursday evening then transferred to Progressive Care Unit where I remained until early evening on Friday.I was sent home on 2 different cardiac medications, Coreg and Lisinopril. I am to follow up with my PCP and a cardiologist. Both are brand new to me. I am now feeling better, but I am very reluctant to have the second covid vaccine. Also, the Hospital does not know what happened to me. (Facility where I received my Covid vaccine.)

She was started on a 15L non-rebreather mask, IV was placed in the left antecubital space, and intubation kit was pulled from cart. Tongue and stridor improved after these doses of epinephrine and hydrocortisone. Blood pressure 190s systolic from 170s systolic after first epinephrine dose, with HR 116 at this point, and SpO2 99%. As EMS arrived, diphenhydramine 25mg IV was administered. At that point, tongue size and stridor were noted to have worsened again, so a third epinephrine pen was administered prior to EMS transport. Patient received racemic epinephrine inhalation nebulizer in EMS. Further treatment administered in ED: LR, dexamethasone and famotidine. Patient admitted later that day for further monitoring given hypertensive status. Put on scheduled cetirizine, famotidine, and dexamethasone and PRN albuterol and racemic epinephrine.

                                                Approximately 3 minutes after pt received her injection and was in the post vaccine observation area, she started feeling tightness in her chest, tingling in her mouth and lips and obvious left sided lip swelling and she notified the EMT observer.  The EMT brought the pt inside the building by the vaccine area where I quickly assessed her and administered 0.3mg of EpiPen AutoInjector.  The pt&#39;s lips gradually became more swollen, pt was able to talk and breath.  Pt refused 911 or other escort but agreed to go to the ED herself as she was with her husband.  Despite counseling, pt still refused 911. A public Health RN followed them to the ED and assured they were taken back quickly.  Pt was in the ED being seen within 8 minutes of the epi administration.  I called the ED to check on this pt about 60 minutes later and she was stable and planned to be discharged in a few hours.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection a warm/hot tingling sensation began in my body rising up from my chest to my head. My throat and chest became tight. My heart began to race. It was difficult to breath. I motioned for help. A physician on site came over. Emergency services was called. An EKG was done in the rescue. It was normal.  Most of the symptoms resolved approximately 20 minutes later. I did not go to the hospital.  I left feeling not completely right with some discomfort in my chest.  One week later my right arm at the injection site became hot and red 4 inches by 3 inches by 4 inches around and the soreness returned.  It is still slightly pink with soreness.

                                                Monday evening - Extreme pain in the arm where the injection was given. Swollen (like a baseball) and very red. I realize it would be sore; however, the pain radiated down the arm to the hand and upwards into my neck. A fever of 100 so I took tylenol.  Headache throughout the night and by morning my whole body hurt to the point I could not get out of bed.  Tuesday - I got up to go to the bathroom with help and lost consciousness. When checked at that time, I had a fever of 102, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms took place all day. I continued taking Tylenol for the pain. Not much sleep due to pain.  Wednesday - Some of the pain in the arm subsided; however, the spine pain was extreme. I struggled walking the pain severe. Throughout the day I was feeling a little better. Thursday - still body pain but tolerable.

After 20 min or longer the symptoms begin to dissipate. 1st event 1/8/21 in the evening. The following week another episode while driving home from work. During work 1/21/21 another episode took place and EKG done with negative result. That same evening during sleep another episode woke me up, although it was not as bad as the other ones and 20 minutes later i was able to go back to sleep.  As of today 1/25/20 no other episodes. I do take Famotidine daily and have been for several years due to acid reflux and heartburn, but never have I experienced chest pain.

                                                After receiving the injection I experienced slight soreness at the injection site, which was expected.  later that evening I experienced swelling in the left axilla lymph nodes. The swelling in that area was extreme on 01/20/2021 throughout the night and has continued until day of reporting on 01/27/2021. The pain and swelling involved the entire underarm and pain could be felt deep in the tissue. On pain scale of 1-10 with 10 as extreme, I would rate pain as a 9 on days 1-5. Pain has gradually diminished in severity on subsequent days and is a 2 today. Measures to reduce the pain included elevation of arm and shoulder during the night, discontinuation of deodorant during period of discomfort and application of warm and cold compresses to decrease pain and swelling.  Initially contemplated seeking emergency room evaluation and treatment for evaluation , but decided against because there is no way to remove the vaccine and treatment would probably include measures already implemented.

I called my son (son is a doctor) he said if my heart beat goes over 110 then I needed to call 911. It lasted till about 4 AM and I was able to sleep. Everything the pain and heartbeat both started to go  down. My heartbeat to went back down to 85. In the morning I was fine.

I called my son again and he said my lymph node getting swollen due to vaccine, it stayed until Sunday night and it started to get better. When you push it was painful.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction. Shot given around 9am. Around 11am symptoms appeared: extremely hot/flushed, nauseated, felt ill, difficulty swallowing. Went to pharmacist who had me sit down, within 30 seconds could not swallow. Pharmacist injected me with Epi Pen and called 911. Paramedics arrived gave more epinephrine, oxygen, started breathing treatment. Lost my voice as throat started to tighten more. Taken to Hospital where I was given Benadryl, steroids, stomach meds, more fluids and another breathing treatment since my lungs were so tight, I could only take shallow breaths. The crated my lungs, did blood work and kept me overnight for observation because I have a history of secondary reactions when I experience anaphylaxis. I was released from the hospital on 2/20/2021 at 2pm.

She was taken to the ED and was found to have a BP of  &gt;200/130. Patient had a seizure in the ED - was intubated to protect airway. CT showed some decreased areas of attenuation in the bilateral occipital lobes and cerebellum. MRI showed vasogenic and cytotoxic edema in posterior temporal, parietal and BL occipital and BL cerebellar hemisphere which can be seen with PRES. Patient required inpatient treatment for her elevated BP and neurological evaluation. Was started on Norvasc and Keppra due to concern for PRES.  Discharged with follow up in cancer center and with neurology. Hospitalist and neuro teams thought PRES was likely due to her  chemo regimen, patient&#39;s oncology team though PRES may have been triggered by vaccine due to timing and her dose of Avastin.   Pt has extensive oncological history including ovarian cancer w/ metastatic breast cancer in L axilla. Pt recently started on cytoxan, Avastin, pembrolizumab. Also has malignant abdominal ascites.
