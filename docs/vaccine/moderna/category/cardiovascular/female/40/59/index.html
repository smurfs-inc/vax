                                                I got the shot, didn?t feel it at all so it went good. I went to the bathroom and went pee and got my arm back in my long sleeve shirt under my scrub top. I wasn?t anxious about getting the vaccine. Then I went to sit down and be monitored. After about another minute I felt very weird like a warm feeling going all over my body.  I started pulling my mask away from my face to get a deep breath. Then I broke out in a sweat from head to toe. I think I became pale (I apparently didn?t look good).  I started feeling more ?weird? as I had never felt this way before and I stood up to walk because the nurse there wanted me upstairs near the ED but I was weak so I sat down and had tunnel vision. After that it?s a bit of a blur. After I stopped sweating I got very cold and shaky but vitals were ok.  It scared me because I have never had a reaction before to a vaccine.

Within the first hour I felt dizzy and I was going to pass out and nausea. I completed the rest of my shift, not sure how I did it.  I woke up in the middle of the night with a head ache and not feeling well. On the 24th I started sweating and dry heaving very bad and had no temp. I was in and out of the bathroom the entire shift.  The next day  (25th)I woke up and thought I had the flu, my lymph nodes in my throat had swollen and I just felt bad  the entire day.  The fatigue and exhaustion was un believable.  By the 28th I started to feel much better. Then everything returned back to normal.

She called for help  and slouched over in a chair and was moved to lay on the floor. Her feet were elevated and 911 was called.  Epinephrine was given, patient responded by being able to gasp for breath and her face returned to a more natural state. Within 5 min she began to struggle to breath and epi was given again.  Some improvement  did occur. EMS arrived and she was taken to the hospital.

Patient&#39;s mother-in-law (MIL) was working as a MD today. About 2:15pm, the MIL notified a staff RN in the clinic that her daughter-in-law (patient) was c/o of tachycardia. The patient called her PCP who recommended she use her prescribed epi-pen and go to the ED. The MIL told the staff RN that the patient had a history of allergies and carried an epi-pen. The MIL left the clinic at that time and we have not heard any update from her or the patient. In Item 21, I selected &#34;Emergency Room,&#34; but do not know for certain if the patient went to the ED.

I alerted a nurse, and she monitored me for the 15 minute duration. After about 2 minutes, I felt &#39;normal&#39; again.

Remedy was to leave work and go home, lay down in bed, and wait.  After a few hours symptoms mostly resolved, but face still feels strange (slight numbness and slight tingling).

Then, Saturday the 16th, a tickle in my chest.. soon produced a dry cough in relief/response to the tickle. Next day, I was hoarse (Sunday the 17th). Still hoarse. Sore throat off and on. Headache. Body aches. Incredible arthritis-like ache at the tops of my shoulders, upper back, and neck. Runny nose. Spitting mucous - was clear, now some thick solid white. Chest pain in the middle that comes and goes. Chest pain on left center side - it feels like in the area of my heart. Ache in my lower left side. Today, aching in my jaws mostly left side, but both. Ache on upper right front (lung area?). INCREDIBLY tired. It&#39;s so hard to stay awake.

                                                On January 4 at 2:00 pm I suddenly started to bleed from the nose from the left nostril and then from both. The event lasted more than 35 minutes so I had to go to the ER. The diagnosis was Epistaxis. I was discharged because at the time of the medical evaluation I removed a large clot from my mouth and the bleeding stopped.  Appointment with primary physician for diagnosis and appointment with ENT was ordered. On January 5 at 4:15 am I had another episode of nasal bleeding lasting 25 min. After removing a clot through the mouth, the bleeding stopped. At 4:00 pm I presented Epistaxis again so I had to return to the Emergency Room. I was reevaluated and the instruction was to visit the ENT and Afrin prescription for three days and Claritin D q 12 hrs PRN. From January 6 to 9, I began to eliminate a serous-bloody vaginal discharge. That began with the elimination of a clot and progressively diminished day by day.  January 11, 2021, the ENT evaluated me and indicated that it did not observe polyps or anatomical problems. I had not previously prolonged nosebleeds. Previously two minor episodes happened to me, a year ago that resolved in less than 7 minutes. I didn&#39;t have a cold or any other symptoms.  I want to raise the flag because it was a strange event that occurred after the vaccination and that I had not experienced before in that way.My next dose is January 29, 2021. I am awaiting clot test results

                                                Patient received her vaccine and was taken to the observation area to be observed for a 15-minute period. In the observation area, she immediately reported &#34;feeling funny&#34; and was noted to be &#34;sweaty&#34;. The advanced practice nurses and pharmacist were called for assistance immediately. She was placed on a stretcher, had her legs elevated, and was moved to a quieter area. She was responsive to commands and her vitals at this time were as follows: blood pressure 96/56 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 96%, and heart rate in mid 60s.  She did not require treatment and within several minutes of lying down on the stretcher felt better. She did not have any rashes or swelling, and she denied difficulty breathing. She was observed for about half an hour in this area and was also evaluated Emergency Medical Services who had been called. It was suggested that the patient should visit the Emergency Department for observation but she refused as she felt better and due to concerns of being exposed to Covid-19. We were able to walk with her escort her to the exit area at the end of the observation period.   We questioned her about potential allergies again and she denied a history of allergic reactions. The advanced practice nurse evaluating the patient suggested this episode was consistent with a vasovagal episode and that anxiety could have also played a role.

The nurse checked on me and it continued to get worse. They checked my blood pressure. It was extremely high, 166/1 Over the course of the next 45 minutes my Blood Pressure continued to stay high. The dizziness would come and go.  I was escorted to the ER. I refused an ambulance. The ER did an EKG, hooked me up to a heart monitor and monitored my blood pressure for about 2 hours. They finally let me leave when my Blood pressure came down to 135/100 and I was not experiencing anything but minor dizziness and a headache. The headache continued on through the night and by 3:30AM I had a migraine. I took Sumatriptan and after an hour the headache subsided.

                                                5 minutes after I the vaccination I got light headed and heart palpations were felt in my throat, elevated BP of 148/92  which continued to increase to 159/109 which then  Rapid Response was called in and I was transported to ER for about 4hrs.  2 EKGs - done 1st showed PVC, and Cardiac labs were drawn and was continued monitoring with elevated BP.  About 3hrs later ,the 2nd EKG was done which looked better and I was released.  I was advised I could return back to work on 1/1 but I still felt bad and had continued palpations and wasnt able to go bk to wk until 1/5.  I did return to work on 1/5 and at 1:30am I got up and felt lightheaded and the palpations returned.  I went to healthcare facility and got my bp taken which was 174/92 so I went to the ER.  I was given presnisone  and within the next 45min the palpations began to lessen and BP began to decrease. I was also prescribed a 7day course of predinsone and removed from work until 1/9.  I had a virtual visit on 1/7 with my physician in which I showed her the injection site which was still very red, painful and bruised so she prescribed Bactrim and Benedryl causing her to further remove me from work until 1/14.  I had a in person follow up appt on 1/14 which by that time all symptoms had subsided. My BP was back normal at 97/72 and my arm symptoms had subsided as well.  An in office EKG was done which was normal.  But from 1/6-1/14 the heart palpation and elevated BP remained.  Although I will say they did lessened throughtout that time it was extremely hard on me during that time frame .

                                                Went out to car around 25 min after with only mild throat discomfort.  Shortly after, was having difficulty swallowing, felt dizzy &amp; face swelling.  Took quick release (dissolve under tongue) prednisolone 20 mg (have for peanut allergy).  Symptoms didn&#39;t initially improve, used albuetrol inhaler and returned to hospital.  Swelling symptoms started feeling better.  Blood pressure when first checked was very high, still at 170/118 at 21:54.  Sent to ED.  Wheezing and constant throat clearing in ED, used inhaler again &amp; symptoms improved.  BP still high for me at 138/80 at 21:54 with patchy confluent erythema over anterior chest that blanches, non-pruritic &amp; 3-4 hives on abdomen.  Given Benadryl 50 mg, famotidine 50 mg &amp; dexamethasone 10 mg at 22:22.  At 23:09, chest rash resolved, but pruritis &amp; mild urticaria to back and arms.  At 23:41, urticartia resolved &amp; discharged.  After second dose of Decadron was delayed the following day, itchy hives returned on chest, stomach, back and left shoulder.  Same occurred on the 3rd day, along with wheezing (resolved by other meds &amp; inhaler) and more steroids were prescribed.  This resolved the remaining symptoms.

The patient&#39;s medical history included a propensity for fainting and low blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient got dizzy, had nausea, a little vomit, and fainted to the floor. She reported feeling dizzy, hot and sweaty.  Patient did not take medication to treat her symptoms.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, fainted, dizziness, felt hot, nausea and vomiting, and sweaty were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 40-year-old female patient with medical history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the unlisted event of Syncope which was considered medically significant. Additionally, the patient experienced the non-serious listed events of Nausea and Vomiting, and the non-serious unlisted events of Feeling Hot, Dizziness and Hyperhidrosis. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. We would note that the patient&#39;s history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure could be also contributory.

Cried for my husband. Dripping sweat gave me a cold rag and foam large diarrhea began. Still 10/10 pain in abdomen. Felt like my lower abdomen was getting ripped out.  About 45 minutes or so later still 10/10 wanted to go to ER. I could not stand. If I stood my legs and body felt like I wanted to curl in a ball on the floor. He called an ambulance. I was pale as a ghost, no fever, normal vital signs. Went into full reynauds flare from body stress. Ambulance was unable to get oxygen sat and glucose at the time due to flare. Arrived at the ER labs drawn. WBC 10.9 and Glucose 194. I am not or never have been diabetic. Vaccine related.

I could feel myself get super flush, I could feel my whole body warming.   I had a hard time swallowing and my tongue burned and felt swollen.  My throat would just get super tight. Each episode lasted under a minute This happened on and off it for about 30 minutes.  Each time it happened it was not as bad as the time prior.  I was dizzy when I tried to stand up and I sat and was monitored for an hour.  They administered  Benadryl.   I have some edema on my upper chest when I got home.  I was super tired too. The next day still the edema and I have a sore throat .   I explained the best I could to the pharmacist when it was happening .  I refused to get EMT because it was not constant and it was getting less intense each time.

I was rushed to ER where the medical staff fought to stabilize me and administered three doses of Adenosine to control my heart rate.   Since 01/02/2021 I have been battling to control my heart rate with Propranolol. I have been to the ER multiple times weekly and have had numerous appointments with specialist at medical center--they are unable to diagnose me. They cannot find a reason for Tachycardia. Gastro, Endo, BH and Cardiology at medical center have many test, scans, echos, bloodwork and are unable to find cause let alone a solution.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, I walked about 40-50 feet and experienced extreme dizziness and shortness of breath, and could not stand straight. I was able to stop my own fall due to a wall being next to me, and I stooped down close to the floor so as to prevent a fall. I then was able to walk about 20 feet to an office where I could sit and the dizziness continued. I noticed I was shaking and heartrate was elevated (that could have been the anxiety caused by the dizziness and being unable to walk straight). I sat for a total of 30 minutes before I walked to my office, which is a couple minute walk. I continued to have dizzy spells (not as severe) while sitting in my office for a few more hours. Also, I&#39;m having a hard time focusing, feel dazed.

I saw my doctor and just thought I was having anxiety. Started medication for anxiety.  Three to four days post second shot, the side effects came back and are not yet resolved at this time. I am currently working with my doctor to determine what I need to do to lower my blood pressure and stop the anxiety attacks.

                                                Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

Patient&#39;s arm became red and very swollen on two separate occasions after receiving flu vaccine but patient did NOT experience difficulty breathing, respiratory distress, throat swelling, shortness of breath, or anaphylaxis. Approximately 11 minutes after receiving Moderna vaccine, patient complained of warmth and redness at injection site. Immediately after this complaint, patient began to faint and complain of difficulty breathing and pain when breathing. Rapid response was called. Patient continued to complain of painful inspirations and difficulty breathing. EpiPen, albuterol inhaler, and diphenhydramine IM were administered. Patient improved and was transported to emergency room for further monitoring. Patient improved in emergency room and was discharged sooner after.

                                                Estimated due date: 02/07/2021. Will probably be induced a week earlier. I felt mild pain in my arm in the evening of the 31st and then the pain started from my elbow to my neck on my right side. I went to sleep and woke up with general malaise, chills, body ache, sore throat, headache. the same feeling I had when I had covid, a heaviness in my chest, almost like a shortness of breathe. I was flushed and felt feverish although I never had a fever. The symptoms lasted all day.  On the first also my arm pain was severe, I could not even lift it the whole day. I went to sleep on 01/01 and when I woke up on 01/02 the symptoms were all gone. I took Tylenol 3 times to help me with the symptoms. 3 grams total in 24 hrs.

She thought she&#39;d be alright- but 5 minutes after the vaccine, she got very pale and lightheaded. Staff eased her onto the floor (she did not faint or lose consciousness) and staff raised her feet up on a chair. Then after about 5 minutes on the floor, we had her sit up and helped her to a cot- continued to lay down another 15 minutes. She also had not eaten or had anything to drink yet that day (she was vaccinated at 11:15am). Given apple juice, which also helped her body recover. No injury was sustained.

                                                I received the injection around 2:15 pm.  There were no immediate effects. By late afternoon/early evening, my arm was a bit sore and later started to feel warm near the injection site.  However, I otherwise felt fine.  At 9 pm, I suddenly became very dizzy and passed out for several minutes. When I regained consciousness, I felt a little short of breath, which resolved within 20 minutes or so. However, I was also extremely nauseous, which got worse any time I tried to move. This continued for several hours.  I also alternated between being very warm and chills during this time - it was like waves of heat. I did not have a fever. Later, my head began to hurt and I took tylenol to help with that. I also had diarrhea. These symptoms began to gradually lessen after a couple of hours and I was able to fall asleep around 12:30 pm. I woke up hot and sweaty several times throughout the night. The following day, 1/6, I was very tired and had a headache and could not eat much, but otherwise felt much better.

                                                I woke up from sleep with severe chest pain at approx. 0400. It was sharp and radiated up to the left side of my neck. The pain was worse with breathing whether I was sitting up or lying down. My heart rate was 150 initially, but came down to 110&#39;s after a few minutes of waking up.  My heart rate did not decrease with rest and the chest pain was not going away, so I drove to the emergency room to be checked. Before I left the house I used my albuterol inhaler once to see if it would make the chest pain and tightness any better.  I received an EKG, mylanta mixed with lidocaine, IV pepcid and IV torodol to help relive the pain. The pain eased some (was a 8/10 when I awoke to a 2/10 after treatment). My blood was drawn, a chest x-ray was taken and the provider informed me all of my lab results, chest x-ray, and physical examination was normal. My EKG showed tachycardia and my heartrate did not drop below 100 beats per minute throughout the whole ER visit.  My BP at the highest was 151/94.  I have never had a problem with a fast heartrate or high blood pressure in the past.  I was discharged with a diagnosis of pleurisy caused by a cough I have been having.  I spent the rest of the day with chest pain and left arm pain from the site of the vaccination.

I felt heat rush into the left side of my head, I was extremely light headed and couldn?t catch my breath. I asked if there was a nurse that could help me. There was 1 paramedic watching everyone. I stepped outside, took my mask off to catch my breath. One staff member accompanied me and sat next to me. I began to shake in my legs and arms involuntarily, my heart kept beating and I just tried to do deep breathing techniques to catch my breath.  The paramedic came outside and asked if I wanted help. I declined his help and I called my husband who was sitting in the car to help me walk to our car. At 1:15, my heart was beating less rapid, I walked back to the car and as my husband was driving us home, my heart began to beat rapidly again, I felt burning and heat in my head and I began to shake in my arms and legs. It lasted about 10-15 minutes. We got home and I could barely walk into the house because I was so weak in my legs. I went to bed where my heart began beating back to normal after 1 hour or so.

                                                I had my first COVID 19 Moderna vaccine Lot: 025J20-2A at hospital. Within about 60 seconds of receiving it, my heart started pounding hard and rapidly and I let a nurse know. She took my vitals and my heart rate was very high, as was my blood pressure. My O2 was fine. I had some tightness and heaviness I my chest. I felt flush in my cheeks, but did not have hives. The nurse said my color was very pale. I was warm, given an ice pack, and then a bit later cold. At one point they wanted me to go to the Emergency Department, which I refused (perhaps stupidly). I&#39;m not sure I was thinking clearly. I was trying very hard to stay calm and relaxed. My blood pressure was very elevated for about an hour and a half. They finally let me go home when I was 140/95 (my usual is 110 over 70 ish). I had some tongue tingling at home, very briefly.

My mom was on the phone with me and stated I didn?t quite know what I was saying to her and she became worried.  The RN came by asking how I felt and I told her I was jittery and decided to wait at the site a few more minutes.  The sensation passed after about 3-4 minutes and then I felt ok.  I drove home and showered.  The rest of the night I would get random bouts of tachycardia and felt overall not well.  Also a small amount of chest tightness.  I also noticed things such as climbing by stairs cause me to become winded very fast and my HR would elevate rapidly.  Today I woke up and am feeling almost normal. HR has not been elevated but when I ate I did notice a small amount of lightheadedness.

                                                The first 10 hours I did not have any symptoms. That night about 12 hours later, I experienced headache and arm swelling at the injection site. At 3 am that morning , I had 102. fever. By the time fever broke, my arm had a goose egg the size of an actual egg.  The fever continued off and on the next 24 hours. The next day, my arm was swelling more about the size of a lemon. My whole arm was swelling. I then called my ER doctor. It felt like a hard lump. The fever I had again 102.3. I took Tylenol and Motrin and could not break fever. My heart rate went up to 125 from the fever. The next day, I felt achy, chills, nausea and then they subsided. It took about a week for the arm swelling to resolve.

                                                A day after the shot I was in the shower and started experiencing exhaustion and shortness of breath. I also had tachycardia. I proceeded not to feel well they?re very next day. Then on Friday I was dizzy and a coworker said that I was flushed and I wasn?t feeling well. I proceeded to go see patients and while examining a patient I became very dizzy and lightheaded while bent over and almost passed out when I came up.. at that time I decided to leave work and go to my PCP. Orthostatic?s were positive and EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and an echo is ordered. Echo was normal. Throughout the week I continued to have tachycardia and shortness of breath with any type of exertion. I left work this morning and was tested for Covid because of my symptoms.

                                                About 10 minutes after the shot, my chest felt very hot and spread to both my left and right arm down to my elbows. Simultaneously, I experienced a weird taste in my mouth that was not metallic. My heart rate increased. I sought help immediately. My chest was a bit painful. That subsided a bit and then both arms felt tingly from my elbows to my wrists. That subsided and came back, milder each time. This lasted for about 50 minutes before I was allowed to leave and go home. I am typing this 7 hours later and my tongue feels a bit swollen (not unusual based on my food allergies and am not concerned to go to the hospital), and my chest still hurts a bit. I am wondering if it&#39;s anxiety at this point. My breathing and speaking have been totally fine. I got home with no trouble. I rested for several hours just to make sure I did not overexert myself.

                                                Within first 15 min my throat started to feel like it was closing up. My tongue also felt like it going towards the back of my throat and I was dizzy/lightheaded. It lasted. About 5/7 min. It felt like was easing up so the school nurse told me wait an additional 15 min to be sure I was ok. She also took my blood pressure and said was normal. Dr. a pharmacist brought me orange juice a d said maybe was just low blood sugar. I said it felt similar to when my epidural during last delivery was up too high and my throat closed up and I couldn?t breathe.  About ten min later it began again.  I tried to get up and walk around some and I felt a little better at first but then started to get significantly worse. I felt like I was struggling to breathe and tongue was swollen feeling and stuck to back of mouth as if it was paralyzed.  I say back down and my blood pressure was high (just told bottom number was 106). I was moved to another room to lie down and pharmacist mentioned using epi pen or benedryl shot. I had to sit up and almost passed out. I was having difficulty breathing. Not because of my lungs but my throat and tongue seemed frozen. He decided to give me a 25 mg Benadryl shot but had me drink it. It had a horrible bitter taste and made my throat and tongue numb. At this point it was about 12:30. My administrator called a coworker to drive me home. I decided to leave about 29 min after I had the benedryl.  I could still feel that my throat was somewhat tight but it had improved enough that I didn?t think I was in danger of not being to breathe again. I went home (15 min drive) and by then my throat felt a lot tighter. I took 25 mg more of benedryl and it felt better. About four hours later it became tight again and I took 50 mg of benedryl. Through out all this I had severe pain at site of injection in my left arm, dizziness, nausea, and headache.

I thought it was anxiety due to receiving the vaccine (though I had never had symptoms like that ever before), so I started deep breathing to try to calm down.  It continued to worsen but then stopped after approximately 2 - 3 minutes after deep breathing. I did not check my pulse during the episode but it felt like a regular rhythm, just elevated rate.  No medical attention or treatment was needed.  My heart rate was elevated for approximately 20-30 minutes afterwards (around 100bpm; my baseline is in the 70s).

                                                Immediate full body  heat rush and heart racing upon injection.  Right arm went numb down to elbow, numbness then radiated up to neck &amp; side of face into ear, up back of head, back toward shoulder blade and then down lateral torso. Numbness turned into intense pins and needles with intermittent jolts the day after the vaccine and slowly began to diminish. Most intense first 5 days, and  lasted in a significant manner a little over 2 weeks. Now is barely noticeable shoulder blade and side of neck. Chest tightness nearly immediately after vaccine. Used albuterol inhaler 30 minutes after vaccine which helped. Chest tightness reappeared 6 hours later, took Benadryl and inhaler. Required inhaler in the evening for 2 more days following vaccine.  Diarrhea began day after vaccine, lasted 2 days Neck muscles felt too weak to hold up head, began shortly after vaccine and recurred each afternoon for about 5 days.  Day 11 developed a sudden rash/redness with heat and swelling over the injection site. Took Benadryl and called PCP when rash worsened the next day. Visit to PCP 13 days post vaccine due to rash. MD unsure if allergy or infection, recommended antibiotics, but by day 14 after taking Benadryl for 3 days, the rash dissipated without beginning any antibiotics.

I was diagnosed with Covid as I found out my husband gave it to me. Then a couple days later my asthma got worse and I ended up in the ED overnight. They were able to get better management in my Asthma.  I was sick for 3 weeks. Went back to work week four 1/25 Monday and 1/27 they cleared me to get the second dosage of the vaccine. I got the vaccine 3:20 pm and at 5:00 I walked my son in Kung Fu and then waited in my car. I ended up passing out in my car at approx 5:15 pm and my 8 year old son knew something was wrong and had to wake me up.  I could barely drive home I felt very drunk. When I got home my temp spikes to 101.3. I had extreme muscle pain, fatigue, chills, sore throat, chest pain, cough, SOB. My left arm swelled up where I was injected and I couldn?t move my arm. I was told I couldn?t take anything tylonel or Ibuprofen for 8 hours. I suffered. Even when I could take something my body was very painful. This lasted  wed, thurs, and Friday morning.

Got up to go to bathroom to throw up, at this time my husband was with me and when I got to bathroom, I passed out. He was holding me, stated my eyes were open and pupils very dilated.  He had to wake me out if it (maybe just under 1 min) When I woke up, I vomited a little. Then until about 4 am I continued to have extreme chills, body aches and threw up a few more times. Still currently (9:30 am) feeling very weak and have a bad headache .

                                                Will call back later this week with lot number. Two days later my body started tingling, I ended up leaving work early. I called the doctor who said and take some Benadryl and rest it off. I was nausea all weekend and slept most of the weekend. I went to work on Monday and worked through Thursday. Friday 1/22/2021 afternoon my body began tingling again, I became so weak that I couldn&#39;t walk. I had to leave work early and they made my husband come pick up because the staff at my job did not think I was safe to drive. I was nauseous again. I had major diarrhea and vomiting about a week after receiving the vaccine. This lasted around 3 days. I finally went into the ER on 1/24/2021. They treated me Magnesium and Potassium and 2 bags of IV fluid and said I was dehydrated and sent me home.  I went from the ER and I could not sleep that night, the ER gave me so much Zofran it was just to much. I still continued to throw up at home. Went back to ER this time  in  on 1/25/2021 around 5AM I was losing feeling in my fingers and toes, they were completely numb. I was also still vomiting. They said I my electrolytes were still out of balance and gave more nausea medicine, medicine to help with the cramping and more IV fluids.  I was sent home later that afternoon. I went to work on the 26th, I felt slow to react, trouble concentrating, very lethargic, and off balance. I was still nauseous but it was getting better with medicine. My eyes yellows turn straight yellow, I thought I had jaundice.  I was able to work all day. I left work and when I pulled into driveway at home 7:01 PM and EMS was in front of my house 7:14  PM.  I went inside and went to bathroom and my husband found me and I was having a full blown seizure, foaming at the mouth. EMS took my to  ER and I was treated for a seizure and an elbow injury and went home. I have seen the neurologist and my physician since being discharged. They did more blood work. I have been having high blood pressure since then. I am trying to get an MRI scheduled that my neurologist ordered. They started Keppra 500 MG to control the seizures. I have been taking Tizanadine for muscle spams from the elbow injury when I feel during the seizure.   I did have an MRI 6 months ago.

                                                I felt a little lightheaded after the first shot on 1/28/21, they had me stay an additional 15&#34; and I felt ok. After the 2nd shot on 2/25, I immediately felt a little lightheaded, sat for 15&#34;, when I stood up to leave I felt lightheaded and had to sit down. The staff member got me a cup of juice and some water. I stayed for another 15&#34;, I felt better, a little kind of &#34;flighty&#34; feeling but not like I did when I had to sit. I went home and did ok. I dont think i drank enough fluids that evening. That night around midnight I had chills and could not sleep, muscle aches, headache. Around 8 am when I woke up to go to the bathroom, I felt so lightheaded that I had to lay back down, my temp was 100.4. I drank some water. I got back up to take tylenol and get more to drink. I still felt lightheaded and fatigue, temp was down to 99.6. I drank 3 bottles of water and a gatorade before I needed to urinate. I dont know if the lightheaded feelings were a drop in blood pressure and the more intense lightheadedness the next day after the 2nd shot was a presyncopal episode. I continued to nap and drink fluids until about 2p when I woke up I no longer felt lightheaded and the fatigue was getting better. I still had a headache til that night. I did call Occupational Health to go over my symptoms, they told me to push fluids and rest.  Today I emailed my doctor, PCP to go over things and see if he thinks this was a reaction to the vaccine vs not drinking enough the night before, I am leaning toward a reaction since it made me feel weird right after the shot for both times. As of Saturday 2/27 AM I am feeling more like myself, still drinking alot and resting though.

                                                Approximately two minutes after I received the vaccine I had a strange feeling in my right arm (where I received the injection) that went away after about 30 seconds. About two minutes after that, I developed a bitter taste on my tongue that later spread to the rest of my mouth. Several minutes later, my lips began to tingle and swell, then my mouth (i.e. my soft palette) began to swell as well. About forty minutes after I received the vaccine, I began developing shortness of breath and spiked a fever.  The on-site doctor administered an Epipen and I was transported to the ER. While at the hospital I had a blood drawn, a COVID test, a chest X-ray, and multiple EKGs performed. I was discharged about 2.5 hours later.

The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID-19 diagnosed in Oct 2020. Concomitant medication was not provided.   On 05 Feb 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 030M20A) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Feb 2021, post vaccination, the patient&#39;s body temperature was 104.6 F, and hallucinations. On 09 Feb 2021, the patient woke up with high blood pressure and had a bad headache. Subsequently, the patient went to emergency room on the same day. Treatment medications included acetaminophen and ibuprofen.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome for the events, hallucinations, high blood pressure, temperature went to 104.6 F, and bad headache were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I?m now allergic to soy, yeast, wheat, coffee, casein (dairy) peanuts, green beans/ legumes, eggs, onion and celery. I?ve had a huge rash that broke out on my left arm that started at the spot where I received the injection.  Now I?ve been experiencing my mouth and tongue swelling to the point that my throat has closed up. I?ve been hospitalized as air wasn?t going through my body. I had to inject an Epi-pen in my leg, and be taken to the hospital. I?m currently on high dosage prednisone, Benadryl and several other meds to address the swelling in my tongue that happens daily. I am desperate to find out if there is anyway to stabilize anything that vaccine had in it to see if this condition will get better.

Woke up March 7th with swollen lips/throat/tongue. went to urgent care and received an EpiPen and steroid. Monitored for a couple of hrs and went home for a nap. (refused the ER at this time as I felt better). Woke up around 2:30 and my symptoms worsened . We to ER and received another Epipen for anaphylactic shock. Remained at the hospital for 5 days. Had 5 episodes while there. Also, had tightening in chest and what felt like a heart attack. Been resting, still very tired and swollen nodes in my neck and sore throat as well as aches. Also, might be developing thrush. Didn&#39;t run a fever and Ive never had an allergic reaction  before this.

                                                In the middle of the night I passed out while walking from the bathroom. I broke my front tooth in half and smashed in 2 other front teeth. Also bruised cheek, lip, and knee. I had been feeling chills, aches, and flu-like symptoms throughout the night. It required a dental surgeon, dentist, and probably braces. The advice nurse advised going to the Emergency Room due to her concern about a head injury.

                                                Post vaccine next day i had scapula pain and chest burning, as the days went the chest burning became more intense. Thought maybe covid,  took test and it was negative, so now 7 days post vaccine still chest burning and scapula pain is intermittent. Contact pcp, going for bloodwork and chest xray. Outcomes to be determined. Pcp believes this is a vaccine reaction.

                                                Thursday night shortly after the vaccine I was exhausted and headed home to go lay down. While driving, I developed a severe headache. I went home and went to sleep really early. Friday morning, woke up, went to work. Extreme lethargy and severe headache. Left work early (2 ish) with joint pain, headache, lethargy. In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and &#34;buzzing&#34; throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled. Still lethargy and dizzy yesterday but no joint pain, no nausea. Now, Monday morning, still dizzy/lightheaded. Symptoms are subsiding, but not gone.

                                                I felt very heavy (especially my limbs) and had a slight headache on Thursday (the day after receiving the vaccine).  This feeling continued into Friday morning when I nearly passed out (blacked out and collapsed for a split second) as I was crouched position for approximately 10 minutes at work.  I felt dizzy and slow moving for the next several hours.  My blood pressure was rated as normal, blood oxygen normal, and pulse slightly low by a nurse on staff who took my vitals after the episode.   My temperature, which had been 97.8 prior to the event that morning (typical for me) was elevated during this time to 100.2 and returned to normal after approximately 4 hours without medication.  I was fatigued, so I slept for approximately 4-5 hours that afternoon and began feeling better the following day (Saturday).

My BP was rather normal but  my heart rate was up to 125bpm.  I am uncertain when my heart rate regulated but do know I slept regularly that night.  I also have severe anxiety so I was hesitant to report this issue due to being unable to distinguish between the two.  Day after injection was sore arm, mild fatigue and headache for most of the day

The patient&#39;s medical history included allergy to shellfish, bee sting, and mushrooms. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 31 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 31 Dec 2020, five minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced anaphylactic shock. Some of the symptoms experienced included chest tightness, difficulty breathing, throat swelling, and weakness. The patient was transported to the hospital by the emergency medical services (EMS). Treatment for the event included epinephrine several times.   On 01 Jan 2021, the patient experienced extreme fatigue, tightness in sternum, and weakness at home. She returned to the hospital where she was admitted. It was noted that a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed atelectasis. The patient also experienced extreme bilateral leg weakness and difficulty walking. The patient was advised to be placed in a nursing home/rehabilitation center.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome for the events, anaphylactic shock, extreme fatigue, tightness in sternum, atelectasis, extreme bilateral leg weakness, and difficulty walking, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 42- year old, female patient with medical history of allergy to shellfish, bee sting and mushrooms, who experienced a serious, unexpected event of anaphylactic shock, chest discomfort, muscular weakness, gait disturbance, fatigue, and atelectasis. The event of anaphylactic shock occurred 5 minutes after first dose of the mRNA-1273. The event of chest discomfort, muscular weakness, gait disturbance, fatigue, and atelectasis occurred 2 days after first dose of the mRNA-1273. The treatment included epinephrine. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded..

My left arm was significantly sore all day, pain from my shoulder to elbow and into my armpit/chest.  On Wednesday, Jan 20th, I noticed a red mark, oval in shape, about 4 inches from the injections site that became warm to touch.  During Wednesday and Thursday, the red mark got larger, wrapping around the outside of my arm and slightly swelled.  It is still warm to touch but not as red today (Monday 1/25). I have applied ice to it twice a day for 20 minutes at a time.

                                                The next morning after I had trouble getting up.  I was achy and had a 99.7 fever.  Took tylenol and rested.  A few hours later the symptoms got worse and worse an my body  ached so bad I could barely walk.  The fever elevated as high as 103 during that time.  And I had what felt like pressure on my neck which made my voice sounded really rough.  I had chest pains, rapid HR and SOB  and the symptoms got so bad I went to the ER where I remained for about 8hrs.  While there I started getting a really bad headache which lasted from that Sun after to the end of the week on Friday.   Benedryl, pepcid, tylenol was given.  About 9:30pm I was released with a prescription for the headache and advised to take benedryl.  Once home I noticed my arm was swollen and white in the center.  I got a rash on that arm that carried to my face and was itchy and burning.  I had lymph nodes that devoloped under both arm pits but the side where the injection was given hurt worse than the other. Had to wear the holter monitor for a week d/t the elevated HR which in turn made the healthcare specialist prescribe metroprol to help lower the HR but to date I am still having issues with the rapid HR.

                                                Around 730-8 I got a really bad headache. Throughout the night my back tightened up and my hips. I got up tp get ready to go to work, I felt really  light headed while I was brushing my teeth but went in to work. I started felling shortened of breathe and achy. I started feeling  bad and told my Head Nurse and he took my BP and I have a fever. My heart beat was rapid. I went home, slept and had no appetite . The I ended up going to the Hospital  my chest was hurting bad in my lung area, everything about me just hurt I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  They did xray on my lungs, they were clear, my BP was still high, my heart rate had calmed down. They had me sit and relax. The next day I woke up and was ready to put my scrubs on, it was like nothing has ever happened to me. I felt worse with the vaccine then I did when I got the Covid, all I had with Covid headache.  Everything hit so rapid and fast after the shot.

My immunologist believes that this was a cytokine storm reaction (non anyphylaxis).  Store gave me water and cookie to help.  Discomfort continued.  Paramedics were on site and did work up on me and allowed me after 1 hour to go home where fever and chills continued for 2 hours.  Immunologist would like to administer second dose in her office using desensitizing approach.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 vaccine EUA Received first shot yesterday (2/10/21 @ 2:42pm) had chills off and on overnight and sore arm. Got up at 6:30 am today (2/11/21), used the bathroom, felt very dizzy and lightheaded, started sweating profusely, tried to make it back to bed, took 4 steps and passed out, hitting my face on dresser.  This has only happened one other time, 16 years ago when I was pregnant, flying on vacation and hadn?t eaten, blood sugar dropped and I passed out momentarily. No history of fainting, not diabetic, no health issues whatsoever. Healthy weight, fit and in shape.

                                                The staff member was given a Covid-19 vaccination as part of the LTCF Covid-19 clinic scheduled on 2/25/2021. During  the 20 minute observation period the patient lost consciousness and begin to have seizure-like shaking. An 0.3mg epi-pen was administered in the lateral thigh.  The patient then experienced cardiac arrest at which point nurses from the LTCF began and completed 2 cycles of CPR before the staff member was resuscitated. EMS arrived and assessed the patient. Patient was taken to the hospital for further evaluation.

After abt 5-10min my heartrate slowed down. EMS was on site and performed bp check and Ekg which he says were both textbook and normal. My hear rate at that point was at 100bpm.

                                                Had the injection Friday evening. Very quickly had my heart rise and felt shaky (like when you take an inhaler). Heart rate stayed up for about 30 min, shaky for about another 1 and half.  but left factily after 15 minutes, as I was shaky, but ok.  About 20 min after shot, the tip of my tongue and lips got tingly/numbish. Not swollen, just tingly.  (They were very slightly the same way the next day). I went home and contacted  hotline. She suggested I call a dr. I called a dr who told me to take a benadryl.  I ate some food and took the benadryl. I fell asleep and slept for 14 hours (definitely not normal). That next day (Saturday) I had a headache, upset stomach, lowgrade fever (below 99.9) and pretty good pain in the injection arm. Stomach was settled by that evening, headache was gone Sunday. Off and on low grade fever (highest was 100.3) still ongoing (Tues 3/2, but highest today is 99.1))

                                                Starting on Sunday Feb 28th I was very fatigued. I woke up on Monday after sleeping more than 12 hours with my head feeling tight and hot. My eyelids were burning, the skin around my neck felt irritated and my lymph nodes in my neck were swollen. The burning in my eyelids and neck pain went away by Monday evening. However on Tuesday I woke up with a visible rash on my neck. In the last few days it has stayed even though I have applied cortisone and neosporin on it. It is now warm to the touch and itchy. I also have a rash on my eyelids and my cheek which are hard to see in pictures because of my skin tone. I called my Primary for a virtual consult when I woke up this morning Saturday March 6 because I am feeling itchy all over especially on my back. Additionally, the skin of my elbows and knees (in the joint crease area) are now super warm like my eyelids were before the rash appeared. I also have neck pain again which started yesterday (March 5th) afternoon. It is not a muscular pain. It starts at the base of neck and radiates up to the crown of my head. It has not gone away with either Tylenol or Advil. My chest is also tight--not my lungs but my chest itself.

On 12/25/20 I was walking downstairs when my husband felt I didn&#39;t look normal. I fell off the bottom two stairs sustaining injury to both feet. I was able to get myself up to standing position and then sat down. My husband reports that a few minutes later I had what he described was seizure activity for about one minute/stopped breathing and he called 911. Due to COVID visitor restrictions my husband was not allowed to go to the ER with me the night of the incident.  I had full work-up with labs, EKG and head CT that were unremarkable  at Medical Center.  I had an appointment with my primary care physician on 12/28/20 and was referred to neurologist. He did an exam, ordered MRI and sleep deprived EEG. My MRI was completed and reported as no abnormalities. I have the sleep deprived EEG  scheduled on 1/11/21. I have continued pain/physical therapy on both feet/ankles from the date of the incident.

                                                The patient had a previous reaction to a flu vaccine.  She was treated for Bell&#39;s Palsy related to the flu vaccine 3 years ago.  The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Around 4pm on January 14th, left upper arm began to swell and feel sore, becoming very painful, radiating down left arm and up left shoulder and had pins and needles in my left hand and could not really lift my left arm.  Around 5pm I began developing a headache.  At 6:30pm I developed a 101 degree fever, and took ibuprofen 600mg, my headache was more severe, I had chills, body aches and my left clavicle became swollen.  My heart was pounding and I felt short of breath.  The racing heart and breathing resolved by 8pm.  By 1am on January 15th my fever was 101.8, I had significant swelling in my left arm, left shoulder, back of my neck, upper back, and back of my head.  I had a severe headache.  I took ibuprofen 600mg at that time.  The swelling improved by 3am.  By 8:30 am my fever was 100.7.  I took 600mg of ibuprofen again and by 9:30am my temperature was 99.8 degrees.  I continue to have a mild headache and fatigue.

Tingling and numbness would switch from right side to entire face but mostly on right side.  Headaches and noticed increased heart rate two days after vaccine. One week after vaccine numbness and weakness extended down right arm and leg, able to move leg just felt &#34;weak&#34;.  I thought I was having a stroke or TIA. Made an appt. with the NP and she did full neuro exam and everything came back normal.  Also, made an appt. with my PCP.  Still continued to have headaches and weakness improved. Did get a COVID test since was still having headaches and it so long since vaccine, received test 1/12/2021 and it was negative. This past weekend was the 1st time I felt &#34;pre vaccine&#34; 17 days post vaccination. I am truly hesitant to take my 2nd dose scheduled on 1/26/2021.

The episode lasted 1-2 minutes.  I did not need assistance.    Then 2 -3 hours later I had the exact same episode and reported it to the downtown clinic and they only urged me to self monitor or report to ER if needed.  Those were the only 2 episodes.    My blood pressure was elevated that afternoon but was very low for 3 days and I did not take my atenolol for those days.

She had a nurse check her blood pressure and it was 101/65 and her heart rate was 138 bpm.  She felt presyncopal so she went to the ED for evaluation.  By the time she got to the ED, she felt her throat was scratchy, and when she would lie down flat she felt her throat was occluding.  She notes that she is s/p tonsillectomy in 12-2020, and considered whether that was playing a role in her symptoms, but she had not had any of those throat symptoms for 1 week prior to getting her COVID-19 vaccine.  In the ED, she was given IV medications and IV fluids.  ENT was consulted.  Her symptoms got better with medications, she is still experiencing some throat dryness but otherwise is feeling back to her usual self.  She never had any rash, flushing, itching.  She had a little tenderness at the injection site only.  She never had any difficulty breathing, lip/eye/tongue swelling, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, vomiting/diarrhea/abdominal pain.  She did have nausea when she felt vertigo.

I wear an Apple Watch and notice my heart rate was steadily climbing. I asked the exit secretaries to be seen by a nurse and as they were getting a nurse my heart rate reached 169 and I was feeling faint and beginning to shake. When the nurse came she noticed how white my hands were and my breathing was becoming labored. The nurse called a code white and an ICU nurse and respiratory specialist arrived to assess me. I thought I would pass out and they had me lay on my back with legs up. They tested my blood sugar and were assessing my vitals. My breathing was fast but I was still able to breathe. My heart rate started to slow down but remained somewhat high. they helped me into a wheelchair and escorted me to the emergency department. I was assessed for cardiac concerns and labs were taken. After a couple of hours in the ED the dizziness started to subside but I had excessive thirst and dry mouth and slightly swollen tongue. I had feeling of butterflies in my stomach off an on. My heart rate stabilized and I was cleared to go home after four hours.

Patient felt &#39;jittery&#39; and &#39;heart racing.&#39;  Was transferred to ED for evaluation given that patient reported her tongue &#39;getting tighter.&#39;  In the ED, the patient was treated with diphenhydramine 25mg x 2 doses, methylprednisolone 125mg x 1 dose, famotidine 20mg x 1 dose, and NS IV fluids.  Hypoglycemia was ruled out with CBG=87.  The physician avoided treatment with epinephrine due to it being listed on her allergy list with a reaction of &#39;shortness of breath.&#39;  Symptoms resolved over the next 3 hours.  The patient was discharged home with a new prescription of oral prednisone taper.  Subsequent follow-up with her primary care provider, in consultation with an ID provider, recommended that this patient NOT get a 2nd dose.  Covid-19 vaccine was added to her allergy list with a reaction of &#39;anaphylaxis.&#39;

From the time of injection until current, chills, intermittent low grade fever, headache and body aches different from my normal aches. Worse GI issues, memory issues worse than normal, feeling of disorientation at times, little difficulty catching my breath (only used rescue inhaler once). I felt a bit better about a week and a half post injection. But, then, started to feel worse, including vaccinated arm feeling heavy and sore again - February 27, 2021 - noticed reddish/ pink abnormal circle around injection site this is new, delayed, overall worse malaise, I felt a general feeling of yuck. I know it?s not a great descriptor, but, it kind of fits. Basically, lupusy, but worse.

                                                2am woke up with severe chills and a severe migraine. At 10am severe migraine progressed to skin on scalp feeling like it was pulled too tight. From there I began to feel an internal tremor in my head, almost like if you ran a jack hammer all day and then stopped, that shaky, off-kilter feeling.  I used the bathroom that morning and had massive diarrhea, experience a vaso/syncope episode and passed out.  All week I felt like this and experienced nausea, dizziness, heart palpitations, severe migraine, internal tremor, severe anxiety and severe thirst.  By Friday, 2/26/21, it got so bad and my blood pressure dropped to 112/50, that I was taken via ambulance to the ER.  They gave me IV fluids, ran labs, EKG, etc.  Blood pressure went up to 137/91.  Released to rehab at home.  2nd ER visit to Hospital on Sunday where they repeated labs, EKG, gave me fluids and treated symptoms. Both trips I was labeled Tachy.

                                                Have had tiredness since 2nd vaccine in February and noticed shortness of breath when walking or going up stairs in mid March.  Around 4/1, I started having left rib pain preventing me from sleeping on my left side and then could not breath during a massage on 4/8.   On April 9th, I was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms (clots) in both lungs, reducing my lung capacity to only 30% of normal.  This could be due to Loestrin birth control but I have taken hormones in the past for IVF and when younger for birth control.  The reaction may be due to a combination of vaccine, Loestrin and iron but triggered by vaccine.  I am currently on Eliquis to treat pulmonary embolisms.

I then had dizziness, nausea, unbalanced when walking, chest pain, feeling like my heart was racing,  palpatations, muscle weakness in my legs, and brain fog. The unbalanced feeling, dizziness, weakness ,and occasional palpatations remain. I had a covid test done on 1/6/2021.I had sinus pain started on 1/8/2021. I am being treated for possible sinus infection with Augmentin that I started on 1/11/2021 but my symptoms are still present . I have been unable to work because when I walk I feel dizzy and unsteady.  I have follow up with my primary doctor on 1/18/2021.

                                                Arm gradually became more painful. Difficulty driving with left arm at 8 p.m. Got into bed with chills. Around 3 a.m. woke with a massive headache, chills and sweats, joint and muscle pain. Went to the kitchen for a glass of water and to take Ibuprofen but almost blacked out. Sat on the floor and placed forehead on cold tiles because of sweats and nausea. Crawled to the couch and remained there until 8 a.m. Moved to bed. In and out of sleep with mild chills and sweats the rest of the day.

My blood pressure continues to be somewhat elevated and heart rate feels rapid at times. Also intermittent dizziness., along with other common post vaccination side effects.

                                                At first I was feeling dizzy, then the back of my throat felt itchy. EMS came over, and took my temperature, which was 98 degrees. Then I started to feel compression and pain in my ribs on both sides, and the middle of my chest - like an elephant was sitting on it, or I had a corset wrapped too tightly around my diaphragm. Then I started having uncontrollable coughing fits, followed by wheezing. EMS got me some ice packs for my ribs and the middle of my chest, but I had to get up and use the bathroom.  When I get anaphylaxis, I usually take two aspirin, a benadryl, a cetirizine, a CBD capsule, a famotidine, a 20 mg steroid pill, and a hydroxyzine pill - all at once. EMS agreed I should take it, and they gave me a shot of epinephrine in the arm. then they loaded me on to the ambulance, where I got a shot of steroid, and we went to the hospital in. EMS also started an IV for me. At the hospital, they gave me another shot of EpiPen, over 20 minutes after the first one, and a shot of Benadryl. by the end of 2 hours, my breathing was back to normal, and I was able to go home. Today I still feel a little bit dizzy, but mostly my arm is sore where I got the vaccination. I also still have a headache.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; Angioedema; Shortness of breath; Wheezing; Fast heart rate; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 44-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced an anaphylaxis reaction, angioedema, shortness of breath, wheezing, and increased heart rate.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 20 Jan 2021 at 18:00, approximately 10 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection, the patient began to have tongue swelling. She was given diphenhydramine and epinephrine by epi pen. She went to the emergency room where she displayed symptoms including a fast heart rate, wheezing, and shortness of breath with an angioedema or anaphylaxis like appearance. She was given more epinephrine, famotidine, scheduled diphenhydramine at 50 QAs intravenously (IV), IV steroids, was intubated and placed on a ventilator. She was on the ventilator for approximately 18-20 hours following admission. She eventually responded to a high dose of dexamethasone. She was also given duonebs for her shortness of breath, regular sedation for the ventilator, and a dose of ketorolac. Consent was given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events were unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44 year old female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred approximately 10 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration. She was treated with epinephrine, famotidine, diphenhydramine, IV steroids, intubated and placed on a ventilator.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

My blood pressure spiked, temperature spiked to 101, heart rate was elevated and continued to be elevated for about 12 hours, and there was a rash across my chest and upper arms. On 1/14, I was extremely tired. On 1/15, I had a sore throat, headache, and still slightly tired. As the days went on, the cold symptoms got progressive worse. Extremely congested, runny nose, extremely painful headache, coughing up pflegm, sore throat, etc. On Wednesday, 1/20 I had a fever of 101. I had these cold symptoms for a week and a half and that was when I called my doctor. She gave me an antibiotic.  I was on the antibiotic 1/26 - 1/30.  Today is 2/4 and I&#39;m still coughing.   Something weird also happened, smells changed.  My coffee smelled awful and other things seemed extremely strong.

                                                Approx. 14 hours after receiving the 1st part of Covid vaccine my arm became so sore I couldn&#39;t move it. It was sore from my neck down to just below my elbow. I began having chills and a low grade temp shortly after that. by 0130, I was dizzy, experiencing diarrhea, with episodes of diaphoresis, and acute nausea. I felt that I had some postural hypotension, was very pale and every time I would get up to walk I felt like I was going to end up on the ground. I remained in bed for approx. 16 hours before I felt like I comfortable even getting up and going to restroom. I still have intermittent dizziness, with syncope to this date.  I had to leave work early as well as calling in sick for the next shift.

                                                My left arm, where I received the shot, began hurting after a few hours. Approximately 12 hours after receiving the shot, fatigue began. Approximately two hours later, I was unable to walk, I collapsed on the floor, my heart was racing, I was sweating, my entire body went numb, and there was ringing and static in my ears. After about 20 minutes on the floor, I got back into bed. My fingers and hands wanted to curl up and not open and that lasted throughout the night. My arms and legs stayed numb all night long.  At around 24 hours post vaccine, the numbness started to subside, I could open my fingers and hands, and regular flu symptoms were present (fatigue, body aches, low grade fever). I could not work the day after receiving the shot. I slept all day. I was not able to drive until around 5PM the day after receiving the shot. The second night and throughout the following day (so 36-48&#43; hours post shot), I had cold sweats. It is now 3 days later and I still feel terrible. I am worried about getting the second Moderna shot.

                                                I had Covid-19 in December 2020. On the following day of my first vaccine, in the middle of the night, I experienced chills, body aches. At 7am the next day I woke up feeling light headed and passed out. When I woke up I had thrown up on myself and started to hear a whooshing sound in my ears and I went back to bed. At 9am my symptoms started all over again. I live with my house maid and since I did not look well, she took me to urgent care. My BP had dropped and I was super dizzy. I got an IV drip for an hour, anti-nausea medication. My blood was also drawn and found to have underlying anemia. My urine test was negative. The pulse oximetry was fine and by the next day I slowly started to feel better.

I still have leg achyness and dizziness that prompted me to call my doctor to note it in my chart. on March 1, 2021. I soaked my legs in an upsom salt bath for comfort.   I now have light bruises on my legs and some feet and left hand tingling/numbnes.  My heart rate is elevated at different times of the day with simple movement; walking to kitchen or bathroom. Some dizziness/brain fog at given moments throughout the day.

                                                Initially there were severe flu like symptoms: chills, shaking, headache &amp; body aches, fatigue starting apx 2 hours following. These continued until apx 24 hours later when additional mental fog set it, difficulty focusing attention, lethargy, trouble walking, dizziness then brief loss of consciousness occurred, extreme difficulty staying awake. I was taken to the emergency room where additional tests were done due to &#34;stroke- like&#34; symptoms.  Tests were okay with hospital staff reporting that likely/only known cause was the COVID  vaccine given the day before. Symptoms have gradually reduced but occasional mental fog, occasional dizzy spells &amp; chronic fatigue persist.

                                                First I got a headache, then I felt extra mucus in my throat. Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn&#39;t able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn&#39;t believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn&#39;t seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it&#39;s on record at the hospital that that&#39;s what happened the first time. It wasn&#39;t the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn&#39;t as good as last time, either. Apparently they&#39;ve been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn&#39;t offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that&#39;s what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there&#39;s a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I&#39;ll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we&#39;ll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it&#39;s taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot. I&#39;ve had problems breathing, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, flushing, fever/chills, and in general just felt like I had the flu.

                                                Slight right  facial numbness half hour post administration lasting 30 mins. Chills and Rt arm site pain and swelling on the first night. 2nd night, chills and increased swelling, pain to right arm site with slight weeping, warm to touch and redness. Throughout the first two weeks, I would have intermittent chills and right arm site redness, swelling, pain, warmth was gradually getting better but did not have any fever the first 13 days.  The night of 2/15/2021, I felt the chills, body aches and went to sleep. All night I felt I was about to get a fever. I was in bed until 1pm the next day on 2/16/21 when I started to have the severe tremors with my chills, back spasms, abdominal pain, and nausea. I got out of bed, took my temp and it was 101.5 F orally. I tried to take Tylenol but I could not because as soon as I sipped some water, I started vomiting yellow emesis first and then later on I was already vomiting greenish bile. I was getting weaker, lethargic and my tremors and chills were getting worst as well as my back spasms and abdominal pain. My husband, then brought me to the ER around 2:30-3pm. I was admitted in ICU for septic shock with unknown source on that day, 2/16/2021. I was on levophed drip via right chest central venous catheter for 48 hours and was given multiple antibiotics until discharged to home on 2/20/21. I developed red facial rashes more prominent to the right side on the second day of admission. Two days after discharge, I had headaches for two days with right shoulder pain. But, on the next day which was the 3rd day post hospitalization, I broke out with generalized reddened, raised, itchy and burning rashes. My husband brought me back to the ER on that day on 2/24/21. ER MD loaded me with dexamethasone steroid IV and Benadryl IV and sent me home with oral dexamethasone and anti-histamine orally. I saw my primary MD on 2/26/2021 for hospital follow up and referred me to Infectious disease MD and Endriconologist. On March 3rd, I was started on insulin SQ due to my blood sugars running 300?s to almost 400. As of now, my MD is still adjusting my insulin dosage due to persistent high blood sugar readings of 300-400 mg/dL.

Said they thought vertigo. That week pulse was going up and blood pressure spikes started. I also started to not see things as clear getting bad pressure in face and forehead. I then had ent do epley maneuver that helped with spinning. However feeling like I wanted to spin would still happen even though I wouldn?t spin. Headaches on and off everyday couldnt sleep right for weeks. Pulse and blood pressure still going up. Then I never had this anxiety that started. Heart doctor put me on a beta blocker that?s been helping. I am 8 weeks from first shot and still not myself. Been on beta blocker for a little over a week starting to feel better bc pressure and headaches are under control. I have been to neurologist also. No one can really explain. I did get the second dose bc doctor said to on Feb 24th. I was fine till I took the vaccine on Jan 27th

The nurse then administered the 2 doses of epinephrine and I came out of it. Afterwards I wasn&#39;t able to swallow for at least a few minutes.  Then the ambulance showed up took my vitals and administered a shot of 50 mg of benadryl.  I started feeling better on my way to the hospital.

Five minutes after injection on 3/31/2021, c/o chest tightness followed by nausea and heaving.  Treated for anaphylaxis, transferred by ambulance to Medical Center; and discharged to home later that afternoon.  The employee worked her regular schedule 4/2/21 and 4/5/21 with no stated complaints.  On 4/6/21, received notification from the Employee that she was to be off work through 4/12/21 as her physician feels that the vaccine has damaged her heart.  She states she has a heart rate down to 38 BPM, experiences black outs, has left sided head pain and weakness.  Her personal physician is scheduling her for Holter Monitor and Echocardiogram.  Her physician has now stated she cannot work through 4/16/21.  I have no supporting written documentation from the physician for these medical concerns.

After consulting the Nurses at the Vaccine site, I called my PTP and was told to go to ER.  I took 2 puffs of my Albuteral inhaler and drove myself to ER (about a mile).  I spent 3 hours in ER under observation where they did a blood test for multiple things that checked out fine, a Covid-19 test (negative) and listened to me hack for almost  2 hours.  I followed up with my PTP the next week, where she wasn&#39;t sure why I reacted the way I did as all lab work was normal.  She said to get the 2nd shot and see what happens.

Felt slightly tight in the throat.  Also experienced diarrhea twice within the 40 minutes following the vaccine.   The heart racing and faint feeling lasted about 5 minutes.  The throat tightness lasted closer to 1.5 hours, but was never severe- just noticeable.  Within 2 hours of the vaccine, was feeling much better.  Never experienced actual difficulty breathing.  I reported to employee health RN and personal physician.

                                                Patient had chest pain post administration of vaccine.  Patient attributed this to heartburn after eating a large meal just before getting her vaccine (though she didn&#39;t typically get heartburn). Since the pain continued to persist her BP was taken and was 160/110.  Patient said it may also be nerves but she didn&#39;t feel particularly anxious.  She also stated she hadn&#39;t had her BP medication that morning.  Patient took a couple of Tums and her BP was rechecked a few times.  Each time the BP stayed above what the patient said was her normal even without BP medication.  Due to the persistence of her hypertension and chest discomfort she was taken to the ED to be evaluated.  Once patient was in ED she had an EKG, CBC with diff, CMP, and troponin.  Provider eventually ruled it as an anxiety reaction (not cardiac related).

I went to the ER on 12/30/2020 due to continued tachycardia.  An EKG, chest xray, and blood was drawn, which showed slightly elevated troponin, stayed most of the night in the EC with second lab draws. I was given a prescription of metropolol 12mg to be taken twice a day for 14 days.  Went to see a cardiologist on 1/05/2021, another EKG was preformed along with an ECHO which was normal but was placed on a heart monitor to be observed for 30 days

Pt. evaluated by their in house medical team who administered a Benadryl injection to the right arm, unknown dosage. The pt. told me the nurse on staff measured her SPO2 at 86% and wanted to call 911 for transport to the ER. Pt. reports she refused and left work to come to the urgent care clinic where I evaluated her. She is concerned that she could be having a panic attack vs. allergic reaction. Her itching arm and metallic taste has resolved but she feels chest pains on the left side of her chest and her left arm feels heavy.

                                                A week later on dec 31, 2020 I began to feel fatigued, loss of appetite, chest and back burning. On Jan 4 2021 my bp and pulse were elevated, I had increased chest burning, headache and was admitted to the hospital to rule out MI.  The ct scan showed mild pancreatitis, endoscopy negative. I didn?t have a period for the month of Jan and I am neg for pregnancy. I continue to have esophageal, chest and back burning. I feel better now. I am scheduled to have my second vaccine Thursday Jan 21st and I am nervous. Not sure if this is an adverse reaction or coincidence.

Was completely weak and stayed in bed for about 10 hours following the vaccine.

                                                12 hours after my second dose I felt paresthesias in my extremities - particularly in my hands and feet - as well as my face. I also had chills and rigors. I felt lightheaded and nearly fainted.  Day 1 post vaccine: I had chills and rigors and the hand/feet paresthesias were persisting. I also felt heavy and weak.  Day 2 post vaccine: the chills had resolved but the hand/feet paresthesias were persisting as well and the generalized weakness got worse. I went to the ER and was sent home with instructions to follow up with neurology. That evening my hands became swollen and tight.  Day 3 post vaccine: the weakness improved but the paresthesias were persisting. I went to work and on my drive home a I felt electric jolts throughout my body but especially my extremities - which caused me to shake. The rigors came back and I also had abdominal pain. Day 4 post vaccine: I still felt similar symptoms but milder than the night before. I got evaluated and tested for covid which was negative. Labwork and U/A were also negative. The symptoms resolved that evening but the paresthesias were persisting and started to become more painful. I had an MRI of my brain and spine which were negative. Day 5 post vaccine: The paresthesias had become more painful. I was started on Lyrica by my neurologist. Day 6 post vaccine: I felt chest pressure and a globus sensation in my chest, weakness, and jolts in my extremities. The dysthesias in my extremities were persisting. I was evaluated by my neurologist had an EMG which was normal and was diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy. I was told to continue Lyrica and titrate the dose up until the symptoms resolve. Day 7 post vaccine:  I have been having heaviness, jolts in my extremities and face, and dysthesias in my hands and feet for most of the day. Lyrica helps a little.  Throughout the entire time I have also had intermittent paresthesias in my face and jolts of pain in my face at times.  I also had paresthesias in my face and intermittent dysthesias in my extremities 7-10 days after my first Moderna dose. Symptoms got a lot worse after the second one. Given the timing I am concerned that these symptoms are vaccine-related.

At 6pm,  started with feelings of being flushed all over body with tingling in extremities to include face, tongue, throat felt like it began to swell with voice beginning to get raspy. Begininng of chest tightness. By 7pm  marked shortness of breath with increased chest tightness, more difficulty swallowing , raspy voice and oxygen saturations dropped to low 90&#39;s . Complete activity intolerance. Injection site had rash extending over entire upper arm and  forearm that was hot, raised and painful.  Took 50mgs Benadryl, multiple doses of rescue inhaler (albuterol) due to difficulty breathing following by steroid based inhaler (3 doses).  Sx continued through night and slowly improved. At 5 am took another 25mgs of Benadryl and took repeated doses of albuterol and steroid inhaler for 48 hours. (normally don&#39;t use at all). Oxygen saturation level returned to normal within 8 hours. Rash resolved with persistent Benadryl use x 2 days.  Due to lack of insurance coverage did not go to ER for Tx as recommended. I am a front line nurse so monitored at home.  Contacted MD via messaging system  MD has stated I cannot receive vaccine number 2 due to risk for complete anaphylaxis.   Was notified my Lot was same lot OHA put notice out as having higher incident of vaccine reaction.

I felt pretty okay except for the feeling of my arm hot and fuzzy and fuzzy fingers on my left hand until my &#34;leave time&#39; of 10:03 am. I stayed a little longer, and was home by 10:30 when I became extremely nauseous, dry heaving, left side of face numb. Headache started at 10:40. Tried calling medical facility but was on hold for soo long- no one answered so since I don&#39;t have insurance I decided to just rest and drink fluids. By 11:40 my face was back to normal, no longer nauseous but extremely lethargic and was the rest of the day. The following day I felt ok -slight swelling on my arm at injection site and a bruise that I still have.

Patient began to drive home when she started to notice tingling in her lips, feeling flushed, and then as though her throat was closing. She contacted 911 and they responded road side.  Patient was initially being monitored only, then her BP dropped. Decision was made to transport patient to ED. En route she received epinephrine and was placed on O2 by way of non-rebreather mask.  Upon arrival to the ED patient continued to be dyspneic. She was given solumedrol, benadryl, Pepcid, and mag. Patient was stabilized and no additional epi was required.  Patient was admitted to hospital in observation status.  She was stable overnight. She did have one episode of itching and nausea, she was given diphenhydramine and Zofran and these symptoms resolved. Patient was monitored until around 1PM the day after event and was released to home in stable condition.

                                                Within about 45 minutes of receiving the vaccine I started getting mild hives spreading around the injection site and across my belly. I had mild wheezing and feeling of loose fluid in my brachial area of my chest. Now at 24 hr out, hives are head to toe, and I took diphenhydramine at bedtime in addition to my loratadine each AM.  I&#39;ve used my inhaler twice to see if that helped - it doesn&#39;t, so it&#39;s not a regular asthma attack.  Today I have intermittently dealt with mild sweats, moderate chills, mild nausea, shakes (might be the inhaler as that sometimes makes me shake), headache fluxing between mild to moderate, eyes watering and lids swollen slightly with hives, injection site soreness, swelling about the diameter of a softball (interfering with ROM on left arm - I am an interpreter, so this interfered with work a lot today!), left arm from shoulder to elbow is hot to the touch, and I have had mild disconnects with my ability to focus/breaks in completing thoughts today.    I am keeping my EpiPens close, just in case.  I live 3 miles to the nearest ER, and someone is here with me just in case I need to go.

                                                I have had a fever that keeps topping 99.5 (avg was 100.1) since Friday night. (It is Monday night) My entire body still hurts. As I write this it is currently 99.3. I normally run low at around 97. 99.3 is high for me and feels pretty crappy.  I have had some heart palpitations. Some of the worst chills I?ve ever had. A few dizzy spells. Fatigue. My arm still REALLY hurts. I?m dehydrated and keep having muscle cramps (I?m drinking lots of water and pedialyte). You need to know how people are reacting to this. This is day 4. I have no energy. I do NOT feel good.

                                                I am quoting this from my mother as she is currently unable to type due to the shaking and shivering. &#34;It started with red hot places on both arms, and then it moved to my face. 2 1/2 hours later I began getting really nauseated and began shaking/shivering uncontrollably. I then went to urgent care and on the way there my heart was pounding and racing. After I was admitted they told me that I had tachycardia and my blood pressure was high (I do not usually have high blood pressure). They did an EKG at urgent care and noticed small changes. I was then sent to the ER and was given IV Benadryl and oral steroids. I was put on a heart monitor, and they were able to get my heart rate to go down, but a few hours later it jumped back up. At that point I was referred to a cardiologist and given a prescription for steroids, and then I was discharged. I saw the cardiologist 2 days later, during those two days I still experienced red hot spots on my arm, shortness of breath, Tachycardia, and shivering. When I went to the cardiologist, they did another EKG and said I still have tachycardia and did some bloodwork. The results of the bloodwork were normal and the cardiologist diagnosed it as an unspecified delayed severe allergic reaction. I am still experiencing symptoms and still having to use Benadryl and steroids.&#34;

In 12 hour time span I had to report to ER 3 times to try to stop the bleeding.  On the third visit ENT was called in and I had emergent surgery to stop the bleeding.  I spent the night in the hospital.  I lost about 4 or 5 units of blood. I have never had nose bleeds like this in the past.

Zofran and Toradol were given along with 1 liter of normal saline. Symptoms subsided for approximately 2 hours and then returned. Doctor ordered a CT scan which indicated free fluid in the abdomen along with possible small bowel obstruction. During this time I (the patient) also experienced unusual hypertension along with hyperglycemia and was transported to hospital, for a diagnostic laparotomy. Findings of the surgery were reactive fluid in the abdomen along with an inflamed bowel.  Hypertension remained days after even when given medication to help lower it and continues at this time. I (the patient) have never had a history of hypertension. Never have I had any previous surgery&#39;s or abdomen related issues.

                                                The evening (3/20/21)I received the vaccine I noticed fatigue, headache and chills. The next morning I developed shortness of breath. The day after that my left left began swelling for no reason, was slightly discolored and warm to the touch. As the week went on my shortness of breath became greater and my leg more swollen. On (3/26/21) I sent to the ER by my doctor. Had a ultra sound and discovered an extensive DVT in my left groin down to behind left knee. Had a CT and discovered blood clots in my lungs. I had never had any underlying health conditions or been on medications, don&#39;t smoke, no complaints prior. Was transported to hospital spent 2.5 days in ICU before being moved to a regular bed for a total of (4) days hospitalized. The doctor installed two sheaths on each side of groin, injected my lungs with medication to blast/dissolve the clots and installed a filter in the main artery to catch any clots that may break away from leg. I was also put on a Heparin drip while in ICU. The next day the doctor went and the procedure was a success dissolving the clots. He removed the sheaths. I went back to ICU. The next day (3/28/21) a second utlra sound was done to left leg and DVT is still in left leg. Have been described Eliquis blood thinner.

Approximately two weeks after the vaccine shot, on 4/4, I lost feeling and went numb on my entire right side, from my head to my feet.  I had no pain other than dizziness, my face did not droop but my tongue was numb.  In the ER they took my blood pressure, and it was 251/112 or so. It was extremely high.  Also, my numbness was intermittent, it would last about 10 minutes and then slowly go away, then a couple of hours later, it might come back.  Saturday 4/3 it occurred about 4 times, on Sunday 4/4, it occurred about twice while in the hospital. I was released to home the evening of 4/4. On Monday it occurred about 1 time.

She was coherent and talking and said she felt nauseated and we moved her back to the clinic room and had her lie down on the carpet with her feet elevated. A few minutes went by and she reported that she felt her skin was hot and tingly.  We called for emergency services and began to attempt to take her bp. Pt appeared normal and reported no issues with her airway. She was speaking normally and answering question  appropriately.  The paramedics arrived and monitored her bp while lying down, sitting and standing. Her bp presented as elevated with tachycardia. Paramedics performed a blood glucose test which showed a low reading within normal limits. Patient reported not having eaten since breakfast. Pt&#39;s o2 saturation was &#34;excellent&#34; and she declined transport to hospital when offered by paramedics. No drugs were administered by pharmacy nor paramedics.

                                                Following the vaccine I was slightly dizzy, after 25 minutes my chest started to get tight, had difficulty breathing, racing heart rate, some constriction in the throat.  I was taken to the ER, used Proair inhaler on the way to ER to ease breathing,  O2 sat slightly decreased but returned to normal in the ER.  Due to difficulty breathing, I had some increased anxiety which lessened after breathing became easier.  Nebulizer treatment given in the ER.  Benadryl 25mg taken.  Rash on L arm and upper chest, burning and pain in L arm.  Benadryl taken for 2 days due to returning rash and burning in arm.  Nebulizer treatments every 4 hrs on the day of the vaccine due to continued tightness and difficultly breathing.  The following day I had fatigue, slight fever, pain of 7 out of 10 in L arm, headache, neck and muscle pain.  Followed up w/ primary care physician on 12/29/2020, he advised not to take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  L arm pain lessened to 4 out of 10 on 12/30/2020.  L arm pain dissipated on 12/31/2020, but headache, neck pain and fatigue continued through 1/1/2021

                                                After taking Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA: About 10 minutes after injection, I noticed a slight lightheadedness, slightly increased heart rate yet I was already anxious, and a very faint tingling in lower lip and end of tongue. Between 1-2 hours after injection, I noticed a little bit of a scratchy throat,  increased thirst, and mild headache. No treatment required.  I took Benadryl and Tylenol when I returned home from my shift at work about 4 hours after the injection. The next day, 1/3/21, scratchy throat had disappeared.  I felt tired, slight fever of 99.5, increased thirst, and very sore arm.   On 1/4/21, I just have slightly sore arm and a little tired with no fever.  I took Tylenol.

This only lasted for approximately a minute. I sat and waited for about 30 minutes before I left. When I got into my vehicle I noticed that my chest was really tight and I called my husband to talk to me while I drove home. After arriving home and not feeling like my chest tightness was a normal symptom I called my daughter who is an RN and she checked my vitals which were fine. She told me that I should continue to self monitor and if I got any worse to go to the ER. My symptoms chest tightness did not get any worse and felt a little better by the time I went to bed between 10-11pm. The next morning I woke up to get ready for work and felt a lot of the common symptoms like:  Fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and my arm was sore. The highest fever that I recorded was 102.4.  I still have a fever as I am filling out this form. It is 100.2 and I took 2 Motrin an hour and a half ago.

                                                Two hours after the injection, I started to not feel &#34;right.&#34;  My head felt heavy, I was getting a little dizzy and all I wanted to do was to lie down.  By the third hour, my body completely shut down.  I was so tired I had no energy to move, to talk, and even breathing was difficult (not because I couldn&#39;t breathe, just that the effort was difficult).  I was dizzy, nauseous, and lost my appetite.  My temperature was elevated, 98.5, but no fever.  I slept for 5 hours as if in a coma.  Woke up to drink water, felt total-body aches, and slept the rest of the night again getting at least 12 more hours of sleep.  At some point during the night, I had chills so bad my body was shaking uncontrollably.  I had 2 layers of clothes and 3 layers of blankets and could not warm up.  Day #2 (today), I have a tremendous headache, dizzy, nauseous, my heart rate is abnormally fast and I am out of breath.  My resting heart rate is typically upper 50&#39;s and is currently averaging in the 70&#39;s, jumping into the 90&#39;s often.   Sitting up, my heart rate is between 80-100 (which is typically my rate when I exercise).  When I stand up or walk to the other room, my heart rate is around 115-120 (typical of when I am running/sprinting or participating in taxing exercise).  Along with this, I am out of breath as if I am exercising, although I am barely moving around. All I am doing is laying down, only getting up to go to the bathroom and my body feels like I ran a marathon.  Breathing is difficult even at rest.

                                                Just prior to 5P had left arm pain -that traveled to my hand. At 5PM driving and heart rate went 128 - most likely higher (registered on iwatch). This is abnormal for me as my heart rate is typically in high 40&#39;s (marathon runner).  Along with the rapid heart rate felt like throat was closing - like a reaction caused by an allergy.  The rate rate stayed like that for about a minute or two followed by severe chills (chills can be described like when a person comes out of the OR).  I felt like I was coming out of my skin and became dizzy. I became nervous and called 911.  In discussion with the 911 dispatch everything subsided and decided I would continue driving with an intent to going to Hospital.  About 10 minutes later, prior to getting onto I95 the same cycle with increased heart rate followed by chills occurred again for about the same timeframe.  I do not know how far apart the cycle was occurring other than I ended up calling 911 again and Ambulance was dispatched while I was on I95 and I had pulled over.  Approx arrival of ambulance was about 6P Once in the back of the ambulance, I showed no arrhythmia and heart rate was now in the 70&#39;s, however I was still having the chills.  Decided to drive home after waiting about 20 minutes in the back of ambulance with no further issues of the tachycardia. Once I was home I continued with chills and a high fever throughout the night.  The fever did not go away until about 48 hours. The chills went away by the following morning. Thursday and Friday have had chest tightness and the feeling of needing to take large breaths to expand chest.  Continue to have moderate headache.

The vomiting continued and she then passed out and became diaphoretic. 911 was called and she was transported to the emergency room. I later spoke with a nurse at the ER and tests were being ran. She said they did not feel it was vaccine related. She did say the doctor said she had a panic attack.

                                                During the 15 minute observation period post-vaccination, patient was noted to have hives on her neck. Patient was taken to ER. Arrival Vital Signs were WNL. Patient c/o itching, erythema, swollen tongue, changed voice, breathing &#34;a little tight&#34;.  Epinephrine and DuoNeb ordered. Seizure like episode at 02.04.21 at 1240 BP 209/81, HR 111, RR 24, Pulse Ox 100% on 15% Non-rebreather mask, Rectal temp 98.4 ED MD wrote:  &#34;At approximately 12:40pm this afternoon the patient was having what appeared to be a seizure versus severe rigors.  She was not verbally responsive and appeared to be apneic with her head shaking in her arms flailing rigidly in an up and down motion.  Symptoms lasted approximately less than 2 minutes and patient was not postictal.  She was not incontinent.  Blood sugar is in the 180s and her rectal temp is normal.  I believe this patient is having a severe reaction to her moderna vaccine that she received earlier today.  Her 1st vaccine was January 7th and today was her 2nd vaccine for COVID.&#34;  Teleneurology consult conducted, no documented recommendations. Patient was transferred to higher level of care.

O2 saturation initially marginal (87% on RA), corrected with 6 Liters of NC supplemental oxygen. BP stable in the 140-160&#39;s/80&#39;s range. HR initially in the 90s, then fluctuated between 100-120&#39;s subsequently. She was observed for 30 minutes, during which time she had 5 episodes of intermittent tachypnea, c/o feeling hot, dizzy and chest tightness. Patient states that she has h/o anxiety and ADHD, taking Adderall and Prozac. She had prior anxiety attacks but this one does not feel like anxiety per patient.

                                                Fatigue - I was unable to work that day. I was so tired. Pain - in my arm to the point that when I moved my arm I felt like I was going to pass out - it hurt that bad. I felt nauseous like I would vomit. I didn&#39;t vomit. Had a headache on day two (I have been having headaches since I had COVID in July 2020). I took Tylenol for that severe headache and that helped and it was just that one day that it was severe.  The worst, was my heart - increased heart rate - anything I did just was difficult on my heart. My heart - was having a hard time - standing, brushing my teeth - was exhausting for my body. That type of exhaustion went on for five days. I was able to feel better by day 11. But my heartrate is still poor. Depending upon what I did - 10 to 30 beats over my normal - just normal work. 40 beats over when I&#39;m attempting a more intense exercise. A slight jog puts my heartrate to 180. My heart rate still hasn&#39;t subsided yet - it is still above average above post COVID ( I had COVID in July of 2020). My heart rate was still at an elevated rate post COVID but worse after the vaccine. I have chest pressure now - like someone sitting on my chest - that started day two after the vaccine. Even when I&#39;m resting, I have chest pressure - it comes and goes and there seems to be no pattern as to why. Didn&#39;t have a doctor visit this second time yet. I treated with Tylenol for the pain at the injection site and for that headache and then I just rested my body.

My entire rib cage, inside and out were on a complete flare that I have never felt before. It was hard to breath, not shallow or during extent of deep breath, but in between the two. I was getting false chest pains as the intercostal pain over the chest would flare. This was constant pain that started within 12 hours of the dose. It resolved to about 90% by day 20, however I still have lingering intercostal pain. This may be a flare of my lyme reacting to the vaccine. It is still worth it to get dose 2, but I am not looking forward to the AE&#39;s.

                                                2.5 hours after injection I started feeling weird, clammy cold sweats, nauseous and it felt like my eyes were bulging or like an intense pressure behind my eyes, blurry eyesight, extreme headache.  I have not ever had any issues with my blood pressure only my diabetes.  It had recently been slightly elevated but controlled mostly. I knew it was high and it suddenly just came on even after not eating at that time. I proceeded to flush with alot of water and some walking to bring it down. I wasn&#39;t exactly sure of how high it got because I don&#39;t normally have to bring my tester to work with me. However as soon as I got home I tested it and even after heavy flushing and exercise my glucose level was down to 500. It has never been that high ever. I continued to flush and monitor and not eating due to nausea and headache I was taken to the hospital. At that time my glucose reading was at 400. I was given 10 units of novolog as well as 1 full bag of fluid thru an IV.  And before I was discharged it had come down to 192.  I have only had to have insulin 1 time since 2008-9. Since then my sugar is refusing to come down below 250. My vision is still not clear and I am now attempting to keep it down with 15 units of a fast acting insulin multiple times a day. I will also be starting metformin again as of tomorrow morning to also help bring it down to a more healthy level due to the possibility of another life altering stroke.

                                                Patient&#39;s received 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine Friday 3/12.  Her husband reported she had not unexpected fatigue,  malaise, and fever for 1 day but better after that.  On Monday she began complaining of shortness of breath.  This progressively worsened and she started having presyncopal episodes.  On Saturday she was unable to come down the stairs in the house so husband planned to take her to the hospital but she stood up and passed out and woke up quickly.  He decided to call EMS.  By the time she presented to our hospital she was cyanotic and agonal breathing.  On moving her from EMS stretcher to ED bed she had PEA cardiac arrest.  She underwent mechanical device CPR with only brief (&lt;1 min) ROSC x1.  She at some point did have a shockable rhythm.  Cath lab was notified and she was taken emergently to the cath lab with ongoing mechanical device CPR.  Peripheral VA ECMO was placed after about 1.5 hours.  Pulmonary angiogram was done which showed massive saddle PE with near complete obliteration of the right pulmonary tree and some filling defects in the left tree as well.  At that time she had severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 24.  She also had no gag or corneal reflex, minimally responsive pupils, and no response to noxious stimuli.  Mechanical thrombectomy was attempted with some result.  She was transferred to the SICU with increasing pressor requirement, and DIC.  Ultimately, the venous catheter of the ECMO circuit malfunctioned thought to be secondary propagating IVC thrombosis.  Family decided to withdraw care and she passed away.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving injection in right arm I felt a BOOM flush all over my body like I just had an IV Contrast.  Then I became dizzy, my heart started racing, I started cold sweats and felt tightness in my mid upper chest to the base of my throat.  The ED RN on site took my BP and HR and had me lie down because I felt that I couldn&#39;t breath.  She called paramedics who took my BP and HR, then did a 12 lead EKG.  They transported me to the ED.  I was worked up for cardiac, lung, chemistry.  My troponin-HS was slightly elevated and a cardiologist was called.  He did an echo on my heart, liver and right kidney -- normal.  Chest X-ray was normal.  A second 12 lead EKG was done, normal sinus.  Hematology, Chemistry was normal.  Was in the ED from 11:30 to 4:00 p.m.  Advised by ED Doctor, and Cardiologist, that it seems the stress of the anaphylaxis reaction stressed the heart which caused the spill of troponin.  Advised to see my cardiologist and get a stress test.  I have already informed my Primary Care Doctor and he has prescribed me an EPI-PEN to carry.  I have no history of allergic reactions/anaphylaxis reactions to vaccines.  I am up to date with all other vaccines and just had my yearly flu shot in November 2020.  This was my first allergic reaction/anaphylaxis reaction to a vaccine.

I needed help to get up as I was so dizzy, weak and in so much pain, I was able to get into bathroom and at that time had pain with urination.  I was able to eventually fall asleep and woke in the morning (1/21) with severe back and flank pain, pain on entire skin surface that increased with touch, fever 100.2, chills, severe nausea, extreme dizziness, weakness, exhaustion, brain fog, left foot numbness, and pain with urination. I slept most of day unable to function normally at all, did call my MD office to get a script for zofran which did help the nausea, later this evening I started to get what appeared like a heat rash across my trunk, I took Benadryl 50 mg and went to sleep.

                                                Within five minutes after receiving vaccine I felt very anxious and I could feel my heart rate go up. The medical staff came over amd took my vitals and blood pressure went up. My heart rate as in the 150?s amd my blood pressure went up to 154/ I can?t remember the bottom number. My head felt tight in my forehead area and my head felt foggy.  They had me do deep breathing and within 15 minutes I felt normal. So I am not sure if my anxiety took over because was extremely scared prior to getting the vaccine or if it was a combination of anxiety amd a reaction. I am scared to get the second one. They said I will have to sit for an hour after the second one. I left the facility after a half hour and felt fine. The next day I felt chest tightness amd my head felt tight. But again not sure if it is anxiety combined.

At approximately 2 p.m., I felt like I was going to pass out while seated at my desk doing some computer work, my alarm on my Apple Watch went off stating that my heart rate was in excess of 110 bpm while at rest- I checked and my heart rate was 143 bpm.  I felt heart flutters and nausea increased as did the headache.  I went home once I was able to drive after the event and my heart rate came down some.  I had heart palpitations and flutters for the next couple of hours.  I rested in the bed for the rest of the afternoon and evening.  I took Advil and Zofran.  I felt better, but still very fatigued around 9 p.m.  The next day I had none of the symptoms except for some fatigue.

                                                I felt impaired  (similar to being intoxicated) about a half hour to an hour later.  I had trouble saying some words., like my brain and my mouth weren?t communicating effectively.  My heart was racing at times and I was  a little short of breath. All of this subsided a few to a couple hours later. I then just became extremely fatigued,  sometimes light headed, with a slight headache and back ache. My arm hurts a little, but not near as bad as shot one. I ended up taking two days off of work to sleep and recover.

These progressed until awakened around 10:30pm and fainted on floor after urinating. Woke up several minutes later vomiting. Nausea and severe body aches continued until the following morning, when they started to subside. Resolved completely the following day, around 48 hours post injection. Mild fatigue in the following days.

I slept poorly but didn&#39;t realize until I got up in the morning that my heart rate was off. I wear a fit watchand it told me my heart rate was above resting 97% of the night (its usually below resting 97% of the night). My heart rate increased to 140  when I got up in the morning. I called my doctor who told me what to do to try and reduce the bpm and when to go to the ER if needed.  I stayed in bed all day and laying down I was able to keep my bpm in the 90&#39;s (about 20 bpm higher than usual) I experienced the other expected flu like side effects and headache as well.  24 hours after the side effects started, they began to decrease and for the next 24 hours I felt only slightly ill and my bpm resting was about 10 bpm over my usual. The next day  (2/14/21) I felt 100% myself and my heart rate was back to normal.

They took me back to the observation room with a nurse.  At about 28 minutes, voice changed very raspy, chest tightness worse, I could not stop coughing and a very mottled rash on the arm of injection.  I was kind of out of it, like wanted to answer questions but really had to think about what I was trying to say and hard to find the answers.

I told the attendant I felt sick and a nurse listened to my heart which was beating at 130 beats per minute, and took my blood pressure (153/94) .After noting my elevated heart rate and blood pressure I still couldn?t catch my breath and was given oxygen by EMS and taken to the local Emergency room.  In the ER my heart rate returned to normal after a few hours, and my blood pressure returned to normal as well.

Subsided before leaving ED, but returned in more mild state the next day - managed by OTC Benadryl and allergy meds. Symptoms returned again at approx 39 hours and returned to Emergency Department again for more IV medications. Asthma attacks - started in the Emergency Department on first day and have continued to today 3/3/2021. Prior to vaccination, I used inhaler approx 1x every 60 days at most.  Have gone more than a year without using one.  After vaccination, used inhaler the same evening and then 12 times the next day, and several times before going to ED again, and have had to use it daily since.  This morning 3/3/2021, woke at apprise 2:30-3:00 am with an attack that needed 2 doses to subside, and then again at 8:30 this am about 1.5 hours after waking.  Burning on tongue with sores on outer sides, metallic/burning/no taste - began 20 minutes after vaccination continuing to today. Rash on face - began in Emergency Department on first day and continues to today. Began using Cortizone yesterday 3/3/2021. Rash and hives on neck, chest - began in Emergency Department on first day and subsided next day after allergy medications in ED and OTC allergy medications that night. Headache - sudden onset 25 minutes after vaccination.  Returned that evening after first ED visit. Returned the following day. Returned the third day. Subsided the fourth day. Used ibuprofen and acetaminophen to manage.

                                                Immediately after shot: I felt some pain &amp; burning at injection sight. In general felt a little off, but nothing significant. After observation period, on the drive home, I began to &#34;taste&#34; the shot, as did my husband who received vaccine right after me. Then, my face felt a little funny, and my jaw felt tight, but no visible swelling. Then I felt a rush of burning sensation throughout my chest and abdominal region. After arriving home, 20 minutes later, I felt a little nauseated, but not bad. An hour later, I was unable to eat dinner, as I felt ill. I felt like I had a mild fever and I was shivering with chills. While trying to sleep, the chills continued. I then experienced unusual frequent urination, every 2 to 3 hours. I had no consumed abnormal amounts of liquid, but my urine was nearly clear, which was odd. After returning to bed after the first time urinating, my heart rate became very fast and I felt like I had a hard time finding my pulse in my neck, which is unusual for me.   The day after the vaccination I experience headache, a lot of tenderness around injection sight and arm muscle pain making it very painful to make certain movement, like putting on my top and reaching for objects. That evening I experience some muscle aches.   These symptoms have improved now that it is day three after the vaccination. I still have a mild headache and pain at injection sight.

                                                2/5 I received the 1st does of Moderna. The next day I had a massive headache. As the days went on my neck started to heart. The days continued and my back started to hurt. I thought my pain was just radiating down my back from my neck. ON 2/12 I have record of going to the pharmacy to get Lidocain patches. I continued on with pain from neck to middle of back. I made appointments with chiropractor and went there complaining that my back and ribs were out. This continued. On 3/5 I got the 2nd dose. I reacted as expected but this went on for 4 days. Went to a convenient care clinic where the dr ordered chest xray and D-DImer for suspected PEs. I got a call immediately to go to ER as my D-Dimer was high at 4.3. I went back to Local ER and had a CT Scan. The CT scan showed MULTIPLE PEs with infarct. I was admitted. SInce then I have been back to the ER and still struggling and have many tests coming up. My pulse is consistantly tachycardia. The ER docs do not want to entertain the thought that is was the vaccine because i was a smoker and on hormone replacement therapy. HOWEVER, I smoked for over 30 years and was on that HRT for almost 3 and never showed any signs of a clotting issue. I can pinpoint with pictures, and bank records of when the pain started and it reflects back to the 1st dose.  Who knows but after the 2nd does and out of the hospital I struggled with covid symptoms including the &#34;foggy&#34; head and that continues as well as other health related PE issues.  They may not want to contribute it to the vaccine but I know when this all started and it does need to be reported incase others. I have a whole story to tell that doesn&#39;t cover in writing!

                                                I got the vacine today.  Unfortunately I did have a reaction, and had to cancel my patient load at work for the day.  They said if you have food allergies you might have one, but I was willing to risk it.  They observed me for 30 min after.  After 15 min it felt like I was having a mild panick attack, but I?m used to that so I just breathed through it.  Coughed a few times.  After 30 min got up and was whoozy/dizzy, but shrugged it off, got my card and walked slowly to my car, drove 5 min home.  By then my hands were shaking hard.  It was like being shot with a crapload of adrenaline.  I called my sister and when I talked I started sobbing.  I don?t know, I just couldn?t stop.  But I knew it was just the adrenaline and if I could calm down, I?d get thru it.  She was awesome bc she kept her voice soft and low when she spoke, which helps.  After 3 hours it has calmed down and I?m just really cold and exhausted and nauseous and only a little shaky.  Being quiet and calm is helping.  Also sitting on a heating pad bc it?s 74 in my apartment and I?m freezing cold.  I?ll be ok by end of day.  I got the Moderna vacine and I?m still glad I did and thankful I could get it....but to those who are getting it...symptoms are that it feels like being shot full of adrenaline, you get a panic attack, but my O2 actually went up, not down.  Chest pain, panting, high anxiety, shaking, nausea, dizziness.

                                                I went to bed Friday night around 10:00PM.  I woke around 12:30AM with a throbbing headache, sore throat, post-nasal drainage, body aches, chills, fever, sweating, weakness and nausea.  I went down to use the bathroom and then back to bed but could not sleep due to the throbbing headache and chills.  I got back up around 2:30AM and soaked in a warm bath.  I went back to bed around 4:30AM.  I was able to go to sleep.  I slept until around 8:30AM.  At that time, I drank some water and went back to sleep.  I slept until approximately 10:30AM and started drinking Powerade Zero.  The Powerade was taken to bed and sipped on when I would stir and change positions.  I slept until approximately 2:30PM, when I got up to use the bathroom.  I urinated, washed my hands and went to walk out of the bathroom when everything went black.  I remember yelling for my husband but then nothing else until I heard him yell my name several times and I was lying on the floor in the doorway of the bathroom.  I passed out.  I was sat up in the recliner and monitored.  Above symptoms continued.  Tylenol and Motrin were alternated every 4 hours for the fever.

                                                I woke up the next morning (about 6am) with nausea/chills/fever (100.9)/headache/eyes were burning. I had to go to ED after getting to work(at 7:30am) due to SOB/elevated heart rate of 145-150bpm/101.6 temp (upon arrival to ED)/chills/nausea/headache. I was given IV fluids (2 liters), Zofran for nausea, Toradol for pain/headache, Tylenol for fever. I was in the ED for about 4-4 1/2 hours. My right eye has a large &#34;blood shot&#34; area that wasn&#39;t there until I took the vaccine also. I was found to still have a count of &#34;34&#34; on my Covid antibody blood test. The ED physician stated that was probably the reason I had the reaction was because I still had antibodies. I tested positive for Covid on Sept 19, 2020 and took the vaccine #1 1/11/2021 (almost 120 days from positive Covid test). If I had known I was going to have any type of reaction because I still had antibodies, I would have waited a few more weeks/months to get the vaccine. This should really be looked into. I am now very scared to receive the 2nd vaccine because of the side effects that has been reported after the 2nd vaccine. I really need good advice about what to do about 2nd vaccine.

She was immediately sent to the Hospital ED and repeat CBC confirmed the critically low platelet count.  She is currently hospitalized and she has received platelet transfusions but her platelet count is still critically low.

                                                7 days after  vaccine administration, my right shoulder began itching and several large red welts appeared. I took Benadryl before bed and that alleviated some itching. The following morning I had a 4 inch by 6 inch area of redness like a sunburn on my shoulder. The skin is hot. My husband who is a physician described the area as indurated. I was able to go to work. I used ice packs for the itching because Benadryl is sedating. Friday evening the shoulder continued to be red and indurated and hot. Saturday AM the shoulder has a center area of white with decreased sensation of hardness. There is a dull ache and the skin is hot.

                                                Approximately seven hours after the vaccine was given, I started to get a headache. The HA was followed by extreme fatigue (around 2000). I went to bed with vaccine site pain (8/10), some chest pain (3/10) and back pain (7/10). I awoke about midnight (2400) with nausea and felt like a syncopal episode was imminent. My BP at the time was 115/75, HR of 75 (baseline is 125/75). I drank some water and elevated my feet. About 0230 on 1/24/21 another episode hit, with a corresponding BP of 105/72, HR 80. Again I elevated my feet and drank a glass of water. A third episode hit around 0600 with a BP of 96/65, HR of 87. I elevated my feet, drank a glass of water, ate something and considered going to the hospital.  I began to feel a little better. That was the last episode. The nextday on 1/24/21 I felt fatigued and weak with unusual pains occurring throughout my body (5/10). By 1/25/2021 I was feeling pretty normal and went back to most activities (I did a short, flat walk instead of my usual 45-minute treadmill incline).

Ttoday is day 10 - I just took another claritin although it&#39;s feeling much better today and redness and heat are almost gone.

Prior to the seizure they said that she was &#34;feeling off&#34;, &#34;jittery&#34;, and &#34;misfiring&#34;.  The RN that notified me said that they were checking on her every hour and the last check in was at 1:00 PM. She went to check on her at 2:00 PM when she found her in the hallway very pale/gray, bradycardic, and hypotensive. The nurse said she appeared to be postictal and hallucinating. They immediately called 911 -and she was transferred to the hospital and to my knowledge she is still there. RN will keep me updated.

                                                I had extreme pain at the injection site that afternoon that then included my arm from elbow to top of my shoulder.  That pain continued with the area very hot and difficult to lift my arm (which continued until Saturday, 1/30/21.)  After being asleep, I woke at about 10:50 pm, abruptly to racing heart beat, sense of tingling/numbness inside ears, feeling of swollen tongue (back of tongue) and then later feeling of tightness in throat. This was just less than 12 hours after my vaccination.   I sat upright sipping cold liquids for approx 2 hrs and sensations faded.   Next day I had headache, fatigue and felt extremely cold later in day for several hours. Occasional dizziness for the next 2 days with chills.

Got out of bed to get Motrin and had 2 syncopal episodes. On the 2nd syncopal episode during the fall I hit my chin on the wall and put a hole in the wall. ED on 1/31/2021- unable to determine on facial CT if mandible was fractured due to the amount of swelling and blood pooling in the area. Treating as if is fractured: tetanus shot given, 10 days of antibiotics, and follow up with oral facial surgery if needed.

                                                After I received the shot I went to the observation room. I could feel the shot move from my left arm (where I got the shot) to my right arm and down to my hand. After 10 minutes I felt the shot go down both legs at the same time and come back up close to my chest. About 5 minutes after that sensation, my chest got a little tight and I was having a hard time breathing and the right side of my face started to tingle. I looked down at my hands and the finger tips of my right hand were blue.  I raised my hand and the nurse came over and took me to the back room. I thought maybe my hands were dirty, so I washed them off. My right fingertips were still blue.   I could feel tingles all over the right side of my face and my lips went a little numb. I kept pressing them together to see if that would help. My throat started to feel swollen and the nurses gave me some benedryl.  I left after an hour and went home. The tingling on the right side of my face stayed with me for another 2 days.  I have no known allergies.  That was my experience.

I slept all weekend.  After shot two (right arm) on 02/05/21 I had all of those same reactions by early Friday afternoon. I woke up at 10:00 pm with the need to vomit. While sitting on the edge of my bath tub waiting to vomit, I fainted and fell backwards into the bathtub, hitting me head and wrenching my neck as I was wedged into the tub sideways. My son found me and roused me. I then urinated all over myself, had extreme diarrhea and vomiting x 2 rounds. I fainted a second time while sitting on the toilet with diarrhea and vomited 2x more into my bathtub.

                                                Within 3 minutes my arm started to turn red, and I started to break out in hives. By 20 minutes my hives went across to my chest and right arm. My BP was 168/108 and pulse 84, they hooked me up to vitals. They wanted to send me to the ER  for Benadryl but I had more own and took Benadryl (20mg) this was about 25 mins into injection.  About 30 mins my arm started to get really warm, you could feel the heat coming off of it.  They monitored me for an hour and re-did my BP 158/97, pulse dropped to  80, my o2 stats were 99. They made me monitor for another 18 mins. BP was  155/103, pulse still at 80. They had me get up and walk around and wanted me to take more Benadryl but I didn&#39;t have a ride home.   . My hives started to improve but were not gone.  About 1hr 25mins post vaccine  I got on the phone with Employee Health to ask to leave (clinic was closing) , they wanted me to stay and I told them I had a BP machine at home, if it didn&#39;t go down they wanted me to go to the ER. My BP did go down about 4 hours later but my arm was still hurting.  The hives on my chest went away, but hives on my arm was on and off for about a week. My left arm remained red for about 2 weeks and I ended up getting a really bad rash.  When I woke up the next day I had to take a Benadryl and Tylenol. On January 3rd I felt awful like  I got hit by a car.  On that Wednesday (6th) my arm started to hurt really bad in the middle of the night, it felt like day 2 all over again. It was really painful, it was bright red and life a figure eight going down my arm and I immediately called employee health and they  told me to monitor for 24 hours. It got worse and went down my arm to my chest.  I went to Friday night to our immediate care (only place we could go), I was given antibiotics for cellulitis.  It took about 7 days to  go away.  They were telling me I couldn&#39;t get the second dose because of my reaction and I had to fight to get the second dose.

                                                It started with tingling in my tongue (which I ignored), then it became numbness that spread down my throat I also became short of breath. That&#39;s when I notified one of the nurses. They checked my blood pressure. I vaguely remember hearing it was high (189/?). They called 911 and the paramedics came. Shortness of breath became worse and chest pains started. The paramedic gave me Benadryl and then epinephrine since I was increasingly getting worse. I was shaking  and I felt lethargic. I could not control the shaking and I felt cold. I do not remember a lot of details when I got to the Emergency Room. Looking at my record they gave me: LORazepam (ATIVAN), methylPREDNISolone sod suc(PF)(SOLU-MEDROL) and famotidine. I went home that night with the condition that I see my primary care physician. I felt like I have the flu and soreness of arm the next couple days. I went back to work after four days.

                                                The day of the injection, approx. 3-4 minutes after getting the injection, I almost passed out.  I became hot, sweaty, dizzy and my head starting to buzz.  The nurse on-site provided me a couple cold packs and after about 30 minutes, I felt better. The nurse described my response as a &#34;vascular&#34; reaction.  Later that night, I got a headache and night sweats and bouts of nausea.  They only lasted a day.    Approx. 10 days after the injection,  the injection site became red, swollen, itchy and uncomfortable to the touch. Then it traveled down my arm and created a large red, swollen, itchy area on my entire upper arm.   I advised my doctor and she provided me a Rx for a topical steroid and oral steroid.    After 5 days of treatment, it is 90% better.   The injection site still hurts.

                                                7 AM 3/25/2021 - Patient called out to husband from the bathroom where she experienced a syncopal event, then passed out.  An ambulance was called and she was revived for a short period of time.  She was taken to Hospital where she coded 3 times.  She was then life-flighted to second Hospital.  According to the hospital records, tests conducted over the course of several days determined that she had no neurological activity.  Initial reports in the records indicate pulmonary embolism, cardiac and respiratory arrest.  She was on life support for the remainder of her time.  Organ donation is being pursued at present and results of this are pending at time of this report submission.  Date of death is unknown until organ retrieval is accomplished.  Family will be contacted in the next few days to ask further questions about any other kinds of vaccine-related reactions that may have happened more immediately to days after the vaccination on 3/17/2021.  A co-worker thought that she had shortness of breath for 3-4 days before this critical event occurred on 3/25/2021.

I had muscle aches, back ache, temperature of 101 and chills. My body hurt so bad that I needed help walking across the room. My fever broke at about 4 am and I was sweating. 3 days later, my heart started racing up to 265 BPM. I had diagnosed A-Fib for 6 years before up until this point that has always been able to be controlled with my Diltiazem. I had to go to the ER. I was admitted into the hospital for a day and 1/2.

The next day, it was even larger, by 4/7, it had completely gone away.  Everyone thinks I should also mention that I was admitted to the hospital with chest pain, high BP/Pulse on 3/31, they did a D-Dimer on me and it was elevated, suggesting a clot has formed and is in the process of breaking down. I had a CT of my chest and no PE was found, but I had thickening of my left lobar pulmonary artery wall, further supporting the suggestion of a possible blood clot. After an echo stress test, I was discharged the next day on HTN meds. I was experiencing chest discomfort prior to my vaccine, but again, EVERYONE is telling me I need to report this, so I am. :)

Approx 10 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose # 1, patient was still in vaccine clinic area and complained of dizziness, palpitations and flushing.  I observed patient fanning herself with papers.  She was escorted out of the immediate clinic room, and assessed by paramedics present as having an anaphylactic reaction.  Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV given in clinic, Rapid Response was called overhead and patient immediately transported down the hall to the Emergency Dept. In ED, pt was noted as having swollen tongue, large areas of erythema on face, arms and chest, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (per ED physician notes).  Pt reported being hospitalized in ICU with COVID disease more than 3 months ago, including intubation (not treated at this hospital), and has been back at work since August 2020.  ED physical exam noted bilateral wheezing and patient in acute distress.  In ED, pt administered racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL via neb, epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV and epinephrine 5 mg/250 mL IV drip (started at 0.118 mcg/kg/min).  Acute symptoms reported to resolve in ED.  COVID test was negative.  ED physician discovered that pt had history of multiple medications, including previous anaphylactic reaction to radiocontrast dye requiring intubation (which was not disclosed on the vaccine screening form).  Pt admitted to Telemetry floor for observation.   Overnight course was unremarkable, and patient was discharged the following day with prescription for Prednisone taper and prescription for Epi-pen.  Advised not to return for second dose of COVID vaccine.  EMR updated to reflect possible anaphylactic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

Patient received her COVID-19 vaccination on 12/30/2020 around 1PM. Immediately after the injection in her left shoulder, she began to feel warmth and numbness in her left shoulder, arm, neck, face, and chest. She reports later experiencing nausea, palpitations, and left arm weakness. Her symptoms persisted, and her family noted a left sided facial droop which prompted her ED visit.    In the ED, patient was noted to have some left sided facial droop and left arm and leg weakness. CT head and CTA showed no acute abnormalities. Tele-neurology was consulted who recommended admission to rule out acute stroke.  Ultimately, work up was negative and symptoms resolved.  Symptoms appear to be related to the vaccine.

I told RN, the nurse who gave me the injection and I was told to lay down on my back and she lifted both of my legs perpendicular to the floor. My hands and feet were tingling. My blood pressure was taken and the first reading was elevated and hear rate was 102. I was given a can of apple juice and I felt better after drinking it. Since the blood pressure cuff was too large for me, I was able to go downstairs to urgent care and get a reading with a smaller cuff. The last BP reading was had lowered and I was able to leave. I did not feel well for a good 45 min.  My left arm was very sore for the first 48 hours. It did not go away for at least 5 days.

                                                moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Tachycardia sudden onset 4 minutes after injection (6:09am). Arms and legs cold and weak. Generalized weakness. BP 167/78, o2 sats 100%. Tachycardia lasted about 10-15minutes and resolved to HR 88 and BP 138/78.  Still left with overall weakness, malaise, cold feeling. No other symptoms.  Released from the facility at 6:48am.  Drove 2 blocks to my husband&#39;s workplace (hospital). Had diarrhea x 2, dull diffuse headache, odd feeling and malaise that persisted. Sudden onset of terrible feeling, the need to get to the ER at 8:36am. Had a bathroom visit to urinate. By the time we got to the ER the intense malaise improved. I sat in the ER lobby not wanting to be admitted to the ER (didn&#39;t want to be having a vaccine reaction). I stayed in the ER lobby. Symptoms completely resolved at 9:45am. I stayed there for 30 more minutes to be sure and then drove home with no other symptoms but Left arm soreness. Tachycardia never returned after the first episode. No rash, no itching, no swelling, no dyspnea. Just felt toxic. Then it resolved completely at hour 4.

                                                Approx 35minutes after vaccine i experienced sneezing ,scratchy throat and itchy yes, took Allegra with good effect. Arm soreness developed about 8 hours after vaccine, woke next morning with fever 100.9, severe body aches, headache, nausea, weakness and fatigue, decreased appetite. In addition, as the  day went on I experienced a shallow cough, high pulse rate (130), tongue twitching and just felt aweful. Slept on and off all day, sx lasted the entire day. Took Tylenol throughout the day for the the fever. I awoke 3:30 am today, 1/10/21 with fever 101.5, took more Tylenol, still headache and feel tongue twitchiness  however muscle aches, body aches, nausea, decreased appetite and fatigue have subsided. I took 600mg Advil around 9am today and have been gradually feeling much better as of now 1:30pm. As a side note, I did have COVID 19 illness mildly in March 2020. It was dx&#39;d with PCR testing and my sx were loss of taste/smell, nausea, weight loss, bursted eye vessel, slight respiratory sx, I recovered well and had a follow up negative test 2 weeks after. Thank you.

Continued to feel weird rubbing chest and short of breath but no chest pain.  Decided to take her to the ED.  On the way she passed out and was not responsive still had a pulse.  In ED became responsive, reports numbness in both arms and short of breath.   Received Benadryl complete assessment, doesn&#39;t appear to be an acute allergic reaction.  ECG &amp; vitals were okay. Patient observed for 4 hours and seemed to improve so discharged.

                                                Thursday January 7, 2021: Developed a hard lump around the injection site (A week to the day later).  Friday January 8, 2021: Arrived at work and around 9:30 felt short of breath. Had pulse and oxygen checked anyway; Pulse 99 (down from 107) and Oxygen 99. Dismissed it as being in my head. Proceeded through my day and it persevered.  After lunch, still felt short of breath. Contacted Infection Control nurse and was advised to leave work as it was also a COVID symptom.  Went home around 12:15; felt fatigued. Slept all day and night. Saturday January 9, 2021: Minor sore throat, feel as if coming down with a cold.  Back of sinuses felt hot upon breathing.  Bump at injection site gone completely (I massaged it Thursday and Friday). Minor discomfort with breathing; barely noticeable. In the afternoon time around 2pm, sudden and urgent diarrhea that lasted into the evening hours at bed.  Top of stomach burning (inside body). Diarrhea stopped, but nausea remained.  At bedtime, still felt as if coming down with a cold. Sunday January 10, 2021: Woke up feeling as if I was getting over a cold.  Nose stuffy on the side I slept on. Throughout the day, had the sniffles as the stuffiness went away.  Stomach still off; feeling nauseous.  No diarrhea (no bowel movement at all).  Throughout the afternoon tightness in chest/shortness of breath returned.  Towards the evening time still felt as if getting over a cold.  Contacted Human Resources and voice appeared hoarse. Ended phone call.  Touched my face and noticed a huge lump on my chin that felt like the lump at injection site.  Felt like a cyst. About 20 minutes later began to have difficulty swallowing; throat felt tight.  Drank a bottle of water and took two allergy pills with antihistamine.  An hour and a half after taking these,  tightness in throat is still present, but has not progressed any further; in fact, it appears to be slowly fading away.  (It&#39;s more like the feeling of having a &#34;lump in your throat&#34; (but I can&#39;t physically feel a lump).  The lump on my chin has noticeably diminished in size and is less painful to the touch. COVID test is scheduled for 1/11/21 at 10:30am. It feels as if my body is doing a &#34;systems check.&#34;

She developed redness in the upper chest. Immediately came back and arrived around 16:38. I saw patient around that time and she was breathing well, had a patent airway. Very anxious. Vitals showed tachycardia but were otherwise normal. Patient had IV placed in the right hand and was given 125mg solumedrol and 25mg diphenhydramine, both IV. Patient monitored at bedside during entire time. BP at time of D/C was 140/80 and HR of 91BPM. No swelling in mouth/tongue/lips/throat. Speaking in full sentences and feeling well.

                                                Patient information was reviewed. Patient was asked if they ever had any form of severe reaction to anything they had had in the past. Patient did not state yes to anything other than having a reaction that was managed at home to shellfish as a child. They stated their throat had swollen as a child during the event. Patient was told that it was an anaphylactic reaction and shouldn&#39;t have been managed at home as a child by nurse and should have been taken to the hospital. Patient was told they would be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. Within 2-3 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient reported tingling or burning around the site of injections. Within 5 minutes they stated to be feeling tired and that their arm had felt numb. After this the patient began starring into the distance and was unresponsive.

Moderate Jaw pain, mild radiating pain down my left arm, moderate bilateral clavicle pain,  radiating pain down my right leg. Moderate to severe pain at the base of my skull.  Felt woozy with this pain.  Then had severe sudden mid-chest pain with palpitations.   I Had high blood pressures the entire time about 168/88 but when this chest pain happened Bp was like 148/110.  O2 sat was 98%.  ICU dr came to assess me but stated my HR didn&#39;t seem that fast to him and offered to take me to hospital - next door to get further checked but my symptoms started to subside. I did get chills and was shaking after this but after that resolved I felt a lot better.  My BP came back down to like 118/72

                                                Extreme dizziness, darkened vision as happens before losing consciousness, feeling of losing consciousness. All symptoms repeated in 5 waves. First wave hit about 10 min after dose and last about 60 seconds. 2nd wave hit a minute later and lasted approximately 30 seconds. 3rd wave hit 2 minutes later and lasted about 60 seconds with some shaking in core/diaphragm area.  4th wave hit 8-10 minutes after that and lasted 5 minutes. 4th wave was precipitated by shaking starting in diaphragm area and branching out to extremities and jawline. Shaking was uncontrollable and made speaking impossible. Shaking passed after about 6 minutes when wave subsided. 5th wave hit about 10 minutes later and was dizziness/darkening vision with disorientation, no shaking.  EMS responded to first wave by removing me from my car and having me sit in a chair, removing my mask to breath better, took vitals. Vitals were taken several times, oxygen levels varying from 93 - 98.  Oxygen was ready nearby but not used. Blood pressure varied, don?t have the readings. EMT gave water immediately and then pretzels about 30 minutes after the episodes began. I was kept for observation for an hour total after inoculation and then released to go home as symptoms had fully subsided.

                                                Within 20 minutes I experienced extreme shortness of breath that continued throughout the weekend and into the following week.  Within 36 hours I developed a &#34;rash&#34; that was later diagnosed as petechiae. Labs were ordered immediately and my platelet level was 66,000. The hematologist that was consulted with had me report to the emergency room for further tests. I was informed not to injure myself in anyway with a count that low or I could hemorrhage and die.

                                                Was performing a COVID vaccine clinic at a skilled nursing facility.  The patient states that at approximately 5 minutes after admin of her second shot, she started feeling short of breath. The nurse ran over to monitor her and take her BP. I arrived as well to monitor. Her breathing appeared fast and labored but patient was alert and oriented. She had no localized reaction to the vaccine. The patient&#39;s lungs were auscultated and were clear. Her glucose was checked, it was &#34;low&#34; for the patient at 80.  She stated the center of her chest was radiating pain and her hands went numb. Her BP was 161/93 and HR 65 and OSAT was 94 but this was close to her normal range. Epinephrine was not administered - but instead diphenhydramine 25 mg. The patient reported feeling better at 12 minutes post immunization and her breathing improved. Her chest pain went away and numbness went away. The patient also ate a donut and drank a glass of water at this time and stated she felt much better. Her BP again at 15 minutes post immunization was 158/96 and HR was 61 and OSAT was 100. Monitored patient for 20 more minutes and no other issues were experienced. The patient is being paired with a nurse from the facility to monitor the rest of the day.   After discussing with the pharmacist who reviewed the consent forms, it was noted that the patient marked yes on the portion that asks the patient if they&#39;ve received a blood transfusion in the last year.

                                                Patient was asked to be observed for 30 minutes due to a previous serious reaction to IVP dye.  About 20 minutes after she received her vaccine, she felt chest pain and claustrophobia.   She refused an epi pen.  She took 50mg of diphenhydramine.  She quickly said that she felt better, but we monitored her blood pressure, pulse, and pulse ox.   We also called a paramedic, they arrived shortly and evaluated her.  She refused to get treatment.   Her vitals were all normal, she was drowsy from the diphenhydramine.  The chest pain and feeling of claustrophobia were gone.  She worked at a school and the school nurse checked on her throughout the rest of the day, and she was feeling fine.  She was very nervous about the vaccine, and her reaction could have been anxiety related (although she felt fine after her vaccine).

I was short of  breath and my heart was racing. i could not sleep all night due to up and down trying to settle my heart rate.  I was very thirsty during the night as well.  I ended up going to the ER the following day around 930am due to unrelieved tachycardia and sob. My headache continued. MY EKG showed PVC&#39;s, tachycardia and my triponin was slightly elevated on two different blood tests. I am now 7 days out and still have nagging headache, some sob and my heart races at times. When i talk alot, I become Short of breath.

Went to the bathroom and saw her eyes bloodshot red, chest red and flushed. She notified other healthcare worker and was signed in immediately to see physician. No sob but felt pressure on her chest and felt jittery inside her body. She frequently was clearing her throat which her fellow associates said she was not doing prior to injection. Was treated with NS bolus and medications and was discharged home. Doctor wants her to stay out of work tomorrow.

                                                Patient post vaccine administration approx 20 minutes. Reported feelinging tightness in chest, spreading to throat. Patient was taken to observation portion of clinic. Patient was hypoxic in 70&#39;s. Supplemental oxygen applied. Oxygen saturation increased to 88. Epipen administered and albuterol nebulizer treatment started while waiting for ED/Rapid response team to arrive. Patient transferred to ED for further observation.  From the physician that treated the patient: &#34;It was a bit of a bizarre presentation. She reported throat tightness after the vaccine. She had a completely normal exam and no other complaints. no signs of airway/oral/pharyngeal abnormality. no respiratory abnormality. Unfortunately she was significantly hypoxic when I took her vitals. as low as 76%. Good waveform. I even checked the pulse ox on myself because I didn&#39;t believe it. In addition, with supplemental oxygen, her sats went up. I had to pull the trigger and treat her even though she looked well and I had no objective exam findings to explain her profound hypoxia. She received IM Epinepherine and Albuterol neb. By the time she was in ED she was satting 100% and her throat tightness resolved. So, not sure how to answer your question. Clinically I pulled the trigger and treated her for anaphylaxis following a vaccine administration. I wish it was a problem with my sat monitor but I don&#39;t believe it was. I was using a life-pack with wave form and verified with two other people that the O2 saturation function was working properly. Intuitively, it doesn&#39;t make sense but I think we should probably consider it a reaction to the vaccine. &#34;

The highest my hear rate  went was 140 BPM. The paramedics but me on an EKG and my heart rate dropped to 116 BPM. I was not admitted to the hospital, and after the paramedics left I was able to go back to sleep.  I had heart palpitations for the next 8-10 days after the vaccine. I saw a cardiologist and they didn&#39;t find anything out of the ordinary, and then I saw an allergist and I&#39;m following up with him soon.

This then turned into full left side numb/foggy feeling. I was with my son (and I&#39;m a nurse) so I asked him to test for signs of a stroke. I could smile evenly but it didn&#39;t feel like it. I had strength in both hands and could lift my arms. I was able to communicate what to look for to my son without slurred speech. But I was not stable on my left foot and felt as if I was listing to the left side. My left side was foggy. I moved my arm but flet it in slow motion. When I got home, I sat down and stretched. The symptoms went away and I was able to continue the day without episode. The episode lasted 20-30 minutes as I was walking home still. In hind sight, I did have a similar eposide after the first dose (Moderna lot 037K20A on 1/29/20) while exercising at home but sat down and thought it was due to a hard workout. That time it was just a weak left leg that was giving out on me and lasted 5 minutes because I stopped the workout.

                                                My left arm was very sore , red and hurting pretty bad. I went to bed around 10:00pm thinking everything was ok and it was a normal reaction. Woke up around 1:30am arm hurting so I got up to get some more tylenol. I immediately felt sick to my stomach (both ways) and I passed out and broke my nose.  I was coherient at times and other times I could not seem to answer any questions. My husband got me to the ER and they took my blood pressure 4 or 5 times and the nurse said &#34;I can&#39;t get a blood pressure&#34;. Another nurse came in and said we will take this one ! My blood pressure had bottomed out and caused all sorts of things going on. I left ER after 4 1/2 hrs. with a BP of 107/57 but I am not sure how low it got! At one point my husband looked at monitor and my bottom number was 39 but it is all a blur to me. As of today I still feel week (heavy arms) and I am concerned about taking my second dose!

At 10pm I started feeling light headed and walked to the kitchen to get water. I began feeling weak and more dizzy and went back to my bedroom to lie down. I felt a rush to my head, passed out and woke up on the ground. I am unsure how long I lost consciousness:  minutes/ seconds.  I was able to get to my bed and called my husband for help. I broke into a hot, drenching sweat to the point I had to change my clothes.  The dizziness eventually cleared. I have a headache and am still nauseated today but not dizzy.  I have never had an experience like this before.

                                                Within 6 hours I had overwhelming headache with injection site pain that radiated up to my ear and down to my elbow. I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

                                                Rash started small area on my right arm (opposite arm of injection) - like eczema red; raised; itchy spot. As a couple of days went I got more and more spots. Sent pictures to my Dr - Pityriasis Roseola - Went to see dermatologist - he diagnosed me with the same thing (January 19th). He gave me cream for it - it was all over my entire body by the time I saw him. It was like a red petechiae rash over my whole body. I usd the cream as instructed per doctor. The following week on that Monday, I was short of breath and not feeling right and I worked. But next day I only worked a couple of hours and went home. I started having vomiting and diarrhea - I went to the ER twice - 1st time they diagnosed - Viral infection - and they discharged me and didn&#39;t give me anything but told me to rest and they pushed fluids. The second time I went - they gave me medication and they said it might help with the pain in my  abdomen. They didn&#39;t do much. I had gone to ER - was there for four and half hours waiting to be seen but didn&#39;t get seen. Two days after second ER visit - I went back to the hospital  on January 26 and was admitted for heart failure and that is when cardiac symptoms occurred.

I had nausea, vomiting, fever of 103.2, had trouble breathing, felt like someone was sitting in the middle of my chest, left side of my body was numb, weakness, migraine headaches, and muscle aches in neck and shoulder.  I went to bed after I took Tylenol and nausea medicine. I woke up at 4 am the next morning and told my husband to get the girls (our daughters) up and that i needed to go to the hospital. When I got there they did a chest x-ray, blood work and gave me a breathing treatment. I was admitted to the hospital. While I was there they gave me IV fluids and medicine for headaches and nausea medicine. I was released about 2:30 in the afternoon on Feb 26th. I still have muscle aches  and head aches. I have noticed my memory is real short, I have trouble remembering things from yesterday.

Symptoms resolved pretty abruptly at 72 hours. 2nd dose 2/12/21.  Again symptoms within 12 hours.  fever up to 103, chills, headache, extreme fatigue, body aches, coughing, increased oxygen demand.  Initial symptoms lingered over 14 days.  On 2/25 was prescribed 20mg prednisone for 5 days which resulted in slight improvement.  Then continued to slowly decline again with increased fatigue, chest pain,  more shortness of breath.  Saw pulmonologist on 3/10.  Referred to cardiologist and echo on 3/11 with concern for heart failure.  Echo on 3/11 showed acute right sided heart failure, new diagnosis.  Cardiologist and pulmonologist both state that I reacted with severe symptoms to first dose of vaccine but recovered.  2nd dose I just could not recover from and with my compromised lungs from post-acute covid syndrome, wound up with heart failure.

                                                Graves disease; shortness of breath; tachycardia; A spontaneous report was received from a health professional concerning a 49-years-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and had graves disease (basedow&#39;s disease), shortness of breath (dyspnoea), tachycardia  No medical history was provided. No concomitant medications were provided.  On 12 Feb 2021, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided), intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 12 Feb 2021, the patient developed tachycardia and shortness of breath. On 13 Feb 2021, she had medical evaluation done that showed she did not have a pulmonary embolus. On 23 Feb 2021, lab data showed undetectable thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). On 01 Mar 2021, she had full set of thyroid function tests that still showed an undetectable TSH and elevated free T4 and a total T3. She was confirmed to have Graves&#39; disease (medically significant) based off elevated thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins.  The patient had been started on treatment.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.   The outcome of the events of graves disease (basedow&#39;s disease), shortness of breath (dyspnea), tachycardia was unknown.  The reporter assessed the events to be possibly related to the study drug.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

EKG: 04/09/21  Rhythm: Sinus tachycardia  Rate: 111  Axis: normal  Intervals: normal   Concern for possible inferior infarct noted, but felt less consistent with true ST depression  Recent Imaging: Chest x-ray, 04/09/21:  FINDINGS: LUNGS: Slightly low lung volumes.  There is hazy reticulonodular interstitial opacity seen within the left mid and both lower lung zones suspicious for interstitial pulmonary edema. CARDIAC: Slightly worsened mild cardiomegaly. MEDIASTINUM: Normal. PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. LINES/TUBES: None. BONES: There is mild rightward convexity curvature of the thoracic spine along with minimal multilevel degenerative change. OTHER: Surgical clips overlie the left lung apex medially and the right upper abdominal quadrant.   IMPRESSION: 1. See above.   CT angiogram pulmonary:  FINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    #Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  -Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  Considerations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (&#34;tea and toast&#34;), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   - Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

I never felt faint or anxious. Approximately 20  minutes after vaccine administration my pulse came down to 100?s. I remained hypertensive. At one hour post-vaccine, my BP was 178/98. I was then transferred to the ED. At 90 minutes post vaccine my BP was 180?s/80?s and pulse was high 90?s. The BP gradually came down. I was discharged home three hours post-vaccine with BP of 140?s/80?s and pulse in the 90?s. The next morning, my VS returned to normal: BP 106/62, pulse 67.

They sat me down and about couple minutes later I felt my heart rate racing and felt flushed.  I reported how I felt the the staff and they put me in a recliner.  The rapid heart rate went away about a minute later.  I stayed at the vaccine clinic for total of 35 minutes after the shot.  They made sure I felt o.k. before I left.  I didn&#39;t have that feeling again.  I felt fine the rest of the day and today.  I have had that same feeling before not from vaccine.  I have never had reaction to vaccine or medications.   2 years ago I thought I was allergic to avocado or avocado oil because I had a couple of incidence of having that same dizzy fast heart rate feeling after avocado oil.  I went to an allergist and got tested and was negative for avocado and he also tested me for shell fish because I have had history of being itchy after eating shellfish.  I was negative for both.  I haven&#39;t had that same reaction for several years since that incident.  I have been able to eat avocado and shellfish without problem.  I don&#39;t really know if this is an allergic reaction or an immune response to the vaccine.  I am going to see my allergist on 1/6/21 see what he thinks.  I am wondering if I should get the second dose.

                                                Began with tingling down my right arm, and I became a little shaky.  Drank some water and the shakiness continued to get worse.  Went to the restroom and felt like I was going to pass out.  Tingling came back  across my upper body (chest level to shoulder level), I began to shake excessively, my mouth got very dry and my skin became splotchy.  I was breathing hard like I had just ran flights of stairs.  Nurses were called and I was given Benadryl and taken to the Emergency Room at a neighboring hospital where they hooked me up to I believe heart and BP monitors.  My blood pressure was very high and my heart was pounding so hard.  Was given steroid pills.  All day I urinated excessively and my heart pounded hard.

She developed a rash over her trunk and extremities that was warm and pruritic. She was given 50mg po benadryl before I evaluated her. When I saw her she was not in extremis, respiratory distress or with audible stridor, but did appear uncomfortable. She denied any lip swelling, tongue swelling or throat closure, however did note that her heart was racing and she was having chest heaviness. The patient&#39;s lungs were clear and there was no audible wheezing or signs of cyanosis. Pulse ox was 100-110 HR, with O2 sat 97-100%.  Did not appear to be an anaphylactic reaction at this time.  She was brought to the ER for further observation

At some time early in the morning of 26 Jan she experienced headache and felt very tired so stayed home from work. During the morning she mainly slept however had some Motrin and a banana around 0830 due to feeling feverish. She went back to sleep until about 1030. When she woke up, she still felt feverish and then noticed her pulse started racing a few minutes later. Her husband took her BP but her pulse was reading ?error?.

I got the shot Friday afternoon, I started noticing the palpitations Saturday afternoon, and now Sunday night they?re really bothering me. They?re almost continuous. It feels like I drank a lot of caffeine, but I haven?t.

Extremely itchy eyes, palms of hands, soles of feet, progressed to shortness of breath, Bradycardic, oxygen saturation in 80s even after administration of IM epinephrin, hypotensive, swollen face, neck and tongue, severe vomiting. EMS transported me to hospital mentioned above. IV started in ambulance where IV epinephrin, IV fluids, IV Benadryl, IV solumedrol were all given prior to arrival at the ER. ER then administered more steroids and anti nausea meds and sent me home after observation and stabilization with prescription for epi pen and prednisone.

                                                After the injection , I had the usual sore arm for several days and was tired.  On day 3 (Jan 6), I felt very dizzy while teaching at school. I did not pass out, but I had to sit down. My blood pressure was elevated. This feeling continued on and off for several weeks after the vaccine. The main adverse event was the vaccine red arm. On day 8, (Jan. 12), my vaccine site got red and swollen again. It was 5 cm by 8 cm. It became hot and swollen and itchy. My primary care doctor did not know what caused it. My school nurse did not know. I was able to contact the father of one of my students who worked in the Medical Center who advised me that it was just an allergic reaction. Days 8-10 had the most symptoms. It slowly went away after that.  I treated it with topical hydrocortisone cream several times a day. It helped soothe the redness and itch. By Day 15, it was gone.

                                                About 4 hours after the vaccine, I experienced sudden nausea and abdominal pain. The symptoms lasted for about a week. They were intermittent at first. I had 3 episodes of sharp adominal pain that radiated up my back and made me short of breath. I felt pain between my shoulder blades when I tried to breathe in. The first two subsided, but the third episode on 02/16/21 was more pronounced. I felt generally unwell, like something was really wrong. I first thought it was a normal immune response or side effect. But the nausea and abdominal pain had grown worse. On 02/16/2021 I went to the ER, where a CT Scan showed I had Epiploic Appendagitis. I suspect the inflammation or a sudden ischemic event after my vaccine had caused this. I had absolutely no such symptoms prior to the vaccine, but the nausea came on exactly 4 hours after my first dose like a switch had been turned on.    In addition to the above, I experience facial flushing on the left side of my face for about 7 days after the vaccine. My forehead and right side of my face would read a normal temperature, but my left cheek averaged 101 degrees. The flushing would come on suddenly, often in the evening. I also had heart palpitations.   Other symptoms: I had the typical sore left arm for a few days. I developed joint pain on my left side, including my arm and my jaw. In general, I feel like I had a pronounced inflammatory response.

A week post vaccination, she had a thick painful cord down injection arm and was misdiagnosed with tendonitis. After a second opinion, she was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. On 01FEB2021, an ultrasound confirmed a blood clot and subsequently, she went to the ER. A computerized tomography (CT) of the lungs ruled out pulmonary embolism. Based on these events, the patient chose not to get the second shot.  Treatment included rivaroxaban and follow-up with hematologist.   The second dose of mRNA-1273 was discontinued in response to the event.   The outcome of the events deep vein thrombosis and chose not to get second shot were unknown.   Follow-up information received 08Feb2021 included additional event, date of first dose was updated from 16Jan2021 to 07Jan2021, diagnostic test and treatment.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 50 year-old, female who experienced deep vein thrombosis. Treatment included rivaroxaban and follow-up with hematologist.Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

                                                I was woken from sleep with severe chills and nausea.  I sat on the toilet b/c wasn&#39;t sure if going to have a BM or vomit, then the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor, so assumed loss of consciousness.  Couldn&#39;t move or get up from floor because so weak.  Another wave of severe nausea occurred and then my husband helped me sit up and lean on the toilet to vomit, and I lost consciousness again for 3 to 4 seconds.  Layed on the floor again for a bit, then made it to bed.  At 5 am had another wave of nausea and vomiting and started to have a bowel movement and vomit at the same time and lost consciousness again for a few seconds, my husband had to prop up my head.  I was able to make it into bed and then the symptoms gradually subsided.  I was able to eat around noon.  My husband and I are both physicians so didn&#39;t seek medical care.

I got up and has a buzzing sensation all over my body. I walked over the the nurse station and told them I was having a reaction, nurse took my vitals my HR was 165 and my BP 170/120.  They took me upstairs to observations and eventually my BP came down a bit. Later that evening it was 160/105. I though I was having chest discomfort. I went to the Emergency Room. They did an EKG which was normal, so they sent me home.  It took my BP another 12 hours to be within a normal reading.  Within 24-36 hours things came back to normal I had recovered.

After going to bed I started getting a sever headache as well as joint, muscle pain, and a shooting pain into my left hand/fingers lasting all night. Dizziness and heart racing when I got up several times to use the bathroom. The chills stopped sometime in the early morning but the fatigue, headache and muscle and joint pain lasted through out the next day. Tylenol was taking every 6 hrs and helped relieve most of the pain. I did not seek treatment. The second day out I am still feeling fatigued and slight headache but seems to be getting better.

                                                About 5 minutes after the vaccine, I felt like the vaccine going through my body, mu fingers kept tingling, heart rate started to race. They game me some orange juice and monitored me for about 15 minutes. I went back to work and I felt shaky for about 3-4 hours. I then had a terrible headaches and back ache. That same night I got some hives and chest tightness with increased in throat production and the headache continued that night.  The next day I still felt tired and achy, felt like a mild flu. I had chest tightness with difficulty breathing.  I continued to feel sick Saturday and Sunday and Monday I had a Covid test done, which was negative.  On Monday I had rashes on my arms and legs and continued to have the hives and on Tuesday I started to feel a bit better with a dry cough.  On Tuesday 01-12-220 I had a chest x-ray which was negative.  On Wednesday, I woke up and felt much worse and that&#39;s when I called the NP and she prescribed three inhalers for my breathing issues. On 01-27-2020, since I was still feeling not better I called off work.  As now, I am slowly getting better, but I still continued with the hives.

I didn&#39;t notice anything else overnight, exception injection site pain increased. The next morning I got up around 6:45 am to feed my pets. I felt woozy walking about 25 m from the bedroom to the pet food location, and also very flushed and hot. I started sweating copiously while I was getting the food out, and then I fainted. I don&#39;t know how long I was unconscious but I suspect not more than a minute or two. I didn&#39;t seem to injure myself when I fell, other than a bruised elbow and hip I was able to finish feeding the pets, crawl to the bathroom (I had a strong accompanying urge to evacuate my bowels), and then get into bed. I went back to sleep at around 7:15 am and by 10:00 am I felt more normal, still with some chills and headache, general lethargy, and not much appetite. Those symptoms lasted through the evening until I went to bed at 9:00 pm, gradually decreasing. Today I feel mostly fine, although dehydrated. I did not record my temperature during the fever spike, nor receive medical attention.

                                                A couple of hours after the vaccine I started experiencing headaches that gradually started getting worse. At night I also had fever, chills, sore throat, body aches, flu like symptoms. In the middle of the night I woke up with heart palpitations. Those symptoms lasted for about 5 days. Monday I still had a slight sore throat, and I started with my throat feeling scratchy and then a sudden cough. I still have those (sore throat and cough), My BP has also been compromised since the 1st dose and still is not back to normal. It shoots up all of a sudden.

                                                About 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I experienced a headache and it became really severe in about half a day.  A dull pain that does not go away, I used Tylenol and it did not take it away. I took Aleve, Excedrin headache, but nothing helps. My BP randomly has been up. Sometimes I am just reading, or watching a movie and then the headache comes and I felt the difference and it is a different kind of headache and I checked and m BP was up. I never had any issues with migraines or nothing like that but now I feel like the symptoms are like a migraine. Saw the MD, who added a new BP medicine and it has not helped my BP is still acting up so I went see my endocrinologist (Dr.) and he added the 3rd BP medicine, I am currently taking 3 of them (for about 3 weeks - he just told me to take it prn when the headache is really severe).

She felt awful within an hour of vaccination and persisted with symptoms for 2.5 days.  She described it as being out of it, headache, fever, chills, profound body aches, weakness and dizziness with palpitations.  She could not get out of bed for a day.  She literally thought she was going to die given the severity of her weakness.  As quickly as the symptoms occurred, they left her on March 7th, 2021.  She went to work on March 8th and noted similar symptoms to prior ITP flares - petechiae on legs, gum bleeding, fatigue, mild headache.  She also noted dark urine but no frank blood.  Since being admitted and receiving steroids, she is feeling improved and petechiae are lessening.  She also noted mild mouth ulceration to lower lip along with oozing.

She was then transferred to Emergency Department. Per their report: The patient presents with a swollen discolored left lower leg.  She does have  discoloration and I am concerned for massive DVT and cerulea dolens.  She does  have really minimal pain to the leg except to the groin, she has intact pulses,  I have low suspicion for acute ischemia/arterial clot.  She does complain of  some mild dyspnea with exertion above baseline so I do have concerns for  possible PE.  She is hemodynamically stable, appears in no distress.  She is on  oral contraceptives, mild obesity, no other significant VTE risk factors.  I am  going to empirically start her on heparin, I have also ordered a CT PE and a CT  abdomen pelvis to check for proximal propagation of the DVT along with a left  lower extremity duplex Doppler ultrasound.    Duplex ultrasound also showed extensive left lower extremity DVT up to the  common femoral, she does have bilateral PEs without evidence of significant clot  burden or heart strain, she is hemodynamically stable with normal pulse  oximetry.  The patient also has clots proximal up to her IVC.  I discussed this  with Dr.  of vascular surgery for possible thrombolysis therapy of the  left lower extremity.  She was discussed with SOUND for admission.

                                                At 9:59AM (9 minutes after vaccination) I suddenly felt dizzy and like I was going to pass out.  My body was tingling from head to toe.  My chest felt heavy but I think that may have been slight anxiety because it was a scary feeling and I did not want to be the person who needed EMS assistance.  I rolled down my window, took off my mask and took deep breaths of fresh air.  I slowly started to feel better.  At 30 minutes I felt much better and after an hour I was back to my normal self.

                                                Throat tightness; not feeling well; Upper chest pressure; A spontaneous report was received from a pharmacist concerning a 52-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced throat tightness, upper chest pressure and was not feeling well.  The patient did not have any relevant medical history. The patient denied any previous history of adverse reactions to vaccines. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Dec 2020 at 09:40 am, approximately five minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 9:45 am, the patient experienced throat tightness and not feeling well. The patient was pale and hypertensive. She was carried on a stretcher and placed on oxygen. Rapid response team was called in and treatment with intravenous (iv) fluids including iv push of famotidine at a dose of 20 mg was initiated. Patient was transported to the Emergency Department (ED) for further evaluation. Additionally, the patient received iv treatment with methylprednisolone succinate at a dose 125 mg and diphenhydramine at a dose of 25 mg. Throat tightness and upper chest pressure were reported to be relieved. The patient was discharged with prescriptions for oral prednisone, famotidine, and diphenhydramine to be taken as needed for recurrent symptoms.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events of  throat tightness, upper chest pressure, and not feeling well was not reported.   The events, throat tightness, upper chest pressure, and not feeling well were considered resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 52-year-old, female subject who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 039K20A), experienced the unexpected events of not feeling well; upper chest pressure and not feeling well. The onset of events occurred 5 min after the first dose of vaccine administration. The reporter causality assessment for the events was not provided. Due to the temporal association between the events and the administration of vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, and the events are assessed as possibly related to vaccine.

By 730p the temp was 102.8 with chills/muscle pain/tremors/nausea.  Began the fever reducing strategy.  No response - fever continued to climb and symptoms became worse until about 11pm.  Temp was 103.8 -took additional meds, cool water soak.  Temp finally began to respond and came back down in the 102 range.  Continued fever for an additional 4-5 hours.   I took fever reducers and cool water.  I was able to keep the temperature below 104.  I did not seek medical attention.

                                                this is a report of my personal experience I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine Wednesday January 20th at approximately 4:30pm Cox North. The injection was painful, the person administering the injection inserted the needle VERY slowly, and then pressed the plunger VERY slowly. However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt &#34;funny&#34; mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised &#34;bed rest and hydration&#34;) I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up. I was unable to remain upright, but could sit in a recliner at that time. I was unable to hold a bottle of water on my own until approximately 2pm. I had no headache, no fever, no nausea (after the initial 5am experience) but DID experience extreme muscle weakness until approximately 2pm Thursday January 21, 2021. (too weak to chew food) Friday January 22nd, I felt &#34;fine&#34;, but still mild tiredness. ( I was told by our office manager that I should fill out an RL to report my experience)

(They checked it after the vaccine and 15 minutes after that).  I normally run in the area of 116/70.  I had fatigue, headaches, and aches for 48 hours after the first one. After the second one my symptoms were more severe but similar although more dizziness.  I am on day 9 currently since my second vaccine and I still have dizziness, headaches and fatigue.   I have had email messages to my doctor and will be making an appointment to see her today.

After the first shot in January I became faint but this time, it did not progress that far, and I was able to control it with deep breathing etc.  The staff were on hand to assist as they were made aware of my reaction to the first shot.  I didn&#39;t need nurse assistance this time, and experienced normal side effects for the next few days (fatigue, nausea, pain at injection site, etc).

I told the nurse.  He asked me to lay down.  I did not get worse.  After 20 min or so I sat up and did not feel worse.  Just stable nausea and dizzy.  I asked if I could leave.  After verifying I had people at home I was allowed to go.  I felt exhausted and nauseous for the rest of the day.  I was confused the next morning about what day it was and had some hives at injection site.  I felt normal after figuring out what day it was.  I walked 8 miles and aside from the hives at the injection site was normal.  One week later I had headache, exhaustion and had an uncomfortable rash at the site.  The rash is still on my arm.    Should I get the second dose?

Worst part was, I had like a tingling and burning sensation that radiated to my extremities legs and feet. Sweating in feet that came in waves. I felt like my skin was on fire, like I was too close to a heater. Waves of numbness and tingling that was constant that lasted for approximated 5 days. Bad taste in mouth like a metallic taste. Blood pressure was extremely high. Worse at night. I went to ER on 1/3/21, because I was still having waves of burning and discomfort that was raising my blood pressure. I thought after 72 hours I would be better and it did not so this is why I went to ER.  Day 5, I had lost of taste, runny nose, light nausea. By day 6, the cough turned into itchy throat discomfort. Day 7 low grade fever. Day 8, everything started to subside.

Rash went away.  SOB lasted off and on for several days. Heart rate was off when I was working out for a couple of weeks.  I work out  so we wear heart rate monitors.  Heart rate did not recover as quickly as normal during my workouts. Took a couple of weeks for this to get back to normal for me.  Just really felt &#34;off&#34; for awhile and not like myself.  Did not feel comfortable getting second shot because of the above symptoms.

I went to the bathroom and thought I would be sick, but I remember being so dizzy that I went to lay on the floor by the toilet but my husband said he heard a thud, and came to find me passed out. Then I was shaking  (a vaso vagel response I guess) til I came to. The ems came, but everything was fine, so I elected to stay home. I threw up a 1/2 hour later and then felt better, and slept for a few hours. The rest of the day I was just exhausted. Today I woke up feeling fine! Just wanted to report the episode in case you track vomiting and dizziness and fainting.

I was seated on a sofa, my eyes closed and I lost consciousness. My daughter reported that my arms went back and forth as did my head. I woke back up and felt dizzy but fine otherwise. I have never had a seizure or anything like that happen to me on the past. I did have all flu like symptoms (fever, chills, body aches, headache) 12 hours post vaccine which I expected to happen. All of these flu like symptoms  occurred 2/23 and were essentially gone by 2/24.  I am not reporting the flu like symptoms as ?adverse ?. I am simply reporting the seizure like activity that occurred approximately 1:00 pm  on 2/24.  I did not seek medical attention but I am following up with my doctor. No more seizures have occurred.

The next morning I had a headache and my blood pressure remained elevated all day. I felt dizzy.  For the following 6 days, my heart would randomly race and I felt odd- just not myself.

They performed an EKG and blood tests. Everything came out normal. Doctor said it could have been an allergic reaction to the vaccine or its components. Recommended to keep taking my anxiety medication and report it to my primary care physician. The tachycardia lasted for 18 hours. It was a scary situation I don&#39;t want to go thru again. I&#39;m not taking the second shot!

Some hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills, headache, started vomiting and my blood pressure started bottoming up that is when I was rushed to the ER. I was admitted and stayed 2 days. They said it was not related to the vaccine. First they told me it was sepsis. Then they told me it was pneumonia, not sepsis. Then said it was a bacterial infection. I sincerely do not know what I had. I am doing better now. My PCP did not recommend me to receive the second dose.

                                                Resident had the COVID vaccine 12/30/2020. 12/31/20,  resident has been in bed all shift. Staff became concerned when resident was not easily aroused. Resident displayed signs of tremors, twitching, confusion, in and out of consciousness, low O2 sats, elevated pulse and fever, fatigue and weakness. Writer called NP. NP stated this is most likely a reaction d/t the COVID vaccine. She gave orders for Benadryl 25mg IM x1 now and Tylenol 1000 mg now. NP also stated resident will not be getting the second dose of vaccine. Will continue to monitor and update NP if worsening symptoms.   After receiving Benadryl and Tylenol at 145pm, resident began to appear as though she was feeling better and was talking to talk, fever had gone down. Tonight resident is not easily aroused, lethargic, continues to have tremors and twitches, almost appearing as convulsions. When asked if she knows where she is or what day it is, resident can properly answer. Resident denies SOB but staff has noted loud squeals while breathing. NP was updated and gave new orders to give Benadryl 25 mg IM x1 if needed and Ok to send resident to ED. Resident currently refuses to go to the hospital. Will continue to monitor. BP 152/112, P 116, T 99.1, O2 87-91. Resident&#39;s O2 at 1205am was 80% on 3LPM. Resident unable to be aroused from sleep by writer. NAR called to assist. NAR could not arouse resident. Writer and NAR attempted to reposition resident and resident&#39;s breathing became more labored. Resident turned back to previous position and writer called on call MD at approx. 1220am. MD returned call approx. 1235am with orders to send resident to ED. 911 called and ambulance arrived about 1245am. History of present condition given to EMTs and they stated resident would be going to Hospital. Writer has attempted to contact Hospital ED x3 but have been unable to get through. An EMT did just call to clarify when vaccine was given, what symptoms have been present and when they started. She said she has everything she should need and she will let Hospital ED staff know to call if they need anything else. Writer will again attempt to contact them though.  Resident&#39;s temp was 97.5 and BG 128. When EMTs arrived they got an O2 reading of 60%. Resident did open her eyes a couple times during transfer from bed to stretcher and while stretcher was going outside but no responses from resident were made.

                                                Following 1st Covid shot on 12/31; about 2 hours afterward experienced extreme fatigue, nausea, and dull headache.  All mild and expected as possible side effects.  No concerns.  Symptoms continued and by 1/5; all symptoms had move to severe level and are still occurring today 1/8.  Temperature spikes to 102.8; chills, severe headache especially in eye sockets, body aches, and heaviness in chest.  Could not work on 1/7 and only for a bit on 1/8 (working from home).  Became concerned and was flu and covid tested on 1/7;  both negative.  I was retested for Covid on 1/8 and still negative.  I am not sure if maybe I am sick with something else and this is coincidence or if I am just experiencing issues from the vaccine that are a little different from others?

I went to occupational health at work. They game me hydrocortisone cream 1%.  1/9/2021 I woke up to swollen red arm, warm to the touch. Reddened area grew outside of pen marked area. Began having tachycardia and an increase in blood pressure and headache. I made an appointment with online doctor who said to monitor BP and if higher seek medical attention. Got off phone and felt dizzy. Took my blood pressure again and it was much higher so I went to the ER. ER determined it was reaction to vaccine

Usual &amp; expected solicited SEs: fatigue, soreness, feeling &#34;off,&#34; transient headache, chills sx Day 2- strong R arm pain, cannot lift R arm.  Metallic taste in mouth and tingling tongue persists.  Also same usual Sx as day 1 plus mild nausea.   Felt really crummy.   Day 3- Still moderately strong R arm pain, can only partially lift arm over head, cannot straighten over head.   Strong fatigue continues, mild nausea.   By this day I recall having some unusual Noc . calf cramping.   Sx certainly improved after 72 hrs but some did continue up to 7 days.   Cramping returned as did odd R ear/jaw/throat nerve pain.  Scratchy throat.  Fatigue persisted, gradually improved.  I believe the non-standard SEs may represent an allergic reaction.  I deem this mild to moderate, as I was unable to perform daily functions at times.  I would like to be able to talk to a professional as to whether a second dose is recommended in my situation.  I am concerned to know if previous allergic reactions suggest increase likelihood of future and possibly worsened reactions.  Note: I have been unable to access my Vsafe reports today to confirm exact time frame.  The above is to best of my recollection.

The lump was hot to the touch and had a large red circle about 3&#34; in diameter. I had tightness in my chest and a headache.  I had took two Benadryls every eight hours for three days, since it seemed to be an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  At this date/time I don&#39;t have any further signs of an allergic reaction.

Symptoms did not resolve after a few hours.  ~ 3 hours later, took Benadryl and bronchodiolator and symptoms improved.  Also since injection have had mild GI distress gradually improving.   Reporting now because I learned reaction could be worse to second injection, and 30 minute observation period would likely be prudent.

                                                I was sitting quietly looking waiting for the observation time to finish and started feeling that my heart was racing, felt like it was over 130 but hard to count.  Had some water, moved closer to the staff that were administering doses and told them I felt weird and my heart rate was fast but feeling ok.  Would let them know if it got any worse.   I started to think I was having either a reaction or worrying about the side effects, etc. and willed myself to calm down.  It felt like an adrenaline rush and did not last longer than a few minutes.  I didn&#39;t report it  to VAERS at the time thinking it was &#34;just in my head&#34;.   Thankfully it went away and I did not need any treatment.  Just felt a little shaky and glad that it went away. Only other side effect that I had was a sore arm for a couple days.  Looking at the CDC website since then, I am not sure if I should get the second dose and would like advice on this.

                                                within 30 seconds I had a cooling sensation rush across the tip of my tongue, then a sweet taste, then more identifiable as bubble gum flavored.  By 12:45 I noticed I was scratching several areas of my body. Arms, legs, chest, neck, back and scalp and kept clearing my throat.  I looked down at my arm and seen a red welt from my elbow to my wrist in my left arm and a fine red rash beneath skin on right arm.  I looked up at the pharmacist and he said at 12:40 he had already placed a call to have another pharmacist come to look me over.   I then noticed that my heart seemed to be racing and feeling winded.  I figured this was my anxiety and just tried to relax.  The second pharmacist arrived and we walked to the ER.  I was very winded. They took me to a room and checked stats.  after 3 attempts taking my BP and using two different cuffs, she said my BP was 190/90 where it is typically 120/70. I drank lots of water and they monitored me for almost an hour and gave me another Benadryl.  My BP came down to 180/82 , breathing was easier and itching was decreasing so I chose to return to my station and I took one more Benadryl.  The following day: woke up with head ache in rt eye and fuzzy vision all day, mild sore throat, mild body aches, queasy stomach, fatigue and runny nose.  Took a Pepcid for stomach, Tylenol/Advil duo for sore throat, headache/body aches, drank lots of water and rested.  Following day most symptoms resided, still  slight sore throat, rt eye blurred vision, coughing, sneezing and runny nose.  everyday since, symptoms continue to decrease.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA received on Saturday.  Sunday morning in the middle of my sleep, I woke feeling hot and sweaty, slightly nauseated, and like I had to defecate.  I stood up, felt like low blood pressure but wanted to get to the bathroom.  I walked towards the door, opened the door and fainted, falling backwards.  My spouse  states I was pale,staring at the ceiling and kind of stiff in my arms and legs for about 3 minutes.  He spoke to me, checked my pulse, covered me, poked my feet. As I came back to awareness I tried to speak and was unintelligible but then became more conscious.  He tested me with questions to make sure I was ok.  I defecated after that but did not vomit.  I was tired the rest of the day and napped for several hours.  I don&#39;t seem to have hurt anything in the fall.  I am instructed to be off work Monday by my supervisor.

                                                a couple hours after the vaccine, I experienced a bit of rapid heart rate, which resolved after a few minutes. The following day around 3 pm I began to have chills and felt like I had the raid heart rate again.  By 5 pm I was beginning to feel really bad, I was freezing, chills and my heart rate was now extremely fast, I was having trouble speaking complete sentences, my husband drove me to the emergency department.  I had a very high heart rate and high fever, I was admitted and in the hospital until Sunday afternoon. The diagnosis was pneumonia,  I don&#39;t really believe this, as I felt fine and had  no symptoms prior to the onset of the fever.

About an hour later while watching TV, a hot flash/flush came over my head and upper torso. I noticed bright red checks and nose which resolved within a couple hours (without any intervention). Temp was elevated per touch, and clammy. Blood pressure was elevated for several days 160-180s/86-100. A small scar on my finger from cyst removal 7 wks prior became inflamed and red w/ burning/tingling for 3 days.   Anticipated SE did included head ache, sore arm, fatigue and sleepiness for 2.5 days. (previous vaccines only resulted in sore arm--all other SE above (esp becoming possessed with fury), were new experiences.

The next morning I was still feeling the same chills and ached and had cold symptoms as well.  Around noon I started to have a temp that went to 102.5. The aches in my body were horrible, my legs being the worst. I slept on and off from 6 pm on, my O2 levels were 89-90 and my pulse was high.  I woke up this morning at 6 am in a pool of sweat, my fever broke and I am feeling better. My aches are going away as well. I am tired, still feel a little weak and my chest feels a little heavy.

I did not even think about it being a reaction to the shot.  I took some Benadryl and a beta blocker because my heart was racing.   I laid down and about an hour later it was better.   I checked with my pcp dr.  She recommended that I take Benadryl before the next dose and ordered an epipen.   I have had anaphalxis previously due to a mango allergy.   I took the Benadryl before and was very nervous.  Eskenazi was amazing.  They assigned me a special watch person and kept me for 30 min.  I felt a little funny.... tingly face and my tongue was not normal.  When I got home I took a second Benadryl and a nap and then felt fine.

                                                On day 11 post vaccine administration, I started to experience an irregular heart rhythm.  I went to the ED at my place of employment and was found to be in atrial flutter.  Just prior to them administering a medication (metropolol), I spontaneously converted back to sinus rhythm.  I was sent home and told to follow up with my PCP or go to the ED should it return.   The following evening around 515 pm, I went into the same type of rhythm so went to the ED for evaluation.  I was again found to be in atrial flutter after a repeat EKG was done.  About two hours after arriving, I was cardioverted and my rhythm returned to sinus rhythm. I was discharged home and continue to be in sinus rhythm and am now on blood thinners.

Sat up, grabbed washcloth with cool water, applied to face and neck, popped pillows so could sleep partially upright.  Whole episode lasted about 10 minutes and then I went back to sleep.   Frightening but not life-threatening.  would have been scarier had I not experienced something like this once before.

                                                Approximately 40 minutes following the injection, my chest tightened and I had problems breathing similar to when I had covid.  I used my albuterol inhaler and got relief.  I had to use my inhaler more frequently (about 3 or 4 times) over the next 24 hours. Approximately 20 hours following the injection, I got body aches similar to the flu and became extremely fatigued.  The aches and fatigue lasted about 48 hours after the injection.

                                                About 24 hours after the vaccination was given I felt a terrible pain in my left arm at the site of the shot.  When I looked at the site it was red, hot and swollen.  I then became very cold (chills) and went to lay down.  I had the chills for several hours.  I then began sweating previously.  At this time my husband took my temperature it was 100.8.  My chest felt tight, my body ached.  My fever lasted for several hours. Through out the whole time I was very nauseous and I had a terrible headache.  By the next morning my fever had broke but I was weak and tired.  My body still ached and I still had a headache which last several more hours.  This is how I felt when I had Covid.

                                                Patient vaccinated on 1/22.  The next morning (1/23), patient experienced diminished sensory and motor function in left arm and leg, as well as facial numbness.  Presented to the hospital on 1/24, and was found to have a small stroke in pontine medullary junction.  Discharged on 1/25.  There is some suspicion that her COVID infection in December may have precipitated this, and patient is currently being evaluated for coagulation disorders, primarily antiphospholipid antibody testing.  It is unlikely that the vaccine contributed to this, but given close timeline between the two, filing this report.

                                                First three days was just muscle soreness and fatigue.  On day 4 I started having tight chest and SOB while snowshoeing, which I did not have the day before on same activity.  That night I woke up with SOB and tightness in my chest and severe pain in area of my heart.  I could not lay on my left side.  It seemed like I was having heart attack symptoms.  Barley slept but upon waking my heart rate was 94 and the pain remained in LT Axilla area.  Took it easy for day and that night again had trouble sleeping, SOB but not as bad.  Woke up with excrutiating pain radiating up the base of my RT skull.  Was concerned about blood clot potential??  Had SOB when walking up stairs.  My throat hurt when bending over, as if my esophagus was crushing.  Friends said my face looked puffy and I felt bloated.  Landed up reporting to ER at the Hospital on Monday, Feb. 1st as directed by my PCP.  Hospital was told I had just had 2nd dose of vaccine, but did not think it was related.  I will mention all tests below, but upon arriving home on Feb. 2nd, I discovered a rash breaking out on underside of my LT upper arm, LT inner thigh and LT lower leg.

                                                I received the shot approximately 7:20 am.  When I first got the shot I had an itchy throat approx. ten minutes after the shot with a small hot spot at the back of my tongue.  Then at approx 4:00 pm I started feeling fatigue.  I went home from work after 5:00 pm and I ate dinner and felt very fatigue and achy.  So I went to bed and had cold chills, was achy had a rapid hard heart beat and had a head ache.  When I woke the next morning I felt like I could not get out of bed, at approximately 5:10 in the morning.  My muscles felt like they could not get me up so my husband pulled me up to my feet.  I continued to walk around the house and get ready for work.  I am at work now at 9:00 am and still feeling fatigue.   I emailed my doctor to give him information of how I am reacting and questioned him whether I should receive the second shot.

                                                After receiving the injection, after 5 minutes I felt my heart racing.  I took deep breathes and it went back to normal.  I waited the 15 minutes.  At 25 minutes after receiving, I was driving home and all of a sudden I felt my muscles in my neck/shoulders and back tighten up.  Other than a sore arm, all was okay.  That evening I started running a temp, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, could barely walk, headache, as if I had Covid all over again.  I called my doctor on Monday.  I stayed home in bed Monday and Tuesday and possibly Wednesday after the first injection.  I worked at home the rest of the week as I was too fatigued to get dressed and drive into town.

                                                Ten hours after vaccine I experienced a hyperglycemic  event; my glucose was so high than neither my arm sensor (Free Style Libre) or my finger stick meter could read it.  It took 40 units of Humolog over a 2 - 1/2 hour time period to bring it down enough to read it.  It was 452.  By morning, six hours later and 20 more units, I am down to 236.  My systems started with my heart pounding out of my ears and neck, frequent urination, and sweating or feeling warm (usually associated with low blood sugar events).  I ate lunch after the vaccine, but by evening when I would normally make some dinner, I didn&#39;t eat until I forced myself to eat some cooked cauliflower at 12:30 a.m.  As I was finally going to bed, around 2 p.m., the cough started.  The cough is an itch at the base of my throat with a slight feeling of swelling.  I have sugar free cough drops and cinnamon candy (which helps reduce the swelling).  This morning, four hours later, the cough has a small amount of phlegm with it (but mostly just itches).

The patient was declared deceased at the  ER with the cause of death initially as cardiac arrest however a full autopsy was performed and  Coroner&#39;s office is awaiting that report at this time. We did not know of the death until we went back this week to complete the second round of vaccinations. Since the death happened in such close proximity to the vaccination date we felt it prudent to report.

The nurse could see me turning red and feel the heat on my body. My BP and HR were also high. After those symptoms started leaving I became extremely cold. My hands stayed so cold they could not get a reading on my oxygen level. I did not feel short of breath at any time. I had a total of 4 episodes like this with each one being smaller and leaving sooner. They gave me juice and a graniola bar, kept checking my temp and blood pressure. After an hour to hour and half I was released to my son and husband. I took a benedryl whenI left.

I quickly started vomiting  which was intense and persistent.  I had no food in my system so vomiting was mostly dry heaves, bile and what ever water I could drink.   Shortly after the vomiting began, I believe I passed out, fell and hit my head on the floor.   I don&#39;t remember falling but my husband said he heard the fall and I developed a large lump/bruise on my forehead.  The persistent vomiting lasted about 4-5 hours and other symptoms gradually improved.  1/11/21 I still have a milder headache, slight nausea and some fatigue.

My speech was Ok, my BP was monitored and was  a little elevated, nurse thought I was a little anxious because of my symptoms, BP was checked again about 10 minutes later and it was normal, they listened to my lungs to-all seemed to be well, except for these changing sensations going up my face, and lip. I stayed for about 20 minutes more, and returned to my office. Throughout the day changing sensations/lip area-that evening, my family said my lower lip was  drooping slightly downward-it seemed a bit swollen as well.  I checked in with the Covid Vaccine Clinic Wed. 01/13/20 in the AM as asked, and let them know i was still having symptoms in my lips, and felt slightly swollen on the one side.   It is 1/13/2020 @ 8:45PM and my bottom lip still feels strange(fluttery/tinglingly-not quite numb in sensation/  my cheeks/chin have intermittent differences in sensation

At 25 minutes, my heart rate increased in the chair,, the tip of my tongue began to tingle. When I stood up to alert a staff member, my head began to &#39;swim&#39;, like it was full of water. My speech became slow and I couldn&#39;t quite find the words to speak quickly to answer the staff&#39;s questions. My walking was slow and wobbly. Staff took me to a secluded room, where vitals were taken four different times throughout my seclusion. My b/p was high at first, I was dizzy and not thinking clearly. It took until 10:55 A.M. before my tongue tip no longer tingled, but became numbish, and my head became clearer. I was able to stand on my own, and then walk out to my car.

                                                Patient is a 55-year-old female who had presented to the vaccination clinic this afternoon to receive her COVID-19 vaccine.  She does have a history of migraine headaches and other comorbidities as described below.  Has had reactions to a number of medications, mostly narcotics as noted in her allergy list some of which could in theory be compatible with urticaria.  Does not have true anaphylaxis in her history. Today at about 15 minutes after administration of her COVID-19 vaccine she began to rather precipitously developed an itchy crawling feeling in her skin, nausea with retching and some shortness of breath.  She did not have the sensation of her throat closing off.  Did not have coryza.  Within about 10 minutes she did develop difficulty with speech that she says is typical for her migraine headache.  She received, in the vaccination Clinic, epinephrine 0.3 mg subQ, 125 mg of Solu-Medrol and 50 mg of Benadryl all IV.  An IV was started and a 500 mL bolus of saline was initiated.  With this she was then transferred to the emergency room for further evaluation.   In the emergency room she did develop chest heaviness but no palpitations.  She was not dyspneic.  Her nausea and vomiting by then had seem to resolve.

                                                About one to two minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt dizzy and lightheaded. Nurses came to help me and put me on the floor. I felt flushed throughout my whole body and the nurse said my face and chest was very red.  My blood pressure went up and I remember at one point the top number was in the 180s and bottom number in the 110s. My heart rate was fast, but I don&#39;t recall what it was from the monitor. At one point my jaw got tight, my face felt numb, and my fingers were tingly.  They  gave me a 50mg shot of Benadryl. One of the nurses wanted to give me an Epipen, but the other nurse said to wait and monitor me for a few more minutes to see if the Benadryl would take effect, which thankfully it did.  I would say the entire episode lasted about 20 minutes.  I never had a problem with breathing, throat closing up, or wheezing and the nurse told me after that my oxygen levels never went down.

                                                presenting to the ED for evaluation of reported reaction to the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient reports undergoing her 1st COVID-19 vaccination recently and did not experience any reaction with this whatsoever. However, she received her 2nd vaccination yesterday and initially felt well, but awoke this morning with the feeling of &#34;an elevated pulse&#34;, along with fatigue, nausea, nagging diffuse headache, left flank/low back pain, and soreness surrounding the vaccination site. No redness or significant swelling around the site. Also notes a brief episode of RLQ abdominal pain described as &#34;cramping&#34; earlier this morning that has since resolved. She has tried taking 500 mg Tylenol at 0800 without relief in her symptoms. No fevers, chills, dysuria, hematuria, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Patient reports being recently diagnosed with thyroid disease and began taking medications for this about two weeks ago. She denies any past medical history otherwise.

                                                I received injection at approx. 1:30 on 02/20/21.  No issues.  At around 5-6PM started to feel tired.  Went to bed around 9 PM.  Woke at around 4 AM to go to bathroom felt fine upon awakening,  Once in bathroom felt nauseated, and dizzy.  Washing hands felt REALLY nauseated, next thing I know, my husband is hovered over me, as I had passed out unconscious onto bathroom floor.  I landed on my left side.  No blood.  Started immediately with visiable chills, and fever accompanied by headache and dizziness.  Fever lasted until Wednesday mid morning.  Dizzy lightheadedness, and Headache is still on going.  Primary care Dr. had X-rays, and MRI to rule out broken bones and/or concussion.  Tests confirmed I had not broken anything, and I had not a concussion.   Dr. suspects the issues I am experiencing are from vaccine reaction.

I checked my blood pressure around 3:30 AM on the 27th and it was 124/70 Pulse 113. At that point I decided to wait until the morning to contact my doctor rather than go to the hospital.  I got up around 8 AM and my pulse was still fast, but had slowed down from the night before.  By around 9:30 AM my heart rate had normalized.  I did not go to the hospital or call my doctor as I believed things had subsided.

They determined that I was in afib. They gave me some meds and my heart went back into rhythm after an hour or so. I had fever and headache for 3 days and then cleared up. I have had the afib episodes 2 more times since then. I had never had heart issues before getting the vaccine.

                                                On 1/2/2021, about 45-60 mins after receiving the vaccine, I had mild right sided throat swelling.  It didn&#39;t seem to progress so I wasn&#39;t concerned.  I also developed the typical immune response (headache and sore arm) later in the evening on 1/2/2021.  On 1/3/2021, I woke up with a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and mild shortness of breath.  These symptoms continued on 1/4/2021, however, the symptoms were improved when I woke up on 1/5/2021.  On 1/7/2021, I received an allergy infection.  Within 24 hours I re-developed a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath (all vitals were stable).  Since I had no improvement in symptoms, I consulted with a physician and was placed on antibiotics and advised to continue with albuterol inhaler.  I&#39;m now slowly improving with my symptoms.  I reviewed this information with my allergist and they have advised me to not get the second Moderna vaccine, in case if what I experienced was some form of a mild-moderate allergic reaction.  I personally feel it is also quite possible that I could have had onset of an upper respiratory infection just after receiving the Moderna vaccine, and this may possibly not have been an allergic reaction.  Since this was not the normal course, I felt it should be reported regardless.

                                                About 2:00 or so I started feeling very hot and sweaty I walked up front and took my temperature. I was not running a fever. I walked back to my desk and sat down. I had a headache and put my head in my hands, I felt nauseous, dizzy and like I was going to pass out. The MAs I work with were asking if I was ok and other questions and I felt as though I wanted to answer them but couldn&#39;t get any words out. This lasted a short while and then I was able to answer them. They said I was very pale and my body felt like I could have just slid out of my chair and onto the floor, I also had some chest pressure and fatigue. A nurse came over to my desk to check me out, she asked the infusion room to come over and start and IV of fluids and some Zofran. They checked my glucose (122) after lunch, bp was normal. They got the stretcher and got me into an exam room and ran an EKG and called EMS for transport to the ED. When I got to the ED they ran an EKG, did lab work, continued IV fluids, gave me meclizine. They released me that night around 8pm and advised me to follow up with my PCP the next day. I called my PCP as instructed the next day. Due to the holiday I was set up with a video visit with my PCP on 1/4/2021. By this time my dizziness had improved and I was only dizzy with quick positional changes. The fatigue was worse and I had a sore throat, congested sinuses, loose stools, nausea, headache and occasional productive cough. My PCP prescribed azithromycin 500mg 1 tab daily for 5 days, staying hydrated and following the BRAT diet and COVID testing.  COVID testing was negative. Had follow up video visit with PCP  on 1/7/2021. Still VERY FATIGUED, sinus congestion and headache. Diarrhea, nausea and cough have improved. Due to continued fatigue and headache I called my PCP and she ordered more lab work. Due to resulting elevated WBC PCP ordered chest X-ray and U/A, culture if indicated. I am still very fatigued, it is taking everything I have to make it through the day.

On January 13, the patient presented to the emergency department again with shortness of breath and sharp, stabbing left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and right side. Initial work up ruled out cardiac etiologies. CTA chest demonstrated COVID-19 pneumonia.    The patient complained of bilateral lower extremity weakness which had been progressing since her COVID-19 vaccination, per patient report.  However, during her hospitalization the patient&#39;s bilateral lower extremity weakness began to accelerate.  On the 13th, the patient was able to ambulate to and from the bathroom herself.  Then on January 14 the patient required maximum assistance. Neurology was consulted and work up initiated for suspected possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) secondary to recent COVID-19 infection.    On January 15, 2021, the patient became obtunded and unable to protect airway.  She was emergently intubated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to GBS. Neurology started GBS treatment with IVIG. Patient also developed NSTEMI and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient remains critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation.

                                                On 12/29/2020 I took the 1st Moderna Covid-19 vaccine dose through my employer. Immediately afterward I felt a warm sensation down my left arm and then up my torso into my face. My face and neck turned red. I felt light headed and my chest was heavy feeling. My heart began to race. I waited the 30 minutes they asked me to wait and then asked the medic if these side effects were normal. He said no and gave me a Benadryl because I might be having an allergic reaction. The medical staff performed an EKG because my blood pressure was 160/100 which is not normal for me. The EKG was normal but they called an ambulance to get a better test. My second blood pressure check went down to 140/82. They wanted me to go to the hospital but I did not go.

The rescue inhaler helped reduce the effects but did not fully eliminate them. The Symbicort Inhaler also helped with breathing but not chest tightness. Although not severe, effects continued to linger 10 hours after injection.

                                                I expected possible side effects from getting the vaccine. I had a fever of 102° F beginning about 12 hours after inoculation, lasting about 36 hours, then an unrelenting severe headache lasting about 20 hours along with fatigue and weakness. I also experienced muscle/joint aches and nausea throughout the first 72 hours. All somewhat expected but to a greater degree and longer lasting than the many. What was not expected, and which began after about 48 hours after inoculation, was hyperhydrosis (even after fever was gone), lightheadedness, imbalance, intermittent palpitations and a neurologic tingling and buzzing in my body. Some of these are symptoms I experience intermittently with Long Covid, but they had been heightened by the vaccine. These symptoms along with the headache and muscle/joint aches continue though not as severely today, four days after receiving the vaccine. I do not believe these symptoms are due to any issue with the vaccine itself, but rather my pre-existing condition of Long Covid. To my knowledge there is no data on people with Long Covid getting the vaccine and I felt it was important to report my experience and unusual adverse reactions to the vaccine. Again, the vaccine had such a severe or prolonged reaction.

I got up and took one of my blood pressure medications. It&#39;s slowed down but I was unable to sleep due to feeling jittery and my heart pounding hard. The next day I felt exhausted my stomach hurt. I have had a sore throat the worst being on the Thursday following. Today Friday things seem to be subsiding.  However my concern is not to get the second dose if I had such a bad reaction the first time I definitely will have a heart attack the second time.

                                                Periorbital swelling; Generalized facial edema; Oropharyngeal edema; Felt faint; Tingling lip; Facial redness; Appears pale; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 56-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced lower lip tingling, pale in color, periorbital and generalized facial edema and facial redness.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No concomitant product use was reported.  On 13 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) in the left arm intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 13 Jan 2021, at 0845, 7 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient arrived for observation at urgent care. The patient stated she felt faint and her lip was starting to &#34;feel swollen&#34; and tingling. Initial vital signs were: blood pressure  147/79, heart rate  69, respirations  20 and oxygen saturation  99 percent. A nurse practitioner and doctor evaluated the patient and noted patient had oropharyngeal edema and lungs were clear to auscultation (CTA).   At 0851, diphenhydramine 25 milligrams orally was given with no effect. Facial redness and edema worsened.  At 0855, epinephrine 3 milligrams was given with improvement, but after 5 minutes, facial redness and lower lip worsened.   At 0902, a second dose of epinephrine was given.  At 0903, vital signs were: blood pressure  162/87, heart rate  104, respirations  20 and oxygen saturation  100 percent on 4 liters of oxygen. Facial redness and edema improved but still had swelling and tingling of lower lip.  At 0909, emergency medical services (EMS) were called and patient was transported to emergency room/department.   Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine, epinephrine and oxygen.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events, lower lip tingling, pale in color, periorbital and generalized facial edema and facial redness, were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 56-year-old, female patient. The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient experienced serious, unexpected event of periorbital swelling, facial swelling, oropharyngeal edema and unexpected events of Paraesthesia oral, erythema, pallor and dizziness. The events occurred 8 minutes after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She was feeling tired, slightly nauseous and very low energy. At about 4:50 PM that day, patient got up to walk to the pantry after eating some peanut butter toast. She suddenly stopped and shut her eyes and froze and then she began having a seizure (and she has never had a seizure before and seizures do not run in her family). After the shaking from the seizure ceased, her body tensed up and she fell flat backwards and she hit her head on the refrigerator. She then was going in and out of consciousness, she had a big laceration on her forehead and was bleeding rapidly. I, her daughter, witnessed this and then at 4:54 PM I called emergency services and paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Later that evening, the family was notified that the patient had bleeding in her brain, a concussion, a forehead laceration that received 15 stitches and a broken neck (C2 fracture). She was taken to the hospital that evening on February 8, 2021. Patuent experienced a second seizure while at the hospital during a CT scan. Patient later was able to come home February 11, 2021 in the afternoon. Patient now has to wear a neck brace for up to 12 weeks, cannot drive, cannot work for up to 12 weeks, and is still recovering cognitively from the concussion.

About 15 minutes later she said that her fingers on that hand were numb and her pulse was racing.  I gave her ice water (she took it with her numb hand)  and offered to walk her to the emergency room (we are situated in Hospital just by the ER).  Patient declined and stated she didn&#39;t want to be around sick people.  She then asked me if it could be related to the heart problems she has been having lately and stated she is between various cardio tests.  She continued to rest in a seated position and I continued to monitor her every 5 minutes.  I offered her a benadryl unit dose 25mg.  She accepted, opened the blister pack with both hands, and swallowed capsule and told me that she had a general unwell feeling.  She swallowed benadryl at 5:04 pm.  At 5:15 pm she said she was better and that benadryl had cured the numbness.   I cam to check on her at 5:20 and she had left the premises.

I told the nurses I didn&#39;t feel right, and I sat down for about 10 minutes and drank 3 glasses of water.  Initially I felt better, but then I felt weak and &#34;not right&#34;,  so I lay down on a cot for approximately 40 minutes.  My B/P was elevated (165/95), which is very high for me.  I did not have any trouble breathing.  I continued to drink water, and eventually my B/P lowered, and I felt better.  I took an antihistamine (10 mg Zyrtec) when I arrived home at 11:00 AM, and felt very tired until about 3:30 PM,  when I felt just about back to normal.  I was assessed by an ER physician at the clinic site.

                                                First shot of Moderna vaccine.  Had the shot and waited around 35 minutes and I felt fine.  I left and was a few minutes down the street and my lips started going numb. I turned around and went back to the hospital where the shot was administered and they had me see the emergency room doctor.  My throat did not start closing, my lips just were numb.  I have had serious reactions before and they start with the lips usually so I was concerned.  My blood pressure was high as well as my pulse.  The doctor gave me prednisone and benadryl and I was feeling good after 15 minutes.  I was in the ER 45 minutes to an hour and then was released with a script to take prednisone and benadryl for the next 4 days.and to come back if I got worse.  I never got a rash or anything else, just the numb lips and increase in blood pressure.  I did have a bit of a headache as well.  I am at work now (the next day) and feeling fine.  I did speak to my doctor and she did advise me not to get the second shot in the vaccine series. .

She had no complaints of SOB, Chest pain or any other signs of anaphylaxis. Initial vitals were  147/79, HR 51, O2 sat 98%. She felt as if her heart was racing so we listened to her heart it was regular and slightly bradycardic at 52 (Pt says the bradycardia is not new for her). We have been monitoring her close to an hour and she feels slightly better after she took Tylenol she had brought.  We gave her a donut and some water. She is feeling better and headache is going away, but still slight dizziness. We recommended patient&#39;s son come pick her up and keep an eye on her the rest of the day. She was advised if she has any SOB, Chest Pain, throat swelling, rash..etc to take Benadryl and seek medical attention immediately. Vitals at time of departure were BP: 145/84, HR 54, O2 sat 98%. Pt felt much better at departure just stated she feels like &#34;she needs to sleep it off&#34;

I asked my supervisor if I could leave work bit earlier because I did not feel well.  I went to the break room, sat down when I started feeling lightheaded and passed out in a chair. I had a syncope.  Under my right and left arm, my lymph nsodes felt inflamed  and the ER doctor said they were not inflamed but upon palpation were tender.  I was put on oxygen, my BP was extremely low.  My BP resumed to come back up within a few minutes.   At this time Iam still having trouble with my lungs, Iam on an albuterol inhaler as needed.  I had a folllowup with my PCP on 01-13-21, she extended treatment for Azithromax and  continue with Albuterol inhaler.

                                                Patient felt unwell and had a fever on Wednesday (1/27) and went home early from work. On Thursday morning (1/28), she threw up once and then laid down to rest. Her son reported seeing her that morning with the episode of emesis prior to her getting on the couch. Son reports that when he came home at 5pm, she was asleep on the couch. Teenage daughter reports patient had been asleep on couch all day. Son tried to wake patient up and she was disoriented and lethargic.  Daughter (reporter) was contacted to come see patient and on arrival to house (5;45pm), noted patient was confused, lethargic, febrile (104), and hypoxic at 83% on room air with portable pulse oximeter. Patient was able to stand and ambulate to car with assistance and was driven to Emergency Department for evaluation.   At emergency department, patient was hypotensive 80/40s but was able to increase blood pressure with 3 L of normal saline to blood pressure of 90/50s. See all tests performed and results below.  Patient received antibiotics, anti-virals and tylenol for fever of 102.7 while in emergency department. She was admitted to ICU that evening at approximately 11pm and had a foley catheter placed overnight due to decreased urine output. patient continued to have low blood pressure through morning of 1/28 and was placed on levophed for blood pressure control at approx 10 am. Her blood pressures continued to improve through afternoon and levophed was titrated down and then discontinued around 4pm.  She continued to received antibiotics for 24 hours after initiation and continued acyclovir during course of hospitalization and is still receiving doses on 2/2. Patient&#39;s initial mental status was confused, lethargic, and unable to communicate. She was intermittently oriented to herself only and would not follow commands. She would localize painful stimuli. Her mental status began to improve on Saturday when she started to become more awake but was still unable to follow commands or communicate clearly. She was moved from ICU to IMCU (step down unit) on Saturday once mental status was improving and blood pressure was stabilized. Her mental status continued to improve from Saturday 1/ 30 to Tuesday 2/2 (current). She began to have diarrhea on Saturday afternoon that continued through Monday and occurred every 1-2 hours. She was unable to stand or move body on her own and had to be assisted by staff to be cleaned. She remained awake and alert and was able to get up and walk on Monday and began to eat. She continued acyclovir treatment pending HSV meningitis panel PCR results (still pending currently 2/2). Mental status not currently at baseline but continuing to improve. She is also still experiencing generalized weakness. Hospitalist team and infectious disease doctors report she should be discharged tomorrow (2/3).  No source for confusion and hypotension has been found at this time. Physician team think HSV is unlikely but awaiting final diagnosis until test is resulted.

Felt like my head was going to explode and  i was disoriented.  and i couldn&#39;t  speak. couldn&#39;t even see to dial 911 or get my husband and after about 20 minutes or so i was able to get to my husband and he took me to the ER. There they gave me meds to get my blood pressure down and ended up admitting me to make sure i was not having a stroke. was in the hospital until that Sunday afternoon.

                                                I awoke at 2 am and got up to go to the bathroom.  I was extremely, severely weak, rapid heart beat, could hardly stand- had to support myself by leaning over sink and hanging onto walls to get back to bed.   I felt some dizziness and had slight nauseau but did not vomit.  I could not stand.  I had to get back to lay down.  Felt like my pulse and blood pressure was all over the place.  I normally have low blood pressure.  I thought I was going to pass out.  I was very shaky and felt terrible.    Felt completely debilitated.  When I laid back down and rest, things calmed back down.  I did take more ibuprofen. Arm is sore but expected that.   When I got up this morning i was still very weak feeling but somewhat better.   I have just been taking it easy.  Have little dizziness, but not debilitating like it was in the middle of the night.  did take some tylenol this morning for arm soreness.

She self administered her prescribed inhalers and took liquid diphenhydramine .  She reports hives and dyspnea that resolved by the following day.

These are still occurring, even though the general symptoms as listed below are subsiding.  Before receiving my vaccine, I was careful to drink a lot of fluid. Eight hours after receiving my second dose, intense body aches began including headache. It was a fitful night of sleep as I remember moving around in an attempt to stretch out the muscles that seemed to be tightening. The next morning as I arose I felt weak and chilled.  Highest temperature recorded was 99.0. Muscle aches, headache, joint pain (especially in my knees) persisted throughout the day. Rest and tylenol helped somewhat.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 5  hours after getting my first vaccine I had a breathing crisis with my oxygen dropping into the low 60s. I have COPD and use home oxygen as well as portable on the rare occasion that I leave the house since COVID 19.  I&#39;ve also had a thoracotomy and thoracentesis in 2019. But my oxygen never drops that low. We turned up my oxygen, I used my rescue inhaler, and we started a breathing treatment. None of it was helping and I felt like I was suffocating. My husband called emergency services. The EMTs got me on oxygen with a face mask and gave me IV Magnesium in the ambulance. I was breathing better by the time we got to the ER. They gave me additional medications and oxygen there. They took a chest X-ray too, but said it looked clear.

I have been putting pain patches on affected areas as well as cold and hot compresses. I am also getting treatment from a Neurophat doctor and a kiropractor. I drink lots of teas and take Tylenol When ever the pain is very severe. I am resting as much as I can and exercise as much as I can.  I have reduced my food intake to only vegetables, protein, and drinking hydrating coconut water and lots of plain water.

                                                A few hours after vaccination, I began to feel like I was getting ill, with fatigue and headache. I also experienced swelling at site of injection, along with hives on my face and neck on the same side as the injection. I had swelling in my neck, throat, tongue, lips, ears and eyes with some tingling. There was a red pallor on both of my cheeks. I also had slightly labored breathing. I took antihistamines and tylenol which helped reduce the symptoms within an hour. If I did not continue to take these round the clock for the next 4 days, the symptoms would get worse. Toward the end of the day, symptoms worsened regardless of antihistamine or tylenol and continue to do so as of yesterday, 1/3/2021. Symptoms have gotten better over the last 4 days. Its hard to say if I am fully recovered as in the evenings when I&#39;m more fatigued, I still have the tingling and mild swelling although the redness and hives have abated.

                                                Felt slight warmth throughout body about 5 minutes after vaccine. Disappeared 2 minutes later. Arm started to feel sore as the day went on and was very sore by nighttime. Next day, arm started to feel better and over the next 3 days was no longer sore.  On the morning of the 30th, woke up feeling fine, took a 3.5 mile walk and felt fine. Around 12:30 pm, experienced sudden pain and a burning sensation in the chest and both upper arms. Thought it was possibly heartburn ; took a Prilosec. The discomfort (mild but steady) continued so checked blood pressure which was 141/91. Called cardiologist and went to emergency room per instruction, around 1:30. Admitted overnight with the diagnosis of a mild heart attack and performed a heart catheterization where they found no major blockage. One artery noted 30% blocked but that overall heart function looked good. Discharged on 12/31/2020. -reported by patient via email, on 1/3/2021 @ 4:49pm

I was immediately taken to the ER and monitored for about 2 hours.  During that time I had about 4 episodes of my heart rate going very high. I was told 120-150 beats/m. I was also told that I had PVC&#39;s and PAC&#39;s. I was released after 2 hours and had  another episode of a  fast heart rate on my way home. Since then I have had daily episodes of fast heart rate but not as long and not as intense.  Last episode was 2 days ago.

                                                Pt had just been sent to observation area from vax station and reported that she was feeling &#34;very warm&#34; and that she was experiencing some &#34;heart palpitations&#34;.  I was called over to assess her. She was flushed in the face, BP was 134/80 with pulse of 80, regular.  She denied shortness of breath or chest discomfort.  She was wearing a warm sweater and hat, so we removed the hat and transferred her by wheelchair to a cooler area.  She was still feeling weak, so we initiated a 911 call for EMS evaluation.  EMS arrived on site within 4 minutes and performed evaluation.  Pt was less flushed and stated she felt much better. She was not transported. Left clinic with her husband.  I called her today to follow up.  Other than some site tenderness and feeling &#34;a little light headed&#34; this morning, she feels fine.  She stated that she took ibuprofen for the injection site tenderness.  Her entire episode at the clinic last about 12-14 minutes from onset to time she left with her husband.

                                                I started to have dizziness/ lightheadedness about 1 hour after the injection went home and got in bed for the rest of the day. On the next day more dizziness and elevated blood pressure I was unable to finish my shift. Called employee health they documented I told them how high my blood pressure was their advice was see my PCP or go to the nearest emergency room. I called my PCP she had me to increase my amlodipine to 10 mg and fluids followed by rest and to monitor my blood pressure.

                                                Unable to make out the Lot number due to illegible.  The pain in my right arm and around the back of my head and neck increased all day on Saturday, latter that night the pain woke me out of my sleep, and as I attempted to go to the restroom, I passed out.  I woke up on the floor where I had passed out face down, with a busted bloody lip and bruises and broken skin on both knees.  Very frightening, Thank God that I woke up because I live alone.   Thank you.

                                                Immediately following injection I had a metallic taste in my mouth. My heart felt like it was racing and shortness of breath. The lady who have shot said my face turned really red. Blood pressure spiked - they took it. Normally it&#39;s 107/70&#39;s-80&#39;s and it was 148/98 and my pulse was around 100 or a little more. Called Drs - to check heart. Okay. BP started going down and I sat for a little bit and I went home but I didn&#39;t drive. Went to work next day but I felt really tired. BP was in high range but not quite as high as yesterday. I was so tired and I went home for the day to rest because I couldn&#39;t work. Blood pressure started going back in normal range about 48 hours later. Metallic taste lasted about 3 days.

Vaccine staff reported my pulse was thready. They gave me water and put a cold cloth on my neck.  They also fanned me with papers. Within 15 minutes I was better and able to walk out of the appointment.  During the next 2 days I had runs of irregular heart beats and light headed feeling - also recorded on fluctuating heart rate on my Apple watch.  The night of my shot my gums bled significantly from simple tooth brushing and required 5 mouthwash  rinses before it stopped. By the 4th day I was back to normal.

Anaphylaxis is often referred to as slow roll and without the typical face swelling and rash. It is more subtle and can be harder to detect.  And that was my experience: as follows: I became faint and briefly passed out within 2 minutes of injection. I stabilized quickly within a 30 minute hold although developed increasing nausea, I and med tech was satisfied that it might just be my dysautanomia. I spent the evening with severe headache vomiting as passed out again. I experienced throat tightening but not full closure. The next day I had flue like symptoms that I assume were normaland vaccine related. When this passed in the evening I again suffered nausea and dizziness, vomiting and throat tightening when I tried to eat.  These symptoms were not similar to the flush feelings earlier in the day. The symptoms ebbed and waned for 2 days with increased frequency as I took chromalyn , Benadryl with some effect at first and ate with great care as not to introduce more allergens.  I had increased chest pain,  sweating, fainting, throat tightening became severe Benadryl was not effective. I was having trouble swallowing. I was forced to us an epi pen and call 911. This  is a typical anaphylactic response for EDS&lt; Mast Cell patients. It became clear that I could not get past this on my own and the symptoms were increasing. I started to shake with chills and feared shock as my chest pains increased. The epi pen injection and hospital visit via ambulance occurred Monday 1/25-1/26. I became very faint during the Ems intake with the techs having to hold me up to check vitals etc.. My HR dropped despite the EPi. At the ER I was given IV steroids,  IV Benedryl and Potassium,  tablets and fluids throughout the night, admitted for evaluation.

                                                Side effects started the same day I received the vaccine, which were reported on the V-safe app.  Started with very sore arm, within 24 hours progressed to extreme fatigue, joint and body aches, loss of taste and headache. I also experienced some mild nausea. By Wednesday evening, I began to experience heart palpations which I listened to as a nurse which sounded like PVC&#39;s. I have never had this happen to me before. I assessed my vital signs and noted that as the arrhythmia progressed, my O2 sat level began to decrease and my pulse began to increase. I could hear a definite pause in my heart rhythm. Within an hour, I had chest pain in the area of my left chest over my heart which progressed into a feeling of pressure as if someone was standing with a foot on my chest. As time went on, this sensation radiated into my back at an angle from left to right. It was at this point that I had my father take me to the emergency room. When I got there, my pulse was in the low 100&#39;s and my blood pressure was 230/130. I have never had this happen to me before. I ended up on a nitroglycerin drip. My magnesium level was low and my sodium level was low normal.   I was kept in the emergency room until Thursday evening then transferred to Progressive Care Unit where I remained until early evening on Friday.I was sent home on 2 different cardiac medications, Coreg and Lisinopril. I am to follow up with my PCP and a cardiologist. Both are brand new to me. I am now feeling better, but I am very reluctant to have the second covid vaccine. Also, the Hospital does not know what happened to me. (Facility where I received my Covid vaccine.)

I called 911 and drove to the nearest fire station where I was treated in an ambulance for my symptoms. I was released to drive home and contacted my primary care physician. My side effects lasted for three hours with pulse fluctuating between 58 bpm and 106bpm.

                                                Moderna dose 2 received at 1605. Patient reported funny taste and throat tightness. Oral diphenhydramine liquid 25mg was given. Tongue swelling and mild stridor were noted, prompting administration of an epinephrine pen and EMS was called. SpO2 noted to be in high 70s, along with persistent symptoms, so she was given an additional epinephrine pen as well as 100mg IM hydrocortisone. She was started on a 15L non-rebreather mask, IV was placed in the left antecubital space, and intubation kit was pulled from cart. Tongue and stridor improved after these doses of epinephrine and hydrocortisone. Blood pressure 190s systolic from 170s systolic after first epinephrine dose, with HR 116 at this point, and SpO2 99%. As EMS arrived, diphenhydramine 25mg IV was administered. At that point, tongue size and stridor were noted to have worsened again, so a third epinephrine pen was administered prior to EMS transport. Patient received racemic epinephrine inhalation nebulizer in EMS. Further treatment administered in ED: LR, dexamethasone and famotidine. Patient admitted later that day for further monitoring given hypertensive status. Put on scheduled cetirizine, famotidine, and dexamethasone and PRN albuterol and racemic epinephrine. Throughout her stay, patient continued to improve with stable vital signs and normal breathing. She was monitored for a total of 2 days and discharged home on 1/29.

The EMT brought the pt inside the building by the vaccine area where I quickly assessed her and administered 0.3mg of EpiPen AutoInjector.  The pt&#39;s lips gradually became more swollen, pt was able to talk and breath.  Pt refused 911 or other escort but agreed to go to the ED herself as she was with her husband.  Despite counseling, pt still refused 911. A public Health RN followed them to the ED and assured they were taken back quickly.  Pt was in the ED being seen within 8 minutes of the epi administration.  I called the ED to check on this pt about 60 minutes later and she was stable and planned to be discharged in a few hours.

I alerted the nurse, BP was 215/95 then repeated 190&#39;s/90&#39;s. I treated with fluid and Benadryl. The symptoms progressed to mild cough, swollen lips, and swollen inner ears. I took the second Benadryl and awaited my sister to take me home. The nurse waited with me and I assured her that I would use the Epipen and seek medical attention if the symptoms did not subside. I called my allergist on-call service who ordered steriods and encouraged EpiPen use and an ED visit. I assured her that I would seek medical care if anything worsened. I contiuned to take Benadryl and drink water. The pharmacy was closed so I could not start the steriods right away.I felt much better by morning so continued, then rebounded, took the EpiPen, and went to Ed where I was treated and released.

                                                Vaccine induced pancytopenia /  thrombocytopenia - STILL ONGOING WITH TREATMENT.  My mom felt very tired the 2nd day after the vaccine; blood taken ~5 days after vaccination showed lower HgB count (8.8 from her normal range of 11&#43;). She remained at home for recovery and then consulted a hematologist. During this period she still felt extremely tired / dizzy / headaches / couldn&#39;t walk up the stairs without breath. 13 days later - more blood sample was taken and now she is diagnosed with pancytopenia - lowered count of RBC (it down further), HgB (down further to 7.1), and Platelets (down to 80 from ~170 her first blood sample). And she was hospitalized. They gave her Prednisone, and a blood transfusion at the hospital. During this first stay - her RBC / HgB and Platelets seemed to have stablized and went higher but they didn&#39;t pay attention to her WBC - which went down to 2 (below normal range). A day later during follow up around WBC - it went lower to ~1.2 (her platelets ~117). She developed a fever - now it is considered a neutropenic fever and she was hospitalized once again (platelets was back down to 84 at the beginning of her stay). During this past week in the hospital, they gave her meds to induce WBC growth - which worked but it overshot to 12 (above normal range) and at the same time her platelets and RBC and HgB dipped again lower. Platelets dipped to 43 on Saturday along with HgB down to  7.1 after 2 days of sustained high WBC count so they gave her IVIG and another blood transfusion. After that, her WBC dropped a little further and is stabilizing around 6 along with HgB around ~10. However her platelets remain high volatile - it went to 51 on Sunday, dropped to 46 on Monday, and now it is 38 today. She was discharged from the hospital today and we have a standing order to have her blood tested everyday.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Thyroid disorder NOS and Blood pressure (Taking meds to control blood pressure.).    On 06-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Feb-2021, the patient experienced BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASED (high blood pressure) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and TACHYCARDIA (rapid heartbeat) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills), HEADACHE (severe headache), VACCINATION SITE RASH (rash all over in the arm where got the vaccine), RASH (rash trunk and leg), THERMAL BURN (burned), DYSPNOEA (trouble breathing ) and OROPHARYNGEAL DISCOMFORT (throat problem). The patient was hospitalized from 12-Feb-2021 to 18-Feb-2021 due to BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASED and TACHYCARDIA. At the time of the report, BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASED (high blood pressure), TACHYCARDIA (rapid heartbeat), PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills), HEADACHE (severe headache), VACCINATION SITE RASH (rash all over in the arm where got the vaccine), RASH (rash trunk and leg), THERMAL BURN (burned), DYSPNOEA (trouble breathing ) and OROPHARYNGEAL DISCOMFORT (throat problem) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included thyroid medication and blood pressure medication.   Treatment of these events included prednisone and Benadryl.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

My throat and chest became tight. My heart began to race. It was difficult to breath. I motioned for help. A physician on site came over. Emergency services was called. An EKG was done in the rescue. It was normal.  Most of the symptoms resolved approximately 20 minutes later. I did not go to the hospital.  I left feeling not completely right with some discomfort in my chest.  One week later my right arm at the injection site became hot and red 4 inches by 3 inches by 4 inches around and the soreness returned.  It is still slightly pink with soreness.

                                                Monday evening - Extreme pain in the arm where the injection was given. Swollen (like a baseball) and very red. I realize it would be sore; however, the pain radiated down the arm to the hand and upwards into my neck. A fever of 100 so I took tylenol.  Headache throughout the night and by morning my whole body hurt to the point I could not get out of bed.  Tuesday - I got up to go to the bathroom with help and lost consciousness. When checked at that time, I had a fever of 102, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms took place all day. I continued taking Tylenol for the pain. Not much sleep due to pain.  Wednesday - Some of the pain in the arm subsided; however, the spine pain was extreme. I struggled walking the pain severe. Throughout the day I was feeling a little better. Thursday - still body pain but tolerable.

After 20 min or longer the symptoms begin to dissipate. 1st event 1/8/21 in the evening. The following week another episode while driving home from work. During work 1/21/21 another episode took place and EKG done with negative result. That same evening during sleep another episode woke me up, although it was not as bad as the other ones and 20 minutes later i was able to go back to sleep.  As of today 1/25/20 no other episodes. I do take Famotidine daily and have been for several years due to acid reflux and heartburn, but never have I experienced chest pain.

Everything the pain and heartbeat both started to go  down. My heartbeat to went back down to 85. In the morning I was fine.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction. Shot given around 9am. Around 11am symptoms appeared: extremely hot/flushed, nauseated, felt ill, difficulty swallowing. Went to pharmacist who had me sit down, within 30 seconds could not swallow. Pharmacist injected me with Epi Pen and called 911. Paramedics arrived gave more epinephrine, oxygen, started breathing treatment. Lost my voice as throat started to tighten more. Taken to Hospital where I was given Benadryl, steroids, stomach meds, more fluids and another breathing treatment since my lungs were so tight, I could only take shallow breaths. The crated my lungs, did blood work and kept me overnight for observation because I have a history of secondary reactions when I experience anaphylaxis. I was released from the hospital on 2/20/2021 at 2pm.

I had a severe headache which felt worse than any migrane headache ever.  Body aches, fever of 100.4  and nausea which caused me to have to take off work.  I was tested for COVID-19 which was negative and I had a pounding HR as well which all symptoms pasted after about 2 1/2 days.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot, I did get a fine rash and began to itch, but this time was not as bad because I had taken the 50 mg of Benadryl two hours prior to taking the shot, after the shot I began tylenol,  because I was already aching and my arm hurt and was swollen and this time had a big red rash and knot., took Zofran because I was already getting nauseous.  Went home, laid down,  late afternoon, checked blood pressure, 2-21-21 110-74 heart rate 90, I was beginning to feel bad, was very tired, so went to bed woke up around 2:00 a.m. with severe headache, hurting head to toe, rash, head to toe, very nauseous, took tylenol, was unable to get Zofran, so woke my husband up he got the Zofran and also got the Blood pressure machine to check my blood pressure, it was (2 a.m.) 128-103 heart rate 75.  I was unable to go anywhere, was freezing to death, so wrapped up and finally fell back to sleep, woke up the next morning blood pressure was 2-22-21 108-78 hr 64, that night 119-72 hr 86, 2-23-21 108-78 hr 69, that night 135-85 hr 75, 2-24-21 120-73 hr 64 that night 133-80-78, 2-25-21 117-73 hr 72,/  blood pressure and heart rate have settled down, and the rash is gone, I still feel tired and arm is just a little sore, no longer having the shooting pains down my arm and out my fingers.  Have stopped tylenol and zofran, none yesterday nor today.  Feel pretty good today and the cold like symptoms are better.

This was also per her PCP instructions.  COVID Moderna vaccine administered at 1016.  After about 15 minutes she had chest tightness and tongue swelling. We continued to monitor patient, and she said she felt like it was getting harder to breathe and swallow. AT 1046 Epipen auto injector was administered in her right thigh and EMS was called. 1051 pulse was 79, O2 was 99% and she said her tongue was not as swollen.  Follow up BP was 125/70 and pulse 80, and O2 was 99%. at 1104, pulse was 72 and O2 was 98.  1106 EMS arrived to evaluate patient. She was feeling better and declined to go to hospital with EMS. She signed refusal and said she was feeling much better at 1114. 1128 patient left with husband, we advised to seek ER treatment if any further symptoms developed.  She had a personal EpiPen autoinjector to use at home if she needs it. She verbalized understanding and left our office at that time.

                                                Modern COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received my COVID vaccine at 7:00pm on 2/22/2021.  At 1:00 am 2/23/2021 I woke up to use the restroom.  I fainted and cut my forehead in the fall.  I was shaking uncontrollably following this.  My husband bandaged my forehead and checked me for a concussion.  Sometime after 2am I realized I was in atrial fibrillation.  I have a Kardia app that confirmed this.  I tried at home methods to go back in rhythm.  At 8am I called my cardiologist.  He advised me to go to the emergency room.  At this time the Kardia app indicated I was no longer in Afib but still had a fast heartbeat.  At the emergency room I had a normal EKG, CAT scan, blood work and chest X-ray and went home about 11am.

She was taken to the ED and was found to have a BP of  &gt;200/130. Patient had a seizure in the ED - was intubated to protect airway. CT showed some decreased areas of attenuation in the bilateral occipital lobes and cerebellum. MRI showed vasogenic and cytotoxic edema in posterior temporal, parietal and BL occipital and BL cerebellar hemisphere which can be seen with PRES. Patient required inpatient treatment for her elevated BP and neurological evaluation. Was started on Norvasc and Keppra due to concern for PRES.  Discharged with follow up in cancer center and with neurology. Hospitalist and neuro teams thought PRES was likely due to her  chemo regimen, patient&#39;s oncology team though PRES may have been triggered by vaccine due to timing and her dose of Avastin.   Pt has extensive oncological history including ovarian cancer w/ metastatic breast cancer in L axilla. Pt recently started on cytoxan, Avastin, pembrolizumab. Also has malignant abdominal ascites.

                                                Patient had an anaphylactic reaction. She experienced tightness in her chest and had was having difficulty breathing. She even looked like she was gasping for air. An epipen was administered and within seconds she was able to breathe. 911 was contacted upon initiation of the reaction. EMS arrived within minutes after administering the epipen. She was assessed by paramedics and it was determined that the patient would be ok. I called husband in the afternoon to check on patient and he stated that she was good. I also followed up on 03/05/2021 with the patient and she stated that other than soreness that she was fine. I let patient know that since she had a reaction to the first dose, that she would not be able to receive the second dose.
