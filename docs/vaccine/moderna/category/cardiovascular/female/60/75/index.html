This is not what triggered the visit. The reason for the visit was that she felt itchy all over, and this started at approximately 4:30 pm. Patient was given IV normal saline, benadryl 50 mg IM and Pepcid 20 mg IV. Patient had significant improvement in itching and was discharged from the ED at 6:10 pm.

                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

                                                Patient received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at her place of employment as a phase 1A essential frontline healthcare worker in a skilled nursing LTC facility on January 6 2021. The day after receiving the vaccine (1-7-21), she started to feel increased shortness of breath (she has shortness of breath at baseline due to chronic health conditions- CHF, asthma), a heavy feeling in her chest/lungs, sweating and fatigue. She contacted the pharmacy on January 8th, as we were the entity that vaccinated her to ask about vaccine reaction. Due to her medical history of MI and CHF, pharmacist did not want to dismiss this as a reaction to the vaccine, and recommended that she contact her doctor for further guidance. She did reach out to her care team, and ended up going to the emergency room for testing due to cardiac history and presentation of symptoms. She had diagnostic testing done (see item 19) and the ER doctor attributed her symptoms to an exacerbation of CHF and asthma, noting that vaccine involvement in the worsening of her symptoms can not be ruled out. Treatment/discharge instructions include: follow up with cardiology/pulmonology, furosemide dose was increased, potassium supplement restarted, and instructed to use inhalers already on hand when needed. As of time of report on January 9 2021, the patient was resting at home, doing well except still having symptoms upon exertion.

The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

                                                Buzzing or fizzing feeling, primarily in left chest, under skin, above my heart. Also I have arm soreness in my left arm where I got the injection, malaise/fatigue, joint pain, and mild nausea. But I&#39;m making this report due to the strange development of buzzing/fizzing in my chest.  It seems unrelated to breathing. I have a Kardia 6-lead EKG and it is reading normal. My blood pressure is about where it usually is (143/93, elevated due to as-yet untreated Cushing&#39;s Syndrome. I do take metoprolol succinate to bring it down somewhat, but diastolic has been chronically 90 and above for several months despite medication.) I don&#39;t feel this is a cardiac event, but of course I would like to be sure. It has been constant on and off fizzing/buzzing since 7:30 this morning (may also have been occurring while I was asleep), and it&#39;s now 11:08 a.m. My question is whether I need to go to urgent care/ER. Plan is to call Moderna and talk to them about this, and then make a decision about what to do next. I&#39;m reading online that this could be an immune response, that some people with COVID get the fizzing and buzzing. But I never stop with Dr. Google. I&#39;m going to speak with the manufacturer and then either my primary care doc or an urgent care/ER doc. So I clicked &#34;none of the above&#34; below, but I will likely be seeing a doctor today.

                                                While patient was waiting her 15 minutes after receiving the Moderna vaccine (1/21/2021), she complained of a bad pain in the left side of her neck &amp; that it was hard for her to breathe.  She was assisted by EMS (who was on site).  Her blood pressure was 249/149 per the patient.  She also experienced some lightheadedness.  It was strongly suggested by EMS &amp; nursing staff that she be transported to the ER but she refused stating she had to work the next day.  She continued to be monitored by EMS until her blood pressure stabilized &amp; she felt better.  She continued to refuse ER.  She was driven home by her companion.   On 1/28/2021 she sent an email to the health department showing a picture of her left arm showing redness from the injection site down to above the bend in her left arm.  She reported that on 1/26/2021 her physician  recommended that she not receive the second dose of Moderna.  She continues to complain of high blood pressure.  It is unkown if she takes medication for high blood pressure.

                                                Right after the 2ND  vaccine was administered I felt a warm feeling all over my body which resolved in a few minutes . Then that night my arm was  very sore and warm  where the injection was given. It was difficult to lift my arm. Also severe body aches and fatigue. Then I started to have a  severe headache, head pressure and ringing in my ears . Took my blood pressure and it was 145/98, 155/101 and 160/100. I am monitoring it daily and it has not been below 147/92 and as high as 163/97. I have never had a problem with my blood pressure before.

                                                I had a sore arm on Sunday night - and Monday it was really sore and couldn&#39;t use my arm at all so I called in sick. Got sick on Tuesday, the January 5th - woke up with a sore throat; hoarse throat; fever; chills; cough - and chest was congested.  Fever came and went. A bit of muscle aches in my chest from coughing so much. I called the DR and they sent me down to the COVID area of my doctor&#39;s office. They did COVID test and told me to go home. On Thursday, they reported that I was negative on my test. I called my Dr  and she told me she had to still be quarantined for 10-14 days. She told me to take my asthma medicine and she told me to take cough medicine (OTC) and take Tylenol if I still need something else. She told me to drink fluids and rest. I went back to work on January 19th, Tuesday. I still have a little bit of congestion and cough.  I had the second dose of the Moderna on January 28th. I had  a sore arm but not as bad as last time.

                                                Five days following the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed diffuse body pain, beginning in the right shoulder (for which she received a steroid injection), but then spreading to the entire body. This pain became so severe that she presented to the hospital via EMS, and was found to have a platelet count of 41 (9 days following the vaccine). No baseline platelet count is available prior to the vaccine (most recent was from 2019). Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is being considered, and the patient has been placed on IVIG and steroids. It is now 4 days into the patient&#39;s admission, and platelets continue to fall (currently 26). Hemoglobin appears normal at the time and there is no sign of active bleeding. Of note, the patient also has positive blood cultures, so thrombocytopenia as a result of sepsis is also a possibility.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

                                                Approx 30 minutes after my 1st Moderna vaccination,  I noticed that I was having difficulty swallowing water.  I soon began to not feel very well.  Sort of light headed.  My heart was racing.  When I looked at my watch it recorded my heart rate at 160 beats per minute!!  I started taking deep breaths and a technique called EFT tapping to calm me down.  Eventually it worked, but I felt extreme tiredness after that.  When I woke up in the morning my entire face was swollen.  I also noticed on the 2nd day after vaccine shot I had dark purple circles under my eyes.  None of those things have ever happened to me before in my life.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

The patient continued to monitor her blood glucose level and administer the correct amount of insulin following the  insulin titration outline.  The patient avoided eating large meals throughout the day.  The patient reported that her insulin levels began to decrease approximately 10-12 hours following the vaccine administration. The patient reported that she never felt the effects or symptoms of the elevated blood glucose.  The patient noticed the spike in her blood glucose due to the routine monitoring of her blood glucose.

On 3/12/21 she was in her car and started having stabbing pain in the left side of her chest under the rib.  She thought it was gas pains and dismissed it, and then it started radiating towards the front and the stomach.  On 3/16/21 she went to the ER and they did a CT scan that showed that she had a blood clot on her spleen.  With that they gave her the diagnosis of idiopathic splenic infarction.  She was then sent by ambulance to another hospital to be admitted in case she was needing surgery.  She was given heparin and on that for 2 1/2 days.  They determined that 60% of her spleen is dead, blood supply cut off to it, and the other 40% is nonfunctional.  On 3/19/21 they gave her vaccines of Prevnar 13, HIB, meningococcal, meningococcal B, and a flu vaccine.  She was discharged on the 3/20/21 with Plavix.  She saw her regular doctor yesterday and he diagnosed her with functional asplenia and to continue the Plavix.   She is no longer having any symptoms after dissolving the blood clot.

                                                She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.  Then her arm started hurting to the point that she could not move it.  On Thursday, 3/25/21 she was tired but functional.  Then around 5:30 PM she started feeling really strange, odd, felt faint, got hot/cold, her heart was racing.  She laid down as she was at a friends house, they checked her BP, blood sugar and her temperature and they were all normal at that point.  Around 8:00 PM she got the nausea that would not stop and took Zofran.  Around 9:30 she started throwing up.  She then tried Phenergan and was not able to keep that down yesterday.  Then she started running a temperature, and called her doctors office and told her what to look for and to call back if things got worse.  They then got worse, called them back and then around 8:00 AM on Friday they told her to go to the hospital.  When she got to the hospital they started checking things as her fever was higher, her liver enzymes, her thyroid, her kidneys, iron just started going off the page.  Her fever then kept getting higher and higher and at one point it was documented at 104.8, and felt like her organs hurt.  11 days prior to this visit she had just had labs done and everything was normal.  So due to the new findings everything was all elevated, so they checked her for an infection, COVID which was negative, but the intensity of the symptoms got to the point they were unbearable.  She stayed in the hospital for 4 days, and the doctor came in and noted that she had a severe reaction to the vaccine.    They told her to stay longer than the 15 minutes as they had some issues today, and told her that they had to call a medic for 4 other people that passed out, which made her wonder if they had a bad batch or not, and wonders how many people from that day got sick as well.     She still has the most dreadful fatigue, headache and cannot walk from her house to the mailbox without feeling like she is going to faint and used to walking 2-4 miles daily.  Wonders how long is this going to last and that this will pass and that she will be okay, or is she going to be permanently this way.  She feels like she has a bad case of mono or something and cannot stay up and has to go to bed, and also has bouts of insomnia as well.   The body aches are extreme and is taking pain medicine daily due to these symptoms, which she did not have prior to the vaccine.   She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.

                                                I recently retired after 37 years and now stay and provide significant weekly care for my elderly parents.  Because I am a primary caregiver for my parents, and have been throughout the months of the pandemic, I explored various potential paths to ethically and appropriately get in line for a vaccination.  When I took my mother in for her second vaccination at the Health Department in late in March I was able, while my mother was waiting, to converse with a county public health care worker about options and avenues for me to obtain the vaccine as well. She could see, clearly, that I was a caregiver for my mother, so she took down my name and number, and she called me the next day to say that I could, as a caregiver, proceed to sign up for their next clinic vaccination day that would be happening on Thursday, April 1st.   I arrived for my noon vaccination time at the Health Department before 12 on Thursday, April 1st. I proceeded through the check in line and screening questions, and arrived at vaccination site #1 at 12:05 where I was promptly given the Moderna vaccine (lot #026B21A).  Within seconds of the injection, I knew that I was having a reaction. My heart immediately began pounding, my tongue swelled and the room disintegrated into swirling flashes of color. I looked into the kind eyes of my vaccinator and remember distinctly saying to her in those first few post-injection seconds that, I was, ??sorry, but I think that I am having a reaction.?  The vaccinator then took me over to the nursing site coordinator who proceeded to check and record my vitals. I do not have that sheet with the vitals that she recorded, but I do remember that my heart rate and blood pressure measures were high. I sat as she continued to monitor me.  After 20-30 minutes, as best I can recall, my vitals were not improving, but remained elevated and even seemed to be trending higher. Also, the swelling and tingling in my tongue was worsening and seemed to be spreading to my lips and face, and down to the base of my neck.  I began to feel dizzy, like I was going to faint, so she had me lay on the floor with my legs elevated.  Additionally, it was becoming more difficult to breath because of the pressure in my neck. She had earlier and initially offered me Benadryl for the symptoms I was experiencing but I did not previously have good luck with Benadyrl the one time I took it, and also was unsure if I would have been able to swallow it. At 12:40 she thus gave me an injection of epinephrine (3mL) in my thigh and an ambulance was called. I was transported to the ER at the hospital. (Please note that the nursing site coordinator provided top-notch, high quality care through-out my entire emergency medical reaction experience, and I am very grateful and appreciative of her professional and caring response.)  In ER they monitored my blood pressure and pulse, and other aspects of my heart rhythm, as well as the swelling and tingling that continued in my tongue, lips, face and forehead.  I met with the Dr., and worked with RNs during my time there where they continued to monitor me for a number of hours. By about 4:30, when my vitals had returned to normal and stabilized for over an hour, they released me from the hospital. Since my release from the hospital, late in the afternoon on Thursday, April 1, I have noted only a few, relatively minor persisting symptoms which have included tongue, lip and face numbness and tingling. Also, I have noted, from time to time, some periods of continued heart rate elevation, though wonder if it is more of an almost ?PTSD? type of reaction than a pure physiological response, since, for example, just retelling this story right now is causing my heart rate to rise as I recall what happened.  Needless to say, this vaccination induced medical event, explained above, made for a surreal and frightening day unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Processing of it, and grappling with its implications, from concrete to existential, is seeming equally daunting, and it is here where I have a range of questions for which I am seeking assistance and perspective from the CDC:  The most concrete types of vaccination questions first: They indicated I should not try to obtain the second dose of the Moderna vaccine but that I should consult and maybe it could be given to me in a hospital setting? I welcome thoughts and feedback on how to proceed to become ?fully vaccinated.? What about another vaccine?  What about the additional boosters now being discussed for the new variants? Will I need to consider a ?cave dwelling? of some type for myself in the future since I will not have the vaccination card that is being discussed as ?the ticket to travel? in the future?  Will there be special cards for folks like me who tried but for whatever strange immunological reason was not able to take the vaccine? Increasingly complex, bigger picture questions next: Would any type of ?reach-out? to Moderna be in order? Or, do you, at the CDC, reach out to Moderna for me as a result of this VAER? Are they studying people like me?  My sense, from what little reading I have done, is that what happened to me, though severe, is rare, though definitely want the producers of the vaccine to know about my experience. Bordering on existential questions: What does this mean for me and my life going forward? Should I meet with Moderna, or some type of allergy specialist to better understand what may have happened, and what I will need to watch out for in the future? As everyone begins sharing vaccination cards and experiences, what should I say? I don?t want to scare others away from doing what is needed to save lives by sharing my experience, and don?t want to fuel the ?anti-vaxers.? What about the lingering disquiet and unease that something I sought to help and protect me seems like it might have/nearly killed me? The pandemic has already shaken and taken so much in so many of our lives.  Immunization seemed to promise to give back some of what the pandemic has taken, yet, feeling now that ?normal? is not only more distant but possibly will not be achievable for folks like me, rare though we seem to be?

I went to lay down and was not able to.  It was hard to breath.  I got up, went to another room where there was a recliner and sat in it trying to catch my breath.  It got harder to breathe.  I had my husband call 911. I went to the ER, had a CT scan of my chest and was found to have ?extensive PE?s?, ground glass and signs of pneumonitis.   I was admitted to the CICU for two days and was transferred for two days.  I was told by my orthopedic surgeon that there was a high unlikelihood of PE?s developing from my ankle fracture 3 months later.  I had home health care for approximately one month.

                                                started with metallic taste in mouth, progressed rapidly to clammy, light headed, elevated BP and HR. All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

Chest pain, left sided stomach pain, and headache persisted through the night.  I was able to get some relief by takin a 325 mg Aspirin and an Advil every 2-3 hours through the night.  The chest pain was pretty bad, considered going to the ER, but persisted to fight it through to the morning.  In the morning, around 6:30 am I was exhausted, but the worst of the pain was over.  I did take another Aspirin and Advil around 8:00 am and stopped after that.  I did run a low grade fever off and on of 99.7 to 100.4.   I felt better on Saturday, but by noon I was feeling generally run down and again started to run a low grade fever off an on the rest of the day.  Sunday - what a joy to feel totally well!!

                                                Throat felt tight with blood pressure and pulse elevated about 15 minutes after giving vaccine. 30 mins after vaccine was given blood pressure and pulse still elevated.  45mins after vaccine was given throat was no longer tight but patient reported lower gums felt swollen. No swelling visable. Blood pressure and pulse remained elevated. Approximately 1 hour after vaccine was administered the patient reported that her gums no longer felt swollen but her blood pressure and pulse remained elevated although had decreased some since initial readings. Decision was made for her to go to the emergency department. Called the patient later in the afternoon on 1/13. She was still in the emergency room. Her blood pressure was still elevated and they were planning on giving her an intravenous medication to try to lower it.

                                                Received the vaccine at 7:00 a.m. on 2/3/21. I woke up at 1:00 a.m  on 2/4/21 with a racing heart, sweats, severe muscle/joint pain. According to my Watch app., the resting hear rate upon waking was 115.. I had a severe headache and generally felt awful. I took Aleve and did deep breathing to try to bring heart rate down. One hour later it was coming down, although still higher than my normal resting rate of 60.  The arm where the injection was given has been extremely sore with a rash, sore enough that it is hard to use the arm. It is now 3 days since the vaccine, my heart rate has been normal. My arm pain is reduced but still sore with a rash. I feel fatigued and foggy. The severe joint pain is less but still present.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the Moderna vaccine, I experienced an odd sensation in my stomach increased breathing, HR, lightheadedness, and dizziness. (I  experienced a similar reaction years ago but more severe, after having a breast MRI   with Gadolinium . I will consult my primary physician by email today. Per consult with a family physician, the recommendation has been advised for possible prophylactic treatment prior to obtaining the second Moderna vaccine. On rereading the composition of the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, I noted that polyethylene glycol(PEG) is a component in both the Pzifer and Moderna vaccines. I also discovered that PEG is also used with Gadolinium particles in contrast dye. Gadolinium-containing copolymeric chelates. A new potential MR contrast agent. Solvothermal synthesis and functionalization of polyethylene glycol.  It leads me to consider whether contrast dye should now be listed as one of the allergens on the vaccination registration forms, in order for persons with this allergy to report this information to their primary physicians prior to obtaining this vaccine.

                                                10 minutes after receiving vaccine I had sudden sharp pains in my right ear.  I have had extensive surgery in and around that ear due to cholesteatoma and perilymph fistula, and I have had some nerve damage to the balance nerve.  The bones of hearing have been removed and replaced with titanium artificial bones that do not work, so I am deaf in that ear.  These pains were severe, as if a number of steak knives were stabbing me at once, but the pain only lasted about a minute and subsided.  3 or 4 minutes later the pain recurred exactly as before but lasted a shorter duration and at a lower level of pain.  The ear felt congested the rest of the day and I avoided driving after getting home.  I have had no further problems, except that I went for more dental work on 2/8, and had a dizzy spell after getting anesthetic, maybe a little heart racing for just 5 minutes or so.

She passed out and fell to floor. Lost her pulse and ED staff began CPR. She got her pulse back and woke up and said I am okay. Doctor seeing her ordered labs, EKG, Echocardiogram , chest xray, cardiac enzymes. All tests were normal. ED doctor told patient the only thing they could contribute this to was her covid vaccine she got the day before. She was admitted to the facility for further observation for the next 24 hours.

New symptoms developed as I am now feeling like I have tightness in my lungs when I breathe with mild difficulty. (kind of like when I have a chest cold). Also my throat feels funny like my trachea hurts.I have been reporting daily with the CDC app as suggested and have reported these symptoms as well.&#34;

The patient&#39;s medical history included Secondary Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. Products known to have been used by the patient within two weeks prior to the event was Sildenafil Citrate. Additional suspected products included Treprostinil Sodium, Plavix, and Aspirin.  On an unknown date, the patient received one of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot: unknown) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unknown date, after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced worsening of nosebleeds filling up towels full of blood, sore throat and coughing. Treatment for the events, nosebleed, sore throat and cough was not reported.   Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The event, worsening of nosebleeds filling up towels full of blood was considered not resolved and outcome of the events, sore throat and cough was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 61 year old female patient with medical history of Secondary Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Epistaxis and NS events of oropharyngeal pain and cough. The events occurred on an unknown date after first dose of the study medication administration.  A causal relationship cannot be excluded. Noting the subject&#39;s underlying medical condition and concomitant medication could remain a confounder.

Honked  horn physician came over, performed simple neurologic test and advised allergic reaction.  Had me roll down windows and sip water and to wait another 10-15 minutes. After 5 minutes throat and nose felt like they were closing. Paramedics came over and checked BP, which was elevated, and blood sugar which was very low. They continued to monitor me until symptoms started subsiding.  Asked if I wanted to go to ER, declined.  They recommended me to take 50 mg of Benadryl and to go to ER or call 911 if symptoms persisted or worsened.  Took Benadryl within 15 minutes of leaving and about 10 minutes afterwards all symptoms were gone.

                                                After 45 minutes of receiving vaccination , the knuckles in my left hand, the arm I received the shot in, began to hurt very badly.  Before I was able to get home,  7 minutes away, both hands hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t hole the steering wheel and I was having cramps in my legs.  I could hardly walk up the steps to my house because my ankle joints hurt so badly.  I went to bed  right away and slept .  My hands hurt really badly, but I knew the vaccination caused an inflammatory response so I figured just  rest.  By the end of the day Tuesday, I couldn&#39;t type and could not hold the steering wheel to drive home.  I felt out of breath, I hurt all over, my muscles ached and were cramping.  I was nauseated, very emotional.  I had a fever that spiked at over 101 degrees.  I was so chilled that I was shaking violently. I hurt in every joint, my lymph nodes were painfully swollen, my heart was racing, normal pulse for me is 68 to 72, it was 88 to 90.  Halfway up our stairs, I just stopped, couldn&#39;t make my legs work.  Day 3 I called my doctor, had a virtual appointment I knew I couldn&#39;t drive or ride 45 minutes away.  I missed 3 days of work, stayed home all weekend and was better by Monday.  It was 3 weeks before my hands quit aching.  The pain came and went in my ankles, wrist, knuckles, hips and knees.    Food still nauseates me.

She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

I started having darker urine about 4 days after the vaccine.  I drank cranberry juice and took a kidney/bladder supplement, increased fluids, but it continued dark.  I went to the Urgent Care on January 7th c/o muscle pain and dark urine.  My blood pressure was elevated, 179/100..unusual for me, and my urine was neg so it was sent for culture and blood was drawn for CBC and metabollic panel and Creatine Kinase

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the vaccine my blood pressure went  up 188/98  and my heart rate  went  up. 122 I could feel  my heart beating fast. I laid down thinking it would go away. I called my Dr  at 7:00pm and he told me to take a Clonidine .1 mg and rest. In an hour my BP and heart rate were down to normal. BP 133/78 heart rate 100. I am not sure if this was from the Vaccine or the anxiety of getting it and not knowing if I was going to be allergic to it. I have had no issues since.  Should I get the 2nd dose?

By 01/09/2021 she was bed bound, NPO, consistent fever, gurgling, hypoxic requiring 2-4 L of oxygen via nasal canula, and significant secretions requiring glycopyrrolate and suction. This progressed for the next days with decreasing condition and increase of above symptoms. Patient eventually could not swallow and developed rhonchi in lungs.

I asked Siri &amp; Alexa if it was ok to take pain reliever after 2nd COVID19 vaccine and they were useless. i had temp of 102 degree. I finally called someone who had reaction and they said Tylenol or Advil. I took Advil at  6am Friday 1/22.  All adverse effects continued throughout day except extreme heart palp. I took Advil at 11am  &amp; 3pm, I took Tylenol at 7pm  and aspirin at 11:30pm &amp; On Saturday at 3:30 am,.  Advil and Tylenol helped slightly, aspirin worked best or I was just exhausted.  I woke up on Saturday at 8:30am  and all was ok, except just tired a and my lower back is in pain still with numbness down leg. Probably  from laying around.

                                                About 9PM after the receiving the vaccine I started had riggers which lasted for about an hour. I couldn&#39;t reach for my phone or call for help. I either passed out or fell asleep. Around 1AM I woke up and checked my temperature 102.7.  Some point after I took some Tylenol but don&#39;t remember when. I finally had to call for help from my family in the morning because I was not able to pee or drink. Tuesday was my fever was still 102.7 with taking Tylenol and Advil it would just go back up.  Tuesday I had Riggers again about 5:30 it only lasted 3-5 minutes. Wednesday my fever went down to 101.4-101.5. Have had difficulty swallowing when the fever is high, did not feel as if I had a allergic reaction or that my throat was sore it was just hard to swallow.  I have a weird bruise on my arm I have clue where I got it. I didn&#39;t urinate for 9 hours. Headache. Pulse OX was at 93-94 for Monday and Tuesday but then it came it up 95-98 yesterday.  As of today I still pretty weak no fever when I woke up.

                                                Awoke at 11pm from a sound sleep feeling unusual but unable to identify anything specific. Checked my O2 saturation with my pulse ox and was 76% with a heart rate of 122.  Used my rescue albuterol inhaler which I haven&#39;t used since October (Fall and Spring are my typical times when I need albuterol inhaler and then not regular use.) Waited 15 mins with no change.  Took a nebulizer treatment of albuterol.  After 30 minutes was getting O2 saturations in the 80&#39;s. With deep breaths after an hour got a reading of 96% but wasn&#39;t consistently staying in the 90&#39;s.  Fell back asleep around midnight and awoke feeling ok.  I did not feel SOB when my saturation was at 76%, but my pulse was elevated to help compensate.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a 62-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced an anaphylactic reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as reported, included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome.  On 24 Jan 2021, about 15 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 24 Jan 2021, 30 minutes prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient took prednisone (dose unknown), per instructions from her doctor due to her history of anaphylactic reactions. She did notify the vaccinators of her history and there was an ambulance present. About 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient started coughing, had heavy chest pain, trouble breathing, and felt like her throat was constricting more than usual. No rash developed. She approached the ambulance and asked if she could take diphenhydramine. She took one dose, followed by 3 other doses, and felt a bit better. Consent given for Safety to follow up with patient.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of event, anaphylactic reaction was resolving at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62 year old female patient with medical history of included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome. She experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction that needed treatment diphenhydramine. The event occurred approximately 15 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration even thought the patient took prednisone prior to receiving the vaccine. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My right arm was painful at the injection site for 3 days after the vaccination.  Then on Wednesday, February 3, 2021 about 3:45pm I experienced shortness of breath and some chest discomfort.  At approximately 6:00pm, I felt a strong pulsating at my left temple which continued through the night.  I took my blood pressure and it was 150/90 and pulse was 103 which is the highest reading I have ever had because I am on blood pressure medication.  I took 2 aspirin, my Proventil Inhaler, and another Losartan 50 mg even though I had already taken my daily dose in the morning.  I rested and continued to monitor my vitals.  At about 11:30pm, I took my blood pressure and it was 160/110 and pulse was 109.  I then took 2 more aspirin and my Clonazapem and fell asleep.  In the morning on February 4, 2021, I tried to get in to see my doctor, but she advised to go to the emergency room.  I went to an Urgent Care facility and the checked me and did an EKG and that was normal.  But they also advised me to go to the emergency room.  So I did go and they did another EKG, chest x-ray, and several blood tests.  They came back normal but they wanted me to stay overnight for observation.  On February 5, 2021 they did an echocardiogram and a stress test, which were normal.  I was released from the hospital that afternoon.  I have a follow up appointment with my Primary Care Physician on February 12, 2021.  My blood pressure and pulse continue to be a little higher than normal.  At this point, the pulsating, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort have improved.  On Saturday, February 6, 2021, I noticed felt itchiness, redness and swelling at the injection site on my right arm.  It is still itchy, red and swollen as of February 8, 2021.  I am putting hydrocortisone cream on it.

By 48 hours, I was feeling better except chest, ribs, head, and neck and was experiencing 1-3&#34; episodes of spasmodic coughing, wheezing, SOB; Occurred every 20-30 minutes and leaving me physically exhausted.  Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

She stated that she was dizzy but that she does suffer from vertigo already. She said these symptoms lasted about a week. On the 1/14/21 she was tachycardic, dizzy, weak and she had a raised red rash distal to the site of injection. She went to urgent care and was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescribed an antibiotic. On 1/17/21 she went back to urgent care since the rash had migrated and appeared patchier than cellulitis. Her doctor said that he did not believe it to be cellulitis at this time and prescribed her a steroid cream.

                                                At 11am on 2/16, my arm began to get sore.  I took Advil at 4pm and it wasn&#39;t so bad.  At about 10pm when I went to bed, I had issues falling asleep because my heart felt like it was pounding through my chest.   That pounding came off and on during the next day.  I woke up twice and my feet were ice cold and my body was very hot.  The second time I woke I thought I would take some tylenol and was extremely dizzy walking to the bathroom.  I was so weak I couldn&#39;t open the bottle.  I slept nine hours, very unusual.  I felt very under the weather all day until around 5pm.  I woke up the next morning feeling pretty normal.  The arm pain was completely gone by the 18th.

Approx. 8 days after injection, noticed red patch (approx. 3&#34;x4&#34;) below injection site.  This  rectangle had surprisingly straight edges and occasionally itched slightly.  Six days later the rectangle is approximately the same size, but has lost its very straight edges, and has paled in color.   Perhaps 10 days after the injection, some swelling was noticed in the left armpit and an intermittent discomfort like a dull pencil poking a particular spot in the armpit was experienced. The armpit swelling/discomfort lasted about 3 days.

Approximately 9am the next morning I passed out without any type of warning (dizziness etc)  I passed out another 2 times during Friday morning.  I stayed in bed the remainder of Friday, felt sluggish on Saturday and back to normal on Sunday.

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

I then went to pharmacy desk and said i thought i was having a reaction and went to the bathroom to see if i was red in the face.  Yes, my face and body were red splotchy which is my indicator of having an allergic reaction.   I also noticed that my chest was feeling tight like my bra was on too tight.  The pharmacist gave me a Benadryl and i waited 15 more minutes.    The Benadryl relieved most of the symptoms after an hour but my chest was tight the remainder of the day and fine the next day.

Ten seconds later, her husband said that she felt like she was going to pass out. Upon getting to the patient, I felt for a pulse and observed mild breathing. The patient was unconscious and did not awaken with a sternum rub. The patient&#39;s husband helped me lower her to the ground, and I administered one dose of Epipen to the patient&#39;s lateral left thigh. She awakened and was able to state where she was, the year, and the president. EMT arrived later, and the patient refused further medical treatment.

The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 15 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 027L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 08 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 0101M20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The first dose of vaccine was taken in non dominant arm and second dose was taken in right dominant arm.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced swollen arm. In between the two doses she felt very hard to breath for few minutes and when she took a deep breath it was fine. She had tylenol for the headaches after the second dose on 08 February 2021. She also had nausea along with headaches. She had blood clogging when she was in a blood donation camp. The event very hard to breath for few minutes and blood clogging were considered as medically significant. Thiamine was provided as medication  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  Follow-up received on 17 Mar 2021 included updated date for first dose of vaccine, and the events very hard to breath for few minutes/dyspnoea, blood clogging/thrombosis.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a strong temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On Friday the 19th at approximately 4 pm I began to have the symptoms of an immune response in my body. Sat the 20th was spent in bed with chills, body aches, fever, stiff neck, and bad headache. On Sunday I was having pain on inhalation along with everything else.  Monday the pain resolved into left side lung pain on inhalation. Tuesday the 23rd I called my provider who directed me to go to the Emergency Dept. I drove to Superior Hospital. After being accessed I was transported; with pericarditis and the additional mentioned immune response symptoms, and a pronounced heart murmur. On Wednesday the 24 I shook uncontrollably with chills for 4 hours and 2 min and went into atrial fib for about 12 minutes, resolved with medication.  Thursday the 25th I woke to all symptoms being gone. I was released on Friday the 26th with the statement my issues had resolved themselves. I was told to report this to where I got my vaccine so it could be passed along.

                                                About 3 minutes after receiving exam went to sit down to wait for 15 minutes. A flush came over my body and I felt myself becoming  tachycardic. I spoke to the nurse who hooked me up to bp machine. O2 sat was fine at 98. BP was 158/110, pulse rate was 157. Normal values for me are bp 120/70, pulse 80. BP started to go down and several minutes later another flush happened and bp and pulse rate went back up. Dropped again then third flush with increased bp and pulse happened. After this vitals went back to normal and didn&#39;t happen again. I subsequently developed a pounding headache which lasted until the next morning. Arm was sore as expected. BP that night was normal and the next morning normal. No further adverse effects noted other than fatigue.

It was brief.  Immediately following that pain, the fingers on my left hand went numb and I couldn&#39;t feel them -- particularly my pinky and ring fingers.  I could move my fingers but they were numb.  I did not have a fever. This lasted about 2 hours.  I iced the site of injection, kept my hand above my shoulder and massaged my fingers for the duration (about 2 hours).  When this first occurred my heart was racing -- but that might have been because it scared me.  I feel fine today.

                                                The day after my first shot, my blood sugars went crazy.  Elevated up over 200-275 most of the day.  Tried to adjust with more insulin, and could not get them to decrease and stay in range.  My A1cs are usually between 6.6 and 6.8 and I stay in my target range 85-90% of the time.  It has now been two weeks since my shot, and the numbers are still elevated.  Is this a normal reaction to the vaccine, and will my second shot be worse?  How long can I expect this to last?  Have consulted with my diabetes educator at my endocrinologist&#39;s office...can&#39;t seem to find  solution.  She is thinking that the vaccine creates inflammation which would elevate the sugars, but after two weeks, it should be improving.  Am worried about 2nd shot.

                                                On Saturday on the 16th I started itching all over my body and my head, dry mouth and my ears were itching as well. On Sunday I noticed the itching  increased after taking my  levothyroxine. The 18th I noticed the same pattern of itching increasing after taking the levothyroxine the dry mouth as continued. Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

I started noticing the bruises were becoming more pronounced. On Monday when I woke up the bruises were worse, and I went to the ER. The doctor checked CBC and platelets count was low around 28 thousand and was admitted into the hospital and they treated me with solumedrol 100 mg. Platelets count went back up.

                                                Platelet count of 28,000; Generalized body pain all over; Weakness; On and off Chills; Low grade fever; Injection site soreness; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was a 64-year-old, female patient who developed a platelet count of 28,000 (thrombocytopenia), generalized body pain all over (general body pain), weakness (asthenia), on and off chills (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia), and vaccination site soreness (injection site pain).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 039K20A) on 31 Dec 2020.  On 28 Jan 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 209K20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an undisclosed date the patient experienced injection site soreness, generalized body pain all over, chills, low grade fever and weakness.  She also went to the hospital because she had a platelet count of 28,000.   Treatment of these events was not provided.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events, platelet count of 28,000, generalized body pain all over, weakness, on and off chills, low grade fever, and vaccination site soreness, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Approximately 7 hours after the 1st COVID vaccination on 2/22/2021, patient developed symptoms of fatigue, aches, chills &amp; fever. Her symptoms worsened into 2/23/21 with increasing shortness of breath. On arrival in the emergency center on 2/23/21,  she was hypoxic with  SpO2 81% on room air.  Oxygen supplement via nasal cannula was given which improved her oxygenation. Covid 19 test negative. Chest Xray shows pulmonary edema and CTA chest shows no PE.  She was admitted to the hospital and provided supportive care.   Pulmonary Edema and inflammatory process is likely associated with the vaccine. Patient appeared to be improving, however, on 2/26/21, she was working with Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy and had a pulse ox reading of 75% on room air. She was on 10 Liters of oxygen via nasal cannula by the time she make it back to bed and her pulse ox was 89%. Neurology exam shortly afterward the above event demonstrated an NIHSS of 21.  Patient became non-verbal and stat imaging revealed an acute hemorrhage in the left occipatal lobe likely representing a SAH.

                                                The same day I received the vaccine, some hours later I started feeling like a pressure in my head. It was not a headache, it was a pressure. It made me dizzy. I also experienced extreme fatigue and so much that it was hard to walk. Really hard to just get out of the bed. Like my legs did not want to move. I had to literally mover them from the bed. Cough. My doctor said after I had covid in June 2020 that my lungs were damaged and now they just work on a 61% capacity. I also felt like my lungs were burning. When I am able to have a productive cough and get rid of some phlegm, then I feel better, I can really breathe and feel like clean air in my lungs. But lots of times I just cough and nothing comes out and then it gives me a sensation that my chest is tight. Still, every morning I cough, just like this morning and my chest feel tight.

Potentially a side effect of elliquis; but her cardiologist does not believe ellipsis was the cause.  Heart attack at similar time due to blood clot and blocked artery and possibly reaction of body  to hematoma.   We do not have any hard data that either are related to the vaccine; but are reporting  them under the advice of a doctor to give information for science.

                                                Injection was at 12:00 Pm on 12/29/2020. At 12:20 PM i started to feel faint, slightly nauseous . I layed down on my office floor, , my heart rate went up to 140 BPM and BP was around 140/76. My MA checked it . One of my physician colleague&#39;s that was nearby checked on me as well as the nurse that gave me the injections. it took about 30-40 minutes for the symptoms to subside. I was sent to our Urgent care dept in the same clinic by wheelchair at around 12:30-12:40 pm. I was evaluated and my symptoms subsided in 30-40 minutes. I was out of Urgent care at 1:25 pm, able to walk upstairs back to my office and felt okay and was seeing patients again at 1:30 PM.  This reaction was similar to getting a shot of Novocaine w/ epinephrine for a dental procedure I received a few years ago, so if I were to sum it up it was like getting a shot of epinephrine. it was not a vasovagal reaction as my BP was high. I have felt fine since. I plan to get the second vaccine. Any suggestions to avoid these symptoms w/ the second one would be appreciated.

Went directly to ED. Sats  were good, no wheeze, throat swelling was noted. BP initially 150/93, peaked at 189/93,. Was 148/67 at discharge. Received oral Benadryl and Zyrtec, IV dexamethasone and Pepcid. ECG was done, no other labs. Observed for approx 90 minutes with improvement of all symptoms. Did need to take additional Benadryl dose approx 5 hours after first dose for return of mild throat fullness and rising BP. Both resolved within 30 minutes of dose. No further throat symptoms, BP fluctuations for over 24 hours now

These were happened within 15 minutes after the vaccine shot. The Healthcare team/rescue team helped me and let me practice deep-breathing. After practiced deep-breathing about 5 - 15 minutes, my heartbeats reduced to around 80 - 90/minutes and my blood pressure went back to normal about 120/75. I left the clinic around 10:25am.

The redness went down my arm to my inner elbow down my forearm to my wrist. The redness going down my arm was not as bad after I took the Allegra.  It was all extremely painful. I had to go see Dr. because the itching was so bad. Dr. prescribed medicine for the swelling/itching.  At times my throat was sore and my face was flushed and I had a tightness in my chest. But that did not last long.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

Immediately after the vaccine my face got hot and bright red as it does when I have an allergic reaction.  My heart rate raced and chest felt weird, but immediately I had tingling in my left arm from the vaccine. I was winded when speaking for about 24 hours. When I got home, I began taking Benedryl. My arm still has a hard knot and is still red and hot. I&#39;m trying to find out what to do about the red, fever at injection site and the redness. It&#39;s starting to itch. This has been 10 days ago that I had the vaccine. I&#39;m not an antivaxxer and look forward to my second vaccine on February 8, but I&#39;m a little apprehensive.

I recovered quickly.  Once home I monitored my blood pressure and it was low.  The lowest reading was 88/70.  I laid down and within a couple hours my pressure was more normal. I did not feel faint at that time.  I have severe anxiety and am not sure if that contributed to this episode.  Additionally, my blood pressure is on the low side of normal.

                                                Grade 3 systemic reactions, much worse than the first time. Injection site (right arm) pain, swelling. Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Received first COVID vaccination Fri., Jan. 22 at 1:56pm. I was not anxious about the shot at all and was playing solitaire on my cell phone when  around 2:15pm it was like a switch turned on and I felt my heart racing and pressure on my chest. I notified the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was 200/90, HR 98, Oxy 100%. At 2:25pm it was 140/80, HR 96, Oxy 96%. And at 2:39pm it was 132/88 and the nurse felt it was OK to return home. My chest felt better at home around 4:15pm that same day.  I definitely had no anxiousness about taking the COVID vaccine, and was not worried about a reaction at all. Having that high of a blood pressure was a surprise because my blood pressure is usually around 117/74, and I don&#39;t get anxious about allergy shots or vaccinations. I have been taking allergy shots for over 15 years every month. I had taken my allergy shots in both arms 2 days prior to the COVID vaccination that was ok&#39;d by my clinic.

Returned to Convention Center, site of vaccination. Paramedics took vitals, determined I was having a &#34;minor&#34; allergic reaction and administered Benadryl. Within 20 minutes of receiving Benadryl, I was able to breathe and swallow without difficulty. No further complications afterwards.

I knew my mouth was hanging open and couldn&#39;t shut it. My husband took my blood pressure,  it was 61/50.  After a few minutes I was coming to, blood pressure began to come back up. My husband had called 911 when my blood pressure dropped so low.  By the time they arrived it was back up to normal.   I have never had any problems with blood pressure,  low or high. Or with dizziness,  fainting etc. I am very sure it was from the vaccine

                                                Vaccinated at 1:20 PM on 1/26/2021. Approximately 15 min later I was in the waiting area, the nurse had been pre-notified to watch me for allergic reaction . In 15 minutes my symptoms were fast heart rate, lips burning, dark red facial flushing, ears flushing, and anterior neck flush, body tremors, a rapid response team notified to evaluate me. I was administered a 25 mg  Benadryl tablet per mouth.  I felt stabilized and chose to go to the ER within the building for further evaluation.  Remaining stabilized, had a 4 hour wait until I was seen by emergency staff. My treatment was Solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and Benadryl 25 mg po. I was placed on a heart monitor and a pulse oximeter to check my oxygen levels the entire time I was in the ER. 4 hours prior to being seen by the ER doctors I had a CBC, a BMP blood work, and an EKG. After medications were administered I was observed approximately 1.5-2 hours. I was discharged with a 5 day medicine regimen to follow. Prednisone 40 mg per day; Pepcid 40 mg per day; Benadryl 25 mg every 6 hours. On 1/27 I chose to take the Benadryl 25 mg only because I had received the Pepcid and Prednisone the previous night late. On the 28th I took the medicine as prescribed but only took Benadryl every 12 hours. I felt Benadryl 4 times a day would not be handled well with my body. On 1/30 I was able to take the Pepcid and Prednisone but had to discontinue the Benadryl due to waking up with a spinning sensation upon opening eyes and a loss of equilibrium upon walking. I completed my medicine regimen on 2/1. Today 2/2 I woke up with symptoms of watery eyes, flushed face, mild facial itching, after drinking one cup of full caffeine coffee developed an increased heart rate and nervousness, was medicated with Benadryl 25 mg po at 10:00 AM along with my blood pressure medicine and potassium. Also at that time my blood pressure was 150/80. Three hours later my blood pressure had come down to 130s/60s but felt extreme weakness and felt the need to lay down and rest with legs elevated.  I continue with my day with increased heart rate with activity, so I have remained inactive for the rest of the day.   Also on 6:00 AM on 1/27 I was awakened with a heart rate In the 160s, I called 911, paramedics came 5 minutes later. On arrival my heart rate had instantly went down to the  112-120 range. The paramedics explained they have been treating COVID patients and have seen this a lot, we discussed going to the hospital but I felt I was stabilized and didn&#39;t need further treatment.   Also upon discharge from ER visit they had me get 2 epi-pens and I now have 2 epi-pens available at home.

On Saturday 1/23/2021, she had a fever of 100.5 F (11AM), nausea, light headache and chills. The temperature went down after she took ibuprofen.  Patient&#39;s husband enrolled her to V-Safe to report all the adverse effects she experienced. On Sunday 1/24/2021, her temperature was 98.3F. She still had nausea and no appetite.  She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

                                                The morning after receiving Covid-19 vaccination I fainted.  I was sitting, working on an i-pad and got up to go to another room. I walked through the house to another room. I noticed my arms and legs felt kind of rubbery and that I didn&#39;t seem to have control of them. I fell to the bed and lost consciousness for 5-10 seconds. This was all observed by my spouse. I  recovered quickly. The remainder of the day I had a slight headache and felt slightly nauseous. I took acetaminophen before going to bed and woke up the following morning with no complaints .

                                                Patient received her COVID-19 Moderna vaccine this afternoon.  She then started &#34;feeling strange&#34; a few minutes later, requesting fresh air. She was monitored outside for 30 minutes. Her O2sat remained &gt;96%ile the entire time. Her HR remained in 60s-70s. Her initial blood pressure was elevated at 210s/140s and improved to 140s/110s with calming relaxation techniques.  She did have brief jerking episodes of her lower extremities intermittently. They were suppressible. She remained conscious the entire time and maintained good eye contact.  At minute ~20 post-vaccination, she endorsed not remembering why she was there, requesting to stand up. She stood up with support and then sat back down. Repeat BP was elevated to SBP 200s.  Decision was made to continue observation in Urgent Care as her blood pressure was still elevated and she still appeared anxious. She was speaking in full sentences and was drinking water without assistance.  She was placed into wheelchair and brought to Urgent Care. However, during UC triage, she  reportedly informed nursing that she didn&#39;t want to be in the enclosed observation room in UC, that she wanted to go home. Her partner wheeled her outside to the patio. When nursing went to go find her, the patient had eloped.

It was harder to breathe and I could not even take a shower that I would be out of breath. My daughter checked my pulsox and it was 85. I couldn&#39;t really walk or do anything so my daughter  transported me to ER and lots of labs were done so since my D Dimer was too high they did a CT scan and it showed some blood clots in my lungs. They admitted me because they were concerned with the location of one of them. They did some heart tests too and put me on Eloquis and then sent me home. I stayed for 2 days. Then they scheduled me FUs with a heart doctor and a pulmonologist.

She grabbed onto the towel bar on the wall and fell hitting her left hip, left ankle and left upper arm.  She does not remember too much after that, but that she was in and out of consciousness until about 12:30 PM Saturday when she remembered being alert but nothing made any sense to her.  Her son came in and found her on the floor, she could not get up, she had a skin tear on her right elbow and she had been incontinent of bowel and bladder.  He started to ask her the orientation questions and got them all wrong, but she knew that she was confused and disoriented.  She could not get up on her own, called the paramedics and they took her to the hospital.  The confusion and disorientation lasted into early Sunday morning 3/28/2021 at about 3:00 AM when she started to answer questions appropriately.  As the day went on things got better, but still exist to this point today 4/6/21.  It was more severe as she came out of the confusion.  She has brain fog, inability to sequence thoughts, a little bit of expressive aphasia.  She had two CAT scans and an MRI that were negative for subdural or CVA&#39;s.  I had urine specimen and blood cultures to rule out a UTI or sepsis and those were negative.  Her kidney labs were normal.  She ABG&#39;s drawn and those were normal.  They placed her on oxygen and she sat for 3 days and then they released her to home.     Today, she is still having the brain fog, still the not able to sequence thoughts, general fatigue.  She is black and blue from shoulder to elbow due to the fall.

Called the doctor on call at my PCP&#39;s office and he stated it is probably rebound hypertension and elevated HR due to missing the dose of Metoprolol last night. His direction was to check in two hours, and if still elevated, take 1/2 tablet Metoprolol. Current readings at 2:00 pm are 129/97 HR 99. Unsure if related to Covid vaccine.

                                                Severe dizziness to the point I was unable to walk or even sit without fear of passing out or falling and had to lay on the floor. Rapid heart rate, nausea, felt like blood pressure was going up a lot.  Afraid I was on the verge of having a stroke. Symptoms hit abruptly with no warning. Were severe for about an hour and then started subsiding.  Gradually felt better over the course of a couple of hours. After about 6 hours, symptoms completely gone and I felt fine.

                                                While waiting 15 minutes after the injection, I begin to feel my heart bounding. I checked my heart rate on my Apple watch, it was 165. The heart rate slowly came down  to the 120&#39;s after approximately 30 seconds and remained their for thirty minutes. I felt better  and left the vaccination location. Shortly after, while driving home my heartrate went up to 152 for approximately the same amount of time  so I drove to my doctors office and explained what happen. They told me to go to the emergency room. By then my heartrate was 109 and I was feeling better. I did not feel the need to go to the emergency room, which I live less than a mile from the nearest hospital. Eventually my heartrate settled at 70-80&#39;s nearly 4 hours after the event.

                                                While driving home after leaving facility 15 minutes after shot, I started having an increased heart rate.  Once home, the rapid heart rate continued and I noticed throat swallowing was getting a little tighter.  I started drinking water and just breathed normally sitting down.  I went to a mirror to see if I could see any swelling of my face and noticed my neck right under my chin was red about half way down.  My chest seemed fine.  I continued to just sit &amp; drink water and soon the heart rate was getting back to normal.  I noticed the redness on my neck was getting lighter also.  I looked at my watch and it had been a little over an hour since my vaccination.  I did not seek treatment, nor have I called my doctor.  There have been no more adverse reactions.

The next morning after - so nauseous; and aching all over; so tired I could hardly move as I had joint pain, too. Couldn&#39;t throw up but nausea was there constantly - even when I went back to work on Monday I as still nauseated and still in pain. When I came home from work on Monday the body aches were gone and my leg felt numb. So it lasted a good four days for me.  No treatment except drank lots of liquids and stayed still as I could so nausea wouldn&#39;t worsen. I still ache but that might be because of my ruptured disc.

Took only one of my medications - the one to prevent migraines and went back to bed. Continued with body aches and chills on and off through the night. In the morning I had worsened vertigo and nausea, but this is typical of my vestibular migraines and I think that was what was going on. I called in sick to work, took one of my  pills for treating migraines and basically slept all day. I do not get migraines often - usually

Immediately felt a little lightheaded during the 15 min window afterward but was able to ambulate independently with walker just afterward.  After taking a nap, she woke with a headache, chills, a little shaky and feeling very tired.  She was able to eat and take Tylenol at the time.  For the rest of the day, she felt under the weather.  The next morning she was very weak, unable to ambulate and tachycardic prompting nursing staff to send her to the hospital for assessment.

I was very tired and slept for 12 hours that night.  Next morning, day 6, a rash began on my chest and spread throughout the day, until it covered my entire torso and both arms.  I took benadryl that night and by day 7, the rash began to subside leaving me very itchy for another day.

I was not light headed, didn?t feel bad but my heart started beating fast and went to 202bpm . I checked it on my finger pulse oximeter. It lasted about a minute I coughed and bear down and heart rate went back down. The next day I didn?t feel well, red rash about an inch or two below injection site, headache, tired, arm sore and temperature of 99.8.

By day 5 it resolved.

The patient presented to the ER just a few days after being discharged from Hospital.  The patient was treated as an inpatient at Hospital little under a week ago for a COPD exacerbation.  She showed dramatic improvement during this time, but over the last few days has started showing increasing signs of shortness of breath and severe fatigue.  She has no known coronavirus (COVID-19) contact, but states that anything is possible.  Her rapid coronavirus (COVID-19) test in the ER was negative.  However, her chest CT seem to suggest a severe viral pneumonia.  Because of this, the patient is going to be admitted to the hospital as she has failed outpatient therapy and is significantly hypoxic.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

                                                After receiving the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine the pt. (while walking around in the store with her husband) began to feel dizzy and weak. She came back to the pharmacy area and she was seated and had her blood pressure checked. It was high (194/84) but she reported that she does have high blood pressure and takes her med at night.  She was given a bottle of water, monitored and her blood pressure was checked twice again over the next 20 minutes. It read lower each time she was checked and when it read 156/84 she said she felt fine and was ready to leave with her husband. She also said she was diabetic and had eaten a small breakfast compared to normally. She will be contacted today to make sure she is still feeling ok.

                                                A little more than 5 hours after vaccination, patient experienced symptomatic hypoglycemia with a Blood Sugar reading of 48 after eating 1/2 candy bar and drinking gatorade.  She took a nap (knowing that what she had just consumed would increase her blood sugar) and woke up feeling better.  She ate dinner, and her blood sugar afterwards was elevated at 397.  She noted that this drop in blood sugar following the vaccine happened with the first dose as well, though she never reported it (symptomatic hypoglycemia with a blood sugar reading of 46).

My right elbow swelled up that evening, gone the next morning.

We gave her ice for the back of her neck.  We checked her blood pressure, it was 230/130, pulse was within normal limits.  Pulse ox was low.  An ambulance was called.  She removed her mask and stepped back so that she could breath better and her oxygen and coloring improved.  She said that her lips felt numb, so we gave her some benadryl just in case.  We did not give an epi pen due to her increased blood pressure.  Her blood pressure did start improving but was still high when the ambulance came.  They took her to the ER for evaluation and she will be following up with her pcp also.  The hospital felt that it was just a fainting episode.

                                                fainted at 5 am following her second Moderna Covid vaccine taken the day prior.  This is the second time this occurred in that she fainted the next day when she took the first Covid shot30 days  ago.  Paramedics were called, her vitals were normal and it was recommended that we do not transport her to the hospital.    When this occurred the first time, she was taken to her neurologist who diagnose a syncope for the incident.

The dizziness increased from mild to so bad I had to hold onto the wall to walk to the bathroom.  I took half a Benadryl but it continued to escalate and I took another half a Benadryl at which time it stopped escalating but did not dissipate until approximately 4:45 p.m.  I called my physician who was unavailable so I just depended on the Benadryl.  There were no breathing difficulties but I had a scratchy throat in the middle of the attack and my tongue went numb and tingly.

                                                Patient presents for pre-syncope and then subsequent development of chest pain. She was in therapy when she had to use the restroom. She was urinating and having a BM when she suddenly felt extremely lightheaded as though she were about to lose consciousness. She did not thankfully lose consciousness, but rather rapidly developed chest pain after this event. She was brought to ED for evaluation. COVID screen in ED is positive. She was infected with COVID in November, 2020. She has since had a negative COVID screen. She is now positive again &gt;90 days after first positive test, thus this will be treated as a new COVID infection. Place in negative pressure room. I am inclined to begin. Remdesivir as patient is always at high risk for progression to severe disease.  11/11/2020 positive COVID-19 2/13/2021 negative COVID-19 3/29/2021 positive COVID

                                                Got slightly dizzy as I stood up. Went to sit in observation room.  My heart was beating very fast for about 8 minutes.  Felt a tightness in my chest and had a slight bit of difficulty breathing.  Did not want to tell the monitors.  Afraid to go to a hospital with COVID.  My left hand turned blue and got cold and tingly.  That lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  So did the trouble breathing.  All subsided in 15 minutes.  Went home and took an antihistamine.  Had a light rash on my body.  Consulted with PCP and cardiologist.  They seem clueless.  We all agreed that i need the second dose but what is the antidote.  Cardiologist gave me a beta-blocker to take before the dose but these symptoms all appeared on the severe allergic reaction list.  The heart pounding was the most pronounced symptom.  What do I do?

Pulse rate elevated but attendant said not &#34;critically high.&#34; Breathing was normal. After about 20 minutes I started feeling better. Oddly, while sitting in observation room, my sinuses cleared up, and I detected an odd taste at the back of my throat. Developed  frontal headache about same time; took acetaminophen and it went away after 12 hours.

Had some tingling in lips and tightness in chest, felt light-headed.  Paramedics observed and checked vitals.  Pulse ox was good, chest clear, BP high.  Gave me choice of getting IV or going to drugstore and purchasing benedryl to begin immediately.  Started oral benedryl.  Went home and took 2nd dose.  Redness is subsiding, BP reduced. Still mild light headedness.

The patient was discovered to have a large saddle pulmonary embolism, went into cardiac arrest and expired. Of note, the patient received her second Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/23, which would place her first one approximately 12/25 if she received them at the appropriate interval. This information is from the patient&#39;s daughter and the ED record, the information is not available in CAIR. Per the daughter, the patient started feeling ill on 1/21, improved on 1/25, and then acutely worsened on 1/27, resulting in the ED visit.

Occasional tingling, angioderma around mouth. Disssapated after Benadryl.  Rash is gradually fading and requires less Benadryl to keep in check.  Had similar reaction to Shrinyx vaccine 2 years ago.  Rash lasted 1-2 weeks without Benadryl treatment.

Tightening of jaw (as when eating something really tart).  Pain felt similar to muscle spasms and would be bad enough to cause nausea &amp; vomiting.  When pain subsided would experience chills and shivering.  This would come and go over the next 5-6 hours.    Checked for fever, but temperature was within normal range.

I nearly passed out several times.  First responders arrived and found my blood pressure to be about 70/30.  Got in ambulance and given fluids.  Arrived at hospital around 5:15 pm.  Got more fluids and numerous blood tests, none of which were very remarkable.  My WBC was 17 but nothing else was wrong.  Left hospital at 9:00.  Physician assumes Covid vaccine cause these side effects.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the shot, my upper lip started tingling. Then both upper and lower lips were tingling. I could drink ok, so no problem swallowing. They took my blood pressure at the time and it was 104/55. I have low blood pressure but that was lower than normal. I stayed for 30 minutes and the tingling would come and go. They did offer to call an ambulance but I declined. I got up this morning and have 2 welts on my forehead and the left side of my lips are still tingling, and occasionally the right side. I will call my doctor tomorrow morning.

                                                RN was staffing a Covid clinic at HS. One of our other nurses gave her the 1st Moderna vaccine at 1:45 PM on 2/12/21. At 1:55 PM, the nurse who had given her shot noticed that patient was pale, and said she was not feeling well. Her BP was 179/110, and she said she usually has low BP. She c/o of &#34;feeling hot and was having difficulty breathing.&#34; She was seen by our medical director. After 30 minutes, her BP was 120/82. She said she ?felt a little better and called her sister to pick her up.? Later that evening, patient texted me saying I didn?t feel well when I got home, had trouble focusing literally and had a crying jag and felt shaky on the inside. I kept hydrating, took 25 of Benadryl and slept for 2 hrs., now feel close to normal. It was definitely a reaction to the shot-just weird!? Patient texted me on 2/13/21 that ?the FDA thinks one vaccine may be enough for 80?90% effectiveness, so I might not get the 2nd dose? On 2/15/21 patient texted, ?My PCP thinks what I had was a side effect &amp; recommends taking Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Tylenol before the 2nd injection, and doesn?t seem to be worried about it!?   On 2/19/21, I received a text from patient at 5:28 AM as she was scheduled to staff a Covid clinic that day, beginning at 7:30 AM. She said, ?I have been up for a couple hrs w/severe eye pain and can?t hardly open my eye but it hurts to close it too! At 10:37 AM she texted, ?I just got home from eye doctor and was prescribed drops 4X/day. Apparently, there are pin holes in my sclera &amp; cornea which hurt so bad I had lavender cold pack on all day &amp; couldn?t stand the light. It is a corneal abrasion &amp; I have no idea why that would happen suddenly?. The following day, she texted me a picture of her L arm injection site which she said was ?very itchy and hot! Not painful-? It was about 6 inches in diameter, red, inflamed,  delayed cutaneous rx.

Pt states she got her vaccine on Thursday and then developed severe GERD sx that night. She states she normally does not have GERD and she tried antacids and PPI for her sx. She states she tried to sleep but awoke with projective vomiting and was unable to stop this. She also had myalgias and fatigue. She went to ER and hospital notes indicate supportive care was given and sx resolved quickly. Pt never developed any CP or SOB.

                                                Post vaccine 2/9/21, I experienced drop in O2 Sat over a period of several weeks as I log my daily vitals (blood sugar, BP, Temp, Pulse rate and O2 Sat in percent).  I have O2 concentrator that I use as needed via nasal cannula.  I do have SOB with exertion due to Sarcoidosis of the Lung.  I notified my PCP on 2/19 of a morning sat of 89 which came up with O2 and breathing exercises, I also took a 20mg. Lasix and Mucinex chewable which usually helps with congestion.  With O2 and rest, my O2 Sat improved and extra O2 was stopped.  Then again my O2 steadily dropped over a period of a week, I coughed more (always have come cough), SOB. On March 7th, getting ready for bed, I became severely SOB, O2 Sat now 82, I called 911.  Was alert, oriented when Paramedics arrived, but needed 100% O2 and transported to Hospital, SOB was severe, gasping/drowning, loss of awareness, apparently resp. arrested, was intubated.  STAT CT with Contrast, and Echocardiogram, R/O PE, Lung collapse, etc.  (No PE/or collapse). MY supposition is that I had a slow moving allergic response to Moderna Vaccine (I am a former healthcare worker of 20 years) and currently work in healthcare medical devices in Ultrasound.  I closely watch vaccine development and read research articles on Sarcoidosis, vaccines and COVID. I participated and continue with a Sarcoidosis Study). I think I experienced cytokine storm with my ultrasensitive immune system. I use oral steroid (QVAR 40mics inhaled daily) which I doubled after taking the vaccine for a few weeks. I have had a MMR vaccine last June 2020 and Quadvalent Flu vaccine last August 2020.

                                                My mother and I received the Moderna vaccine on January 20th. About two weeks later on January 31st, she complained about her leg. It was swollen. Later on  that day, she collapsed, was rushed to the hospital. Died on February 4th due to anoxic brain injury due to DVT that caused a massive pulmonary embolism.

                                                My mom was very ill with fever like symptoms following her first vaccination on January 26th. The symptoms were even worse after her second vaccination March 2nd and included muscle cramping in her legs. Once she was recovered she only had a persistent cough which she attributed to allergies as the pollen count had been high. In the early morning hours of March 19th she was having difficulty breathing and chest pains. She was rushed to the emergency room where she subsequently died of cardio pulmonary embolism which the coroner indicated began within three weeks of her death.

I was laid down, cold compress. It came in waves over a period of 20 minutes. I was given a few sips of water. When it did not resolve I was taken to the ER and given IV fluids.  The doctor said I had an adverse reaction to something in the vaccine. The chief of Infectious disease thought I had a vaso vagel response.  While I am nervous to get the second vaccine , I will go forward and get it..

On Tuesday I felt tired all day long. At 7 PM, I took a Coke inside the fridge and I noticed and told my husband I was not feeling well. I put the coke in the glass, after I took the glass in my hand and then I fainted. Never in my life I have fainted before. I hit my head in the floor. Now I have some bruise in my face, mainly around my left eye. Feeling a little dizzy,  I am in quarantine I and my husband are staying home all the time. I have my doctor scheduled for next Thursday.

I went over and rolled patient over having her lay face up and then proceeded to ask her questions. We had a staff member called 911 while I was helping her.  I asked her how she felt and she responded and said she felt &#34;hot all over and dizzy.&#34; Her pulse was low (~40 bpm). 911 informed us to lie her down on the floor until EMS arrived which we already had been doing at the time. After getting off the phone with 911, she started feeling better and her pulse returned to a normal rate (~80 bpm). EMS still took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

While waiting for EMS to arrive her pulse was low (~40 bpm), but shortly before EMS arrived on scene her pulse rose to a normal heart rate (~80 bpm). EMS then took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Fainted; Did not feel well; Hit head; A little pain in arm; A spontaneous report was received from a 68-year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced the events, fainted, hit head, did not feel well, and a little pain in arm.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Relevant concomitant medications reported included ezetimibe, atorvastatin, and atenolol.   On 04 Jan 2021 at 9:00 am, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient reported that she took the vaccine on 04 Jan 2021 and she did not feel anything after but a little pain in her arm.   On 05 Jan 2021 around 7:00 pm, the patient went to her fridge for a drink and told her husband she did not feel very well, and then fainted. The patient reported that she hit her head and has never fainted before. No treatment information was reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome for the events, fainted, hit head, did not feel well, and a little pain in arm, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 68-year-old female patient  with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Syncope, the non-serious listed event of Pain in extremity, and the non-serious unlisted events of Head injury and Malaise.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events on the day after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

O2sat.- 96 up to 100 before I left  I really want to get the second shot when I am due.  My personal doctor can not give me any answers. I never got out of my car.  Did not get any extra care just monitored.  Only sore arm later.

                                                One week after taking the vaccine I developed significant swelling of the upper left arm at the vaccination site that gradually got worse as the day progressed. I also experienced a headache and a severe spike in blood pressure in the afternoon, which led me to think that my reaction might be severe. As a result I went to the local ER where they decided to keep me overnight for observation. The symtoms did not get worse, but I was given steroids and peptid intravenously, as well as Benadryl to counteract the swelling. Today, Jan. 28, I continue to have some swelling in the left arm, as well as redness.

Attempted to w as l holing on to things to ease the contractions. Yes the pain was as bad a worst contractions from labor. At 3am dressed to go to Ed but decided against  it duevti Covid concerns. Pain most server when I was either sitting  or lying  down. Terrible afraid to take second dose for tear that side effects will be much worse. On the intervening days no pain or paroxysms.

                                                At time of injection, I immediately had a headache.  When I got home my BP was as 140/90. I&#39;m usually 110/65.  I was very tired and took 2 tylenol and took a 3 hour nap.. was very tired for 3 days

A few days after that my blood pressure was going lower than normal and I felt dizzy, so I reduced my blood pressure medication and kept an eye on it. I also had a huge a lump in my arm and my whole arm was sore. It was red and hot to the touch.

By the time that she looked in her rear view mirror her face was swelling up.   Her face started to burn, fast heart beat, and dizziness.  Her neck started to burn as well.  She looked at the side effects.  She called her doctor and took 2 Benadryl as she recommended, and took a nap.  Her doctor told her to continue taking the Benadryl and to call us to report the reaction.  She still has the swelling and the burning sensation in her face, and is still getting a little dizzy but it comes and goes.  The fast heartbeat comes and goes as well.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Monday, 2-15-21. 11:45 am. ? Received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  12:30 pm. ? Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

                                                I had the virus in August of 2020 for 30 days until symptom free.  ON 2/6/2021 received first vaccine injection.  within 3 minutes a light headache started.  That evening, rash and itching on right fore-arm and under chin. took benedryl. Woke at 3:30 am on 2/7 not feeling well and left arm very sore and could not touch.  6:30 am - chills with severe body shaking and 101 temp.  7:30 am 102.2  took tylenot 8 hr 650 mg. Oxygen at 96, heart rate at 76 and BP 117/68. 8:00 am 101.9 temp. 10 am 100.6 temp. 1:30 pm 102.9 temp. 2:00 pm 103.3  Took Tylenol, extra strength 2 tabs. 8:30 pm used inhaler due to chest pains  101.3 temp. took benedryl.  Oxygennn @98  HR-82 BP 145/77.  11.00 pm 103.3 temp. took 2 tylenol.  Mon 8:00 Monday am continued/ 100.2 temp  oxygen 97  HR-70; 99.2 temp  BP 110/71.  7 pm. took Benedryl for congestion.   Quit taking stats.  Fatigue and rest took play at this point.  Since then have had intermittent low grade fever in 99.2 to 99.9.  Same with headache and extreme fatigue.  Have high risk husband that I take care of .  He had his first vaccine at same time.  No side effect at all.  I am scheduled for 2nd vaccine on March 6th.  I am very apprehensive about taking it with this reaction.  Please advise/recommend if I should proceed.  My PCP stated that these reactions were evidence the vaccine is working.  Is this because I had the virus???  Both the virus and vaccine have been really hard on me.  I am usually a very active person and since August, I have been struggling with fatigue.  First time in life.   Thank you.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

                                                Beginning about 9pm increasing soreness and pain in arm -by midnight arm was too sore and stiff to lift above waist Beginning about 11pm headache, full body joint pain, full body body aches, chills, fever approaching 99 (NB - my typical body temp is 97.2 - 97.4). As night progressed the symptoms worsened - about 2am intense back pain between shoulder blades radiating to chest, heart was pounding, temperature increased to 101 About 3am was in extreme pain throughout entire body, severe chills/shaking,  fever was 102.2, experienced minor urinary incontinence About 3:30am I finally had to take  2 Advil - within an hour the symptoms had lessened and temp had dropped to 100 By noon (22 hours after injection) I was experiencing only mild body aches, temperature was normal, left arm remained sore but I could move it - other side effects had resolved  I am very stoic and have a fairly high pain tolerance. I had no side effects after shot 1. After shot 2 I was sicker than I have ever been in my life ?- for several hours I was concerned I was going to die.

                                                I received my 2nd Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA on 2/24/2021. Had only a mild sore arm. When I woke the next morning I was fine with still just a mild sore arm. Then 21 hours after my vaccine I started getting chills and fever 101.9 which I read I could have after the vaccine. The unusual thing that occurred was how cold my hands got, they became so cold they hurt. I had a difficult time warming them up when I checked my oxygen level it was low, 89. I assume because they were so cold. This was very uncomfortable. I have never experienced this freezing hands before, and I have not seen it has a symptom so I wanted to inform someone. I started taking Tylenol with my fever and it broke overnight and I feel fine now.

We gave her a bottle of water to drink and crackers and she said she felt better. The tongue tingling went away as well before the 30 minutes ended. Her blood pressure was retaken before she left and it remained in the 140s/100s. She said this is higher than her normal but it could be due to anxiety.

                                                Fifteen minutes after injection, I experienced pain in my left chest. It migrated to the center of my chest and could be felt on both front and back. Pain was a dull, squeezing ache that could be mitigated by placing hand over the pain and leaning forward. Pain level was 2. The pain migrated to left shoulder and up left side of neck. Vital signs were normal.  A few dry coughs caused medical personnel to offer water, which was declined. The pain was similar to the pain I experienced after drinking contrast medium (now considered an allergic reaction) but without breathing difficulties. The pain went away after an hour and half. Nurses suggested emergency medical care, which I declined.

                                                First two days after vaccine- tired. By day three began experiencing back pain. By Wednesday, January 20th severe back pain and chest tightening. I went first to Urgent Care. Dr. said EKG ok but I should follow up with Dr. or ER. That evening I went to ER at Hospital. By then it felt like my back and chest were in vice. It did not feel like regular back pain- more searing and deep spasms. Had a gnawing kind of feeling in my stomach and esophagus. Pain in upper part of my body....sometimes waves of pain in shoulders and down back half of my arms. ER Dr gave me shot of pain meds and sent me home after a few hours. Vice like feeling subsided but deep muscle pain in back continued.It was not as severe as the previous day. Over the next week it continued to go from severe back to mild.I visited my primary care Dr/PA and tried changing GERD meds from Famotidine to another- no help. Tried muscle relaxers- I just slept on those. About a week after first visit I went to ER again after a bad night of the vice like feeling in chest and back. ER Dr. did CAT scan of heart and lungs. No sign of pneumonia . Since then I have had an endoscope, seen a cardiologist, and an orthopedic Dr.  After second dose, reaction came back, but less severe than the first time.

                                                Sent: 3/4/2021   7:55 AM Subject: Non-Urgent Medical Question                    For a full week now, I have been battling diarrhea and a very hyperactive stomach and intestines. Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).

The patient was hospitalized on an unknown date and was discharged after two days, date unknown.  Treatment information was not provided.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, COVID-19 and hypotension were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the event of COVID-19. The event of COVID-19 is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.

By the time I sat down, I realized I had no feeling or use from the left side of my body including my face. I also had trouble communicating. Could not form complete sentences. The entire left side of my face was drooping. At that moment my husband immediately called 911.  I was taken to the hospital by ambulance where i was immediately treated and diagnosed with a stroke. They administered TPA. I spent 3 days in the ICU. I have since been treated with blood pressure medication, blood thinners and statins.

                                                Felt a bit ill the day of the shot. Tried to help  do dinner later that day and turned white and sweaty and had to sit down for about 15 minutes. The next day injection site began to swell. By the 8th day post injection it was hard to the touch, about the size of a large marshmallow and hard to the touch. No skin discoloration,  but felt warm to touch and very itchy. Used Lanacanevto stop the itch.  Today the 11th, most of swelling is gone and just a little tender to touch. Did not contact anyone medical about this, but a friend said i should report it.

                                                36 hours later, (approximately), I woke up with a rash. Under the both arms it looked like a sunburn. Across the chest an sides, it was spotty. The right side had more rash than the right, and both sides wrapped around to the back, about 2 inches, on both sides. Less going down the rest of the torso. Took Benadryl, 2-25 mg, 4 hours apart, for a total of 100 mg. 1:00PM, Feb. 26, rash faded significantly.  Also had a dry mouth and a bit of a racing heart, right after being given the vaccination &amp; again when the rashes appeared. However, this could have been anxiety. Both times it went away after walking &amp; deep breathing. Lasted for about 15 minutes each time.

                                                One week after I received the 1st dose of the Moderna  CoVid-19 vaccine, I developed a bright pink, hard, raised area of very itchy rash at the site of the injection. It was about 2&#34;x3&#34; in size, was very warm and painful to the touch. The size increased over the next couple of days to about 3&#34; in diameter but decreased in symptoms (less pain, less itch, less hard, less raised and less warm). I still have the sensitive area today (Saturday, Feb 27, 12:33 pm) but it has continued to decrease in symptoms. The affected area is still about 3&#34; in diameter but has faded in color (now pale pink).

                                                Began not feeling well about 8 hours after my shot. That night I developed a fever (under 100 degrees) and chills. Had some heart palpitations. Next day I still had a slight fever, general malaise, soreness from shot in arm, a few occurances of heart palpitations, sore back. On third day, no fever, but still felt under the weather, with a sore arm plus some hardness in the injection area. Had some palpitations that evening. By the 4th day, felt better in general, but began feeling a very slight numbness on lips and surrounding facial area. Arm still sore with hardness. Better on 5th day. Day 8 &amp; 9 had pains in lower shins. Day 9 I noticed tiny small bumps on upper front and back shoulders and upper arms. They were not hive like and some were itchy. Took some Benadryl that night which didn&#39;t reallly help. Days 10-12 - still have tiny bumps some slightly pink, mostly skin tone, spreading to neck area. Saw my internist on 2/25/21 Day 14 to ask if symptoms related to vaccine shot. He didn&#39;t think the rash was related because it didn&#39;t start away after shot. The continuing ever so slight numbness in lips and surrounding area may be just from anxiety, he said. 3/1/21 - still have occasional slight numbness off and on of lips with &#34;grainy&#34; rash still present.

                                                spontaneous bleed; bruise on the shin; sore arm; hives; nose bleed; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning a 69 years-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced sore arm, hives, nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin.    The patient&#39;s medical history included Von Willebrand Disease and breast cancer. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 JAN 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 012L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date post-vaccination, the patient experienced a sore arm and some hives. Approximately two weeks after the first dose, the patient experienced a spontaneous bleed resulting in a huge bruise on the shin the size of the palm of their hand. The patient consulted their Hematologist who performed blood work which was perfect. There were no abnormal results. The physician administered DDAVP.  On 09 Feb 2021, the patient experienced their first nose bleed described as &#34;horrific&#34;.  The patient reported they had blood gushing out of their nose and that they bled for four hours. The patient ended up in the hospital emergency department where they were sprayed with DDAVP to stop the bleeding.  Treatment details included DDAVP.  There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the events.  The events, nose bleed and spontaneous bleed were considered not recovered / not resolved.  The outcome of the events sore arm, hives, and bruise on the shin was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and the patient&#39;s history of Von Willebrand Disease, a causal association between the events nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin with mRNA-1273 use is assessed as unlikely.  However, based on temporal association, causality for the events of sore arm and hives cannot be excluded.

I pulled over as I was driving. I got off the interstate and was on the phone with my daughter. She told me to call 911, I put my head down and laid down. The ambulance got there, my daughter was there, and they could feel the skipping of beats. My BP was up, my HR was irregular. I still had the tightness in my chest. The medic said I am going to give you some nitro to see if would help with the tightness. I felt like I was going to black out. Arrhythmia was noticed on the monitor; EMT gave me a jolt of  and it immediately stopped the dysrhythmia. Transported to ER, inpatient overnight. Medical team decided I could go home, set up with follow up appt. Put me on a echo, stress test, HR monitor for a month (caught one episode and it lasted 1 hour in the middle of the night).  *i feel better but once in a while I get the lightheadedness and can feel the skipping.

On 31-Mar-2021, ILLNESS (really really sick - with chemotherapy), HYPERTENSION (blood pressure was slightly elevated), MALAISE (felt unusual), PYREXIA (Temperature was 100.4F.) and FATIGUE (exhausted) had resolved. Not Provided          Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  Because of chemotherapy the patient rescheduled her second shot and so it was delayed. Four days after the second shot she got pressure in the area of her cancer (left lung cancer), it tightened up, she had difficulty in breathing, painful, lot of discomfort, it was like somebody was squeezing her lungs. Few days later (2-3 days) she got really really sick and felt very tired - she was under chemotherapy. This never happened before with the chemotherapy (she has been taking it from several years). Her blood pressure was slightly elevated. Temperature was 100.4F. She felt very unusual and exhausted. All this happened for about for about 4-5 days.  Treatment for the event included acetylsalicylic acid.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination on Saturday January 16th 2021 at approximately 12pm. She completed all necessary screening forms and was deemed to be at low risk for serious allergic reactions. She tolerated the vaccination well, and no complications or immediate adverse events occurred. She was observed for a full 15 mins per CDPHE/CDC guidelines and left the Clinic in stable condition after her observation period was complete. On the morning of Tuesday, January 19th, 2021, the patient was found unconscious and unresponsive by her husband. She was transferred by Ambulance to Hospital shortly thereafter. She was diagnosed with a brain bleed that was determined to be inoperable. She was transferred to other Hospital for higher level care. She was seen by neurosurgery and diagnosed with a ruptured aneurysm. She was treated in the ICU for 24 hours, at which point her team determined that the severity of her brain bleed would not respond to treatment.

                                                After receiving the injection, I was directed by an RN to sit in a chair for 15min in the same room. Five minutes after the injection I felt my upper back  muscles, ribcage area, contract.  The contraction continued around to the front of my chest with next 3 minutes.  I felt tightness with each breath.  The RN who gave me the injection came to see if I felt alright. She informed the charge nurse that my chest felt tight and the charge nurse came to ask me questions.  The charge nurse called the hospital pharmacist to come to see me.  The pharmacist arrived with various medications and talked to me.  He instructed me to do breathing exercises and meditate.  I told him that I was familiar with these techniques and using them.  I also informed the pharmacist that I had a heart attack in 2018 and had atrial tachycardia but I wasn&#39;t feeling any problems with my heart, that it was beating normally.  I also informed the pharmacist of my severe allergies to certain items but I wasn&#39;t experiencing any anaphylaxis that I&#39;ve experienced in past allergic episodes.  The pharmacist left and told the charge nurse to keep me a half hour longer under observation and to call him if I felt worse.  During that half hour, the muscle contractions stopped and I was able to breathe normally.  The charge nurse asked me if I was ready to leave after the half hour was up, I told her I was feeling odd so she said to stay another 20min.   I began to experience intestinal cramping and asked to leave to go to the bathroom.  In the bathroom I had a bout of diarreah that lasted 10minutes.  After that I drove home but was experiencing a headache that started.   The headache lasted for 20hrs. It felt like I was wearing tight hat, squeezing.  Iv&#39;e not had that type of headache before.  My right arm site of injection feels a little warm and is pink but isn&#39;t painful.

Been taking BP/HR daily for last 3 months. Normal for me is 135/75 BP, 80 HR. Have not had heart palpitations in very long time prior to this vaccination. Contacted  doctor and was strongly advised not to get second dose of Moderna due to probable allergic reaction. No other allergic symptoms to the vaccination.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up at 2:15 a.m. feeling pains in my chest middle and extending through to my upper back.  The pain encompassed the span of my upper chest and back from one arm to the other.  I experienced very rapid heartbeats that I could feel throbbing from my head to my chest.  I was hesitant to move or rise from my bed because of the pain.  At 3:40 I called 911.  They did an EKG and I was told that my heart was fine.  My blood pressure was 180/90.  I chose not to go to the hospital but to call my doctor when his office opened up at 9:00 a.m. in approximately 5 hours.  My doctor had me come into his office.  I had another EKG which was fine and he sent me to have a Cat Scan. the same day which was also fine.  My doctor spoke to me and said that he felt that this was due to side effects of the vaccine.  I doubled up on my Acid Reflux medicine, taking 80 mg daily for  four days through Monday 2/22/2021.  I could not sleep well for three days after the vaccine experiencing pain in my chest and could not breathe deeply without feeling it.  Then I steadily improved and today I can take deep breaths with little pain.  I also experienced muscle pain in my left shoulder and neck but used Mineral Ice on my neck and was relieved in one day.

The levels remained in the mid to upper 200s. With an average A1c in the high 5s and low 6s, this was unusual for me.

As day progressed felt discomfort, site began to get itchy. In evening checked and blotches became one mass, swollen, very warm to touch. Called pharmacy, they never heard of delayed reaction said take benedryl and call primary dr in morning. Went to pharmacy, the pharmacist looked at it and felt it, also never saw delayed reaction, gave same instructions. Sent picture to primary, did video call today, 99.7 temp, elevated BP and pulse. She saw picture, close up on screen, concerned one spot darker might be cellulitis, need to watch, take benedryl, call if changes, report to CDC

                                                symptoms since her dose of Covid Moderna vaccine on Jan the 25th.  In the first 1-2 days she had the usual soreness at the injection site but nothing else. Then, about a week after it, her arm in the area of the injection site gradually became red and warm and indurated slightly without pain About the same time she noted a sense of fatigue and feverishness. Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .  Other symptoms she is complaining of bilateral lateral hip pain. She feels quite achy. She believes this started since the vaccine dose I believe she may have had some complaints prior to it. No joint complaints, no upper extremity symptoms other than as above. No HA, ST. She has had what she describes as &#34;spasms in her chest&#34;) which has improved but presented about the same time as the arm and temperature did. No Gi symptoms. Her activity has not been curtailed. Neck pain bilat was noted starting the end of December without other symptoms and wo any hx of trauma and did not feel like a typical wry neck.    No travel other than for the vaccine, to the grocery store and rarely to another shop. No exposures to anyone other than our grandchildren, son and dau-in-law who are in our &#34;bubble&#34; (the granddaughter attends an out door preschool where they all wear masks and have had no covid cases.Patient walks weekly out doors with a friend. She sees her mother who at 96 resides at home and sees no one.  She had a NP swab for Covid PCR test yesterday (the 17th) which is reported this am as &#34;undetected&#34;.  An evaluation with Doctor led to blood work showing wbc 9.2, hgb 11, plt 546k, ESR 74, CRP 67 a diagnosis of PMR was tentatively made and she was started on prednisone 15 mg /d.  Improvement was seen at 24 hours and persisted. Neck pain is 80% better as well.  Questions: Did the vaccine play a role in exacerbating a preceeding condition of PMR? If the neck pain is a red herring, did the vaccine cause PMR?

I experience shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness.  My left upper quadrant is sore from the  Moderna vaccine.  It appears to be spreading circular to the size of a quarter to about the size of a fifty-cent piece.  I had gone to sleep.  I contacted the veteran 24 hour nurse, my best friend, and my brother to tell them my health status.  I had eaten dinner, taken a Tylenol, and went back to sleep before brushing my teeth.

                                                Woke up at my usual time the day after vaccine. Felt a little warm but not feverish and did not take my temperature. After walking to kitchen to let cat in from garage I stopped at the nearby kitchen sink and began to shake ( I believe just my upper body). I had to grab onto sink to steady myself. Shaking was only seconds long.  Then I must have fainted as I awoke (quickly) on the floor  alongside the cupboards and sliding glass door.  I laid there conscious about 15 minutes till I felt confident I could get up on my own.  As result of fall I bit upper and lower lip on right (no blood just skin injured), must have clenched my teeth because my left posterior teeth were sensitive to cold and I injured my right ankle. After I got up and realized my ankle hurt with pressure I put on a support knee high to control swelling.  Injury seemed to be focused on the ankle bone. I applied ice for recommended 20 on 20 off protocol for most of both 2/25 and 2/26, elevated and took OTC Aleve as directed on package.  Bruising observed from heel, behind ankle bone and front of ankle.   Called PCP, she recommended continue as I have and she will contact me tomorrow, March 1

Pharmacist let me stay until I felt I could drive.  I came home and took Tylenol for headache.  5 hrs later I felt extremely ill with joint pain , fever , dizziness.  Vomiting occured during the night along with fainting.  Next morning drank tea, no food. Slept all day until 5pm.  Slept through night.  Sun. still had extreme joint pain and headache.  Was able to eat a light meal. Today I ate normally, went to physical therapy with a reduced routine.  I still have a headache as of Mon. night. I know these seem like Normal side effects, but these were like having the worst Flu ever.

I checked my blood pressure &amp; it was 199/105,   10 minutes later 197/101. I went to ER arriving at 10 am.  Had EKG, blood work, chest xray, covid quick test.  All ok. BP stayed very high until 12:30 pm then started to go down.  After about an hour bp went back up to 188/99.  I was given a pill to lower pressure but it didn&#39;t  lower.  Finally given a dose of metroprolol &amp; pressure went down. Was released from ER at 3:45 pm.   Today, 3/1/2021 BP is still high,  166/87.   Went to cardiologist 3/1/2021, was told they were having these type issues lately.  No problem with EKG, blood work.  Gave me another BP pill to try for 2 weeks to try lower BP.

After a few more minutes we tried to sit her up again, she had another syncopal episode, again non-responsive.  We called for EMT transport to the hospital.

I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

                                                I received 1st Covid shot on Feb 18, 2021. On March 4,2021, I was taken to Med Center by ambulance after having a small stroke that am. I don&#39;t know if there is any correlation? Did not think so, as I received my second Covid shot on March 18th, without any adverse reaction at all. I am only sending this o you as I wws informed that you would want to know about this?

                                                I spoke to my sister on the phone an hour or two after she got the vaccine and she was slurring her words.  The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

                                                Received the vaccine and about 5-7 minutes she felt like somebody put there thumb on the right side of her throat and pushed really hard.  This got worse and worse for about 10 minutes and stayed that way for about an hour.  She was kept for 45 minutes.  Later on it got less and less and by that evening the sensation was gone.  On day 29 2/20/21 of the vaccine she started having really crazy dizzy spells, off balance, blood pressure was going up and having the shakes.  She went to the ER 02/21/21, which they did a lot of testing, and everything was fine.  They did not know if it was due to the virus.  She saw her PCP today 2/24/21 and she said that it could be from the vaccine, but again not sure.  She called the health dept and told them that she was canceling her appointment and advised that she call us to report the incident.   She has also had pressure in her chest, generally overall not feeling well over the last 3 days.

I have never had heart palpitations from Graves before, although it is a common problem with it I have not had double vision since my eye surgery 5 years ago.  Am wondering whether to proceed with second dose of the Moderna vaccine.

By Monday (1/18), I had a really bad sore throat, chills and a fever. I had a fever for 26 solid days. My lung capacity was 98-99% the entire time. On Wednesday (1/20), I contacted my doctor and he had me to come in to get tested for COVID. The next day, I got my results and they were positive. It got worse from there and I was admitted to the hospital due to my sodium being low. I was also losing a lot of weight. I was hospitalized for 3 days in order for them to get my sodium up. I also had burning and tingling on the sole of my feet, which they attributed to my lack of sodium. My symptoms lasted for weeks. I have a lot of congestion, but they can&#39;t seem to locate the source. I&#39;m also having issues with my BP, which just started to decrease on 3/21. I was also diagnosed as anemic, which I&#39;ve never had an issue with. I also have a hard time concentrating. I also have spine issues, so I&#39;m not sure if my knee pain is from that or the COVID.

Within a  week she started haveing swings in her Blood pressure some times associated with numbness sensation left face, arm and  left lower extremity.   I saw  her on  March 27 with the same.   Neg CT work up, including neg CT angio gram of head and neck.  I transfered pt for insurance reasons.  I called and spoke with  her daughter on April 2.   Pt was having same symptoms, although improved.   I ask about MRI. She was told that there may or may not have been a stroke on that study. .   My impression was CVA with subjective left sided parestesia or TIA.

I also had ringing in my ears. I felt like I was going to pass out. It scared me.  I put on my brakes and started to pull over but by the time I started to pull over, the dizziness was slowly starting to clear up.  I had a &#34;foggy&#34; feeling in my head for about a half hour after so I went to my friend&#39;s house and sat down and drank some water. Then I went home.  I have had no incidents since then.

                                                Thrombocytopenia/lowplatelet; A spontaneous report was received from a caregiver concerning a 72-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced thrombocytopenia/low platelet count.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 18 Jan 2021 at 04:00 pm, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 19 Jan 2021, the patient was hospitalized for thrombocytopenia/low platelet count, the patient was in emergency room and was given a strong dose of steroid. Her body did not react to it and she was then given a platelet transfusion. The doctors have given her steroids, immunoglobulin and aminocaproic acid during the hospitalization. They were discussing the next steps of therapy and plan to try rituximab.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the event thrombocytopenia/low platelet count was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 72-year-old, female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of thrombocytopenia. This event occurred 2 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # unknown. Treatment included steroids, platelet transfusion, immunoglobulin, Amicar and pending treatment with Rituximab. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the event a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Woke up at 1:00 am with extremely rapid heart beat?130 bpm. It did not subside so I contacted the pharmacy who suggested I notify my doctor. I visited his office at 2:00 pm. He ran an EKG. It was normal so gave me a prescription for a beta blocker. After taking that, my heart rate returned to normal. I also had a slight fever, body aches &amp; headache.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 21 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 043L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021, after vaccine administration, the patient experienced injection site reaction.  On 22 Jan 2021, she was feeling achy.   On 23 Jan 2021, she had nerve pain that felt like cutting on the back, legs, and arms.  On 24 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s muscles were weak and were not working or responsive on both sides.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient could not control her left hand and weakness was more predominant on left side. The patient went to the doctor and was hospitalized with minor stroke for 24 hours. The patient stated that she was still experiencing terrible pain in neck and lower back.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, minor stroke, weak muscles, nerve pain, injection site reaction, and achy, was unknown. The outcome of event, terrible pain in neck and lower back, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and evidence of a temporal association between mRNA-1273 use and the onset of injection site reaction and achy, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. There is limited information to asses causality for the events of injection site reaction, and achy.  Additional information has been requested.

                                                Blood clot on right lung; soreness in arm; A spontaneous report was received from  a 72 year old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced blood clot on right lung  (pulmonary embolism) and myalgia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient had family history of blood clot (mother and brother). No concomitant product use was reported.  On 02-Feb-2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient had soreness in the right arm which subsided couple of days later. The patient also experienced shortness of breath for a week after vaccine administration. On 17-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and underwent COVID-19 virus test, the results of which were negative. On 17-Feb-2021, the computerized tomography scan on chest showed moderate size blood clot on right lung. On 18-Feb-2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital on recommendation to initiate and continue lifetime treatment with Eliquis (apixaban, 5mg every 12 hours). According to the physician, moderate size blood clot on right lung of the patient could be attributed to the genetic history (patient&#39;s mother and brother also had blood clot). The patient also followed up with primary care physician, who informed that it was genetic and not related to vaccine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism was unknown. The outcome of the event, myalgia was considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 25-JAN-2021, 26 hours prior to the onset of events, the patient received her second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot#: unknown) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 26-JAN-2021, the patient reported they have developed chills, fever, and muscle pain in the chest area. The reporter specified that it wasn&#39;t chest pain.  The patient took acetaminophen for the pain. On 27-JAN-2021, the patient reported her fever subsided but she was still having a little cough and chest pain.  On 28-JAN-2021, the patient had chest pain again during a nap and decided to call 911 because she was about to pass out. The patient was taken to the ER (emergency room) where an EKG (electrocardiogram) was performed. A few moments after the EKG, the patient had a heart attack. The cardiologist suspected the patient may have had a heart attack two days earlier because her cardiac enzymes were too high to be a result of a recent heart attack. The patient was admitted to the hospital from 28-JAN-2021 until 01-FEB-2021. Catheterization and stent placement were performed. Treatment medications included acetaminophen, clopidogrel, metoprolol, low-dose aspirin, and atorvastatin. At the time of this report, the patient was still feeling fatigued but other than that, she was feeling better.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, heart attack, cough, muscle pain in chest area, fever, chills, and chest pain, were resolved. The outcome of the event, fatigue, was not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Shortness of breath, cough onset Sunday April 4th.  DATE OF SERVICE: 04.06.2021   CT ANGIOGRAPHY, CHEST (CPT=71275); PULMONARY EMBOLUS PROTOCOL; 3-D RECONSTRUCTION  CLINICAL INDICATION: SOB (shortness of breath)  COMPARISON STUDY: 10/9/2020  TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest were performed during dynamic contrast enhancement for the  optimization of the opacification of the pulmonary arteries, following IV administration of 80 mL of  Isovue 370. Three-dimensional reformation into the coronal plane was performed.  Automated exposure control and ALARA manual techniques for patient specific dose reduction were  followed while maintaining the necessary diagnostic image quality.  ADVERSE REACTION: None  FINDINGS:  PULMONARY ARTERIES: There is a large filling defect within the right interlobar artery, extending  into the lobar, segmental, and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe. There is expansion of  the right interlobar artery by this thrombus. Small filling defect is noted within the distal left  main pulmonary artery, with some extension to the left upper lobe and left lower lobe lobar  segments.  HEART AND VASCULATURE: The heart is normal size. No pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of  right heart strain.  MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:  Heterogeneous densities are seen in the right lower lobe, new since the prior  exam. Scarring is noted in the superior segment of the right lower lobe as well as in the anterior  left lower lobe..  PLEURA: Small right pleural effusion.  CHEST WALL, LOWER NECK, AND AXILLA: Grossly unremarkable.  UPPER ABDOMEN: Grossly unremarkable.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are seen within the visualized spine.  IMPRESSION  1.  Bilateral PE, with extensive thrombus on the right and minimal thrombus on the left as detailed  above.  2.  Small right pleural effusion and heterogeneous right lower lobe consolidation, likely reflecting  pulmonary infarction.

At the hospital they performed EKG&#39;s and stress test. The EKG was slightly off but the stress test was normal. I felt all my body flushed after the Moderna vaccine. my cardiologist I am now seeing and at the hospital I saw another Dr.  I also stayed at the  Hospital one day for monitoring.

                                                On 01/11/2021, within a few hours of my grandmother getting the shot her injection area became red, swollen and hot to the touch. At around midnight the day her shot she started to experience tingling on both sides of my tounge. She an unusually restless night and on 1/12/2021 woke up feeling very tired and over all worn down.  Around 10:45a my I called to check on her she said she had just checked her temp and it was 99.6.  She was complaining of being very cold and had the shivers.  While on the phone she started to develop a stutter. At first it was one word every 14-20 word but it quickly got worse to the point where she couldn&#39;t get a full  word out and just sounds. I immediately left work and went to her house. On my way we contacted 911.  It took me about 10 mins to get to her house and when I got there she was semi- unresponsive on the couch making moaning noises and shaking. She was having severe muscle spasms throughout her body. You could see her muscles tighten and release. EMS got there within a few minutes after me. They checked her temp and it had increased to 101.00 she was a bit responsive and they were able to take her vitals however, it was difficult due to her shaking and convulsing. They transported her to the hospital and by they time they arrived (within 15 mins) her temp was then 102.6. She was still shaking, not lucid and stuttering her words. They hospital ran several tests to rule out stroke and other possible reasons for her symptoms- they said she had to be having a delayed reaction to the shot. She was extremely dehydrated, they hooked her up to an IV, she had an extremely elevated white blood count and was overall &#34;out of it&#34;. She was given IV antibiotics and observed.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                Atrial Fibrillation; Tachycardia (Double heart rate); A spontaneous report was received from a 73-year-old female consumer who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced atrial fibrillation and tachycardia.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Jan 2021, the patient reported having atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. Treatment for the events included metoprolol.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73-year-old, female patient. The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient experienced an unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. The event occurred 2 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

                                                Received vaccine at 4 pm. At 6 PM, I started having pain from shoulder to shoulder. Then pulse started to rise and by 6:30 pm, I had central chest pain and my pulse was 107.  Blood pressure rose. I kept checking it and by 9 pm, it had slowed to 97. I contacted my doctor who told me to monitor it and call back. She checked with me on Feb. 4th and my blood pressure and pulse continue to go down slowly.

                                                About 3:30 in the morning I woke up and I was really cold. I started having chills. when I checked my temperature it was in the 99s (the highest my temperature 101.9. When I checked my heart rate in the morning and it was in the 90s, and that&#39;s higher than normal for first thing in the morning. My heart rate went high and I had achy muscles. I sat around all day, but I didn&#39;t feel that bad in the morning, I took an extra strength Tylenol and I didn&#39;t have much have an appetite. My heart rate stayed in the 90s-130, so I called my cardiologist and he recommended I alternate Tylenol and ibuprofen and drink lots of fluids. By dinner that night I had no appetite, and then I had nausea and dry heaves, so I took 25 mg of promethazine at about 8 and the dry heaves got better within an hour. I got the COVID tongue. I had a white coating on my tongue and I couldn&#39;t get it off and a weird metallic taste in my mouth, I had a mild headache. The next day I felt much better. I called my PCP and they didn&#39;t think it was necessary for me to come in for a cardiogram because I was feeling better.

She reported she began to have a rapid heart rate (which went away that evening) and elevated blood pressure. She normally takes a BP med and took an extra 1/2 pill that evening. Her BP was up to 178/101 and came down to 124/78. She reports she is still not feeling well (but BP is within her normal range). She reports she will contact her PCP. I advised her to go to the urgent care and she wants to wait to see her PCP.  She agrees to go to urgent care or ER if condition worsens.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter included breast cancer.  No concomitant medications were reported.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 029L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22 Jan 2021, the patient experienced chills, dizzy, temperature, hands were shaking, passed out and sweating profusely. The treatment for the events included paracetamol.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced, nausea, heart rate at 107 heartbeats per minute and stomach discomfort.   The treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome for the events, chills, dizzy, temperature, hands were shaking, passed out, sweating profusely, nausea, heart rate at 107 and stomach discomfort was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73-year-old female patient, who experienced serious event of loss of consciousness and non-serious events of chills, dizziness, temperature abnormal, tremors, hyperhidrosis, nausea, heart rate increased, and abdominal discomfort. The reported events occurred on the same day after first dose of mRNA-1273, (lot # 029L20A) with the exception of nausea, heart rate increased, and abdominal discomfort which occurred at unknown date. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patients&#39; medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications list was provided.   On 24 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of symptoms, patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 011J20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID -19 infection.  On 25 Dec 2020, patient experienced shortness of breath with low oxygen saturation levels.   On 26 Dec 2020, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue.   On 27 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s energy was back to normal.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient woke up in the morning with symptoms of almost could not breathe, could not walk across the room.  The patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation 83%.  The patient was struggling for every breath.  The patient tested negative for COVID-19.  On 30 Dec 2020, another COVID-19 test was negative.  On 31 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation closer to 90%, and she reported getting better. Symptoms remained the same for about a week.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient experienced left ankle and foot swollen. The patient was seen by physician and then sent to emergency room where it was determined that the patient had DVT in the left leg. A computerized tomogram (CT) scan found clots in the left lung, or saddle PE.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital.  Treatment for the events experienced included intravenous heparin and blood thinners.   Action taken with planned second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The event, extreme fatigue, was considered resolved on 27 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, slight fever, DVT and saddle PE were not provided.  Follow-up received on 19 Jan 2021 included updated events (DVT and saddle PE), updated event details, treatment, and hospitalization details.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of 73- year-old female patient who experienced serious event of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and non-serious events of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue the next day after administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 011J20A, expiration date-unknown. Based on temporal information provided and the known safety profile of the vaccine and the absence of any other etiology factors, a causal association between the vents of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue and the administration of  mRNA-1273 vaccine cannot be excluded. Fever and fatigue are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine.  There is no enough information t clinically assess the causal association between the events of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis as the patient&#39;s medical history and list of concomitant medications were lacking.

                                                About 3 or 4 hours after vaccine, I developed tightness in my chest and shortness of breath.  I felt like I did when at high altitude. When climbed basement stairs (10 stairs), had to stop at top and take deep breaths.  While sitting or laying down, felt needed to take deep breath. Felt breathing was shallow. Tightness in chest went away next day. Shortness of breath went away on evening of day 5.

                                                I am not 100% certain of this event being related to the vaccination with the Moderna COVID19 shot or not.  However, in the interest of completeness and for investigative purposes, I am reporting to you the event in relation to the vaccination as the patient reported to me.  She received the vaccination on 2/14/2021 and became very confused.  She had significant left arm swelling much worse than when she had her first vaccination.  Her husband brought her to the emergency room and she was eventually discharged, but she went on to develop significant hypertension and she reported that her blood pressures were normal prior to the vaccination.  She had an emergency room visit in which her systolic pressures were well above 240.  She revisited the emergency room and had elevated blood pressures of 240 and was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy and later found to have posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or PRES.  We have started the patient on medications, and started laboratory work-up for secondary hypertension and her blood pressures have improved with treatment.  We discussed the case with the neurologist, who suggested that we repeat MRI scan to make sure that her punctate lesions noted on MRI on this admission on 2/25/2021, have resolved.  It was advised that if they had not resolved that we should call neurology again.  Hypertensive encephalopathy is rare and press syndrome as a result is also rare.  It is for this reason that I am reporting this event as again, I am not trying to mislead anyone or distort information, but should this be an adverse effect of the vaccine I wanted to make sure that this was reported as the patient&#39;s history prior to the vaccination and developing this complication post vaccination are temporally related at a minimum.  The patient is a known smoker but quit on the 14th of this month.

I called my cardiologist&#39;s office and they advised me to start on propranolol 20mg twice daily.  They had prescribed that earlier as I have had episodes of that in the past but did not take the medication.  After the 3 doses, approximately 12 hours apart, the lightheadedness and dizziness got worse.  I called the cardiologist on call and they d/cd the med.  Today, the lightheadedness &amp; dizziness is worse.

I am not sure how long I was unconscious,. but when I came to I was on the floor and unable to move.  I called out to my husband and he got me up, but I could not walk. He got me back into bed. Several hours later he assisted me in walking  and I am walking ok now.

                                                On 3/1/21, about 10 AM, I found a new pink oval spot on Left deltoid, about 2 1/2 in tall, 2 in wide.  Pink color,  firm and slightly warm, mildly tender, some rash spots above it.  Edges not raised.  Blanched in center with pressure.  Exactly 2 weeks after 1st dose Moderna vaccine.    No systemic symptoms at this time.     Prior to this:  On the day following 1st dose, the injection site became tender and sore, no change in skin color then, but some induration and was particularly sore when I raised my arm above my head.  That Lasted about 3 days, and has been completely resolved.   On the 3rd and 4th day post vaccination, I had mild fatigue and napped each of those days (very unusual for me).   Otherwise I have had nothing else from vaccination.      I took picture this morning, but do not know how to attach it.

Chest felt very heavy and I became lethargic, not able to take a deep breath.  Left work and became a couch potato the rest of the day and evening.   Today symptoms about the same.  Breathing still a problem and although it does not feel good, I am forcing myself to take an occastional deep breath. Did not report to work.

                                                About 12 hours after vaccine she felt like she had COVID all over again.  She had fever of 101, and then the body aches that were very painful.  She took Tylenol #3 for the pain and didn&#39;t notice the arm hurting yet.  The main thing was the body aches and fever.  She had chills off and on and a headache.  She felt like she just couldn&#39;t get up, wiped out.  She did not eat or drink much.  Through the day Saturday and by Sunday the body aches left, the chills went down during the day but returned Sunday night 2/28/21.  On 3/1/21 she went to the doctor and her temp was down, and is down now 3/4/21.  Through the night Sunday night started having terrible pain in her chest/esophagus, which she could not get the pain to go away.  She did the remedy that she read online, and has had some GERD over the years, but nothing like this.  She could hardly even swallow her own saliva without pain.  She got a prescription for Nexium from the doctor, and started taking that today.  She is trying to eat something, little bity bits to go down without pain in her esophagus.  The pain does get better at times during the day.  She read that it may take 2-3 weeks to heal and the Nexium should be working by then.  She is very fatigued and dealing with the acid reflux issues.   She did also notice redness on her arm was about 3&#34; x 2&#34; down her arm.  It was not at the site of the injection, was a little lower and it was hot to touch.  She kept putting a cold washcloth on it.  She took regular Tylenol.  The body aches went away but was left with such a heavy headache that she took up to 4 Tylenol #4 due to pain.  The redness had faded to about a square &#34; by the time she went to the doctor on Monday, and is still really sore.

I also began running a fever at about that time and ran it for about 24 hours, highest is got was 101 . Arm is swollen. I had covid the first week of October so am not sure if this played into my reaction. I am concerned about taking my second shot if this is what I experienced with my first one.

She states that her symptoms 1st started out as a slight postnasal drip, which turned into a hoarse voice with a cough, which turned into a head cold, which has turned in due shortness of breath, diarrhea, and cough with associated chills. After 17 days of cold-like symptoms, pt was tested on 2/26 for COVID and tested positive. 2/27, pt worsened and presented to ED. Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient&#39;s temperature is 100.2° F, heart rate 96, respiratory rate 24, saturating 84% on room air with blood pressure 164/84.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were significant for BUN 17, CR 1.47, lactate 2.2, D-dimer 6.79, and phosphorus 2.2.  The patient&#39;s chest x-ray showed no acute findings.  CT chest showed extensive acute bilateral pulmonary emboli involving most of the lobar and segmental branches, right greater than left with no saddle embolus.  Findings borderline for right heart strain, correlate with echocardiogram.  Peripheral ground-glass airspace opacities consistent with atypical/viral pneumonitis.  Reactive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 93 with inferior infarct-age undetermined.  The patient was administered 1 L IV NS, ceftriaxone 1 g IV, azithromycin 500 mg IV, and heparin IV bolus and drip for PE indication. Remdesivir started.  2/28/21: Pt on 3 L oxygen. Azithromycin, ceftriaxone, remdesivir continued. Vancomycin started.  3/1/21: 1 L oxygen via nasal cannula. Small, nonproductive cough. Pt complains of SOB.  3/2/21: 1/2 blood cultures from 2/27 positive for CoNS. Vancomycin discontinued. Pt feeling much better. Still on 1 L oxygen via nasal cannula. More alert.  3/3: 5 day remdesivir course and azithromycin, ceftriaxone course completed. Patient weaned off oxygen. Pt discharged home with oxygen as a precaution. Pt also enrolled in COVID Safe At Home telehealth program.

The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure, and thyroid disorder.  Concomitant medications included enalapril hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin for &#34;cholesterol&#34; and a &#34;thyroid medication.&#34;  On 29-Jan-2021, at 0931, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 004M20A ) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 29-Jan-2021, 46 minutes after vaccine administration, patient reported that she started feeling like a heavy weight was pressuring her chest from the inside and also felt like a heavy pressure was coming from outside her body. At 1100, she stated that she experienced a feeling like a heavy thing was moving across her chest and she reportedly had a hard time breathing. Her oxygen level dropped to 80%, but by breathing intensely she managed to bring it to 84-87%. She reported her pulse to be 115. All of these symptoms lasted for 20 minutes. Later, she reported that her oxygen level returned to 90% and then eventually to 94%.  However, she reported that for the next few days she felt like her heart rate was fast through the day, for about 5 days.  She said that she felt like it was beating really fast and felt like it was moving up her throat, giving her a choking feeling. Since last Friday, 05-Feb-2021, she stated that she has had no more problems. Patient reached out to her HCP who denied her any post-vaccine related attention.    Treatment activities for event included taking ibuprofen 600 mg after the vaccination.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The outcome of event, experienced a heavy weight was pressuring their chest from the inside, and also felt like a heavy pressure coming from outside their body, like a heavy thing was moving across their chest, they had a hard time breathing as if earing several masks over their head felt their breathing was inhibited, oxygen level dropped to 80%,  pulse was at 115, was considered  recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73-year-old female who experienced serious unexpected events of Chest discomfort, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decreased along with a nonserious unexpected events of heart rate increased and choking sensation.  Event onset 46 minutes after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Treatment with ibuprofen. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 13 Feb 2021, the patient received the first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch# 007M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the night of 13 Feb 20212, the patient experienced arm hurt a little bit and she felt fatigued.  In the early morning of 14 Feb 2021, the patient went to the bathroom.  On her way to the bathroom,  she felt confused and had overwhelming nausea.  She lost consciousness and banged her head on the cabinet.  Within second, she regained consciousness but felt extremely weak.  She could not recall how she got back to her bed.  The patient said she was cold and clammy at that time and she never got back to sleep.  During the day on 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt a throbbing pain on the arm where she got the injection.  She was not sure whether that was due to the injection or due to her fall when she lost consciousness.  She could barely move the arm.  Then she took a nap in the afternoon and was able to recover from her lack of sleep that night.    Treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown (although her doctor advised her not to get the second dose given the reaction she had).

                                                Moderna Shot on February 23, 2021. Tired, sluggish and headache along with some ringing in the head.  March 22, 2021 I had second Moderna shot. My arm was very swollen, fatigue and bad headache with loud ringing in the head. My blood pressure accelerated  to nearly 200/88 and had to be admitted to the ER three days after shot. I was in the hospital for two days and had a series of CAT scans and ultrasounds.  Loud ringing in my head has not stopped. Never had a history of high blood pressure, but now they put me on high blood pressure medication along with the baby aspirin. I was a relatively healthy woman until I had these vaccinations.

These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

                                                Approximately  84 hours after administration, I had severe vertigo when prone.  This included a strange sensation of my head floating and an odd sense of loosing consciousness.  The vertigo was awful, and I could barely stand.  This lasted each evening for about 6 night.  It subsided in the morning, after I felt more stabilized in walking.

On 21 Jan 2021, the patient reported she got very dizzy and passed out. Her husband relays that she was totally out for a couple of seconds. She went to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a vasovagal reaction and urinary tract infection. Premature ventricular contractions were also discovered and was not known prior to this event. Patient reports a normal blood pressure of 114-120/75. Patient also stated her arm was sore the day after vaccine but not hurting much during her usual four mile walk.   Treatment for the event included intravenous medications in the emergency room, cephalexin, and a heart monitor.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events passed out, dizziness, vasovagal reaction and arm pain were resolved. The outcome of the events, urinary tract infection and premature ventricular contractions were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of dizziness, passed out, vasovagal reaction, urinary tract infection, premature ventricular contractions and arm pain.  The events occurred the next day after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current limited available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.  Further information have been requested.

                                                Felt unwell on Wednesday but on Thursday morning I was getting dressed and intended to go back to bed since I did not feel well. Then came back to consciousness on the floor with a definite knot on my head from a fall.  Crash was enough to wake my husband who said I was out about 5 minutes.

About 10 minutes later, stood up and walked about 4 meters to the refrigerator, grabbed onto handles and my husband rushed over and grabbed me as ir seemed I was going to fall. Sat me down in sofa, where after short? while  I recovered. After getting up to go to refrigerator, no recollection of anything that followed. My internist?s diagnosis - síncope.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning herself, a 74-year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced medically important event of atrial fibrillation.  The patient&#39;s medical history included heart surgery on an unspecified date in 2017. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of event, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 015L20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unspecified date in FEB 2021, the patient experienced fast heart rate, felt weakness, dizziness, and had atrial fibrillation. No treatment medication information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable.   The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on current information the event was assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 vaccine, because of biological implausibility, no clear temporal association, and the patient&#39;s history of heart surgery which may promote atrial fibrillation episodes.

The most serious adverse reaction was the 18 hour spike in my blood glucose level which was elevated to the high glucose level .  I ended up taking over 200 units of insulin in a 30&#43; hour period (normally would use this amount of insulin in a 36 hour period.  I was unable to lower my blood glucose level from the range (200-300mmg) despite repeated doses of insulin during the time period of reaction (8:00am- 4:00 am).

Was told to wait another 15 min and was given water and snack to elevate blood sugar in case it had dropped (I do not have diabetes or history of sugar drops).  When I stood to leave, I stumbled in the hall and was told to stay and blood pressure was taken, which was elevated to about 170, which I had taken as I do daily, before I arrived and it was 119/60.  This was done at hospital by nurse. It was taken again, and it had gone down to 145, and I felt well enough to leave and drive home.  Stayed home, and vertigo was obvious, have had years ago, not recently, so I knew it was side effect.

Went back into pharmacy and they called 911.  EMT took me to ambulance to check vitals and this took about 45 minutes.  They offered to take me to hospital but declined as had my husband suffering from cancer who also had shot and can&#39;t drive was waiting in the car.  We drove 1/2 mile to friends home and waited to make sure felt ok to drive back.  Drove home ok and have been feeling tired for 3 days but otherwise ok.  Pharmacy followed up next day.  Today feel a bit of pressure in the chest and have placed a call to my doctor but he has gone for weekend.  I will go to emergency room if I feel worse and will call him on Monday to report incident.

Pain/nausea elevated BP and decreased food intake which caused low blood sodium levels. IV treatments to increase sodium and lower BP. Dizziness from low sodium and high BP created fall risk, so bed had alarm.  Bed confinement necessitated daily injections to prevent blood clots.  Twice daily blood tests done to monitor sodium and potassium levels &#43; kidney function.

The patient&#39;s current conditions included atrial fibrillation, back trouble and peripheral neuropathy (diagnosed years ago). The patient had medication allergies to pain medications and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Concomitant products included digoxin, carisoprodol, metamizole sodium and warfarin sodium.  On 09-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09FEB--2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had a slight reaction and became very tired, faint and dizzy. The patient&#39;s husband helped her to bed. The next morning on 10-FEB-2021, the events were resolved. The patient was scheduled for next Moderna vaccine (second dose) on 09-MAR-2021. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, faint, dizzy, slight reaction and very tired was recovered/resolved on 10-FEB-2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

My weight before the vaccine was 116 lbs, now it is 110 lbs. I am of a small frame, 5 ft. At the time, I was unable to contact my physician to report the problems before I receive the second dose that was scheduled on March 10, 2021, due to death in his family. I wrote to the Physicians who were communicating with me about my appointment and reported the above symptoms. An Administrative Assistant responded that these symptoms are not known to be associated with the vaccine.On March 16, 2021 I was able to get an appointment and on that date he did a series of blood tests.

Hospital course: 74 y.o. female admitted on 4/8/2021 for abdominal pain. Notable PMHx: aortic valve replacement, HTN   On morning of admission, patient woke up with severe epigastric pain.  Describes pain as a pressure.  Has had vomiting.  Had bowel movement after pain started.  Patient came to the emergency room.  Patient received an antiemetic and Demerol.  Patient has continued to have pain in got a dose of morphine as well.  Pain eased some but was still 7/10.  In the ER, blood pressure was very elevated with systolic in 200s.  Cardiac enzymes negative.  EKG look good with normal sinus rhythm.  Patient has aortic valve replacement and is on Coumadin with INR goal of 2.5-3.5.  INR was elevated at 4.3.  D-dimer was negative.  Amylase and lipase negative.  Creatinine normal at 0.9.  Chest x-ray done which showed no acute disease.  On the floor, we ordered a CT abdomen.  It did show gallstones, but nonobstructing.  It showed kidney stones in the renal pelvis, but none obstructing.  No other inflammation or signs of bleeding.  Blood pressure came down after medicines in the ER.  Did have some lower blood pressures through the afternoon evening which was felt to be a combination of blood pressure low in medicines in the ER and pain medication.  From 11:00 p.m. onward blood pressures were controlled.   Patient continued to have severe abdominal pain.  Hemoglobin down to 9.0 from prior 12.4 yesterday.  Creatinine up from 0.9 yesterday to 1.8.  White count up from 8.3 yesterday to 14.4.  INR from 4.3 yesterday to 4.2.  Coumadin was held yesterday.   CT abdomen was repeated. CT abdomen was read as worrisome for necrotic gallbladder and small bile leak Contacted transfer line at hospital.  Surgery accepted and wanted transfer to go through the ER. Patient has PCN allergy.  Surgery said that if reaction was not severe, they wanted Invanz given before she left.  Patient says that she had a itching rash in the 70s.  No trouble breathing or swallowing.  No other reaction.  Dose of Invanz ordered.  IVF were increased.  HPI from hospital: 74 y.o. female who presents with Chief Complaint Patient presents with? Abnormal Scan   Patient presents via EMS as a medical transfer from hospital after having gallbladder necrosis seen on CT imaging.  She was given IV Invanz there.  General surgeon was contacted by that facility and he accepted the patient for transfer to this facility.   Apparently, the patient began having abdominal pain yesterday. Timing of onset was gradual.  Severity is rated as severe at maximum intensity. Quality is described as aching abdominal pain.  Symptoms have been improved after IV pain medicine.  Symptoms worsen with nothing, and improve with IV pain medicine.     History was provided by patient, EMS, transfer paperwork and EMR, and I spoke with treating doctor in general surgery who accepted the patient for transfer.

                                                Within 1 minute I started feeling a rush in my throat and a metallic taste, then a tingling in both arms.  That subsided for a minute or two, then started again with a flush feeling down my body.  Nurse took blood pressure 140/80.  Breathing fine. Heart rate fine.  Flush feeling started again, and blood pressure dropped  to100/70.  I was then given 50 mg of Benadryl and an ambulance was called.  My blood pressure stabilized but I was very shaky.  It was recommended that I go to the hospital for observation for a couple of hours, which I did.  I only had the flush feeling once at the hospital.  I was released after two hours.

                                                Following the shot, my face became hot, my ears were red, my tongue, arms, and legs tingled, heart rate increased.  This started shortly after the injection, It subsided after about 15 to 20 minutes. This is similar to reactions that I&#39;ve had to flu vaccines when I last had one nearly 25 years ago.  It is also similar to my reaction to numbing shots where epinephrine is in the shot.

                                                After receiving vaccine patient started to feel hot and face turning red. She reported feeling like she was tight in the chest and throat was swelling. She said she had an epi pen with her. I asked her if she thought it was time to administer and call 911 she said yes. We proceeded. She said her throat was feeling a little better but chest was tight and she was having a dry cough. Ambulance took her to hospital. I called her around Noon the next day to check in on her and she said she was in hospital still being monitored. Was advised not to get second dose of vaccine from hospital.

It was a consistent flow and had been going on for 5 minutes before calling the pharmacy. She had placed a clip on her nose to see if it would stop, but when asked to check she said it still has not stopped. Asked her what medications she was taking and if she was on blood thinners. she indicated no. Looked up adverse events on Moderna covid-19 vaccine and it didn&#39;t indicate nose bleeding, package insert states &#34;intentionally blank&#34;. Advised patient to head to the ER and I would call to check up on her.

Blood pressure rose to 170-190 over 110 and would not go down.  Doctor advised I go to the E.R. for assessment, which I did. Blood pressure remained elevated for days . Noted the systolic was higher , mostly in the 80&#39;s.  I do not have hypertension BP this morning  in the 120&#39;s over 70.  Needed Alprazolam to calm my anxiety since.  Not every day. Very concerned about having the second dose. Doctor has advised me to only drink water the day of shot, take a tranquilizer an hour before and has given me BP med to take if my BP goes over 150.

                                                Adverse reaction began around midnight with chills, continued throughout the night alternating chills and hot flashes, severe backache, muscle aches in thighs and general malaise.  Got up around 8 to try to take a warm shower to ease muscle aches but as soon as I got into the bathroom I felt very hot, very nauseated and lightheaded.  I suspected hypotension but of course I wasn&#39;t able to prove it at the time. I attempted to get back to my bed but had syncopal episode a few feet from the bed where I collapsed onto the floor.  I just stayed on the floor and rested because it actually felt better lying down. I am a retired RN and suspect this adverse event was related to orthostatic hypotension.  Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

At 1;00PM  I woke up and stood up out of bed and collapses onto the floor.  I was unable to get up.  I found my phone which had fallen onto the floor.  I was shaking so bad I kept dropping it.  I looked and my phone and was  unable to figure out how to make a call.  The screen did not make sense.  Eventually I was able to call my daughter who decided to call 911.  The paramedics came, picked me up  off of the floor and helped me walk to the living room.  My legs kept giving out like I was going to fall again.  They were asking questions but I was unable  to answer coherently. I was so confused.  My brain was not working.  They took me to the hospital where I was admitted and many tests were done.
