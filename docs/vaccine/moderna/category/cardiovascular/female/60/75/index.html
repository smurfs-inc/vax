                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

The day after receiving the vaccine (1-7-21), she started to feel increased shortness of breath (she has shortness of breath at baseline due to chronic health conditions- CHF, asthma), a heavy feeling in her chest/lungs, sweating and fatigue. She contacted the pharmacy on January 8th, as we were the entity that vaccinated her to ask about vaccine reaction. Due to her medical history of MI and CHF, pharmacist did not want to dismiss this as a reaction to the vaccine, and recommended that she contact her doctor for further guidance. She did reach out to her care team, and ended up going to the emergency room for testing due to cardiac history and presentation of symptoms. She had diagnostic testing done (see item 19) and the ER doctor attributed her symptoms to an exacerbation of CHF and asthma, noting that vaccine involvement in the worsening of her symptoms can not be ruled out. Treatment/discharge instructions include: follow up with cardiology/pulmonology, furosemide dose was increased, potassium supplement restarted, and instructed to use inhalers already on hand when needed. As of time of report on January 9 2021, the patient was resting at home, doing well except still having symptoms upon exertion.

The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

After 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine, I woke up the 2nd day with my neck lymph glands completely swollen, my jaw hurt really bad, and every tooth in my mouth hurt, and I had another infected tooth on the other side of my mouth.  I had to take an antibiotic for both tooth infections.  Teeth were not infected prior.  By the end of day 2, my lymph nodes were back to normal using Advil for swelling.

She was assisted by EMS (who was on site).  Her blood pressure was 249/149 per the patient.  She also experienced some lightheadedness.  It was strongly suggested by EMS &amp; nursing staff that she be transported to the ER but she refused stating she had to work the next day.  She continued to be monitored by EMS until her blood pressure stabilized &amp; she felt better.  She continued to refuse ER.  She was driven home by her companion.   On 1/28/2021 she sent an email to the health department showing a picture of her left arm showing redness from the injection site down to above the bend in her left arm.  She reported that on 1/26/2021 her physician  recommended that she not receive the second dose of Moderna.  She continues to complain of high blood pressure.  It is unkown if she takes medication for high blood pressure.

                                                Five days following the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed diffuse body pain, beginning in the right shoulder (for which she received a steroid injection), but then spreading to the entire body. This pain became so severe that she presented to the hospital via EMS, and was found to have a platelet count of 41 (9 days following the vaccine). No baseline platelet count is available prior to the vaccine (most recent was from 2019). Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is being considered, and the patient has been placed on IVIG and steroids. It is now 4 days into the patient&#39;s admission, and platelets continue to fall (currently 26). Hemoglobin appears normal at the time and there is no sign of active bleeding. Of note, the patient also has positive blood cultures, so thrombocytopenia as a result of sepsis is also a possibility.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

It is hard to lift my left arm up and put it across my chest because that hurts. It hurts in my lymph nodes and my joints. I had to go the the ER on 12/31/20 because of this. they gave me a shot of Prednisoneand Hydroxyzihe that helped for a coupled of days and then I had to go back to the ER on 1/6/21 because of the same symptoms. They gave me Benadryl,prednisone and pepcid. I am still itching.

                                                started with metallic taste in mouth, progressed rapidly to clammy, light headed, elevated BP and HR. All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

                                                I received the vaccine in my right arm about 10 AM on 1/11/2021 I felt a sharp muscular pain in my back near  the base of my right shoulder. It was difficult to take deep breath?s. It felt like I had pulled a muscle there. Moving positions from sitting to standing or raising my right arm to scratch or reach for something caused the muscle pain to occur. After taking ibuprofen, water and rest the pain subsided a lot, but still continues. There was no increase in my temperature.

Chest pain, left sided stomach pain, and headache persisted through the night.  I was able to get some relief by takin a 325 mg Aspirin and an Advil every 2-3 hours through the night.  The chest pain was pretty bad, considered going to the ER, but persisted to fight it through to the morning.  In the morning, around 6:30 am I was exhausted, but the worst of the pain was over.  I did take another Aspirin and Advil around 8:00 am and stopped after that.  I did run a low grade fever off and on of 99.7 to 100.4.   I felt better on Saturday, but by noon I was feeling generally run down and again started to run a low grade fever off an on the rest of the day.  Sunday - what a joy to feel totally well!!

                                                After approximately a week?s time and after a workout at the gym, I noticed my arm hurt to raise it above my head. I observed a reddened fibrous cord-like area from my axilla to just above the inside of my elbow. Very painful initially. After stretches, massaging, and apply warmth, pain is nearly gone yet cord is still visible and slightly painful. Dr?s appt revealed one enlarged lymph node in same axilla.

The patient&#39;s medical history included Secondary Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. Products known to have been used by the patient within two weeks prior to the event was Sildenafil Citrate. Additional suspected products included Treprostinil Sodium, Plavix, and Aspirin.

On an unknown date, after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced worsening of nosebleeds filling up towels full of blood, sore throat and coughing. Treatment for the events, nosebleed, sore throat and cough was not reported.   Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The event, worsening of nosebleeds filling up towels full of blood was considered not resolved and outcome of the events, sore throat and cough was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 61 year old female patient with medical history of Secondary Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Epistaxis and NS events of oropharyngeal pain and cough. The events occurred on an unknown date after first dose of the study medication administration.  A causal relationship cannot be excluded. Noting the subject&#39;s underlying medical condition and concomitant medication could remain a confounder.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

Then on Thursday, every joint in her body hurt and this continued until Saturday.  On Saturday she had a big red whelt on the arm that progressively got larger.  She still has some aches in her joints, but not as severe.  The rash is deep red today, swollen with hard ridges, very itchy and very hot to touch.  She has not taken anything for it.  She has been having a harder time than usual breathing, but not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine or not.  She has less than 20% of her lungs.

On March 19, 2021 she was on the floor laying beside of the bed and my father noticed blood looking stuff on her shirt and bed covers. She was really confused and lethargic. She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

Some heart fluttering and some slight shortness of breath beginning a couple of days after.  More a nuisance.  No other symptoms I&#39;m aware of although every little thing I feel now I think may or may not be a symptom like slight head throb but not consistent pain.  Not sure because of vaccine.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

They continued like this but with fluctuating severity.  My calves and shin muscles began to be sore.  I sought out acupuncture and myofascia release work to help.  It did help temporarily.  I started to have left ankle pain, not like a sprain, like tendonitis or inflammation.  It continued to hurt to walk and the muscles more painful.  I started having darker urine about 4 days after the vaccine.  I drank cranberry juice and took a kidney/bladder supplement, increased fluids, but it continued dark.  I went to the Urgent Care on January 7th c/o muscle pain and dark urine.  My blood pressure was elevated, 179/100..unusual for me, and my urine was neg so it was sent for culture and blood was drawn for CBC and metabollic panel and Creatine Kinase

On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right. I still feel fatigued and I have a full feeling around the area of my right upper abdomen ( liver), I dont have a gallbladder. Otherwise, I am OK. Just wondering about the 2nd dose. Lymph node still slightly swollen above clavicle.

On 24 Jan 2021, about 15 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 24 Jan 2021, 30 minutes prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient took prednisone (dose unknown), per instructions from her doctor due to her history of anaphylactic reactions. She did notify the vaccinators of her history and there was an ambulance present. About 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient started coughing, had heavy chest pain, trouble breathing, and felt like her throat was constricting more than usual. No rash developed. She approached the ambulance and asked if she could take diphenhydramine. She took one dose, followed by 3 other doses, and felt a bit better. Consent given for Safety to follow up with patient.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of event, anaphylactic reaction was resolving at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62 year old female patient with medical history of included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings.

                                                My right arm was painful at the injection site for 3 days after the vaccination.  Then on Wednesday, February 3, 2021 about 3:45pm I experienced shortness of breath and some chest discomfort.  At approximately 6:00pm, I felt a strong pulsating at my left temple which continued through the night.  I took my blood pressure and it was 150/90 and pulse was 103 which is the highest reading I have ever had because I am on blood pressure medication.  I took 2 aspirin, my Proventil Inhaler, and another Losartan 50 mg even though I had already taken my daily dose in the morning.  I rested and continued to monitor my vitals.  At about 11:30pm, I took my blood pressure and it was 160/110 and pulse was 109.  I then took 2 more aspirin and my Clonazapem and fell asleep.  In the morning on February 4, 2021, I tried to get in to see my doctor, but she advised to go to the emergency room.  I went to an Urgent Care facility and the checked me and did an EKG and that was normal.  But they also advised me to go to the emergency room.  So I did go and they did another EKG, chest x-ray, and several blood tests.  They came back normal but they wanted me to stay overnight for observation.  On February 5, 2021 they did an echocardiogram and a stress test, which were normal.  I was released from the hospital that afternoon.  I have a follow up appointment with my Primary Care Physician on February 12, 2021.  My blood pressure and pulse continue to be a little higher than normal.  At this point, the pulsating, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort have improved.  On Saturday, February 6, 2021, I noticed felt itchiness, redness and swelling at the injection site on my right arm.  It is still itchy, red and swollen as of February 8, 2021.  I am putting hydrocortisone cream on it.

                                                I developed chills/shivering in the evening of the vaccination (2/19/21) but was not alarmed, just tried to stay warm.  I ate normally.   I awakened in the night with extreme chills and was shaking most of the night, unable to get warm.  I felt feverish and had body aches as well as nausea.  I threw up what I could to alleviate the feeling of nausea, about 2 a.m.   I slept restlessly until 9:00 am, then tried to take a hot shower.  Though the chills were gone, I felt weak and listless and went back to bed shortly after showering.  I slept for about 4 hours.  I had little/no appetite for most of the day after the vaccine.  By the second day I still had a headache but felt better, albeit weak.   I took Ibuprofen for the body/headaches with minimal success.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

                                                Patient was vaccinated on 3/9/21 at facility in the morning. She developed a headache later that day. She woke up on 3/10/21 around 1145 with facial/neck swelling, urticaria,  and shortness of breath and presented to the ER at 1250. Upon arrival she was given 50mg benadryl IVP, 20mg Pepcid IVP, and 125mg Solu-medrol IVP. Soft tissue neck xray showed subglottic narrowing and thickened epiglottis. She had some improvement after IV medications but was admitted to ICU for observation overnight. She was discharged 3/12/2021 in stable conditions on steroids and antihistamines. Pt&#39;s vaccine card did not list vaccine lot number. I reached out to facility for the lot number and have not heard back.

On 03/27/2021, her nausea continued and she complained of shortness of breath while walking. On 03/28/2021, she was short of breath before vomiting a small amount. She then became unresponsive. Death was pronounced a short time later.  Per her treating physician who signed the death certificate, the cause of death is felt to be probable myocardial infarction due to electrolyte abnormalities due to complications of her diabetes mellitus.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

Lymph Node tenderness is resolved.

Her doctor said that he did not believe it to be cellulitis at this time and prescribed her a steroid cream.

At about 10pm when I went to bed, I had issues falling asleep because my heart felt like it was pounding through my chest.   That pounding came off and on during the next day.  I woke up twice and my feet were ice cold and my body was very hot.  The second time I woke I thought I would take some tylenol and was extremely dizzy walking to the bathroom.  I was so weak I couldn&#39;t open the bottle.  I slept nine hours, very unusual.  I felt very under the weather all day until around 5pm.  I woke up the next morning feeling pretty normal.  The arm pain was completely gone by the 18th.

I slowly went into the post office and was offered a chair.  It was over as fast as it hit me and everything was fine after that. No other adverse effects since then

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

I didn&#39;t need any medical intervention like O2 or IV administration of fluids or any medications. I was under observation and dranks about 30 oz of water to keep myself hydrated .

I was taken to a room and had vitals and was hypertensive and tachycardic with a worsening headache, I was given 50 mg Benadryl and put ice on my face and neck for about 20 minutes as I felt I was burning up. I remained at the clinic for an hour for monitoring. I never had difficulty breathing , and it was mostly resolved in about 45 minutes except for the mild headache and my face was still red and my eyes were swollen for at least an hour.

                                                About 3 minutes after receiving exam went to sit down to wait for 15 minutes. A flush came over my body and I felt myself becoming  tachycardic. I spoke to the nurse who hooked me up to bp machine. O2 sat was fine at 98. BP was 158/110, pulse rate was 157. Normal values for me are bp 120/70, pulse 80. BP started to go down and several minutes later another flush happened and bp and pulse rate went back up. Dropped again then third flush with increased bp and pulse happened. After this vitals went back to normal and didn&#39;t happen again. I subsequently developed a pounding headache which lasted until the next morning. Arm was sore as expected. BP that night was normal and the next morning normal. No further adverse effects noted other than fatigue.

It was brief.  Immediately following that pain, the fingers on my left hand went numb and I couldn&#39;t feel them -- particularly my pinky and ring fingers.  I could move my fingers but they were numb.  I did not have a fever. This lasted about 2 hours.  I iced the site of injection, kept my hand above my shoulder and massaged my fingers for the duration (about 2 hours).  When this first occurred my heart was racing -- but that might have been because it scared me.  I feel fine today.

                                                On Saturday on the 16th I started itching all over my body and my head, dry mouth and my ears were itching as well. On Sunday I noticed the itching  increased after taking my  levothyroxine. The 18th I noticed the same pattern of itching increasing after taking the levothyroxine the dry mouth as continued. Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

Chills, pain, weakness. Next day I was feeling well. I started noticing small dots on knee and shoulder. And then I started noticing bruising on my hands and legs. Felt fine on Sunday. I started noticing the bruises were becoming more pronounced. On Monday when I woke up the bruises were worse, and I went to the ER. The doctor checked CBC and platelets count was low around 28 thousand and was admitted into the hospital and they treated me with solumedrol 100 mg. Platelets count went back up.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA adverse event.   Approximately 7 hours after the 1st COVID vaccination on 2/22/2021, patient developed symptoms of fatigue, aches, chills &amp; fever. Her symptoms worsened into 2/23/21 with increasing shortness of breath. On arrival in the emergency center on 2/23/21,  she was hypoxic with  SpO2 81% on room air.  Oxygen supplement via nasal cannula was given which improved her oxygenation. Covid 19 test negative. Chest Xray shows pulmonary edema and CTA chest shows no PE.  She was admitted to the hospital and provided supportive care.   Pulmonary Edema and inflammatory process is likely associated with the vaccine. Patient appeared to be improving, however, on 2/26/21, she was working with Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy and had a pulse ox reading of 75% on room air. She was on 10 Liters of oxygen via nasal cannula by the time she make it back to bed and her pulse ox was 89%. Neurology exam shortly afterward the above event demonstrated an NIHSS of 21.  Patient became non-verbal and stat imaging revealed an acute hemorrhage in the left occipatal lobe likely representing a SAH.  Patient then transferred to another hospital that could provide neurosurgical intervention.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, pneumonia (had from Dec 2020 to Feb 2021 and had &#34;compromised lungs&#34;), allergies to penicillin and sulfa drugs, vitamin D deficiency, pseudobulbar effect, and traumatic brain injury (with swelling on back of brain stem, memory loss, problems with speech). Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium, vitamin C, vitamin D, fish oil, tizanidine, and fluvoxamine.     On 18 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number:029L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 18 Feb 2021, after receiving mRNA-1273 the patient reported to have a severe reaction to the vaccination. The patient had swelling at injection site which looked like a bee sting and felt hot.   On 19 Feb 2021, the patient reported to experience swelling and very bad pain in left hand. The patient took Benadryl as a treatment.   On 20 Feb 2021, terrible pain in arm was reported along with swelling. She went urgent care and they sent her to the hospital, where she stayed for about 8 hours.  Test showed a severe inflammatory reaction.  She also had headaches, her body was in a weakened state, pain went up her arm, she had a rapid heartbeat and a fever.  The patient&#39;s blood pressure was 289/89 and they &#34;thought she was going to have a stroke or a heart attack&#34; because her blood pressure was so high.    Treatment for the events included steroids and unspecified painkillers.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.    The outcome of the events peripheral swelling was considered to be not resolved at the time of reporting.  The outcome of the events of  severe reaction,  swelling and warmth at vaccination site, pain in the arm, inflammation, rapid heartbeat, blood pressure was 286/89/blood pressure was so high, fever, headache, and weakened body state was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I layed down on my office floor, , my heart rate went up to 140 BPM and BP was around 140/76. My MA checked it . One of my physician colleague&#39;s that was nearby checked on me as well as the nurse that gave me the injections. it took about 30-40 minutes for the symptoms to subside. I was sent to our Urgent care dept in the same clinic by wheelchair at around 12:30-12:40 pm. I was evaluated and my symptoms subsided in 30-40 minutes. I was out of Urgent care at 1:25 pm, able to walk upstairs back to my office and felt okay and was seeing patients again at 1:30 PM.  This reaction was similar to getting a shot of Novocaine w/ epinephrine for a dental procedure I received a few years ago, so if I were to sum it up it was like getting a shot of epinephrine. it was not a vasovagal reaction as my BP was high. I have felt fine since. I plan to get the second vaccine. Any suggestions to avoid these symptoms w/ the second one would be appreciated.

Went directly to ED. Sats  were good, no wheeze, throat swelling was noted. BP initially 150/93, peaked at 189/93,. Was 148/67 at discharge. Received oral Benadryl and Zyrtec, IV dexamethasone and Pepcid. ECG was done, no other labs. Observed for approx 90 minutes with improvement of all symptoms. Did need to take additional Benadryl dose approx 5 hours after first dose for return of mild throat fullness and rising BP. Both resolved within 30 minutes of dose. No further throat symptoms, BP fluctuations for over 24 hours now

The redness went down my arm to my inner elbow down my forearm to my wrist. The redness going down my arm was not as bad after I took the Allegra.  It was all extremely painful. I had to go see Dr. because the itching was so bad. Dr. prescribed medicine for the swelling/itching.  At times my throat was sore and my face was flushed and I had a tightness in my chest. But that did not last long.

Redness and tenderness went away after 3 days, however lump at injection site remained.  Redness and skin irritation suddenly appeared 2 weeks after injection along with slight chill sensation up and down arm.  Skin around injection site is very sensitive to touch.  I can see exactly where the injection was given 2 weeks ago as the needle entrance point is red.  I have applied Benadryl spray to the injection site and applied a bandage to prevent irritation from clothing rubbing site.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

My husband had called 911 when my blood pressure dropped so low.  By the time they arrived it was back up to normal.   I have never had any problems with blood pressure,  low or high. Or with dizziness,  fainting etc. I am very sure it was from the vaccine

                                                Patient had the first Moderna Covid vaccine on Thursday 1/21/2021.  She had a bit of sore arm on that day and the day after.  On Saturday 1/23/2021, she had a fever of 100.5 F (11AM), nausea, light headache and chills. The temperature went down after she took ibuprofen.  Patient&#39;s husband enrolled her to V-Safe to report all the adverse effects she experienced. On Sunday 1/24/2021, her temperature was 98.3F. She still had nausea and no appetite.  She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

I had missed a dose of Metoprolol the previous evening. I felt shaky/jittery and checked my BP and HR. Called the doctor on call at my PCP&#39;s office and he stated it is probably rebound hypertension and elevated HR due to missing the dose of Metoprolol last night. His direction was to check in two hours, and if still elevated, take 1/2 tablet Metoprolol. Current readings at 2:00 pm are 129/97 HR 99. Unsure if related to Covid vaccine. MD recommended reporting to CDC

                                                Severe dizziness to the point I was unable to walk or even sit without fear of passing out or falling and had to lay on the floor. Rapid heart rate, nausea, felt like blood pressure was going up a lot.  Afraid I was on the verge of having a stroke. Symptoms hit abruptly with no warning. Were severe for about an hour and then started subsiding.  Gradually felt better over the course of a couple of hours. After about 6 hours, symptoms completely gone and I felt fine.

                                                While waiting 15 minutes after the injection, I begin to feel my heart bounding. I checked my heart rate on my Apple watch, it was 165. The heart rate slowly came down  to the 120&#39;s after approximately 30 seconds and remained their for thirty minutes. I felt better  and left the vaccination location. Shortly after, while driving home my heartrate went up to 152 for approximately the same amount of time  so I drove to my doctors office and explained what happen. They told me to go to the emergency room. By then my heartrate was 109 and I was feeling better. I did not feel the need to go to the emergency room, which I live less than a mile from the nearest hospital. Eventually my heartrate settled at 70-80&#39;s nearly 4 hours after the event.

                                                Sore arm beginning the day after the injection and lasted for 2 days.  A second side effect occurred on January 6 - a swollen lymph node under my left arm, which was not the injection arm.  However, I had lymph nodes removed due to breast cancer in 2001..  Lymph node is normal on January 9.

                                                While driving home after leaving facility 15 minutes after shot, I started having an increased heart rate.  Once home, the rapid heart rate continued and I noticed throat swallowing was getting a little tighter.  I started drinking water and just breathed normally sitting down.  I went to a mirror to see if I could see any swelling of my face and noticed my neck right under my chin was red about half way down.  My chest seemed fine.  I continued to just sit &amp; drink water and soon the heart rate was getting back to normal.  I noticed the redness on my neck was getting lighter also.  I looked at my watch and it had been a little over an hour since my vaccination.  I did not seek treatment, nor have I called my doctor.  There have been no more adverse reactions.

                                                My throat started constricting air passage and it was hard to breathe in air through my mouth.  I went to the emergency room and was given an IV of steroids, Benadryl and pepsin.  They watched me for 2 hours and discharged me with prescriptions for steroids and Benadryl and pepsin.

                                                I had been freezing all evening after the shot.  Went to bed as usual for the night.  Woke up about 1 am which is normal for me.  I was still freezing.  Got up to go to the bathroom as I normally do.  While sitting on the toilet, I started shaking violently - not just regular shivers.  This was scary.  Violent jerking from the waist up - head, arms, torso.  I could not control it.  Eventually it stopped.  I put on warmer clothes and climbed back into bed.  Eventually I warmed up and went to sleep.  Other minor side effects were same as the first vaccine - sore and tender around the injection sight and slight headache.

                                                Patient is a 66 y.o. female presents with increasing shortness of breath and fatigue the last few days.  The patient presented to the ER just a few days after being discharged from Hospital.  The patient was treated as an inpatient at Hospital little under a week ago for a COPD exacerbation.  She showed dramatic improvement during this time, but over the last few days has started showing increasing signs of shortness of breath and severe fatigue.  She has no known coronavirus (COVID-19) contact, but states that anything is possible.  Her rapid coronavirus (COVID-19) test in the ER was negative.  However, her chest CT seem to suggest a severe viral pneumonia.  Because of this, the patient is going to be admitted to the hospital as she has failed outpatient therapy and is significantly hypoxic.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

She came back to the pharmacy area and she was seated and had her blood pressure checked. It was high (194/84) but she reported that she does have high blood pressure and takes her med at night.  She was given a bottle of water, monitored and her blood pressure was checked twice again over the next 20 minutes. It read lower each time she was checked and when it read 156/84 she said she felt fine and was ready to leave with her husband. She also said she was diabetic and had eaten a small breakfast compared to normally. She will be contacted today to make sure she is still feeling ok.

                                                Monday 02/15/2021 a 3 inch egg shaped rash started appearing at injection site. No pain but itched. Started as a few red pimples but became red all over and swollen (possible hives?). Later in evening swollen lymph node (about 1)2 inch diameter) under chin near left ear. Felt very tender. Lymph node swelling reduced by next morning. Rash at injection remained. Has diminished in color but is still pink thru today 02/22/2021 and no more itch.  Took no action at all. Notified primary care physician Thurs 02/18/2021. Note that on Friday 02/12/2021 (prior to rash appearing) started prescription prilosec 40 mg 1 per day. Continued this thru Thurs 02/18/2021.  Discontinued prilosec after speaking with primary care physician. Don&#39;t know if this had anything to do with reaction.

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

                                                Got slightly dizzy as I stood up. Went to sit in observation room.  My heart was beating very fast for about 8 minutes.  Felt a tightness in my chest and had a slight bit of difficulty breathing.  Did not want to tell the monitors.  Afraid to go to a hospital with COVID.  My left hand turned blue and got cold and tingly.  That lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  So did the trouble breathing.  All subsided in 15 minutes.  Went home and took an antihistamine.  Had a light rash on my body.  Consulted with PCP and cardiologist.  They seem clueless.  We all agreed that i need the second dose but what is the antidote.  Cardiologist gave me a beta-blocker to take before the dose but these symptoms all appeared on the severe allergic reaction list.  The heart pounding was the most pronounced symptom.  What do I do?

The doctor said I had an adverse reaction to something in the vaccine. The chief of Infectious disease thought I had a vaso vagel response.

I went over and rolled patient over having her lay face up and then proceeded to ask her questions. We had a staff member called 911 while I was helping her.  I asked her how she felt and she responded and said she felt &#34;hot all over and dizzy.&#34; Her pulse was low (~40 bpm). 911 informed us to lie her down on the floor until EMS arrived which we already had been doing at the time. After getting off the phone with 911, she started feeling better and her pulse returned to a normal rate (~80 bpm). EMS still took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

About 5 minutes later after receiving vaccine she passed out and fell onto floor. I went over to provide aid and rolled her over to have her lying face up while another staff member was calling 911. She was still awake and responsive when I proceeded to ask her questions and she informed me she felt &#34;hot all over and dizzy.&#34; 911 informed us to keep her lying down on the floor as comfortable for her as possible until EMS arrives on scene. While waiting for EMS to arrive her pulse was low (~40 bpm), but shortly before EMS arrived on scene her pulse rose to a normal heart rate (~80 bpm). EMS then took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                16 hours after the injection, I was awakened with needing to vomit.  I had only clear liquid which I coughed out.  I was having difficulty catching my breath and unable to burp or clear the liquid.  After three tries, I was able to clear the airway and was able to breathe well.  I also checked my blood pressure which was 163/83.  I had phlegm in my throat and could clear it with drinking water.  After approximately 40 minutes of checking and rechecking my blood pressure and drinking water, I was able to sleep until 9:00 am.  It is now 24 hours from the injection and I feel much better.

                                                One week after taking the vaccine I developed significant swelling of the upper left arm at the vaccination site that gradually got worse as the day progressed. I also experienced a headache and a severe spike in blood pressure in the afternoon, which led me to think that my reaction might be severe. As a result I went to the local ER where they decided to keep me overnight for observation. The symtoms did not get worse, but I was given steroids and peptid intravenously, as well as Benadryl to counteract the swelling. Today, Jan. 28, I continue to have some swelling in the left arm, as well as redness.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Monday, 2-15-21. 11:45 am. ? Received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  12:30 pm. ? Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

                                                In about 12 hrs I felt fevered,  then went to cold, then I started trembling.  So hard, I still felt cold, but this wasn?t shivering,  I wanted to go to get in warm water.  I was shaking so bad I couldn?t take my clothes off.   I got in with clothes on, I was getting delirious.   My whole body was contracting so hard I couldn?t sit in the tub flat, my but cheeks contracting with all muscles.   I found myself in the night with a sticking hat soaked in water to cover my face.  I could not have called for help when the muscle contractions  were going on.  That lasted I think 30-45 minutes.  I was groggy on the 20th all day but getting much better.   I was very excited for vaccine and would do it again, but wanted to report what I consider pretty rough side effect, so you could make note of it. And I still thank you for the vaccine,  but dang I truly thought I was dying.

ON 2/6/2021 received first vaccine injection.  within 3 minutes a light headache started.  That evening, rash and itching on right fore-arm and under chin. took benedryl.

Oxygennn @98  HR-82 BP 145/77.  11.00 pm 103.3 temp. took 2 tylenol.  Mon 8:00 Monday am continued/ 100.2 temp  oxygen 97  HR-70; 99.2 temp  BP 110/71.  7 pm. took Benedryl for congestion.   Quit taking stats.  Fatigue and rest took play at this point.  Since then have had intermittent low grade fever in 99.2 to 99.9.  Same with headache and extreme fatigue.  Have high risk husband that I take care of .  He had his first vaccine at same time.  No side effect at all.  I am scheduled for 2nd vaccine on March 6th.  I am very apprehensive about taking it with this reaction.  Please advise/recommend if I should proceed.  My PCP stated that these reactions were evidence the vaccine is working.  Is this because I had the virus???  Both the virus and vaccine have been really hard on me.  I am usually a very active person and since August, I have been struggling with fatigue.  First time in life.   Thank you.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination on Saturday January 16th 2021 at approximately 12pm. She completed all necessary screening forms and was deemed to be at low risk for serious allergic reactions. She tolerated the vaccination well, and no complications or immediate adverse events occurred. She was observed for a full 15 mins per CDPHE/CDC guidelines and left the Clinic in stable condition after her observation period was complete. On the morning of Tuesday, January 19th, 2021, the patient was found unconscious and unresponsive by her husband. She was transferred by Ambulance to Hospital shortly thereafter. She was diagnosed with a brain bleed that was determined to be inoperable. She was transferred to other Hospital for higher level care.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up at 2:15 a.m. feeling pains in my chest middle and extending through to my upper back.  The pain encompassed the span of my upper chest and back from one arm to the other.  I experienced very rapid heartbeats that I could feel throbbing from my head to my chest.  I was hesitant to move or rise from my bed because of the pain.  At 3:40 I called 911.  They did an EKG and I was told that my heart was fine.  My blood pressure was 180/90.  I chose not to go to the hospital but to call my doctor when his office opened up at 9:00 a.m. in approximately 5 hours.  My doctor had me come into his office.  I had another EKG which was fine and he sent me to have a Cat Scan. the same day which was also fine.  My doctor spoke to me and said that he felt that this was due to side effects of the vaccine.  I doubled up on my Acid Reflux medicine, taking 80 mg daily for  four days through Monday 2/22/2021.  I could not sleep well for three days after the vaccine experiencing pain in my chest and could not breathe deeply without feeling it.  Then I steadily improved and today I can take deep breaths with little pain.  I also experienced muscle pain in my left shoulder and neck but used Mineral Ice on my neck and was relieved in one day.

The levels remained in the mid to upper 200s. With an average A1c in the high 5s and low 6s, this was unusual for me.

                                                symptoms since her dose of Covid Moderna vaccine on Jan the 25th.  In the first 1-2 days she had the usual soreness at the injection site but nothing else. Then, about a week after it, her arm in the area of the injection site gradually became red and warm and indurated slightly without pain About the same time she noted a sense of fatigue and feverishness. Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .  Other symptoms she is complaining of bilateral lateral hip pain. She feels quite achy. She believes this started since the vaccine dose I believe she may have had some complaints prior to it. No joint complaints, no upper extremity symptoms other than as above. No HA, ST. She has had what she describes as &#34;spasms in her chest&#34;) which has improved but presented about the same time as the arm and temperature did. No Gi symptoms. Her activity has not been curtailed. Neck pain bilat was noted starting the end of December without other symptoms and wo any hx of trauma and did not feel like a typical wry neck.    No travel other than for the vaccine, to the grocery store and rarely to another shop. No exposures to anyone other than our grandchildren, son and dau-in-law who are in our &#34;bubble&#34; (the granddaughter attends an out door preschool where they all wear masks and have had no covid cases.Patient walks weekly out doors with a friend. She sees her mother who at 96 resides at home and sees no one.  She had a NP swab for Covid PCR test yesterday (the 17th) which is reported this am as &#34;undetected&#34;.  An evaluation with Doctor led to blood work showing wbc 9.2, hgb 11, plt 546k, ESR 74, CRP 67 a diagnosis of PMR was tentatively made and she was started on prednisone 15 mg /d.  Improvement was seen at 24 hours and persisted. Neck pain is 80% better as well.  Questions: Did the vaccine play a role in exacerbating a preceeding condition of PMR? If the neck pain is a red herring, did the vaccine cause PMR?

I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

                                                I spoke to my sister on the phone an hour or two after she got the vaccine and she was slurring her words.  The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

The patient received Cardizem IV, converted back to sinus rhythm and discharged home two days later on Lopressor PO.   Treatment for the event included Cardizem IV and Lopressor PO.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the event AFIB was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of atrial fibrillation. This event occurred 1 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 013L20A.  Treatment included Cardizem iv and Lopressor po.

                                                I work at  medical center where patient is being treated for a new diagnosis of Acute monocytic leukemia.  I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

She no sooner said to wait 30 mins, I turned to look at clock and bam! everything hit at once.   I was told to go to ambulance on site. They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

                                                On 1-27-21 my mother received her first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (031L2A). The next day she felt something in the back of her left knee. The following day (2 days) after the injection she saw her primary care physician for the discomfort in the back of her knee. She was treated for what was believed to be a soft tissue injury. She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 (14M20A) vaccine on Friday 2-26-21. The next day the back of her knee started to bother her again. She saw her doctor on Monday3-1-21 and had an x-ray. On Tuesday the doctor&#39;s office called and said her x-ray  was clear. Friday morning, 3-5-21 my father heard a loud noise (thud) and  found my mother unresponsive on the bathroom floor at approximately 8:30am. He called 911. She was transported to the hospital via ambulance. The emergency room physicians worked on her for over an hour and were unable to get her back. Her time of death was 10:12am. The primary cause of death listed on her death certificate is pulmonary embolism.

I developed chills and had muscle aches like the flu.  No fever.  The next day, my arm started getting sore below the injection site and itched.  That night, my whole arm was swollen, red,  sore, hot to touch and itched.  The redness extended around my upper arm and down to the elbow.  It had been 8 days since the vaccination and I still have the red itchy arm.

On 23 Jan 2021, she had nerve pain that felt like cutting on the back, legs, and arms.  On 24 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s muscles were weak and were not working or responsive on both sides.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient could not control her left hand and weakness was more predominant on left side. The patient went to the doctor and was hospitalized with minor stroke for 24 hours. The patient stated that she was still experiencing terrible pain in neck and lower back.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, minor stroke, weak muscles, nerve pain, injection site reaction, and achy, was unknown. The outcome of event, terrible pain in neck and lower back, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and evidence of a temporal association between mRNA-1273 use and the onset of injection site reaction and achy, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. There is limited information to asses causality for the events of injection site reaction, and achy.  Additional information has been requested.

On Feb 21st started having severe pain in both legs from the knees down to the ankles. No swelling, but ice and ibuprofen lessened the pain some. Still also have tenderness in right arm from when shot was administered. Wondering if the pain my legs is related to the shot. Have also had small headache since having shot everyday.

                                                Blood clot on right lung; soreness in arm; A spontaneous report was received from  a 72 year old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced blood clot on right lung  (pulmonary embolism) and myalgia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient had family history of blood clot (mother and brother). No concomitant product use was reported.  On 02-Feb-2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient had soreness in the right arm which subsided couple of days later. The patient also experienced shortness of breath for a week after vaccine administration. On 17-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and underwent COVID-19 virus test, the results of which were negative. On 17-Feb-2021, the computerized tomography scan on chest showed moderate size blood clot on right lung. On 18-Feb-2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital on recommendation to initiate and continue lifetime treatment with Eliquis (apixaban, 5mg every 12 hours). According to the physician, moderate size blood clot on right lung of the patient could be attributed to the genetic history (patient&#39;s mother and brother also had blood clot). The patient also followed up with primary care physician, who informed that it was genetic and not related to vaccine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism was unknown. The outcome of the event, myalgia was considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The cardiologist suspected the patient may have had a heart attack two days earlier because her cardiac enzymes were too high to be a result of a recent heart attack. The patient was admitted to the hospital from 28-JAN-2021 until 01-FEB-2021. Catheterization and stent placement were performed. Treatment medications included acetaminophen, clopidogrel, metoprolol, low-dose aspirin, and atorvastatin. At the time of this report, the patient was still feeling fatigued but other than that, she was feeling better.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, heart attack, cough, muscle pain in chest area, fever, chills, and chest pain, were resolved. The outcome of the event, fatigue, was not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                On 01/11/2021, within a few hours of my grandmother getting the shot her injection area became red, swollen and hot to the touch. At around midnight the day her shot she started to experience tingling on both sides of my tounge. She an unusually restless night and on 1/12/2021 woke up feeling very tired and over all worn down.  Around 10:45a my I called to check on her she said she had just checked her temp and it was 99.6.  She was complaining of being very cold and had the shivers.  While on the phone she started to develop a stutter. At first it was one word every 14-20 word but it quickly got worse to the point where she couldn&#39;t get a full  word out and just sounds. I immediately left work and went to her house. On my way we contacted 911.  It took me about 10 mins to get to her house and when I got there she was semi- unresponsive on the couch making moaning noises and shaking. She was having severe muscle spasms throughout her body. You could see her muscles tighten and release. EMS got there within a few minutes after me. They checked her temp and it had increased to 101.00 she was a bit responsive and they were able to take her vitals however, it was difficult due to her shaking and convulsing. They transported her to the hospital and by they time they arrived (within 15 mins) her temp was then 102.6. She was still shaking, not lucid and stuttering her words. They hospital ran several tests to rule out stroke and other possible reasons for her symptoms- they said she had to be having a delayed reaction to the shot. She was extremely dehydrated, they hooked her up to an IV, she had an extremely elevated white blood count and was overall &#34;out of it&#34;. She was given IV antibiotics and observed.

It did not get to a point of an anaphylactic shock just a mild reaction. I consulted my PCP afterwards regarding the second dose and he said since it was not severe and I was able to take care of it myself, I could get the second one.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                Atrial Fibrillation; Tachycardia (Double heart rate); A spontaneous report was received from a 73-year-old female consumer who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced atrial fibrillation and tachycardia.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Jan 2021, the patient reported having atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. Treatment for the events included metoprolol.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73-year-old, female patient. The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient experienced an unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. The event occurred 2 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

The patients&#39; medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications list was provided.   On 24 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of symptoms, patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 011J20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID -19 infection.  On 25 Dec 2020, patient experienced shortness of breath with low oxygen saturation levels.   On 26 Dec 2020, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue.   On 27 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s energy was back to normal.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient woke up in the morning with symptoms of almost could not breathe, could not walk across the room.  The patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation 83%.  The patient was struggling for every breath.  The patient tested negative for COVID-19.  On 30 Dec 2020, another COVID-19 test was negative.  On 31 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation closer to 90%, and she reported getting better. Symptoms remained the same for about a week.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient experienced left ankle and foot swollen.

Treatment for the events experienced included intravenous heparin and blood thinners.   Action taken with planned second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The event, extreme fatigue, was considered resolved on 27 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, slight fever, DVT and saddle PE were not provided.  Follow-up received on 19 Jan 2021 included updated events (DVT and saddle PE), updated event details, treatment, and hospitalization details.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of 73- year-old female patient who experienced serious event of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and non-serious events of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue the next day after administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 011J20A, expiration date-unknown. Based on temporal information provided and the known safety profile of the vaccine and the absence of any other etiology factors, a causal association between the vents of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue and the administration of  mRNA-1273 vaccine cannot be excluded. Fever and fatigue are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine.  There is no enough information t clinically assess the causal association between the events of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis as the patient&#39;s medical history and list of concomitant medications were lacking.

                                                I woke up in the night (approx. 2:00 a.m.) with freezing cold feet and hands.  This continued throughout the night (I could not get warm) until I fully awoke at 7:00 a.m. when  took my temperature.  That was 100.6.  After speaking to my doctors office, I took Tylenol and my temperature reduced to 99.8 for the rest of the day.  By 9:00 p.m., it had gone down to normal without medication.  I still suffered from exhaustion and seem to have ongoing digestive issues.

                                                Approximately 2 weeks after the first COVID vaccine she developed shortness of breath that was much more significant than she had previously. This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don&#39;t think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.  She had other comorbidities as well which I&#39;m sure predisposed her such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer for many years.

                                                I am not 100% certain of this event being related to the vaccination with the Moderna COVID19 shot or not.  However, in the interest of completeness and for investigative purposes, I am reporting to you the event in relation to the vaccination as the patient reported to me.  She received the vaccination on 2/14/2021 and became very confused.  She had significant left arm swelling much worse than when she had her first vaccination.  Her husband brought her to the emergency room and she was eventually discharged, but she went on to develop significant hypertension and she reported that her blood pressures were normal prior to the vaccination.  She had an emergency room visit in which her systolic pressures were well above 240.  She revisited the emergency room and had elevated blood pressures of 240 and was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy and later found to have posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or PRES.  We have started the patient on medications, and started laboratory work-up for secondary hypertension and her blood pressures have improved with treatment.  We discussed the case with the neurologist, who suggested that we repeat MRI scan to make sure that her punctate lesions noted on MRI on this admission on 2/25/2021, have resolved.  It was advised that if they had not resolved that we should call neurology again.  Hypertensive encephalopathy is rare and press syndrome as a result is also rare.  It is for this reason that I am reporting this event as again, I am not trying to mislead anyone or distort information, but should this be an adverse effect of the vaccine I wanted to make sure that this was reported as the patient&#39;s history prior to the vaccination and developing this complication post vaccination are temporally related at a minimum.  The patient is a known smoker but quit on the 14th of this month.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  2/27/21: Pt received 1st Moderna vaccine 2/4/2021. She states that her symptoms 1st started out as a slight postnasal drip, which turned into a hoarse voice with a cough, which turned into a head cold, which has turned in due shortness of breath, diarrhea, and cough with associated chills. After 17 days of cold-like symptoms, pt was tested on 2/26 for COVID and tested positive. 2/27, pt worsened and presented to ED. Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient&#39;s temperature is 100.2° F, heart rate 96, respiratory rate 24, saturating 84% on room air with blood pressure 164/84.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were significant for BUN 17, CR 1.47, lactate 2.2, D-dimer 6.79, and phosphorus 2.2.  The patient&#39;s chest x-ray showed no acute findings.  CT chest showed extensive acute bilateral pulmonary emboli involving most of the lobar and segmental branches, right greater than left with no saddle embolus.  Findings borderline for right heart strain, correlate with echocardiogram.  Peripheral ground-glass airspace opacities consistent with atypical/viral pneumonitis.  Reactive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 93 with inferior infarct-age undetermined.  The patient was administered 1 L IV NS, ceftriaxone 1 g IV, azithromycin 500 mg IV, and heparin IV bolus and drip for PE indication. Remdesivir started.  2/28/21: Pt on 3 L oxygen. Azithromycin, ceftriaxone, remdesivir continued. Vancomycin started.  3/1/21: 1 L oxygen via nasal cannula. Small, nonproductive cough. Pt complains of SOB.  3/2/21: 1/2 blood cultures from 2/27 positive for CoNS. Vancomycin discontinued. Pt feeling much better. Still on 1 L oxygen via nasal cannula. More alert.  3/3: 5 day remdesivir course and azithromycin, ceftriaxone course completed. Patient weaned off oxygen. Pt discharged home with oxygen as a precaution. Pt also enrolled in COVID Safe At Home telehealth program.

The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure, and thyroid disorder.  Concomitant medications included enalapril hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin for &#34;cholesterol&#34; and a &#34;thyroid medication.&#34;  On 29-Jan-2021, at 0931, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 004M20A ) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 29-Jan-2021, 46 minutes after vaccine administration, patient reported that she started feeling like a heavy weight was pressuring her chest from the inside and also felt like a heavy pressure was coming from outside her body. At 1100, she stated that she experienced a feeling like a heavy thing was moving across her chest and she reportedly had a hard time breathing. Her oxygen level dropped to 80%, but by breathing intensely she managed to bring it to 84-87%. She reported her pulse to be 115. All of these symptoms lasted for 20 minutes. Later, she reported that her oxygen level returned to 90% and then eventually to 94%.  However, she reported that for the next few days she felt like her heart rate was fast through the day, for about 5 days.  She said that she felt like it was beating really fast and felt like it was moving up her throat, giving her a choking feeling. Since last Friday, 05-Feb-2021, she stated that she has had no more problems. Patient reached out to her HCP who denied her any post-vaccine related attention.    Treatment activities for event included taking ibuprofen 600 mg after the vaccination.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 13 Feb 2021, the patient received the first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch# 007M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the night of 13 Feb 20212, the patient experienced arm hurt a little bit and she felt fatigued.  In the early morning of 14 Feb 2021, the patient went to the bathroom.  On her way to the bathroom,  she felt confused and had overwhelming nausea.  She lost consciousness and banged her head on the cabinet.  Within second, she regained consciousness but felt extremely weak.  She could not recall how she got back to her bed.  The patient said she was cold and clammy at that time and she never got back to sleep.  During the day on 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt a throbbing pain on the arm where she got the injection.  She was not sure whether that was due to the injection or due to her fall when she lost consciousness.  She could barely move the arm.  Then she took a nap in the afternoon and was able to recover from her lack of sleep that night.    Treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown (although her doctor advised her not to get the second dose given the reaction she had).  The outcome of the events was resolved on 15 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.

                                                Moderna Shot on February 23, 2021. Tired, sluggish and headache along with some ringing in the head.  March 22, 2021 I had second Moderna shot. My arm was very swollen, fatigue and bad headache with loud ringing in the head. My blood pressure accelerated  to nearly 200/88 and had to be admitted to the ER three days after shot. I was in the hospital for two days and had a series of CAT scans and ultrasounds.  Loud ringing in my head has not stopped. Never had a history of high blood pressure, but now they put me on high blood pressure medication along with the baby aspirin. I was a relatively healthy woman until I had these vaccinations.

                                                Typical expected side effects but were very SEVERE and UNable to function normally- headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Dizziness, Chills, Cold Sweats, Pain and soreness especially in lower back, and throat hurt when swallow.  These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

The patient&#39;s medical history included back problems with osteoarthritis in the spinal column neck and lower back. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included celecoxib and nortriptyline.   On 20 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 21 Jan 2021, the patient reported she got very dizzy and passed out. Her husband relays that she was totally out for a couple of seconds. She went to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a vasovagal reaction and urinary tract infection. Premature ventricular contractions were also discovered and was not known prior to this event. Patient reports a normal blood pressure of 114-120/75. Patient also stated her arm was sore the day after vaccine but not hurting much during her usual four mile walk.   Treatment for the event included intravenous medications in the emergency room, cephalexin, and a heart monitor.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events passed out, dizziness, vasovagal reaction and arm pain were resolved. The outcome of the events, urinary tract infection and premature ventricular contractions were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of dizziness, passed out, vasovagal reaction, urinary tract infection, premature ventricular contractions and arm pain.  The events occurred the next day after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current limited available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.  Further information have been requested.

Hospital admission that evening. 2/26 Steroid treatment stopped headaches and eye pain. 2/27 released from hospital after BP was &lt;160.  Diagnosis-migraines possibly triggered by vaccine.  Pain/nausea elevated BP and decreased food intake which caused low blood sodium levels. IV treatments to increase sodium and lower BP. Dizziness from low sodium and high BP created fall risk, so bed had alarm.  Bed confinement necessitated daily injections to prevent blood clots.  Twice daily blood tests done to monitor sodium and potassium levels &#43; kidney function.

Blood pressure rose to 170-190 over 110 and would not go down.  Doctor advised I go to the E.R. for assessment, which I did. Blood pressure remained elevated for days . Noted the systolic was higher , mostly in the 80&#39;s.  I do not have hypertension BP this morning  in the 120&#39;s over 70.  Needed Alprazolam to calm my anxiety since.  Not every day. Very concerned about having the second dose. Doctor has advised me to only drink water the day of shot, take a tranquilizer an hour before and has given me BP med to take if my BP goes over 150.

She reports no weight changes, no cough, shortness of breath, PND, dysuria, swelling.  Patient originally presented to the ED at hospital 3/1/2021 with a generalized body aches and pains of 1 day duration. In the ER, patient was hypertensive and labs showed elevated creatinine of 1.6 (baseline 1.27), BNP &gt;8000.  She describes her symptoms as a sub-acute onset hand and leg weakness. It appears that the leg symptoms started before the arms were affected, after which she developed positive sensory symptoms in the form tingling of the hands and feet. She also admits to negative symptoms in the form of decreased sensation of her feet. She has been unable to stand on her feet since about two days ago. She appears to have some disturbance in time perception as her recollection of the progression of her disease is off by several weeks. she denies bowel/bladder incontinence or saddle anesthesia.
