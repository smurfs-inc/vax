Began to feel dizzy, weak, was sweating, and had a flushed appearance in face.  On attempt to stand, felt like I could not take a step.  In ER vitals were normal except for blood pressure was high.  Was discharged after receiving IV fluids, lab tests, EKG.  About 5 hours later, I developed a low grade fever of 99.7, blood pressure 142/92, chills,  general malaise and body aches.  Symptoms started dissipating later in the evening.  Started feeling better as the day progressed the next day.

                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

                                                Patient received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at her place of employment as a phase 1A essential frontline healthcare worker in a skilled nursing LTC facility on January 6 2021. The day after receiving the vaccine (1-7-21), she started to feel increased shortness of breath (she has shortness of breath at baseline due to chronic health conditions- CHF, asthma), a heavy feeling in her chest/lungs, sweating and fatigue. She contacted the pharmacy on January 8th, as we were the entity that vaccinated her to ask about vaccine reaction. Due to her medical history of MI and CHF, pharmacist did not want to dismiss this as a reaction to the vaccine, and recommended that she contact her doctor for further guidance. She did reach out to her care team, and ended up going to the emergency room for testing due to cardiac history and presentation of symptoms. She had diagnostic testing done (see item 19) and the ER doctor attributed her symptoms to an exacerbation of CHF and asthma, noting that vaccine involvement in the worsening of her symptoms can not be ruled out. Treatment/discharge instructions include: follow up with cardiology/pulmonology, furosemide dose was increased, potassium supplement restarted, and instructed to use inhalers already on hand when needed. As of time of report on January 9 2021, the patient was resting at home, doing well except still having symptoms upon exertion.

The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

                                                After the shot my left arm became sore and tender. Later my arm had pain from my elbow radiating up into my neck and head causing a massive headache on the left side of my head. I had chills with NO fever. I felt nauseated. I went to work the following day with all of the previous symptoms. I experienced sweats along with the chilling and light headed ness. I started to experience tachycardia. My supervisor on my floor took my blood pressure and it was 164/122 and my pulse rate was 190. A PA was available and examined me and asked if I had caffeine which I didn?t. After sitting and being re-examined my blood pressure was 142/100, and my pulse was 90. I was sent home. At home I still experienced the headache and was fatigued, and my arm was still sore and tender. This happened within 24-25 hours after receiving the vaccine. Today my arm is slightly sore and I still have a headache but it is not as severe as previous.

Also I have arm soreness in my left arm where I got the injection, malaise/fatigue, joint pain, and mild nausea. But I&#39;m making this report due to the strange development of buzzing/fizzing in my chest.  It seems unrelated to breathing. I have a Kardia 6-lead EKG and it is reading normal. My blood pressure is about where it usually is (143/93, elevated due to as-yet untreated Cushing&#39;s Syndrome. I do take metoprolol succinate to bring it down somewhat, but diastolic has been chronically 90 and above for several months despite medication.) I don&#39;t feel this is a cardiac event, but of course I would like to be sure. It has been constant on and off fizzing/buzzing since 7:30 this morning (may also have been occurring while I was asleep), and it&#39;s now 11:08 a.m. My question is whether I need to go to urgent care/ER. Plan is to call Moderna and talk to them about this, and then make a decision about what to do next. I&#39;m reading online that this could be an immune response, that some people with COVID get the fizzing and buzzing. But I never stop with Dr. Google. I&#39;m going to speak with the manufacturer and then either my primary care doc or an urgent care/ER doc. So I clicked &#34;none of the above&#34; below, but I will likely be seeing a doctor today.

She was assisted by EMS (who was on site).  Her blood pressure was 249/149 per the patient.  She also experienced some lightheadedness.  It was strongly suggested by EMS &amp; nursing staff that she be transported to the ER but she refused stating she had to work the next day.  She continued to be monitored by EMS until her blood pressure stabilized &amp; she felt better.  She continued to refuse ER.  She was driven home by her companion.   On 1/28/2021 she sent an email to the health department showing a picture of her left arm showing redness from the injection site down to above the bend in her left arm.

Got sick on Tuesday, the January 5th - woke up with a sore throat; hoarse throat; fever; chills; cough - and chest was congested.  Fever came and went. A bit of muscle aches in my chest from coughing so much. I called the DR and they sent me down to the COVID area of my doctor&#39;s office. They did COVID test and told me to go home. On Thursday, they reported that I was negative on my test. I called my Dr  and she told me she had to still be quarantined for 10-14 days. She told me to take my asthma medicine and she told me to take cough medicine (OTC) and take Tylenol if I still need something else. She told me to drink fluids and rest. I went back to work on January 19th, Tuesday. I still have a little bit of congestion and cough.  I had the second dose of the Moderna on January 28th. I had  a sore arm but not as bad as last time.

Could  not function during the day hardly at all.  After 36 hours felt almost no symptoms.  Shot given on Tuesday and Thursday night awoke with very high heart rate.  114 BPM - upon arriving at work was given a blood pressure reading of 170/160.  I called my doctor and due to not having any other symptoms of stroke prescribed a low dose high blood pressure medication.  I took only 2 doses but due to very adverse effects to the medication stopped after 2 doses.  My BP was going down as I was checking it.  The medication made me feel very dizzy with fatigue and increased heart rate.  On Monday morning at 1:00 A.M. - 2/8 I awoke AGAIN with chest discomfort and extremely high BPM - 140.  I called 911 and was admitted to the ER.  After 3 hours both BP and BPM decreased to a normal range and i was released.  Chest x-ray and blood draw  were all normal.  Continued to experience some dizziness during the day but could function.

                                                Five days following the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed diffuse body pain, beginning in the right shoulder (for which she received a steroid injection), but then spreading to the entire body. This pain became so severe that she presented to the hospital via EMS, and was found to have a platelet count of 41 (9 days following the vaccine). No baseline platelet count is available prior to the vaccine (most recent was from 2019). Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is being considered, and the patient has been placed on IVIG and steroids. It is now 4 days into the patient&#39;s admission, and platelets continue to fall (currently 26). Hemoglobin appears normal at the time and there is no sign of active bleeding. Of note, the patient also has positive blood cultures, so thrombocytopenia as a result of sepsis is also a possibility.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

Sort of light headed.  My heart was racing.  When I looked at my watch it recorded my heart rate at 160 beats per minute!!  I started taking deep breaths and a technique called EFT tapping to calm me down.  Eventually it worked, but I felt extreme tiredness after that.  When I woke up in the morning my entire face was swollen.  I also noticed on the 2nd day after vaccine shot I had dark purple circles under my eyes.  None of those things have ever happened to me before in my life.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

The patient continued to monitor her blood glucose level and administer the correct amount of insulin following the  insulin titration outline.  The patient avoided eating large meals throughout the day.  The patient reported that her insulin levels began to decrease approximately 10-12 hours following the vaccine administration. The patient reported that she never felt the effects or symptoms of the elevated blood glucose.  The patient noticed the spike in her blood glucose due to the routine monitoring of her blood glucose.

                                                I noticed many days after getting the first shot a kind of sick all over feeling, loose stools and cramping lower GI, nausea gassiness, a lot of phlegm in throat, headache, and some chest pain, each evening just after dark and into bedtime. The last day I had it was yesterday and it was all day. My doctor asked me to report this to you. By the way I have the date wrong my vaccine was 02/19/2021 but the form won&#39;t let me go back to fix it. Symptoms came up suddenly 7 days later.

                                                About 3 hours getting the shot, I started having tightness in the chest along with a stabbing pain in my left shoulder blade. It was severe at times then it would subside a little.  I chewed on a aspirin to make the tightness go away and it seemed to help but then the pain would return.   This continued for around 48 hours then subsided.  I was seriously considering going to the ER, but I  didn&#39;t want to risk exposure to Covid by going to the ER.   I do have high blood pressure but I have NEVER felt anything like this.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  Other side effects were ones I read about but usually after the 2nd shot.  This was my FIRST shot.    I had a temperature of 100.6 although I was FREEZING.  My feet were cold to the touch and yet the thermometer read over 100.   Pain at the injection site ( it hurt like hell when the bedsheet touched my arm!   Alternated between burning up and freezing.

Day 10 (today) itching at injection site significant enough for me to stretch in my sleep.  Injection site visably swollen, warmer to the touch than surrounding area,  no rash.

Throat started to swell up, and dry, very nauseous, shaking while no fever, eliminated all stools, and my heart staryed to beat fast mixed up with irregularity. It settled a bit after 1 hour after i did Therapy, a tapping method to support the immune system and help with adverse reactions. Stayed nauseous for days, and as of today 3/14/2021 i still don&#39;t feel like myself yet. Still tired, weak, a bit shaky, just off.

                                                Gave a patient a Moderna vaccine today. ( 03/15/2021)  Patient stated before I gave then vaccine to her that she had felt dizzy after receiving her flu vaccination previously.  Patient became dizzy and lightheaded after I gave her the Moderna (10:40am). Patient was concerned that her blood sugar was low and took a glucose gel packet from her purse.  She stated that she thought she might faint, so moved the patient to the floor with her feet elevated.  I took the patient&#39;s blood sugar, it was 211. I monitored her pulse, it was strong and not racing. Placed a cool wet rag on the patient&#39;s forehead. Patient remained lying down for 10 minutes and said she was feeling better and asked to sit up.  I assited her in sitting up on the floor. Had her sit on floor for 5 minutes more before helping her to a chair.  Continued to monitor patient for an additional 10 minutes.  She stated she felt better and had her companion escort her to his car and drove home.  Followed up with patient an hour later, she stated that she felt much better and had eaten lunch and was taking it easy.  She thanked us for assisting her. I will follow up with her tomorrow.

                                                Got her vaccine with no problem, got her vaccine and felt dazed as she was going to the waiting area.  She was anxious and then started feeling heaviness in her chest.  She felt dazed, nothing registered and was not focused on anything, and sat for 25 minutes.    She then got up and walked to the car, felt like she was in the clouds and her right lung was really, really bothering her by the time she got home and tired.   Her heart rate was 140 and very fast.  She didn&#39;t feel as if she was anxious but just blaise.   She was really winded and exhausted by the time she got home.  She had not eaten before she got the vaccine, made herself a sandwich and fell asleep and slept for about 3 hours.  When she woke up she had a very, very sore arm.  Then on Saturday, she woke up around 3:00 AM, and could not go back to sleep as she was wide awake.  Then every task that she did just exhausted her and still felt heaviness in her chest and back and the right lung was really bothering her like she had worked like an animal for a period of time.  She has a small apartment and it doesn&#39;t take any energy to walk to the kitchen.  Saturday she felt fine, was cleaning and felt good.  Sunday she slept all day and her right lung was still hurting her.  Yesterday was still exhausted and winded feeling.  Today, 3/16/21 she is still feeling the same way and exhausted doing simple tasks.  She has a nodule in her right lung and several spots in her left lung but nothing is being done for them.  The vaccine seems to have exacerbated the symptoms and made them worse.  The injection site is a little sore but nothing out of the ordinary for a vaccine.  She took two Advil for her symptoms which did help as she had pain in her head with this which will last for 5-10 minutes and then goes away.  She has notified her doctor and she has an appointment on Friday at 11:00 AM.

Then the pounding in my chest started with pressure in my neck and head. After an hour I ended up in the ER with SVT. My heart was beating close to 200 beats a minute. My heart slowed down on its own to 114 beats a minute.

                                                I was waiting as required and I started feeling itchy. Then it started in my legs and knees, and ended up staying in there an extra 20 min. I left and got halfway over the bridge and had to go back. My lips got numb and the tip of my tongue. I kept having to clear my throat. I went to the ER and my heart felt like it was pounding out of my chest. Once they gave me the Benadryl, Pepcid and steroids via IV, it got better but didn&#39;t go away. They also gave me oral steroids to take at home. The symptoms remained for 3 days or more. I also had a metallic taste in my mouth. I was awakened during the night multiple times. After about 3 days the itchiness and blotchiness went away, but the taste remained for like a week. After a full week, I was back to 100%.

My heart rate still continued to stay high.  I drove home and continued to monitor my heart rate.  My heart rate stayed elevated for the remainder of the evening.  The lowest was around 99 bpm when I retired to bed.  Woke the next morning with a heart rate in the 80&#39;s.  Normally my resting heart rate is around 62 bpm. Within 24 hours, my heart rate was back to normal. As of today, my heart rate is back to normal.    I have a slight cough, but I believe that is due to my sinus allergies.

                                                Within two hours I felt heat in the left arm and head twice, then four hours later I had pinching in the left side abdomen colon area, Eight hours later I felt pinching in the chest area and repeated pinching in the colon area. Later towards evening I felt a slight headache and then stiffness in the left neck area. Fifteen hours later I felt intense pain in the right hip and towards the buttock region, including right leg pain for about six hours. It was very difficult to walk when the pain came on.I got the sniffles on and off that day. I experienced leg stiffness in both legs for over two weeks and it was painful to walk during this time. It was like an artherosclerotic event in that everything  stiffened up and my legs felt like logs. I started to get on and off pain in the upper inner thigh region, which felt like nerve pain. This nerve pain was often felt in both legs as well. My daily walk became very difficult to do. The second week I began to have a vein pulsate in my right forearm and a tic developed in that area. This went on for three days. By the third week I started experiencing daily headaches.  My blood pressure increased in the third week to about 167/90 up from 136/80. Up until today, March 17 I still have mild headaches on and off, and some mild inner thigh nerve pain, and minimal stiffness and mild pain in both of my legs. I am very concerned about receiving the second dose and have contacted two of my physicians.

She reported feeling dizziness, chills, nausea and tingling in both hands.  I asked her if would like us to call EMS but refused medical attention.  She knew date and location when asked.  We offered to have family member pick her up but refused.

Began on inside of left bicep in the early morning hours, but had spread to face, neck and upper torso by 10 am 2 days after injection. Went to see physician @ 3 pm same day. Blood pressure was the highest it has ever been: 192/86. Was given a steroid injection and prescribed Hydroxyzine and a steroid cream. Dr asked that I monitor BP and if it came down she would call in a prescription for prednisone.  BP did come down and began taking prednisone yesterday, 3/25/21. Rash has worsened so that the individual red spots have combined to almost completely cover my body in red. I have also experienced extreme fatigue and low grade fever, 99.5 degrees.

About 21 hours after receiving the vaccine I had chills, fever, headache, muscle ache, chest tightness, light-headedness, and fatigue.  After my fever broke Friday morning, I continue to have a horrible headache, light-headness and fatigue.

                                                She got her vaccine and had no reactions at all.  On 3/12/21 she was in her car and started having stabbing pain in the left side of her chest under the rib.  She thought it was gas pains and dismissed it, and then it started radiating towards the front and the stomach.  On 3/16/21 she went to the ER and they did a CT scan that showed that she had a blood clot on her spleen.  With that they gave her the diagnosis of idiopathic splenic infarction.  She was then sent by ambulance to another hospital to be admitted in case she was needing surgery.  She was given heparin and on that for 2 1/2 days.  They determined that 60% of her spleen is dead, blood supply cut off to it, and the other 40% is nonfunctional.  On 3/19/21 they gave her vaccines of Prevnar 13, HIB, meningococcal, meningococcal B, and a flu vaccine.  She was discharged on the 3/20/21 with Plavix.  She saw her regular doctor yesterday and he diagnosed her with functional asplenia and to continue the Plavix.   She is no longer having any symptoms after dissolving the blood clot.

                                                She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.  Then her arm started hurting to the point that she could not move it.  On Thursday, 3/25/21 she was tired but functional.  Then around 5:30 PM she started feeling really strange, odd, felt faint, got hot/cold, her heart was racing.  She laid down as she was at a friends house, they checked her BP, blood sugar and her temperature and they were all normal at that point.  Around 8:00 PM she got the nausea that would not stop and took Zofran.  Around 9:30 she started throwing up.  She then tried Phenergan and was not able to keep that down yesterday.  Then she started running a temperature, and called her doctors office and told her what to look for and to call back if things got worse.  They then got worse, called them back and then around 8:00 AM on Friday they told her to go to the hospital.  When she got to the hospital they started checking things as her fever was higher, her liver enzymes, her thyroid, her kidneys, iron just started going off the page.  Her fever then kept getting higher and higher and at one point it was documented at 104.8, and felt like her organs hurt.  11 days prior to this visit she had just had labs done and everything was normal.  So due to the new findings everything was all elevated, so they checked her for an infection, COVID which was negative, but the intensity of the symptoms got to the point they were unbearable.  She stayed in the hospital for 4 days, and the doctor came in and noted that she had a severe reaction to the vaccine.    They told her to stay longer than the 15 minutes as they had some issues today, and told her that they had to call a medic for 4 other people that passed out, which made her wonder if they had a bad batch or not, and wonders how many people from that day got sick as well.     She still has the most dreadful fatigue, headache and cannot walk from her house to the mailbox without feeling like she is going to faint and used to walking 2-4 miles daily.  Wonders how long is this going to last and that this will pass and that she will be okay, or is she going to be permanently this way.  She feels like she has a bad case of mono or something and cannot stay up and has to go to bed, and also has bouts of insomnia as well.   The body aches are extreme and is taking pain medicine daily due to these symptoms, which she did not have prior to the vaccine.   She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.

Wonders how long is this going to last and that this will pass and that she will be okay, or is she going to be permanently this way.  She feels like she has a bad case of mono or something and cannot stay up and has to go to bed, and also has bouts of insomnia as well.   The body aches are extreme and is taking pain medicine daily due to these symptoms, which she did not have prior to the vaccine.

                                                I recently retired after 37 years and now stay and provide significant weekly care for my elderly parents.  Because I am a primary caregiver for my parents, and have been throughout the months of the pandemic, I explored various potential paths to ethically and appropriately get in line for a vaccination.  When I took my mother in for her second vaccination at the Health Department in late in March I was able, while my mother was waiting, to converse with a county public health care worker about options and avenues for me to obtain the vaccine as well. She could see, clearly, that I was a caregiver for my mother, so she took down my name and number, and she called me the next day to say that I could, as a caregiver, proceed to sign up for their next clinic vaccination day that would be happening on Thursday, April 1st.   I arrived for my noon vaccination time at the Health Department before 12 on Thursday, April 1st. I proceeded through the check in line and screening questions, and arrived at vaccination site #1 at 12:05 where I was promptly given the Moderna vaccine (lot #026B21A).  Within seconds of the injection, I knew that I was having a reaction. My heart immediately began pounding, my tongue swelled and the room disintegrated into swirling flashes of color. I looked into the kind eyes of my vaccinator and remember distinctly saying to her in those first few post-injection seconds that, I was, ??sorry, but I think that I am having a reaction.?  The vaccinator then took me over to the nursing site coordinator who proceeded to check and record my vitals. I do not have that sheet with the vitals that she recorded, but I do remember that my heart rate and blood pressure measures were high. I sat as she continued to monitor me.  After 20-30 minutes, as best I can recall, my vitals were not improving, but remained elevated and even seemed to be trending higher. Also, the swelling and tingling in my tongue was worsening and seemed to be spreading to my lips and face, and down to the base of my neck.  I began to feel dizzy, like I was going to faint, so she had me lay on the floor with my legs elevated.  Additionally, it was becoming more difficult to breath because of the pressure in my neck. She had earlier and initially offered me Benadryl for the symptoms I was experiencing but I did not previously have good luck with Benadyrl the one time I took it, and also was unsure if I would have been able to swallow it. At 12:40 she thus gave me an injection of epinephrine (3mL) in my thigh and an ambulance was called. I was transported to the ER at the hospital. (Please note that the nursing site coordinator provided top-notch, high quality care through-out my entire emergency medical reaction experience, and I am very grateful and appreciative of her professional and caring response.)  In ER they monitored my blood pressure and pulse, and other aspects of my heart rhythm, as well as the swelling and tingling that continued in my tongue, lips, face and forehead.  I met with the Dr., and worked with RNs during my time there where they continued to monitor me for a number of hours. By about 4:30, when my vitals had returned to normal and stabilized for over an hour, they released me from the hospital. Since my release from the hospital, late in the afternoon on Thursday, April 1, I have noted only a few, relatively minor persisting symptoms which have included tongue, lip and face numbness and tingling. Also, I have noted, from time to time, some periods of continued heart rate elevation, though wonder if it is more of an almost ?PTSD? type of reaction than a pure physiological response, since, for example, just retelling this story right now is causing my heart rate to rise as I recall what happened.  Needless to say, this vaccination induced medical event, explained above, made for a surreal and frightening day unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Processing of it, and grappling with its implications, from concrete to existential, is seeming equally daunting, and it is here where I have a range of questions for which I am seeking assistance and perspective from the CDC:  The most concrete types of vaccination questions first: They indicated I should not try to obtain the second dose of the Moderna vaccine but that I should consult and maybe it could be given to me in a hospital setting? I welcome thoughts and feedback on how to proceed to become ?fully vaccinated.? What about another vaccine?  What about the additional boosters now being discussed for the new variants? Will I need to consider a ?cave dwelling? of some type for myself in the future since I will not have the vaccination card that is being discussed as ?the ticket to travel? in the future?  Will there be special cards for folks like me who tried but for whatever strange immunological reason was not able to take the vaccine? Increasingly complex, bigger picture questions next: Would any type of ?reach-out? to Moderna be in order? Or, do you, at the CDC, reach out to Moderna for me as a result of this VAER? Are they studying people like me?  My sense, from what little reading I have done, is that what happened to me, though severe, is rare, though definitely want the producers of the vaccine to know about my experience. Bordering on existential questions: What does this mean for me and my life going forward? Should I meet with Moderna, or some type of allergy specialist to better understand what may have happened, and what I will need to watch out for in the future? As everyone begins sharing vaccination cards and experiences, what should I say? I don?t want to scare others away from doing what is needed to save lives by sharing my experience, and don?t want to fuel the ?anti-vaxers.? What about the lingering disquiet and unease that something I sought to help and protect me seems like it might have/nearly killed me? The pandemic has already shaken and taken so much in so many of our lives.  Immunization seemed to promise to give back some of what the pandemic has taken, yet, feeling now that ?normal? is not only more distant but possibly will not be achievable for folks like me, rare though we seem to be?

                                                On February 5th, I received my second Moderna vaccine.  Monday the 8th, I was working from home and wasn?t feeling well.  I went to lay down and was not able to.  It was hard to breath.  I got up, went to another room where there was a recliner and sat in it trying to catch my breath.  It got harder to breathe.  I had my husband call 911. I went to the ER, had a CT scan of my chest and was found to have ?extensive PE?s?, ground glass and signs of pneumonitis.   I was admitted to the CICU for two days and was transferred for two days.  I was told by my orthopedic surgeon that there was a high unlikelihood of PE?s developing from my ankle fracture 3 months later.  I had home health care for approximately one month.

All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

                                                Severe stomach pain, no nausea, pain like a severe side ache; severe chest pain; headache.   Chest pain, left sided stomach pain, and headache persisted through the night.  I was able to get some relief by takin a 325 mg Aspirin and an Advil every 2-3 hours through the night.  The chest pain was pretty bad, considered going to the ER, but persisted to fight it through to the morning.  In the morning, around 6:30 am I was exhausted, but the worst of the pain was over.  I did take another Aspirin and Advil around 8:00 am and stopped after that.  I did run a low grade fever off and on of 99.7 to 100.4.   I felt better on Saturday, but by noon I was feeling generally run down and again started to run a low grade fever off an on the rest of the day.  Sunday - what a joy to feel totally well!!

At 3:04 pm, started having a strange body feeling,  felt a warm rush from my neck to my groin (like a person having a CT scan with dye), heart rate increased to 127bpm. I stood up and  said I&#39;m not feeling well.  Staff came, took pulse rate, bp (170s over 90s) walked to a cot and felt shaky legs. Around 3:11pm  they gave benadryl 50mg.  Staff called a rapid response.  I was told i had a rash. They shot me with an epipen and was taken to EMERGENCY DEPT.

According to my Watch app., the resting hear rate upon waking was 115.. I had a severe headache and generally felt awful. I took Aleve and did deep breathing to try to bring heart rate down. One hour later it was coming down, although still higher than my normal resting rate of 60.  The arm where the injection was given has been extremely sore with a rash, sore enough that it is hard to use the arm. It is now 3 days since the vaccine, my heart rate has been normal. My arm pain is reduced but still sore with a rash. I feel fatigued and foggy. The severe joint pain is less but still present.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the Moderna vaccine, I experienced an odd sensation in my stomach increased breathing, HR, lightheadedness, and dizziness. (I  experienced a similar reaction years ago but more severe, after having a breast MRI   with Gadolinium . I will consult my primary physician by email today. Per consult with a family physician, the recommendation has been advised for possible prophylactic treatment prior to obtaining the second Moderna vaccine. On rereading the composition of the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, I noted that polyethylene glycol(PEG) is a component in both the Pzifer and Moderna vaccines. I also discovered that PEG is also used with Gadolinium particles in contrast dye. Gadolinium-containing copolymeric chelates. A new potential MR contrast agent. Solvothermal synthesis and functionalization of polyethylene glycol.  It leads me to consider whether contrast dye should now be listed as one of the allergens on the vaccination registration forms, in order for persons with this allergy to report this information to their primary physicians prior to obtaining this vaccine.

Cold on and off, cold feet throughout the day. 5:30pm got home from work had shaking chills, unable to get warm for 2 hours. Finally got warm but it was a hot warmth. No fever. Took Tylenol 500mg. The warmth continued and had mild headache. Took 500mg Tylenol at bedtime 11pm. I was hot throughout the night ( no sweats ) woke at 6am feeling light headed and dizzy, body aches, still hot. Felt like I had the flu. I went into the bathroom to void. I remember thinking  - I am too sick to go to work.  My husband said I was standing holding onto the door, white in color, said &#34;i&#39;m sick&#34; he came to stand beside me to help me walk and I passed out. I had loss of consciousness. I do not know how long - he said he tried to shake me to wake me up about 30 seconds. He yelled to my son sleeping upstairs a few times, they got the phone and called 911. He said I vomited a few times and would not wake up.  I remember coming to - sitting on the floor with him talking to 911 .  I woke up enough to get up and walk to the living room couch with assist and gradually starting feeling better. The paramedics came and took my vital signs. Blood pressure (120/69 ), heart rate (84) oxygen saturations were all good. Blood glucose 116.  I declined ER transport.  I had continued light headedness, dizziness 2/6, 2/7/21.  Arm soreness gone at injection site on 2/7/21. I believe the dizziness is a mild concussion. I have a provider appointment 2/9/21.

I was using v-safe to report my symptoms but never received any reminders about the second shot, and did not get a reminder until Sunday, which of course by then, all symptoms  were gone and answered how I felt that day which was fine.  I just felt it was important to report the symptoms accurately.

                                                10 minutes after receiving vaccine I had sudden sharp pains in my right ear.  I have had extensive surgery in and around that ear due to cholesteatoma and perilymph fistula, and I have had some nerve damage to the balance nerve.  The bones of hearing have been removed and replaced with titanium artificial bones that do not work, so I am deaf in that ear.  These pains were severe, as if a number of steak knives were stabbing me at once, but the pain only lasted about a minute and subsided.  3 or 4 minutes later the pain recurred exactly as before but lasted a shorter duration and at a lower level of pain.  The ear felt congested the rest of the day and I avoided driving after getting home.  I have had no further problems, except that I went for more dental work on 2/8, and had a dizzy spell after getting anesthetic, maybe a little heart racing for just 5 minutes or so.

ED doctor told patient the only thing they could contribute this to was her covid vaccine she got the day before. She was admitted to the facility for further observation for the next 24 hours.

                                                At vaccination site 30 minutes after 2nd dose vaccination I started having numbness in my front teeth then quickly went to nose, lips, roof of mouth and throat.  Honked  horn physician came over, performed simple neurologic test and advised allergic reaction.  Had me roll down windows and sip water and to wait another 10-15 minutes. After 5 minutes throat and nose felt like they were closing. Paramedics came over and checked BP, which was elevated, and blood sugar which was very low. They continued to monitor me until symptoms started subsiding.  Asked if I wanted to go to ER, declined.  They recommended me to take 50 mg of Benadryl and to go to ER or call 911 if symptoms persisted or worsened.  Took Benadryl within 15 minutes of leaving and about 10 minutes afterwards all symptoms were gone.

                                                After 45 minutes of receiving vaccination , the knuckles in my left hand, the arm I received the shot in, began to hurt very badly.  Before I was able to get home,  7 minutes away, both hands hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t hole the steering wheel and I was having cramps in my legs.  I could hardly walk up the steps to my house because my ankle joints hurt so badly.  I went to bed  right away and slept .  My hands hurt really badly, but I knew the vaccination caused an inflammatory response so I figured just  rest.  By the end of the day Tuesday, I couldn&#39;t type and could not hold the steering wheel to drive home.  I felt out of breath, I hurt all over, my muscles ached and were cramping.  I was nauseated, very emotional.  I had a fever that spiked at over 101 degrees.  I was so chilled that I was shaking violently. I hurt in every joint, my lymph nodes were painfully swollen, my heart was racing, normal pulse for me is 68 to 72, it was 88 to 90.  Halfway up our stairs, I just stopped, couldn&#39;t make my legs work.  Day 3 I called my doctor, had a virtual appointment I knew I couldn&#39;t drive or ride 45 minutes away.  I missed 3 days of work, stayed home all weekend and was better by Monday.  It was 3 weeks before my hands quit aching.  The pain came and went in my ankles, wrist, knuckles, hips and knees.    Food still nauseates me.

                                                The patient received her second Moderna inoculation January 20, 2021 at 8 a.m.  At around 7:30 p.m., she had a sudden onset of myalgias and chills.  Within 30 minutes, she had a fever at 99.9° F.  She went to bed without taking acetaminophen or NSAIDs based on new CDC recommendations of how to treat symptoms due to the COVID-19 vaccine.  The patient hydrated and went to bed around 9 p.m.  By 11 p.m., the patient?s fever was 100.4° F., accompanied by intense myalgias, chills and a migraine headache.  She woke again at 1 a.m. with a fever of 101° F.  At 2 a.m., she woke with right-sided pleuritic chest pain (severe pain with inspiration, some pain with expiration and no pain with holding of the breath), with her fever persisting at 101° F. And tachycardia to 109.   By 7:30 a.m., her fever dropped to 100.4° F. But still tachycardia at 101.   At this time, she took ubrogepant 50 mg, with resolution of her headache within about 30 minutes.  Because she had rhinorrhea at this time, she decided to get tested for COVID-19 that day.

My fever rose to 101.3 by the following morning. It started to drop to 100.2 again by 9:30pm  on 2/4/21 and was 99.5 by 10am 2/5/21. I had  a severe headache that started as gentle pressure about 2 hours after being vaccinated and escalated to feeling like my head was in a vice  through the morning of 2/5/21. I had severe hip and knee joint pain and muscle pain all of 2/4. I was unable to walk because it hurt badly to put weight on my joints. I had a stiff neck and couldn?t turn my head more than 45% in either direction. I slept no more than 20 mins that night due to the pain.  On 2/4 I developed nose bleeds and incontinence. Those symptoms went away by 2/5.  Dizziness and lightheadedness, fatigue and headache stayed with me for 2 weeks. I am still more tired than usual.

Later that evening My are was sore and I continued to be dizzy. By nighttime I felt achy and tired. About 6 hours after the shot a fever started and I took Tylenol. By 1am I had 101.3, the rigors and a headache and dizziness which I still have 4 days later. My fever ran for over 48 hours and would not respond to any  ibuprofen or Tylenol. My joint and muscle pain was severe, my balance was off. I could barely move my arm. Today I am now nauseous. I was not this sick when I had Covid. My fever would at least relent. I?ve lost time from work and my life. I have heart palpitations and my resting heart rate has gone up. Pressure feels strange behind my eyes. My legs are sore.   I called my doctor two days after my vaccine and she minimized my symptoms.

                                                I started to feel unwell soon after receiving the vaccination.  I was tired and had a sore arm the first day.  By the second day, I began having heart arrhythmia and shortness of breath, which was confirmed at my physician&#39;s office by EKG.  I was referred to a cardiologist. Today (day three), I am still feeling less energetic and have a higher than usual amount of skipped beats. I get short of breath easily.  This afternoon I have a bad headache. My cardiologist has ordered heart ultrasound and monitoring out of an abundance of caution.  He says it could be that the inflammation from the vaccine might be causing heart irritation.

On March 19, 2021 she was on the floor laying beside of the bed and my father noticed blood looking stuff on her shirt and bed covers. She was really confused and lethargic. She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep.

                                                I had the second Moderna shot that afternoon, scheduled for 4:15pm but it was about 4:30pm when I got it.  I moved around as instructed by my doc, and after 15 minutes went back to my car.  I noticed after another several minutes that my pulse was still elevated so opted to go back in and talk to a health care professional.  Pulse was 120.  Paramedic wanted me to lie down in waiting area but I didn&#39;t want to be in such a potentially  germy environment, and the guy next to me who had fainted earlier was just getting up himself.  She walked me back to my car, where I agreed to wait, listen to a stress relief hypnosis audio and see if my pulse rate would calm down.  She came back out w/ a BP cuff and said my blood pressure was 210 over 130 (or some number over 100; I don&#39;t recall which) and she said I needed to get in an ambulance right away and go to the hospital.  I said I would make my own decisions about my body and I wanted to try a couple of other things first, promised not to leave, contacted my doctor, naturopath.  (Note: I did not have any other worrisome symptoms -- blurred vision, dizziness, etc.  My head was a little buzzy, but whether out of fear or in reaction to the shot I didn&#39;t know.  I was a little flushed).  He asked me a bunch of questions, said my body hadn&#39;t had time to mount an immune response to the vaccine and that I had likely had a histamine reaction to a preservative in the vaccine (or similar), which a couple of his other patients had experienced.  He asked if I&#39;d been drinking fluids (yes, plenty), had eaten recently (no, so he suggested I have some food; I had some nuts, a little cheese and some Cheez-Its so had that), asked if I had an antihistamine around -- I did, but I don&#39;t do well with Benadryl and didn&#39;t have Claritin, but after looking through my bag found some Allervive, an herbal product he compounds.  He said, &#34;That&#39;s perfect.&#34;  I took two of the three capsules and hung up.  Staff were checking up on me in my car every ten minutes or so, by the way, very kind and professional as I had been quite upset at the whole &#34;get in an ambulance&#34; scenario.  He thought some of my reaction was probably also stress-related, and I noticed before the shot that I was teary, not from anxiety but the kind you get when you feel relief after a long ordeal.  I didn&#39;t feel anxiety, really, until the first blood pressure measurement.  He also let me know that if the bottom number didn&#39;t drop below 100 they couldn&#39;t let me go.  After eating, drinking some more water and taking the Allervive my BP was down to 138 over 75 in just a few minutes.  I agreed to stick around and make sure it stuck.  We re-tested again about 15 minutes later, perhaps longer, and it was the same.  I had been a little flushed but that had gone away too.  I left and went for a light walk and eventually drove home without incident.  I had symptoms after the shot that could have been related to my body fighting off the allergic reaction or to the vaccine itself, but they were pretty mild (fatigue later that night; occasional heart rate elevation sometimes after eating or with very mild exertion -- not unusual for me if I&#39;m &#34;fighting off&#34; something; sore, itchy, red blotch sized between a quarter and a half dollar at vaccination site -- it is still a little tender today and appears a bit bruised; a bit sinus headache-y for three days, especially when I bent down to tie my shoes or something like that - also not that unusual as I often seem to &#34;cleanse&#34; through my sinuses when I have a bug or am fighting something off).    In hindsight, I think the symptoms I had after the first shot, which lasted about 9 hours, may have been fighting off the allergic reaction and not a reaction to the virus vaccine itself.

Some heart fluttering and some slight shortness of breath beginning a couple of days after.  More a nuisance.  No other symptoms I&#39;m aware of although every little thing I feel now I think may or may not be a symptom like slight head throb but not consistent pain.  Not sure because of vaccine.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

I went to the Urgent Care on January 7th c/o muscle pain and dark urine.  My blood pressure was elevated, 179/100..unusual for me, and my urine was neg so it was sent for culture and blood was drawn for CBC and metabollic panel and Creatine Kinase

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the vaccine my blood pressure went  up 188/98  and my heart rate  went  up. 122 I could feel  my heart beating fast. I laid down thinking it would go away. I called my Dr  at 7:00pm and he told me to take a Clonidine .1 mg and rest. In an hour my BP and heart rate were down to normal. BP 133/78 heart rate 100. I am not sure if this was from the Vaccine or the anxiety of getting it and not knowing if I was going to be allergic to it. I have had no issues since.  Should I get the 2nd dose?

                                                Thursday 1/21/21 shot; Friday 01/22/2021, 2:30am woke with extreme body ache, sweats, chills, felt like legs were being ripped from body, headache, could not move, teeth chattering, heart beat so extreme I thought my heart was going to pop out of my chest, this last adverse effect only lasts for about seconds.  I asked Siri &amp; Alexa if it was ok to take pain reliever after 2nd COVID19 vaccine and they were useless. i had temp of 102 degree. I finally called someone who had reaction and they said Tylenol or Advil. I took Advil at  6am Friday 1/22.  All adverse effects continued throughout day except extreme heart palp. I took Advil at 11am  &amp; 3pm, I took Tylenol at 7pm  and aspirin at 11:30pm &amp; On Saturday at 3:30 am,.  Advil and Tylenol helped slightly, aspirin worked best or I was just exhausted.  I woke up on Saturday at 8:30am  and all was ok, except just tired a and my lower back is in pain still with numbness down leg. Probably  from laying around.

                                                About 9PM after the receiving the vaccine I started had riggers which lasted for about an hour. I couldn&#39;t reach for my phone or call for help. I either passed out or fell asleep. Around 1AM I woke up and checked my temperature 102.7.  Some point after I took some Tylenol but don&#39;t remember when. I finally had to call for help from my family in the morning because I was not able to pee or drink. Tuesday was my fever was still 102.7 with taking Tylenol and Advil it would just go back up.  Tuesday I had Riggers again about 5:30 it only lasted 3-5 minutes. Wednesday my fever went down to 101.4-101.5. Have had difficulty swallowing when the fever is high, did not feel as if I had a allergic reaction or that my throat was sore it was just hard to swallow.  I have a weird bruise on my arm I have clue where I got it. I didn&#39;t urinate for 9 hours. Headache. Pulse OX was at 93-94 for Monday and Tuesday but then it came it up 95-98 yesterday.  As of today I still pretty weak no fever when I woke up.

                                                Awoke at 11pm from a sound sleep feeling unusual but unable to identify anything specific. Checked my O2 saturation with my pulse ox and was 76% with a heart rate of 122.  Used my rescue albuterol inhaler which I haven&#39;t used since October (Fall and Spring are my typical times when I need albuterol inhaler and then not regular use.) Waited 15 mins with no change.  Took a nebulizer treatment of albuterol.  After 30 minutes was getting O2 saturations in the 80&#39;s. With deep breaths after an hour got a reading of 96% but wasn&#39;t consistently staying in the 90&#39;s.  Fell back asleep around midnight and awoke feeling ok.  I did not feel SOB when my saturation was at 76%, but my pulse was elevated to help compensate.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a 62-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced an anaphylactic reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as reported, included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome.  On 24 Jan 2021, about 15 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 24 Jan 2021, 30 minutes prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient took prednisone (dose unknown), per instructions from her doctor due to her history of anaphylactic reactions. She did notify the vaccinators of her history and there was an ambulance present. About 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient started coughing, had heavy chest pain, trouble breathing, and felt like her throat was constricting more than usual. No rash developed. She approached the ambulance and asked if she could take diphenhydramine. She took one dose, followed by 3 other doses, and felt a bit better. Consent given for Safety to follow up with patient.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of event, anaphylactic reaction was resolving at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62 year old female patient with medical history of included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome. She experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction that needed treatment diphenhydramine. The event occurred approximately 15 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration even thought the patient took prednisone prior to receiving the vaccine. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My right arm was painful at the injection site for 3 days after the vaccination.  Then on Wednesday, February 3, 2021 about 3:45pm I experienced shortness of breath and some chest discomfort.  At approximately 6:00pm, I felt a strong pulsating at my left temple which continued through the night.  I took my blood pressure and it was 150/90 and pulse was 103 which is the highest reading I have ever had because I am on blood pressure medication.  I took 2 aspirin, my Proventil Inhaler, and another Losartan 50 mg even though I had already taken my daily dose in the morning.  I rested and continued to monitor my vitals.  At about 11:30pm, I took my blood pressure and it was 160/110 and pulse was 109.  I then took 2 more aspirin and my Clonazapem and fell asleep.  In the morning on February 4, 2021, I tried to get in to see my doctor, but she advised to go to the emergency room.  I went to an Urgent Care facility and the checked me and did an EKG and that was normal.  But they also advised me to go to the emergency room.  So I did go and they did another EKG, chest x-ray, and several blood tests.  They came back normal but they wanted me to stay overnight for observation.  On February 5, 2021 they did an echocardiogram and a stress test, which were normal.  I was released from the hospital that afternoon.  I have a follow up appointment with my Primary Care Physician on February 12, 2021.  My blood pressure and pulse continue to be a little higher than normal.  At this point, the pulsating, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort have improved.  On Saturday, February 6, 2021, I noticed felt itchiness, redness and swelling at the injection site on my right arm.  It is still itchy, red and swollen as of February 8, 2021.  I am putting hydrocortisone cream on it.

                                                initial symptoms started at ~ 8-12 hr post inj on FRI:  fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain (generalized), back pain from sacrum to occiput, through cranium to behind eyes, nausea, loose stools, exhaustion, arm swelling (6&#34; diameter) with bandaid indented becoming hard (feeling a little like cellulitis).  routinely measure pO2 and body temp--both spiked; resp rate went from normal pattern of 10-12 to 25; night time HR went from low 60&#39;s to the 100&#39;s; pO2 went from 96-98 to 89-91 (Innovo PulseOx)Treated with sleep (slept from 8PM night of shot until 48 hours after the shot), fluids, hot water bottles, arnica (I can&#39;t take NSAIDS), vit C, zinc megadoses;  by ~36 hours post injection I started wheezing and coughing deeply but non productive, both nasal passages were/are open, feels as though phlegm is stuck at bronchi.  By 48 hours, I was feeling better except chest, ribs, head, and neck and was experiencing 1-3&#34; episodes of spasmodic coughing, wheezing, SOB; Occurred every 20-30 minutes and leaving me physically exhausted.  Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

Her injection site bled and required multiple bandaids and pressure held on area. During this, she felt like she was going to pass out. We provided a cold compress and water. I checked her blood pressure and she reported it being lower than normal (120/82). I re-checked in 5 minutes and it continued to drop to 105/65. I asked the patient if she would like us to call for additional medical attention to be evaluated and she said &#39;yes&#39;. We called 911 and EMS arrived on the scene to further evaluate. Prior to EMS arrival, the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 130/90. The patient&#39;s blood pressure returned to normal about 30 minutes after injection and she did not go to the hospital.

After waking, I still had a headache and body aches, but felt somewhat better.  by 1:00 pm, became very achy in my joints again and tired. I  had 2 times during that evening lasting about 5 to 10 minutes each  of difficulty breathing and a slight tightness in my chest.  This passed and I did sleep better the night of 3/5/21.

                                                My normal heart rate is around 72 beats per minute. I received the vaccine at 12:30pm on Monday 03/08/2021. I did not seem to have any reactions to the injection. Two hours later, I happened to have an annual check up with my cardiologist. At that time, my vitals were taken and my heart rate was 113 bpm. I told the doctor that I just had the vaccine. He said that if it did not go down by that night or the next day, to get it checked. On Tuesday, my pulse had went down to the mid 80&#39;s/low 90&#39;s, so I thought it was improving. When I woke up today, Wednesday, 03/10/21, my pulse had gone up to 103-104 and my blood pressure was somewhat elevated, so I attempted to get an appt to see my primary care doctor, but she was out so I saw her associate, Dr . At this visit, my pulse was 98-99. She did not think that it was an allergic reaction, but that it was a side effect of the vaccine. She had no idea how long it might last, and just told me to monitor it and if it became increasingly elevated to seek help.

                                                I was really nervous about getting the vaccine.  I received the shot at 3:40pm and waited at the site for 15 minutes,  and I was feeling good, so I went home.  I had dinner around 7:00pm.  It was around 8:30pm when  I was standing at the kitchen sink  doing the dishes and I felt a wave wash over me and the rapid heart beat started.  I immediately took Metoprolol since I usually take it around 9:00pm, and my heart rate went down some what. My heart beat is usually around 72.  I didn&#39;t have my fit bit on, but I put it on after I took the medication and it was around 124, but I know it was much higher on the onset.  It only lasted about 1 or 2 minutes.  My heart beat was jumping around after that, I was scared, nervous, so I took a Xanax around 11:00pm.  I slept through the night and had a normal heart beat in the morning.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

                                                The day after I received the first dose of my vaccine, I felt numb on my tongue, around my mouth, and hands. In addition, I also experienced a low fever. Then on the third and fourth day, I stated to feel numb on my arms, thighs, fingertips and the bottom of my feet.  I also started to feel chest pain, back pain, and experience migraines. I&#39;ve felt very tired throughout this time, had a dry mouth. The tops of my feet and hands were slightly swollen and my veins were much more prominent as well. The palm of my hands are always very warm and have a visibly pink color. During this time frame, I&#39;ve seen also seen my GP twice. As of today, overall, all of these symptoms have lessened in severity. Although the feeling of numbness has also lessened in severity as well, the slight feeling of numbness is still present as of today-especially on my tongue (23 days after my first dose of the vaccine).

Observation of swelling then 2 Benadryl were given.  BP monitored. After about 15 minutes or longer swallowing slowed down  some.   BP did start coming down.  A friend came to get me and I took 2 more Benadryl  about 4 hours later due to swallowing issues again.  After about 6 hours after that took more Benadryl and the the next 2 days just as needed about every 8 to 10 hours   Started  chills with highest temperature was  99.4.  K Legs felt heavy the morning after the vaccine and  I felt very tired with some short bursts of Nausea

She stated that she was dizzy but that she does suffer from vertigo already. She said these symptoms lasted about a week. On the 1/14/21 she was tachycardic, dizzy, weak and she had a raised red rash distal to the site of injection. She went to urgent care and was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescribed an antibiotic. On 1/17/21 she went back to urgent care since the rash had migrated and appeared patchier than cellulitis. Her doctor said that he did not believe it to be cellulitis at this time and prescribed her a steroid cream.

Then felt &#34;odd&#34;, BP was 92/47. drank 8 ounces fluid, BP slightly increased then dropped again. Felt very faint chest pain, about 8-9 deep &amp; sharp, but resolved quickly. Returned to work. Next day at 32 hours exactly, arm injection site felt slightly achy , return of off feeling. Headaches off and on.  On day 3 fatigue began, and intense injection site sharp pains which woke me at night although not apparent in day.   Over next several days, intense site pain continued to wake me in middle of night, very painful.  On day 7, began to feel better, but then woke that night with extremely intense pain at site. Today is day 8, I found 2 red swollen, thickened and hard, pear shaped areas 4cm x 10cm; smaller one at site and a second larger area below that, area red and warm to touch indicating a cellulitis was developing.  Call to primary doctor and CDC, instructed to complete this. Now concerned about whether to obtain vaccine #2.

                                                Moderna vaccine #2 was given on Friday, January 29 at 1 PM.  She had no side effects that day.  On Saturday she felt mildly achy and had a headache and stayed in bed.  Sunday her heart was flip-flopping with palpitations.  She noticed new dyspnea on exertion with just a short distance as well as feeling panicky.  On Monday she went to work and continued to have the same symptoms.  Two colleagues were vaccinated at the same time she was also reported the same symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea and new onset anxiety.  Yesterday the symptoms were even worse, &#34;really bad&#39;.  Her vital signs were checked at work and were all normal.    Today she is not feeling as bad but still feels very anxious.  She woke up with a headache again.  She is taking ibuprofen for the HA which helps.

At about 10pm when I went to bed, I had issues falling asleep because my heart felt like it was pounding through my chest.   That pounding came off and on during the next day.  I woke up twice and my feet were ice cold and my body was very hot.  The second time I woke I thought I would take some tylenol and was extremely dizzy walking to the bathroom.  I was so weak I couldn&#39;t open the bottle.  I slept nine hours, very unusual.  I felt very under the weather all day until around 5pm.  I woke up the next morning feeling pretty normal.  The arm pain was completely gone by the 18th.

Approx. 8 days after injection, noticed red patch (approx. 3&#34;x4&#34;) below injection site.  This  rectangle had surprisingly straight edges and occasionally itched slightly.  Six days later the rectangle is approximately the same size, but has lost its very straight edges, and has paled in color.   Perhaps 10 days after the injection, some swelling was noticed in the left armpit and an intermittent discomfort like a dull pencil poking a particular spot in the armpit was experienced. The armpit swelling/discomfort lasted about 3 days.

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

                                                4 days after getting the vaccine feeling extremely tired in the afternoon and like I was zoning out, and have had that feeling when my blood pressure has spiked before, but this was even worse--could barely keep my eyes open and felt weird, so measured my BP, and it initially read 190/151 which could not be right, but I know it was high.  I took it again a little while after, and it was down to 140/90, but usually is not that high when I&#39;ve taken my full medication in the morning, which I did.  I then took my Spironoloactone.  BP was high for about an hour and then came down.  Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the vaccine, but I haven&#39;t had it spike in quite a while, especially if I have taken my full amount of Losartan (which is 50mg), and while it may not have been 190, I know it was higher than it&#39;s ever spiked because I felt worse, and I can always feel when my BP goes up.  (There are days when my BP is too low to take the full pill, so I take half, but this day, I had taken the full pill.)  So, as I said, not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine or not, but was the worst I felt during a BP spike and lasted longer than ever did as well, but then came down without having to take any more medication except the Spironolactone, but it had come down a bit before that kicked in.

                                                Within 7 min. Of vaccine i began to feel like i was on a cold IV drip; the sensation started at vaccine site and traveled down my arm into my body.  I then went to pharmacy desk and said i thought i was having a reaction and went to the bathroom to see if i was red in the face.  Yes, my face and body were red splotchy which is my indicator of having an allergic reaction.   I also noticed that my chest was feeling tight like my bra was on too tight.  The pharmacist gave me a Benadryl and i waited 15 more minutes.    The Benadryl relieved most of the symptoms after an hour but my chest was tight the remainder of the day and fine the next day.

                                                Had an immediate headache.  Five to ten minutes later left hand was numb and tingle.  Blood pressure went up to 147/85 and pulse was 53. I was observed by an EMT.  Last vitals were taken at 11:00.  135/82 and pulse was 53.  I am not on any blood pressure meds.  I called my dr. and when I was seen in December of 2020, my pressure was 116/68 and my pulse was 74.  I refused to go to the hospital.  on the day of the vaccine but I did go to my drs. the same day at 4:30 and my pressure was 122/80 and pulse was 54.  I did not go to work the next day.  I felt heaviness in my chest and my arm was sore.  I was also tired.  I feel better today, but still do not feel myself.  My dr. recommended I get my second shot at the hospital if I possible.

At first, once, then progressed to vomiting every 30 minutes, fever, soreness, and extreme headache. I went to ER  and finally saw an Er doctor-he gave me fluids and zofran-then sent me home?about 6 hours later, the same symptoms and went to a different ER because I would not have to wait 3 hours to see dr. They gave me fluids, phengran, and toradol w/tylenol. He kept me long enough to make sure it had passed. The intense headache continued thru the 13 but finally better today. It was horrible.

                                                I was exposed to Covid-19 in September, but my tests were negative. I had the same chest pain as when I thought I had Covid-19 on the third morning after vaccination. Started in the back with trouble breathing. I was lethargic and tired but I had a lot of trouble breathing for a week.  I also took a course of Zithromax and the symptoms resolved after eight days but the tiredness persisted. I gave blood on the day of vaccination after the shot and it may have some effect.

Noticed eyesight blurred. Pharmacist told me my chest &amp; face were bright red. I felt slightly nauseous &amp; my mouth tasted like penny&#39;s. Pharmacist administered antihistamine. By this time I had a bad headache &amp; feeling of pressure in chest &amp; head. I was made to sit in lobby &amp; wait 30 min. I continued feeling strangely unwell for 8 days. My b.p. went up &amp; I felt anxious &amp; exhausted. Arm hurt. No temp. On day 3 ( I believe..or day 4) arm became even more painful &amp; A round rash appeared. My chest &amp; neck were also red again . I took pictures of my arm, chest &amp; neck.

                                                Wednesday night I felt tired and cold. Woke up Thursday morning and couldn&#39;t lift up my head. Migraine was in all of top teeth, ears, behind eyes, all over head. Pain was so extreme I fainted in bed. Came to and pain was a bit better but quickly came back full force. Woke up at 1am Friday morning drenched from sweat through to the mattress but migraine was better. Ran fever up to 102 and down and up all day Friday. Saturday fever was only 100 but came back after each sweat. Sunday I had almost no fever and just a regular head ache. Monday exhausted but okay.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.     On 03 Mar 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Mar 2021, the patient experienced severe diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort. At 4 AM she had lost consciousness and fell after urinating and hit her head on the curb of the shower. Her husband found her and when he saw her, she was cold, clammy and very sweaty. Her husband reported that the patient had low blood pressure that caused syncope and caused her to fall. The patient was in a semi-delirious state and was confused, tremulous. The cramps were intermittent for 1-2 hours. The patient was in a borderline shock or in shock as she was very dizzy when she stood up. The events were resolved after four hours. On the next day her temperature was at 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, loss of consciousness, fall, cold sweats, hyperhidrosis, hypotension, syncope, confusional state, tremors, muscle spasms, shock and dizziness were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

                                                Rapid Heartbeat started about 1-1/2 hours after the shot.  Heartbeat was rapid for several hours and then intermittently for ~30 Hours.  My face was flushed &amp; hot.  I started trying to look up Moderna side effects but could not find anything about rapid heartbeat until after I found the Moderna fact sheet online.  I did not go to the hospital as I had no chest pains or shortness of breath.  But I did take a baby aspirin 3 times over the course of the 30 hour period.  I was also very fatigued during this time.  The rapid heartbeat has subsided by now  but I don&#39;t know if i should still get the 2nd shot which is scheduled for April 16.

I was taken to a room and had vitals and was hypertensive and tachycardic with a worsening headache, I was given 50 mg Benadryl and put ice on my face and neck for about 20 minutes as I felt I was burning up. I remained at the clinic for an hour for monitoring. I never had difficulty breathing , and it was mostly resolved in about 45 minutes except for the mild headache and my face was still red and my eyes were swollen for at least an hour.

I spoke to the nurse who hooked me up to bp machine. O2 sat was fine at 98. BP was 158/110, pulse rate was 157. Normal values for me are bp 120/70, pulse 80. BP started to go down and several minutes later another flush happened and bp and pulse rate went back up. Dropped again then third flush with increased bp and pulse happened. After this vitals went back to normal and didn&#39;t happen again. I subsequently developed a pounding headache which lasted until the next morning. Arm was sore as expected. BP that night was normal and the next morning normal. No further adverse effects noted other than fatigue.

Light adverse side effects right after the vaccine was administered. Remained under supervision for 45 minutes longer instead of 15 min. Within 5 mins, heat rose up to my head causing dizziness &amp; head spin. Then loss of smell lasting for 10 min or a bit longer, then tongue tied hard / swollen for 3 hrs and lasting mildly 1 day after. Severe dehydration. Did not monitor heart beat due to severe fatigue. Took blood pressure rising and falling like roller coaster 2x. I stop and learned to relax and sleep throughout the day to calm the nervous system and the slight fever. Other normal aching pains as pre-described side effects. No nausea, vomiting, no rash as of 1 day after and no difficult breathing. Occasional and short loss of smell carried after 1st day.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At about 8 pm the day following my vaccination; I started to experience sharp needle-like pain at the site of injection (left arm).  It was brief.  Immediately following that pain, the fingers on my left hand went numb and I couldn&#39;t feel them -- particularly my pinky and ring fingers.  I could move my fingers but they were numb.  I did not have a fever. This lasted about 2 hours.  I iced the site of injection, kept my hand above my shoulder and massaged my fingers for the duration (about 2 hours).  When this first occurred my heart was racing -- but that might have been because it scared me.  I feel fine today.

                                                The day after my first shot, my blood sugars went crazy.  Elevated up over 200-275 most of the day.  Tried to adjust with more insulin, and could not get them to decrease and stay in range.  My A1cs are usually between 6.6 and 6.8 and I stay in my target range 85-90% of the time.  It has now been two weeks since my shot, and the numbers are still elevated.  Is this a normal reaction to the vaccine, and will my second shot be worse?  How long can I expect this to last?  Have consulted with my diabetes educator at my endocrinologist&#39;s office...can&#39;t seem to find  solution.  She is thinking that the vaccine creates inflammation which would elevate the sugars, but after two weeks, it should be improving.  Am worried about 2nd shot.

                                                On Saturday on the 16th I started itching all over my body and my head, dry mouth and my ears were itching as well. On Sunday I noticed the itching  increased after taking my  levothyroxine. The 18th I noticed the same pattern of itching increasing after taking the levothyroxine the dry mouth as continued. Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

Took tylenol before getting vaccine, and the next day around 4 in the morning started having malaise, pain, fever, chills. (fever around 102), and went 104 around midafternoon, and 106 around 10. Chills, pain, weakness. Next day I was feeling well. I started noticing small dots on knee and shoulder. And then I started noticing bruising on my hands and legs. Felt fine on Sunday. I started noticing the bruises were becoming more pronounced. On Monday when I woke up the bruises were worse, and I went to the ER. The doctor checked CBC and platelets count was low around 28 thousand and was admitted into the hospital and they treated me with solumedrol 100 mg. Platelets count went back up.

                                                On 12/29/2021 as soon as I woke up I could not get out of bed, I had a fever of 101 or higher, a terrible headache, my nose bleed, a dry non productive cough, also my blood pressure was very high it was around the 170s &amp; 180s at that time. The next morning 12/30/2021 I still had a headache but not as bad as the 29th, no fevers on the 30th. I still had nose bleed but very little. The cough still continued &amp; my high blood pressure still continued the lowest it got 144 over79. I experienced moments of weakness &amp; that&#39;s when my blood pressure would shoot up.  I called my doctor on the 12/30/2021 I called my doctor and he started me on medications &amp; he told me to keep track of my blood pressure. On 12/31/2021 everything began to diminish except the blood pressure that one continued. The high blood pressure continued all the way towards the end of January.  On 01/28/2021 I ended up in the emergency room also because of my blood pressure &amp; they did some test there.

That went on for days. I called my doctor and she put me on Metrozal to help with heart rate and BP and that brought that back down again. I&#39;m taking this every day now in addition to my other blood pressure medicine. It has helped.  I had headaches; I had terrible dreams and couldn&#39;t sleep. My eyes turned all dark - like when you need to drink water (underneath eyes). Had a terrible thirst. I drink water constantly.  I had bruising on various parts of my body - legs; arms etc. It&#39;s calmed down with all these symptoms within a couple of weeks.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA adverse event.   Approximately 7 hours after the 1st COVID vaccination on 2/22/2021, patient developed symptoms of fatigue, aches, chills &amp; fever. Her symptoms worsened into 2/23/21 with increasing shortness of breath. On arrival in the emergency center on 2/23/21,  she was hypoxic with  SpO2 81% on room air.  Oxygen supplement via nasal cannula was given which improved her oxygenation. Covid 19 test negative. Chest Xray shows pulmonary edema and CTA chest shows no PE.  She was admitted to the hospital and provided supportive care.   Pulmonary Edema and inflammatory process is likely associated with the vaccine. Patient appeared to be improving, however, on 2/26/21, she was working with Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy and had a pulse ox reading of 75% on room air. She was on 10 Liters of oxygen via nasal cannula by the time she make it back to bed and her pulse ox was 89%. Neurology exam shortly afterward the above event demonstrated an NIHSS of 21.  Patient became non-verbal and stat imaging revealed an acute hemorrhage in the left occipatal lobe likely representing a SAH.  Patient then transferred to another hospital that could provide neurosurgical intervention.

It made me dizzy. I also experienced extreme fatigue and so much that it was hard to walk. Really hard to just get out of the bed. Like my legs did not want to move. I had to literally mover them from the bed. Cough. My doctor said after I had covid in June 2020 that my lungs were damaged and now they just work on a 61% capacity. I also felt like my lungs were burning. When I am able to have a productive cough and get rid of some phlegm, then I feel better, I can really breathe and feel like clean air in my lungs. But lots of times I just cough and nothing comes out and then it gives me a sensation that my chest is tight. Still, every morning I cough, just like this morning and my chest feel tight.

                                                Awaken around 2:00 am with mild asthma symptoms wheezing and tight chest. Haven&#39;t been waken before at night and thought it was unusual.  Around 5:00pm that same day I noticed itchiness near the injection site and around the neck.  Around 6:00pm I noticed a muscle twitch around the elbow on the right arm.  By 7:00 pm my back, chest, and both arms were extremely itching.  I took a generic Benadryl and a puff of my Proventil inhaler.  This helped a little but I took another Benadryl an hour later.  I was able to sleep several hours later. Next morning sill have itchiness but less and asthma symptoms seem better.

Stayed in bed and slept a lot. 1 dose of Nyquil Cough to sleep for 2 nights. Felt progressively better and all symptoms just lifted away right at 72 hour mark after shot! I did not see the cough and all the flu like symptoms listed as side effects. So our family started a chat and a cousin&#39;s husband - big strapping police captain had the exact same side effects as me.

The pain lasted all night and in the morning I could barely get out of bed.  I was able to slide out of bed with considerable pain.  Once up I struggled to bend at all. My husband had to put my socks and shoes on.  I had to take him to get a medical procedure that morning and I could barely get in the car.  I took an Alieve before we left because   sitting down was excruciating.  I had everything I could do to get up and down from chairs while waiting.  When we got back about 10:30 I took another Alieve.  It was starting to calm down.  I took another Alieve later in the evening and today it still hurts but not as bad.  Now it includes my right Knee.   I have never had these pains before.   I am concerned about my second shot.

Symptoms with stomach cramping lasted into 2/11, all day. By 9PM, I had a severe HA, chills, spent most day in bed. My heart was pounding. Couldn&#39;t lay down, HA was throbbing. Temp was 101.5. I contacted my PCM. Advised to rotate between Tylenol and Motrin. The fever did break overnight.  2/12 I was still feeling fatigue, HA. No fever, no chills. Still having vertigo with chest tightness. That had set in on the 2/11. Started my albuterol on 2/11 and lasted till 2/16 with a slight cough.  2/16 Dr was able to see me. She could feel the inflammation in my chest. *Exacerbated the problem because on 2/13 I felt chest tightness and thought it was the asthma, exercises made my symptoms worsen. The acid reflux gave me the sense I was having tight chestness due to the asthma but it was actually due to me exercising on 2/13 which worsened by the 2/15-2/16. I had still had the chest pain, HA Prescribed Advil.

I had had a blood clot and anemia six months prior to vaccine. I had two episodes of diarrhea. I had the second dose of vaccine and had no symptoms.

                                                To give context to the adverse event, in early November 2020 I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy of unknown origin on the left side of my face. I was tested for COVID-19 and it came back negative. It resolved itself in about a month. About 8 hours after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine on 3/9/21 (about 6:30 p.m., I started to feel a slight headache. Because I had just had the vaccine, I was trying to avoid taking any pain medication, so I did not take anything for it. The headache got worse throughout the evening, and by 10 p.m. I would describe it as a moderate headache. It was primarily concentrated on the left side of my head towards the front, on my forehead and above the eyebrow. I went to bed without taking any pain medication. About 3 hours later, at about 1 p.m., I woke up, and the headache was much more intense. It felt like all the nerves around the left side of my face, including the nerve along my jaw line leading to the 7th cranial nerve that causes Bell&#39;s Palsy, were throbbing. I grew concerned about getting Bell&#39;s Palsy again, so at that time I took one ibuprofen Advil. After taking it, the headache subsided, although I continued to have a dull headache throughout the night and the next day. Patient received the vaccine Monday March 1st around 2:30pm. Patient began to feel arm soreness around 5pm, woke up at 3am the following morning with a severe headache and spent the next day resting. Wednesday morning March 3rd, the patient reported extreme fatigue, dizziness and feeling &#34;woozy&#34;. As she was walking around the store, around 8:30am, patient had to request help as she almost fainted. Patient went home quickly after, reported dizziness until 3pm. Patient&#39;s friend who is a nurse came to her home to check her vitals, confirmed they were normal and encouraged fluids/rest. After resting further Wednesday/Thursday, patient returned to work Friday morning and has been fine since. Patient did not take any medications prior/during/after incident.

                                                She had sudden onset of fatigue, stiffness, joint pains in her shoulders and hips bilaterally, and depression. The pain was worst in the mornings and across the shoulder girdle. These were the most severe symptoms she had ever had and they reduced her to about 50% of her usual capacity. These symptoms started much more suddenly than past joint aches and were persistent without any improvement for two weeks, leading her to seek care on 3/2/2021. This provider checked labs and referred her to specialist. I saw her on 3/17/2021, ordered a few more labs, and prescribed prednisone on 3/22/2021 for suspected polymyalgia rheumatica. She is starting to have less pain, fatigue, and depression as of 3/26/2021.

                                                Cranial and spinal SAH hematoma  at roughly same time as heart attack.  Cause of hematoma was unknown.  Potentially a side effect of elliquis; but her cardiologist does not believe ellipsis was the cause.  Heart attack at similar time due to blood clot and blocked artery and possibly reaction of body  to hematoma.   We do not have any hard data that either are related to the vaccine; but are reporting  them under the advice of a doctor to give information for science.

                                                Injection was at 12:00 Pm on 12/29/2020. At 12:20 PM i started to feel faint, slightly nauseous . I layed down on my office floor, , my heart rate went up to 140 BPM and BP was around 140/76. My MA checked it . One of my physician colleague&#39;s that was nearby checked on me as well as the nurse that gave me the injections. it took about 30-40 minutes for the symptoms to subside. I was sent to our Urgent care dept in the same clinic by wheelchair at around 12:30-12:40 pm. I was evaluated and my symptoms subsided in 30-40 minutes. I was out of Urgent care at 1:25 pm, able to walk upstairs back to my office and felt okay and was seeing patients again at 1:30 PM.  This reaction was similar to getting a shot of Novocaine w/ epinephrine for a dental procedure I received a few years ago, so if I were to sum it up it was like getting a shot of epinephrine. it was not a vasovagal reaction as my BP was high. I have felt fine since. I plan to get the second vaccine. Any suggestions to avoid these symptoms w/ the second one would be appreciated.

                                                Moderna: one giant hive on my left shoulder; swelling, redness (approximately 2&#34;x3&#34;); extremely sore; horrible horrible itching; the center of the red spot was hard and hot.  The redness went down my arm to my inner elbow down my forearm to my wrist. The redness going down my arm was not as bad after I took the Allegra.  It was all extremely painful. I had to go see Dr. because the itching was so bad. Dr. prescribed medicine for the swelling/itching.  At times my throat was sore and my face was flushed and I had a tightness in my chest. But that did not last long.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

                                                My arm is still red and hot and it&#39;s beginning to itch. Immediately after the vaccine my face got hot and bright red as it does when I have an allergic reaction.  My heart rate raced and chest felt weird, but immediately I had tingling in my left arm from the vaccine. I was winded when speaking for about 24 hours. When I got home, I began taking Benedryl. My arm still has a hard knot and is still red and hot. I&#39;m trying to find out what to do about the red, fever at injection site and the redness. It&#39;s starting to itch. This has been 10 days ago that I had the vaccine. I&#39;m not an antivaxxer and look forward to my second vaccine on February 8, but I&#39;m a little apprehensive.

I recovered quickly.  Once home I monitored my blood pressure and it was low.  The lowest reading was 88/70.  I laid down and within a couple hours my pressure was more normal. I did not feel faint at that time.  I have severe anxiety and am not sure if that contributed to this episode.  Additionally, my blood pressure is on the low side of normal.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Received first COVID vaccination Fri., Jan. 22 at 1:56pm. I was not anxious about the shot at all and was playing solitaire on my cell phone when  around 2:15pm it was like a switch turned on and I felt my heart racing and pressure on my chest. I notified the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was 200/90, HR 98, Oxy 100%. At 2:25pm it was 140/80, HR 96, Oxy 96%. And at 2:39pm it was 132/88 and the nurse felt it was OK to return home. My chest felt better at home around 4:15pm that same day.  I definitely had no anxiousness about taking the COVID vaccine, and was not worried about a reaction at all. Having that high of a blood pressure was a surprise because my blood pressure is usually around 117/74, and I don&#39;t get anxious about allergy shots or vaccinations. I have been taking allergy shots for over 15 years every month. I had taken my allergy shots in both arms 2 days prior to the COVID vaccination that was ok&#39;d by my clinic.

                                                40 minutes after receiving vaccine my  throat constricted, chest tightened, had difficulty swallowing and catching my breathe. Returned to Convention Center, site of vaccination. Paramedics took vitals, determined I was having a &#34;minor&#34; allergic reaction and administered Benadryl. Within 20 minutes of receiving Benadryl, I was able to breathe and swallow without difficulty. No further complications afterwards.

I knew my mouth was hanging open and couldn&#39;t shut it. My husband took my blood pressure,  it was 61/50.  After a few minutes I was coming to, blood pressure began to come back up. My husband had called 911 when my blood pressure dropped so low.  By the time they arrived it was back up to normal.   I have never had any problems with blood pressure,  low or high. Or with dizziness,  fainting etc. I am very sure it was from the vaccine

                                                Vaccinated at 1:20 PM on 1/26/2021. Approximately 15 min later I was in the waiting area, the nurse had been pre-notified to watch me for allergic reaction . In 15 minutes my symptoms were fast heart rate, lips burning, dark red facial flushing, ears flushing, and anterior neck flush, body tremors, a rapid response team notified to evaluate me. I was administered a 25 mg  Benadryl tablet per mouth.  I felt stabilized and chose to go to the ER within the building for further evaluation.  Remaining stabilized, had a 4 hour wait until I was seen by emergency staff. My treatment was Solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and Benadryl 25 mg po. I was placed on a heart monitor and a pulse oximeter to check my oxygen levels the entire time I was in the ER. 4 hours prior to being seen by the ER doctors I had a CBC, a BMP blood work, and an EKG. After medications were administered I was observed approximately 1.5-2 hours. I was discharged with a 5 day medicine regimen to follow. Prednisone 40 mg per day; Pepcid 40 mg per day; Benadryl 25 mg every 6 hours. On 1/27 I chose to take the Benadryl 25 mg only because I had received the Pepcid and Prednisone the previous night late. On the 28th I took the medicine as prescribed but only took Benadryl every 12 hours. I felt Benadryl 4 times a day would not be handled well with my body. On 1/30 I was able to take the Pepcid and Prednisone but had to discontinue the Benadryl due to waking up with a spinning sensation upon opening eyes and a loss of equilibrium upon walking. I completed my medicine regimen on 2/1. Today 2/2 I woke up with symptoms of watery eyes, flushed face, mild facial itching, after drinking one cup of full caffeine coffee developed an increased heart rate and nervousness, was medicated with Benadryl 25 mg po at 10:00 AM along with my blood pressure medicine and potassium. Also at that time my blood pressure was 150/80. Three hours later my blood pressure had come down to 130s/60s but felt extreme weakness and felt the need to lay down and rest with legs elevated.  I continue with my day with increased heart rate with activity, so I have remained inactive for the rest of the day.   Also on 6:00 AM on 1/27 I was awakened with a heart rate In the 160s, I called 911, paramedics came 5 minutes later. On arrival my heart rate had instantly went down to the  112-120 range. The paramedics explained they have been treating COVID patients and have seen this a lot, we discussed going to the hospital but I felt I was stabilized and didn&#39;t need further treatment.   Also upon discharge from ER visit they had me get 2 epi-pens and I now have 2 epi-pens available at home.

Patient&#39;s husband enrolled her to V-Safe to report all the adverse effects she experienced. On Sunday 1/24/2021, her temperature was 98.3F. She still had nausea and no appetite.  She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

                                                The morning after receiving Covid-19 vaccination I fainted.  I was sitting, working on an i-pad and got up to go to another room. I walked through the house to another room. I noticed my arms and legs felt kind of rubbery and that I didn&#39;t seem to have control of them. I fell to the bed and lost consciousness for 5-10 seconds. This was all observed by my spouse. I  recovered quickly. The remainder of the day I had a slight headache and felt slightly nauseous. I took acetaminophen before going to bed and woke up the following morning with no complaints .

                                                Patient received her COVID-19 Moderna vaccine this afternoon.  She then started &#34;feeling strange&#34; a few minutes later, requesting fresh air. She was monitored outside for 30 minutes. Her O2sat remained &gt;96%ile the entire time. Her HR remained in 60s-70s. Her initial blood pressure was elevated at 210s/140s and improved to 140s/110s with calming relaxation techniques.  She did have brief jerking episodes of her lower extremities intermittently. They were suppressible. She remained conscious the entire time and maintained good eye contact.  At minute ~20 post-vaccination, she endorsed not remembering why she was there, requesting to stand up. She stood up with support and then sat back down. Repeat BP was elevated to SBP 200s.  Decision was made to continue observation in Urgent Care as her blood pressure was still elevated and she still appeared anxious. She was speaking in full sentences and was drinking water without assistance.  She was placed into wheelchair and brought to Urgent Care. However, during UC triage, she  reportedly informed nursing that she didn&#39;t want to be in the enclosed observation room in UC, that she wanted to go home. Her partner wheeled her outside to the patio. When nursing went to go find her, the patient had eloped.

The next day,  Friday, 3/5/21,  at about 10:00am, I experienced chills and muscle fatigue that lasted until  bedtime about 11:00pm.  Life returned to normal until yesterday, 3/8/21,  when, beginning around 11:00pm and lasting until 11:00pm bedtime,  I experience body chills similar to 3/5/21.  Today,  Tuesday,  3/9/21, when I awoke at 6:00pm, my heart rate was noticeably elevated but stabilized within 15 minutes.  And about 10:55am, as I was focusing on work (reviewing/editing an electronic document), I  had an unusual blurry vision and mentally spacious experience that lasted for less than 2 minutes but required me to halt work and collect my thoughts. These experiences are completely new to me.

I had fever of 100.3, headache, rapid heart beat and joint pain throughout the night.    Off and on, I iced my arm for hours.  I finally took extra strength tylenol 23 hrs after the injection.  It helped but my fever persisted until Tuesday, March 9th along with headache and arm pain.  On the evening of March 9, i developed a huge red, warm rash all over my upper arm below  the injection site.  It is more than half way around my arm and about 3-4 inches long.  I rubbed benedryl on it and took a Benedryl pill.  It still appears on my arm and is warm and tender on the morning of March 11th.

                                                Vaccine #1 - Received first dose of Moderna 1/14/2021  -- Ten-15 minutes after injection began to have lips and mouth tingling, wheezing, increase heart rate.  Told people at clinic.  They said to sit for another 15 minutes and come and get them if it got worse.  I went back after ~ 30 minutes total and a couple of medical assistants took my blood pressure.  It was  178/158 (normally I run 128/ 68).  They asked me to take my inhaler (Advair was all that I had so I took a dose).  In addition they gave me one Benadryl tablet (25 mg). 1 hour 20 minutes later my heart rate was 157/124 they gave me another Benadryl to take on my way home if I needed it. *** When I got to my home 30-40 minutes away.  I called my internist. I spoke with her nurse and they called back and told me to take my second dose of 25 mg Benadryl.  She told me to take 25 to 50 mg of Benadryl one hour before getting my second dose of Moderna vaccine.  I had significant swelling on the injection site 3-4 inches in diameters that went down after 5-6/days.  Vaccine # 2 - I received my second dose of Moderna 2/19/2021.  I took 25mg Benadryl ~ 30 minutes before vaccine and took the additional 25 mg when I returned home.  I was extremely cold and could not get warm for 48 hours I took Tylenol. There was no fever. I had wheezing. Swelling day #1 was 1-2 inches Days 2-5 swelling was 4-5.5 inches in diameter. Five to seven days later the swelling and pain resolved.

It was harder to breathe and I could not even take a shower that I would be out of breath. My daughter checked my pulsox and it was 85. I couldn&#39;t really walk or do anything so my daughter  transported me to ER and lots of labs were done so since my D Dimer was too high they did a CT scan and it showed some blood clots in my lungs. They admitted me because they were concerned with the location of one of them. They did some heart tests too and put me on Eloquis and then sent me home. I stayed for 2 days. Then they scheduled me FUs with a heart doctor and a pulmonologist.

She grabbed onto the towel bar on the wall and fell hitting her left hip, left ankle and left upper arm.  She does not remember too much after that, but that she was in and out of consciousness until about 12:30 PM Saturday when she remembered being alert but nothing made any sense to her.  Her son came in and found her on the floor, she could not get up, she had a skin tear on her right elbow and she had been incontinent of bowel and bladder.  He started to ask her the orientation questions and got them all wrong, but she knew that she was confused and disoriented.  She could not get up on her own, called the paramedics and they took her to the hospital.  The confusion and disorientation lasted into early Sunday morning 3/28/2021 at about 3:00 AM when she started to answer questions appropriately.  As the day went on things got better, but still exist to this point today 4/6/21.  It was more severe as she came out of the confusion.  She has brain fog, inability to sequence thoughts, a little bit of expressive aphasia.  She had two CAT scans and an MRI that were negative for subdural or CVA&#39;s.  I had urine specimen and blood cultures to rule out a UTI or sepsis and those were negative.  Her kidney labs were normal.  She ABG&#39;s drawn and those were normal.  They placed her on oxygen and she sat for 3 days and then they released her to home.     Today, she is still having the brain fog, still the not able to sequence thoughts, general fatigue.  She is black and blue from shoulder to elbow due to the fall.

Company Comment: This case refers to a 65-year old female patient with relevant history of Diabetes, Asthma, Hypertension and High cholesterol who experienced Pneumonia bacterial, chest pain, and breast pain following the administration of Covid-19 vaccine and was assessed as Unlikely Related to study drug due to lack of temporal relationship.  The subject&#39;s underlying disease history can be strong confounding factors.  The pneumonia bacterial can be caused by bacterial infection and the immunocompromised system can allow the patient to higher risk for infections.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case refers to a 65-year old female patient with relevant history of Diabetes, Asthma, Hypertension and High cholesterol who experienced Pneumonia bacterial, chest pain, and breast pain following the administration of Covid-19 vaccine and was assessed as Unlikely Related to study drug due to lack of temporal relationship.

I had missed a dose of Metoprolol the previous evening. I felt shaky/jittery and checked my BP and HR. Called the doctor on call at my PCP&#39;s office and he stated it is probably rebound hypertension and elevated HR due to missing the dose of Metoprolol last night. His direction was to check in two hours, and if still elevated, take 1/2 tablet Metoprolol. Current readings at 2:00 pm are 129/97 HR 99. Unsure if related to Covid vaccine.

Were severe for about an hour and then started subsiding.  Gradually felt better over the course of a couple of hours. After about 6 hours, symptoms completely gone and I felt fine.

                                                While waiting 15 minutes after the injection, I begin to feel my heart bounding. I checked my heart rate on my Apple watch, it was 165. The heart rate slowly came down  to the 120&#39;s after approximately 30 seconds and remained their for thirty minutes. I felt better  and left the vaccination location. Shortly after, while driving home my heartrate went up to 152 for approximately the same amount of time  so I drove to my doctors office and explained what happen. They told me to go to the emergency room. By then my heartrate was 109 and I was feeling better. I did not feel the need to go to the emergency room, which I live less than a mile from the nearest hospital. Eventually my heartrate settled at 70-80&#39;s nearly 4 hours after the event.

                                                While driving home after leaving facility 15 minutes after shot, I started having an increased heart rate.  Once home, the rapid heart rate continued and I noticed throat swallowing was getting a little tighter.  I started drinking water and just breathed normally sitting down.  I went to a mirror to see if I could see any swelling of my face and noticed my neck right under my chin was red about half way down.  My chest seemed fine.  I continued to just sit &amp; drink water and soon the heart rate was getting back to normal.  I noticed the redness on my neck was getting lighter also.  I looked at my watch and it had been a little over an hour since my vaccination.  I did not seek treatment, nor have I called my doctor.  There have been no more adverse reactions.

Patient had pain that started in arm where she got shot, then hurt in right leg, and then left leg and arm. Patient passed out at one point, causing her to fall and hit head on bathroom floor. She did not seek any medical attention at that time and has not since her vaccine. She had extreme thirst from 8pm until 3am. She could not sleep due to pain.  Patient was foggy after that for several days, but she is back at work today and feels much better. Patient doesn&#39;t think she had fever. She did have a lot of hot/cold flashes. Patient states she is entering information into the VAERS online system herself since she knows all her symptoms. Patient is wanting to speak to someone that knows about Mold toxicity and if it correlates to the covid Vaccine. She states she had the same symptoms when she had mold toxicity before. States she had a mold toxin dump at that time when she lived in Dallas and was given an IV which caused symptoms to stop.  Patient states she will look up someone if she needs to and does not want the provider to do any leg work. She has several books and has ordered more. When this occurred before, she had hyperbaric oxygen therapy and believes this pushed toxins out of her cells into her body

The next morning after - so nauseous; and aching all over; so tired I could hardly move as I had joint pain, too. Couldn&#39;t throw up but nausea was there constantly - even when I went back to work on Monday I as still nauseated and still in pain. When I came home from work on Monday the body aches were gone and my leg felt numb. So it lasted a good four days for me.  No treatment except drank lots of liquids and stayed still as I could so nausea wouldn&#39;t worsen. I still ache but that might be because of my ruptured disc.

Woke up so got up to take evening meds and brush teeth. Had vertigo and moderate nausea. While brushing teeth, I fainted. Came around quickly - was on bathroom floor. Took only one of my medications - the one to prevent migraines and went back to bed. Continued with body aches and chills on and off through the night. In the morning I had worsened vertigo and nausea, but this is typical of my vestibular migraines and I think that was what was going on. I called in sick to work, took one of my  pills for treating migraines and basically slept all day. I do not get migraines often - usually

Immediately felt a little lightheaded during the 15 min window afterward but was able to ambulate independently with walker just afterward.  After taking a nap, she woke with a headache, chills, a little shaky and feeling very tired.  She was able to eat and take Tylenol at the time.  For the rest of the day, she felt under the weather.  The next morning she was very weak, unable to ambulate and tachycardic prompting nursing staff to send her to the hospital for assessment.

                                                On day 5 I began to have pain in my lungs, later my head started hurting and my lungs got tighter.  I took a nap and woke feeling the same.  I was very tired and slept for 12 hours that night.  Next morning, day 6, a rash began on my chest and spread throughout the day, until it covered my entire torso and both arms.  I took benadryl that night and by day 7, the rash began to subside leaving me very itchy for another day.

Breathing was fast but that might have been panic. I don&#39;t know if it was an allergy or sensitivity and am concerned about getting my second dose on February 24.  2) Also, my injection site was red and sore for the first day but got progressively worse day 2-4 with a red raised hot area and pain that made it stiff to raise my arm. By day 5 it resolved.

Had slight minor itching within 15 minutes of second dose but brief and minor, taking benadryl before injection and twice after.  Then 3 days later (injection on Fri 5:00 pm) reaction Monday 3:00 pm) noticed hives on both hands and some small spots on arm and itching. Over next 2 hours noticed injection site had large irregular rash-y area. Was in another county getting first aid and cpr training ironically, even going over how to use an epi-pen. Could not take benadryl as had to drive 45 min home. Started driving home and began feeling very bad with chest tightness, more itching, decided better to go to ER half-way to home as I live out in the county.  At triage bp was 180/111 and had tachycardia, I think they said 145 bpm. They did EKG labs etc.  Dr. diagnosed allergic reaction and tachycardia.  Administered oral and IV meds and IV fluids and was discharged and home by 8:15 pm.  feel fine the next day, but taking steroid and antihistamine prescription level medications to control.  Meds given at hospital listed: zyrtec tablet 10 mg Pepcid 20 mg Benadryl 50 mg Solu-Medrol 125 mg NS -0.9 1000ml Lopressor 5 mg  Home medications Hydroxyzine HCL 25 mg 1 tab every 6 hrs prn Prednisone 20 mg 1 tablet 2x daily 5 days

                                                Patient is a 66 y.o. female presents with increasing shortness of breath and fatigue the last few days.  The patient presented to the ER just a few days after being discharged from Hospital.  The patient was treated as an inpatient at Hospital little under a week ago for a COPD exacerbation.  She showed dramatic improvement during this time, but over the last few days has started showing increasing signs of shortness of breath and severe fatigue.  She has no known coronavirus (COVID-19) contact, but states that anything is possible.  Her rapid coronavirus (COVID-19) test in the ER was negative.  However, her chest CT seem to suggest a severe viral pneumonia.  Because of this, the patient is going to be admitted to the hospital as she has failed outpatient therapy and is significantly hypoxic.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

She came back to the pharmacy area and she was seated and had her blood pressure checked. It was high (194/84) but she reported that she does have high blood pressure and takes her med at night.  She was given a bottle of water, monitored and her blood pressure was checked twice again over the next 20 minutes. It read lower each time she was checked and when it read 156/84 she said she felt fine and was ready to leave with her husband. She also said she was diabetic and had eaten a small breakfast compared to normally. She will be contacted today to make sure she is still feeling ok.

We gave her ice for the back of her neck.  We checked her blood pressure, it was 230/130, pulse was within normal limits.  Pulse ox was low.  An ambulance was called.  She removed her mask and stepped back so that she could breath better and her oxygen and coloring improved.  She said that her lips felt numb, so we gave her some benadryl just in case.  We did not give an epi pen due to her increased blood pressure.  Her blood pressure did start improving but was still high when the ambulance came.  They took her to the ER for evaluation and she will be following up with her pcp also.  The hospital felt that it was just a fainting episode.

                                                fainted at 5 am following her second Moderna Covid vaccine taken the day prior.  This is the second time this occurred in that she fainted the next day when she took the first Covid shot30 days  ago.  Paramedics were called, her vitals were normal and it was recommended that we do not transport her to the hospital.    When this occurred the first time, she was taken to her neurologist who diagnose a syncope for the incident.

                                                The day following the vaccine I was fine until approximately 1:30 p.m. when I suddenly got very, very dizzy, had disequilibrium and began to feel nauseous, and had diarrhea.  The dizziness increased from mild to so bad I had to hold onto the wall to walk to the bathroom.  I took half a Benadryl but it continued to escalate and I took another half a Benadryl at which time it stopped escalating but did not dissipate until approximately 4:45 p.m.  I called my physician who was unavailable so I just depended on the Benadryl.  There were no breathing difficulties but I had a scratchy throat in the middle of the attack and my tongue went numb and tingly.

My breathing felt a little different but it could have been from wearing two masks for a longer period of time than usual. After ten or fifteen minutes, I felt sort of dizzness and it didn&#39;t feel quite normal around my eyes and forehead. The staff were extremely attentive to me. I probably was there after the shot for 30-45 minutes. Dr.  suggested my symptoms was due to anxiety and out of an abundance of caution, the emergency squad was called and I was taken to  Hospital Emergency Department.

She came to quickly and was taking to us.  She then was alert oriented to person and place.  She knew the date but could not state the year. She also could state the month and date of her birth but not her birth year.   When asked what happened She stated she go lightheaded and fell. She couldn&#39;t remember the incident.  She remembered standing felling lightheaded and then she remembers being on the ground with myself and the EMT talking to her. Took HR and BP. We got her to a sitting position on the floor when she was ready. Took HR and BP. Then we stood and sat her in a chair. Took HR and BP and obtained a Glucose. Called her sister to come to the vaccine center. Talk to patient about going to the ED.  The ED doctor who was communicating with EMT requested patient goes to the ED. Patient initially was refusing. Patient went to the restroom with assist of her walker and nurse.  She was still a little unsteady. Patient did agree to go to ED. Sister arrived and we filled her in on the events. Ambulance arrived and we sent patient to the ED

It was challenging to stand on my own, extreme light-headedness, blood pressure wasn&#39;t taken until March 6th. The symptoms were the worst on March 4th, they improved over the past day or so, however when taking blood pressure reading on March 6th, 2021, blood pressure was 110/60 at 8 am, so it is highly indicative that blood pressure was even lower in the previous days. Other accompanying symptoms on 3/4 were headache, low fever, fatigue, sore arm, achiness (expected side effects). Other side effects on 3/5 were nausea and metallic taste (expected side effects). There were no swelling of throat or breathing problems.

                                                An hour after the injection I began to feel light headed, off-balance and somewhat nauseous. In the next half hour, I went to lie down on the floor of my office because the room was spinning and I was extremely nauseous. A doctor in the building checked my vitals and ordered an ambulance to take me to the hospital. The EMTs checked my vital and my blood pressure was quite high. They started  fluids and added Zophran for nausea while in the office. In the emergency room , again my vitals were checked and the  Zophran was beginning to calm down the nausea. I slept for an hour (or two) and the spinning had stopped. I was discharged around 5:15pm.

After the 2:00 bathroom visit I found myself on the floor of the bathroom between the toilet and the shower. I tried to get up but couldn&#39;t and managed to get out of the spot I was in but unable to get up. I continued to try but was unable to. after two hours of moving, trying to get up and resting where I was I managed to get to my bedroom (a distance of under 12feet).  I felt like my muscles weren&#39;t working properly. I called 911 to help me get off the floor and was taken to the closest ER. By 7am on March 12th I was able to get up and walk on my own. Although my arms and legs are bruised I feel much better today.

                                                36 hours of depilitating headache, chills, body ache, and fever.  I was bedridden. Throat swollen, hard to swallow. Mild angina when reaching down to floor.  I have a history of high tolerance for pain.  This stopped my world for a day and a half.  Better now.

I checked my Fitbit on my wrist, and it said pulse was at 93 normally runs around 52 resting. My breathing was heavy.  My head felt like someone tried to strike me with an axe down the center.  I woke again at around 2:00 a.m. My breathing was still heavy.  I decided to check my temperature and it was 101.4.  My arm was hurting where I had the injection but nowhere near like my head hurt.  I woke again around 4:00 to urinate, checked my temperature and it was up to 101.7.  But then it started coming down and was around 101.4.

                                                Woke up around 2 am with stomach cramps, loose bowels, nausea, chills, sweating, dizziness, sore left arm, very shaky feeling.  Went to bathroom for bowel movement, had trash can in front of me in case of vomiting.  Apparently passed out and fell off toilet.  Woke up on floor, on my right side, with very cold chills and sweating.  Finished going to bathroom.  Noticed small cut on forehead, with dried blood, probably from hitting my head on trash can I was holding.  Went back to bed.  Still dizzy, chills, sweating, stomach cramps, nausea, sore arm, and aching all over.  These symptoms persisted for hours.  Finally fell asleep, woke up around 7:30 am, still dizzy, stomach cramps.  Took temperature, normal, took blood Additional information for Item 18: pressure, also normal.  Called office of primary care doctor, not open on Friday, declined appointment with another doctor, left detailed message, and was told they would contact me on Monday.  Went back to sleep, woke around 11:15 am, still nauseous and stomach cramps and dizzy.  Went back to sleep until around 2:30 pm.  Woke up feeling better, still sore left arm, sore stomach, achy and very tired.

                                                Hello,  FYI: My first Moderna vaccination I had a sore arm and fatigue for a day. For my second Moderna vaccination it was at 0745 6 Mar 2021. Twelve hours later side effects began. The first night was brutal. Temperature rapidly rose to 102. Joint aches, fatigue but couldn&#39;t sleep due to the pain, loss of taste and smell, nausea, felt real cold, shakes, congestion, gassy, hurt to breath, headache, shallow breathing, slightly elevated heart rate. I drank a lot of water and hot Green Tea.  I did call the medical center and spoke with a nurse about whether it was Covid or side effects to the second vaccination.  Second day was miserable; I still had a fever that gradually went down. Finally was able to sleep end of second day. I continued to drink a lot of water and hot Green Tea. Third day, still fatigued, mild heachach. Mild sore arm for three days.  Third through  nine days I have a below normal temperature, hoarseness, mild headache, and fatigue.  the medical center gave me annual flu vaccinations. I&#39;ve never had a side effect from them. While I was in the medical center, before I was deployed overseas, the medical center gave me some dozen vaccinations. Again, no side effects from them.  I have never been around anyone who turned out later to have Covid 19 or tested positive for it.  I have never had the flu. I have had some four cases of a cold. Worst illness was after my exposure to norovirus. I was gravely ill, had to be admitted to the hospital here. Norovirus worse than the two cases of food poisoning I had.  I figure with those awful side effects I now have an immune system better able to handle Covid 19 if I do get exposed.  Per CDC, I will still wear a mask, social distance, avoid medium- and large-sized crowds, avoid poorly ventilated public and private spaces, and wash my hands frequently for the forseeable future.

She noted a history of bee stings and that she has an epi pen at home so was given the shot and monitored for 30 minutes. 20 minutes post vaccine, patient noted she felt dizzy and somewhat disoriented. She noted a dry throat and like her arms and legs felt funny &#34;like jello&#34;. Her husband alerted staff at the vaccination site and EMS assessed her. She said she was told her blood pressure was high for her but otherwise vitals were fine. She denied itching, or shortness of breath or trouble breathing. She actually asked her husband to go home and get her epi pen and he returned with it and was given a dose of epi and sent to the local emergency room for evaluation. She said she felt better by the time she got their but was monitored for a number of hours. She felt completely fine by the time she was discharged. She noted for a few days following the vaccine she felt fatigued and a slightly itchy spot at injection site but that&#39;s it.

                                                Approximately 3 days post vaccine I began to have severe tinnitus. On the same day, I began to have difficulty with my vision , especially in the left eye, a headache and all my joints began to ache. I was also very tired. The symptoms progressively got worse  over the following two weeks and included a couple of episodes of heart rhythm irregularities . During the third week, the headache, eye issues and joint pain began to resolve but the tinnitus is debilitating and prevents me from mentally focusing or sleeping.

Extreme &#34;fogginess&#34; in head, numb feeling around nose, mouth and eyes.   Fatigue, depression, sadness .  Anxious feeling in the chest which is continuing as of this writing (3/21/21)   I do not take  any medications and do not have any history of depression or mental illness.   This is all very unusual for me.

These symptoms went on for 2 weeks, until I had to do my routine lithium level on 3/18/21.  I was toxic at 1.7.  Have been on lithium 40 years and have never been toxic.  My doctor sent me to ER, where they gave me fluids and potassium.  When checked in ER, my BP was 214/87.  I never have high BP - 120/80 is normal.  On discharge, my BP was 194/79.  Saw my doctor ASAP on advice of ER.  My doctor put me on amlodipine for BP which I started today.  He said I had essential hypertension and heart rate is irregular.

She was urinating and having a BM when she suddenly felt extremely lightheaded as though she were about to lose consciousness. She did not thankfully lose consciousness, but rather rapidly developed chest pain after this event. She was brought to ED for evaluation. COVID screen in ED is positive. She was infected with COVID in November, 2020. She has since had a negative COVID screen. She is now positive again &gt;90 days after first positive test, thus this will be treated as a new COVID infection. Place in negative pressure room. I am inclined to begin.

The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID-19 and concomitant medication included Vitamin B12.  On 24-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011A21A) intramuscularly on left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 25-FEB-2021, one day after receiving mRNA-1273, patient started to experience sore arm.  On 26-FEB-2021 patient had severe severe ice pick headache, it felt like the biggest wasp in the world stung her head. She states that it was so painful, and it scarred her. Patient claims she searched it up and it was the cranial 7 nerve from her temple to the back of her head that was on fire which lasted for 5 minutes.  The next day 27-FEB-2021 patient states the headache was gone however the nerve still throbbed a little and she was afraid to go to sleep that night. She then woke up that same night with severe ice pick headaches that were slamming into her head.  On 28-FEB-2021 the patient took protective measures and got up early and did not experience anything on that day. On 1-MAR-2021, she accidentally touched her husband&#39;s forehead with her head lightly and had the most severe ice pick headache (like hot lava running through that nerve for 20 minutes). It alleviated when she took two Advil&#39;s.  The next morning 2-MAR-2021 the patient nerves felt like little electricity lines zapping through constantly. Patient had looked up Bell&#39;s Palsy within our clinical trials and when she went to the doctors on 3-MAR-2021, they said the wrinkles in the right eye was very smooth compared to the left but her eyes were not drooping), doctors believed it to be Bell&#39;s palsy and prescribed her Gabapentin, and Zovirax.  Since then her ice picks have left but there is still nerve pain. She feels like the cranial 7 nerves are still on fire. All her headaches happened in bed while laying down. Patient states that the headaches feel dangerous and feel like they will cause her permanent damage. Patient still feels pressure in her brain and is scared there may be swelling in her brain.  Treatment medications included Advil, Gabapentin, and Zovarax.  Seriousness criteria included medically significant events.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.    Outcome of the event sore arm, severe ice pick headache, felt like the biggest wasp in the world stung her head,  nerve pain, afraid to go to sleep, most severe ice pick headache/headaches happened in bed while laying down/headaches feel dangerous, patient nerves felt like little electricity lines zapping through constantly/still feels like cranial 7 nerves are on fire were considered recovered but bell&#39;s palsy, wrinkles in right eye was very smooth, patient feels pressure in her brain/scared there may be swelling in her brain and heart muscle is a little sore were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Headache is consistent with the known safety profile of he vaccine.

                                                Got slightly dizzy as I stood up. Went to sit in observation room.  My heart was beating very fast for about 8 minutes.  Felt a tightness in my chest and had a slight bit of difficulty breathing.  Did not want to tell the monitors.  Afraid to go to a hospital with COVID.  My left hand turned blue and got cold and tingly.  That lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  So did the trouble breathing.  All subsided in 15 minutes.  Went home and took an antihistamine.  Had a light rash on my body.  Consulted with PCP and cardiologist.  They seem clueless.  We all agreed that i need the second dose but what is the antidote.  Cardiologist gave me a beta-blocker to take before the dose but these symptoms all appeared on the severe allergic reaction list.  The heart pounding was the most pronounced symptom.  What do I do?

Had some tingling in lips and tightness in chest, felt light-headed.  Paramedics observed and checked vitals.  Pulse ox was good, chest clear, BP high.  Gave me choice of getting IV or going to drugstore and purchasing benedryl to begin immediately.  Started oral benedryl.  Went home and took 2nd dose.  Redness is subsiding, BP reduced. Still mild light headedness.

The patient was discovered to have a large saddle pulmonary embolism, went into cardiac arrest and expired. Of note, the patient received her second Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/23, which would place her first one approximately 12/25 if she received them at the appropriate interval. This information is from the patient&#39;s daughter and the ED record, the information is not available in CAIR. Per the daughter, the patient started feeling ill on 1/21, improved on 1/25, and then acutely worsened on 1/27, resulting in the ED visit.

Occasional tingling, angioderma around mouth. Disssapated after Benadryl.  Rash is gradually fading and requires less Benadryl to keep in check.  Had similar reaction to Shrinyx vaccine 2 years ago.  Rash lasted 1-2 weeks without Benadryl treatment.

                                                Began with sweating than pain  in upper back between shoulder blades, radiated from back to  chest.  Tightening of jaw (as when eating something really tart).  Pain felt similar to muscle spasms and would be bad enough to cause nausea &amp; vomiting.  When pain subsided would experience chills and shivering.  This would come and go over the next 5-6 hours.    Checked for fever, but temperature was within normal range.

I had the first Moderna shot on Friday February 5th st 3:00 pm.  By 8:00 that night   joint. muscle and skin pain and headache started.  The next morning February 6th my  temperature dropped to 96 and I had extreme chills all day. That night my temperature was 103.2 ,  diarrhea and vomiting started with all the previous reactions except chills still there.  Sunday morning February 7th,  all effects from vaccine still there- joint, muscle, skin pain, headache, diarrhea and vomiting but no fever.  Sunday night, fever of 102.4 .  Monday morning February 7th,  headache and fever are gone but extremely weak and body aches still here.  My question to you is &#34;With such a reaction to the first shot,  should I get the second one? &#34;

In  a couple of minutes I felt very light headed.   While scheduling my second dose, I started feeling  strong pressure inside my head.  I didn&#39;t not feel any pain, just a lot of pressure.     When measuring my  blood pressure (usually, in my case,  it is 120 X 80)  I was told my high number was at 178 x 80.   After resting for some 20 minutes, I was fine again and drove home.    I felt a bit strange  for a couple of hours.

Pt reports she was feeling well prior to the episode and she had her COVID 19 vaccine at 4:30PM and had tolerated the vaccine well.  She does report that she had atrial fibrillation before, about 5 years ago and she underwent a cardiac work up.  She denied palpitations, fever, chills, body aches, nausea, or vomiting.  She does have a non productive cough.  Her BP normally runs 130/80&#39;s at home and is controlled w amlodipine.  She was given SL nitro and aspirin in the ambulance.  EKG showed atrial fibrillation with RVR, HR 150&#39;s.  Reason for admission: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (*) Atrial fibrillation with RVR (*)    She was admitted for further evaluation and monitoring.  Troponin level noted to be 0.79 and EKG with ST-T wave changes, cardiology was consulted and patient underwent cardiac cath who revealed no significant CAD hyperdynamic LVEF 70 %.  She developed a small hematoma post catheterization which has resolved.  Cardizem was switched to metoprolol and both BP and HR are improved and controlled with losartan.  Pt without any adverse effects to losartan, no s/s angioedema.  Afib with an abrupt onset and abrupt return to normal sinus rhythm.  She complained of calf pain, US dopplers were obtained and were negative for DVT.  Her D Dimer was also normal.    Pt discharge to home in stable condition.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included Pentasa, metformin, insulin, Zoloft and atorvastatin.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 028L20A) on 20 Jan 2021 in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient developed a fever on 25 Jan 2021, and it got up to 101 degrees Fahrenheit on 26 Jan 2021.  On 26 Jan 2021 she felt must worse, couldn&#39;t take food, and couldn&#39;t get up from bed. On 27 Jan 2021, she was taken to the emergency room where her oxygen saturation was low, but the fever was gone.  She was placed on oxygen, and blood work had elevated troponin. The patient was diagnosed with pericarditis and she was kept overnight. On 28 Jan 2021 she had atrial fibrillation and the medical team couldn&#39;t convert her chemically.  She was stabilized on 30 Jan 2021 and she was feeling much better.   Treatments of these events included oxygen and ibuprofen.    The events, fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, feeling much worse, couldn&#39;t take food, couldn&#39;t get up from bed, bloodwork with elevated troponin, pericarditis, and atrial fibrillation were considered Recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67 year old female who experienced serious unexpected events of feeling abnormal, decreased appetite, bedridden, elevated troponin, pericarditis, and atrial fibrillation, and a serious expected event of fever. The events began 6 days after first dose of mRNA-1273. Treatment with ibuprofen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I was given water and after a few minutes HR went below 100.  I stayed another 30 minutes and left however I did still feel a bit dizzy.  At about 8 hours post injection got chills and fever of 101.5 and HR remained high (above 102) for at least 6 hours after onset of fever.   Resting HR usually 59 and still remains above 90 at 48 hours.

                                                The day after my injection, at 5:00 a.m. I got up to try to go to the bathroom but felt very dizzy - I had help to get to commode but had to lie on floor to stop from passing out, was sweating profusely.  Did not feel well between 5 and 8 am. I think I had 2 vasovagal episodes during this time brought on by needing to do a bowel movement but I had difficulty not passing out.  After second bowel movement - the dizziness and nausea and sweating subsided.  The rest of the day, I just had minor fever and minor headache.  By the next day I was normal.  I have had 2 or 3 vasovagal episodes in the last 15 years and so that is what I think it was but I assume possibly brought on by the vaccine.  My average sleeping heart rate that first night was 10 beats per minute higher than normal (I wear a Fitbit with a sleep app).

She did not notice until after another 10 minutes that her face was on fire.  She looked in the mirror and her face was red, much more on the left than the right.  It would decrease in intensity and then flare up again.  She then went to the doctor, tried to wait out getting into the doctor, but then decided to go to the ER.  Her blood pressure was 187/181, yesterday was 112/64.  They gave her a stronger Benadryl and Pepcid, monitored her and did her oxygen level which was 97%.  All other VS were normal.  Today, 2/18/21 the redness was gone by 10:00 the night of the vaccine.  Over the last 24 hours she has had a mucousy cough, and clearing of the throat, but otherwise feels back to normal.

About 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt nauseated but finally managed to sleep.  The next afternoon on February 23 I became very ill with vomiting and diarrhea all at the same time.  I nearly passed out several times.  First responders arrived and found my blood pressure to be about 70/30.  Got in ambulance and given fluids.  Arrived at hospital around 5:15 pm.  Got more fluids and numerous blood tests, none of which were very remarkable.  My WBC was 17 but nothing else was wrong.  Left hospital at 9:00.  Physician assumes Covid vaccine cause these side effects.

I could drink ok, so no problem swallowing. They took my blood pressure at the time and it was 104/55. I have low blood pressure but that was lower than normal. I stayed for 30 minutes and the tingling would come and go. They did offer to call an ambulance but I declined. I got up this morning and have 2 welts on my forehead and the left side of my lips are still tingling, and occasionally the right side. I will call my doctor tomorrow morning.

Later that evening, patient texted me saying I didn?t feel well when I got home, had trouble focusing literally and had a crying jag and felt shaky on the inside. I kept hydrating, took 25 of Benadryl and slept for 2 hrs., now feel close to normal. It was definitely a reaction to the shot-just weird!? Patient texted me on 2/13/21 that ?the FDA thinks one vaccine may be enough for 80?90% effectiveness, so I might not get the 2nd dose? On 2/15/21 patient texted, ?My PCP thinks what I had was a side effect &amp; recommends taking Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Tylenol before the 2nd injection, and doesn?t seem to be worried about it!?   On 2/19/21, I received a text from patient at 5:28 AM as she was scheduled to staff a Covid clinic that day, beginning at 7:30 AM. She said, ?I have been up for a couple hrs w/severe eye pain and can?t hardly open my eye but it hurts to close it too! At 10:37 AM she texted, ?I just got home from eye doctor and was prescribed drops 4X/day. Apparently, there are pin holes in my sclera &amp; cornea which hurt so bad I had lavender cold pack on all day &amp; couldn?t stand the light. It is a corneal abrasion &amp; I have no idea why that would happen suddenly?. The following day, she texted me a picture of her L arm injection site which she said was ?very itchy and hot! Not painful-? It was about 6 inches in diameter, red, inflamed,  delayed cutaneous rx.

Racing heartbeat. The symptoms lasted for about 5 minutes, then subsided completely.  Approximately an hour later I felt very tired, and had a mild headache. Took a Tylenol tablet and rested. Felt better after about 2 hours.

Patient received her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at 1200 yesterday. She states she was feeling okay prior to 2000. Patient states she then developed numbness to the right side of her head, right arm, and right leg. She called EMS and was evaluated at her home. Patient was hypertensive at the time but was told she did not need to come to the ED. Afterward she took a Benadryl and went to bed. She states the benadryl just made her sleepy but did not improve her numbness. This morning she woke up still feeling numb and called her PCP. The RN she spoke to recommended she come to the ED. She is dizzy but she states this is normal per her baseline. States HTN previously resolved.

                                                At 8am Jan 20th (30 hrs after shot) I woke feeling extremely strong and powered up, very energized and liken the mental energy to feeling like I was on steroids. Went downstairs to kitchen to make a cup of tea and it was then I realized my pulse was going extremely fast (about 180bpm). I didn&#39;t think much of it or get nervous, but went to sit down and work at my computer, hoping it would go away, After about 20 minutes I realized it hadn&#39;t slowed down, so I went back to my bedroom to get dressed in the event I had to go to an urgent care or hospital. On the way up the stairs to my bedroom I realized I was getting a bit light-headed.  After about another 10 minutes I decided to lie down and called up a &#34;calming meditation&#34; app to see if that could lower my heart rate. I was able to get my heart rate down to about 125 after the10 minute meditation and it returned to normal shortly thereafter. The second episode was on February 11th. This time I was woken up out of my sleep at 4:45am by an extremely rapid heartbeat. Again, about 180bpm. This time I was a bit frightened. I walked around the house for about 15 minutes and when it didn&#39;t go down  I decided to go out for a walk. I did about a 30 minute walk , I had some tingling in my hands, but by the end of the walk my heart rate came down to about 100 and dropped back to normal shortly after.

IN CONNECTION WITH THAT, I DEVELOPED SEVER PAIN IN MY LOWER RIGHT FLANK AREA THAT RADIATED TO MY SHOULDER AS WELL AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THERE IS NO HISTORY IN MY FAMILY OF ANY CLOTTING ISSUES AND I MYSELF HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A THING OCCUR.  THE PAIN BECAME SO BAD IT FORCED ME TO GO TO A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPT.  AFTER CT SCANS CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF THE CLOTS, I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ADMITTED FOR OBSERVATION ON A REGIMEN OF DRUGS, BLOOD THINNER, PAIN MED, AND A CLOT BUSTER (NOT SURE WHICH MANUFACTURER.)  I AM STILL EXPERIENCING PAIN IN MY RIGHT FLANK AREA - SOMEWHAT RADIATING TO MY RIGHT SHOULDER DAY 1 POST DISCHARGE AND AM HAVING TO RELY ON OPIOID PAIN MED AS WELL AS THE CLOT BUSTING MED AND A HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MED. TO ME, IT SEEMS THAT THIS MAY NOT BE JUST COINCIDENTAL.  I WAS FEELING FINE PRIOR TO THE S 2ND DOSE OF THE MODERNA VAC AND THIS SEEMS TO ME THAT IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE 2 DOSE.

                                                At approx 2 pm Monday, March 8, 2021 I was shopping for clothes.  I was having difficulty breathing through my mask and asked employee if they had a mask I can have.  When I took mine off to use theirs, I was surprised it wasn&#39;t my usual KN95 on me as those are more difficult to breath through.  I felt labored in breathing from that point.  I left the store to get home quickly.  I was also experiencing rapid heart rate\great nervousness and was assuming that because I purchased a large diet coke one hr before that, that the caffeine was causing this.  However, I&#39;ve never experienced this event.  Within 3 minutes of my home, I started experiencing what seemed to be shortness of breathe.  it lasted about a minute.  I considered going to ER.  But went home.  Shortness of breathe stopped and I looked on google how to reduce caffeine reaction.  I ate handful of peanuts for protein, but had odd indigestion.  Kept drinking lots of water to flush out.  Was doing many deep breathing exercises. Nervousness and rapid heart rate lasted about 2 hours.  I  was back to normal by evening.  Scary as I never experienced difficulty with a regular surgical mask.  Never experienced such a severe reaction to a caffeine beverage.  Never experienced that shortness of breath.

I took Acetaminophen every 8 hours through to 8:00 AM March 10.  I was too weak to prepare meals and I live alone so I ate only 8 or 10 cookies throughout the day as they were easy to grab and get back to bed.  Had moderate sweating episodes throughout the day and through the night of March 9/10.    Still felt sore when I woke up at 8:00 AM on March 10, 2021.  Took about 2 hours for me to get myself comfortable being upright and able to dress and move about.  Waited for Acetaminophen to work.

                                                Vaccine was Thur 3/11 at noon.  Slight headache and pain at site of injection. Friday morning, was very dizzy.  Had walked into kitchen to get the thermometer.  My temp was 99. I got very dizzy and passed out for a second or two.  When I hit my head on a cabinet handle I came to.  At first I though I was in my bed and couldn&#39;t figure out what I had hit my head on.  There was blood coming from the wound. My husband came to help me.  We stopped the bleeding after a few minutes and I began icing my head.   I was still very dizzy and had an urge to use the bathroom.  I was afraid to get up. With my husband&#39;s help, I crawled to bathroom and he helped my onto toilet.  I had diarrhea.   At that point I was able to walk with help to my bed. I have had a mild to moderate headache since I had the vaccine.

However, exactly 14 days later, tight chest, front and back ribs, spine and all back muscles hurt with unusual severe pain.  Loss of appetite and &#34;tingling&#34; as well as elevated blood pressure and &#34;wierd&#34; feeling irregular heart rhythm.  This lasted exactly 5 days.  6th day, fortunately the other symptoms seemed much better, but now occasionally there is a &#34;tingling&#34; sensation throughout my entire nervous system... in other words I feel it in my chest, arms, legs.  There has been no dizziness associated with any of these symptoms.  Had I felt any difficulty breathing I would have immediately gone to the hospital or emergency room, but that never occured.  I told my husband, I felt (based on what you hear) like the symptoms were &#34;covid&#34; but no fever, no nausea and no lung issues... just really strange pain.  Today, 17th of March, I am feeling better (I have also been off work), but I am concerned as I am scheduled in less than 10 days for a second moderna vaccine, and I am uncertain what to do.

                                                I got up around 8:30 , went to the toilet, and as I was washing my hands, I blacked out.  I slipped to the floor and then vomited several times.  Fortunately,  I had not eaten since about 7 pm the night before, but I still expelled material.    Stayed in bed all day.  Drank lots of water and slept.    FEEL MUCH BETTER today....eating and vertical.  PS   After the first shot, I slept most of the next day, felt very achy, sweated, and had a headache.  Those symptoms disappeared after about 24 hrs.  BUT about a week after the first shot, I developed a large rash not on, but rather near the injection site.  It was itchy for a day or two, as well.    As I said, I feel much better today, but just thought you should know, especially because the fainting and vomiting are not listed as common reactions.    THANKS

                                                I was walking out of my apartment building to my car inside the garage on Friday at 6:00 pm. As I was walking, my arms &amp; legs began to feel heavy. By the time I reached the garage I was feeling extremely fatigued. I got inside of my car and thought to myself that I&#39;ve never felt this tired in all of my life. I then felt very cold and decided it was best to go back upstairs.  When I into my apartment unit - my cats greeted me as if I was gone for an extremely long time - and I noticed the sun coming in through my windows when the sun should have been on the other side of the building at 6:00 pm. Both the cats &amp; the sunshine told me something was very wrong. I looked at the clock - it said 8:08. I put on the tv and discovered it was 8:08 A.M. on Saturday morning. I had fallen asleep (or passed out) in my car from 6pm Friday evening until 8am Saturday morning.  I have no sleeping disorders &amp; do not require naps during the day. Today I still feel fatigued, but only slightly.  From the time I entered my car at 6pm Friday - until the time I exited my car at 8am Saturday - it felt as though only moments had passed. I had no idea I had fallen asleep or passed out.

                                                Post vaccine 2/9/21, I experienced drop in O2 Sat over a period of several weeks as I log my daily vitals (blood sugar, BP, Temp, Pulse rate and O2 Sat in percent).  I have O2 concentrator that I use as needed via nasal cannula.  I do have SOB with exertion due to Sarcoidosis of the Lung.  I notified my PCP on 2/19 of a morning sat of 89 which came up with O2 and breathing exercises, I also took a 20mg. Lasix and Mucinex chewable which usually helps with congestion.  With O2 and rest, my O2 Sat improved and extra O2 was stopped.  Then again my O2 steadily dropped over a period of a week, I coughed more (always have come cough), SOB. On March 7th, getting ready for bed, I became severely SOB, O2 Sat now 82, I called 911.  Was alert, oriented when Paramedics arrived, but needed 100% O2 and transported to Hospital, SOB was severe, gasping/drowning, loss of awareness, apparently resp. arrested, was intubated.  STAT CT with Contrast, and Echocardiogram, R/O PE, Lung collapse, etc.  (No PE/or collapse). MY supposition is that I had a slow moving allergic response to Moderna Vaccine (I am a former healthcare worker of 20 years) and currently work in healthcare medical devices in Ultrasound.  I closely watch vaccine development and read research articles on Sarcoidosis, vaccines and COVID. I participated and continue with a Sarcoidosis Study). I think I experienced cytokine storm with my ultrasensitive immune system. I use oral steroid (QVAR 40mics inhaled daily) which I doubled after taking the vaccine for a few weeks. I have had a MMR vaccine last June 2020 and Quadvalent Flu vaccine last August 2020.

                                                My mom was very ill with fever like symptoms following her first vaccination on January 26th. The symptoms were even worse after her second vaccination March 2nd and included muscle cramping in her legs. Once she was recovered she only had a persistent cough which she attributed to allergies as the pollen count had been high. In the early morning hours of March 19th she was having difficulty breathing and chest pains. She was rushed to the emergency room where she subsequently died of cardio pulmonary embolism which the coroner indicated began within three weeks of her death.

                                                I developed severe lower back/flank pain about 4 days after receiving my 2nd Moderna vaccination.  The pain was most pronounced while lying supine and , while in that position, manifested a creeping , fluid nature, i.e. migrating from my lower back to my shoulder.  I was unable to lie down comfortably.  In thinking about the nature of this pain, I determined that it was possibly/probably from a PE as it seemed as if  pain was migrating from my lower back to my shoulder.  I&#39;m &#34;not a doctor but play one on TV&#34; (LOL ) so surmised that it was something serious that  decided that this was something needing attention.  I presented to a hospital ER for care and was ultimately told I had 2 small PE blood clots - 1 in the base of each lung.  My diagnosis was confirmed by a CT scan and I was subsequently admitted for observation.  I was discharged the following day with blood thinners and blood pressure medication.

I went over and rolled patient over having her lay face up and then proceeded to ask her questions. We had a staff member called 911 while I was helping her.  I asked her how she felt and she responded and said she felt &#34;hot all over and dizzy.&#34; Her pulse was low (~40 bpm). 911 informed us to lie her down on the floor until EMS arrived which we already had been doing at the time. After getting off the phone with 911, she started feeling better and her pulse returned to a normal rate (~80 bpm). EMS still took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

Again brief a couple minutes.  It did not advance. EMS and Doctor checked me for 40 minutes.  Only slightly elevated pulse.  It was elevated before I left home. It was 100 at home.  Got to about 106 doing this episode.  Went down to 97 before I left.  All other vs-WNL..  LS clear the whole time. O2sat.- 96 up to 100 before I left  I really want to get the second shot when I am due.  My personal doctor can not give me any answers. I never got out of my car.  Did not get any extra care just monitored.  Only sore arm later.

About early afternoon, my hands felt warm , face warm and lips dry, heart rate was 100, temperature was 99 , right arm very painful. Temperature runs between 98.8-99.4 ,pulse around 80-90&#39;s on  Saturday and Sunday. I took extra strength Tylenol every 6-8hrs which helped relieve some pain and fever(tried Advil but this did not help with the arm pain.) Monday morning 1/25/21 woke up and noticed arm pain gone. Temperature was 98.6-98.8 the whole day.  No further symptoms like above felt ( so far)

                                                One week after taking the vaccine I developed significant swelling of the upper left arm at the vaccination site that gradually got worse as the day progressed. I also experienced a headache and a severe spike in blood pressure in the afternoon, which led me to think that my reaction might be severe. As a result I went to the local ER where they decided to keep me overnight for observation. The symtoms did not get worse, but I was given steroids and peptid intravenously, as well as Benadryl to counteract the swelling. Today, Jan. 28, I continue to have some swelling in the left arm, as well as redness.

Pain is worse and lasts all afternoon  into evening Day 8 pain returns, but this time deep in the right chest and worse. Begins in afternoon and by evening pain is paralyzing, in tears. Attempted to w as l holing on to things to ease the contractions. Yes the pain was as bad a worst contractions from labor. At 3am dressed to go to Ed but decided against  it duevti Covid concerns. Pain most server when I was either sitting  or lying  down. Terrible afraid to take second dose for tear that side effects will be much worse. On the intervening days no pain or paroxysms.

After an hour I felt like the inside of my skin was prickly and tingly, my face was flushed and burning.  I was so tired I had to lay down.  I just stared into space.  There was ringing in my ears.  My heart rate was a good 20 beats per minute faster than normal.  By bedtime, my face was slightly swollen and I was unable to read because the letters were jiggly.  I had a traveling headache from the side to the top of my head through my eyes.  My breathing was more rapid and shallow.  I felt intermittent chest tightness. And pain.  The next morning, I felt better, but the prickly skin continued and my chest and back were  sore.  I had intermittent cramping in my feet and was sore in my joints.  My arm was very tender.  I was still tired and my heart rate was still elevated.  I did not sleep well and got up frequently during the night to walk around.  By the third day the prickly skin was almost gone, but I have had cramping in my chest and feet.  I am very tired.  I still have an occasional traveling headache.

By the time that she looked in her rear view mirror her face was swelling up.   Her face started to burn, fast heart beat, and dizziness.  Her neck started to burn as well.  She looked at the side effects.  She called her doctor and took 2 Benadryl as she recommended, and took a nap.  Her doctor told her to continue taking the Benadryl and to call us to report the reaction.  She still has the swelling and the burning sensation in her face, and is still getting a little dizzy but it comes and goes.  The fast heartbeat comes and goes as well.

Within 8 hours of receiving the first vaccine I got a bad headache, my chest felt heavy again, I was nauseated and felt a general malaise - all symptoms I had experienced with Covid.  These symptoms lightened over the next few days, but I developed a cough again, and my headache continued off and on through day 5.

                                                After 20 minutes of obtaining patient (me) felt a rapid heart beat (i.e., Tachycardia) and called nurse over who in turn got the Doc who was on call for the drive through to come over. Confirmed rapid heart beat and said I need to remain under observation and he would come back again in 5 minutes. After he left had intense bowel and abdominal pain. He came back and rapid heart beat subsided and I left and went home. Continued to have abdominal pain and it was severe for next 36 hours along with a headache. Felt a bit better after 36 hours but still after 72 hours abdominal pain continued again and took a dose of Imodium. Did not feel well systematically as well and called health care professional and got an emergency appointment for the next morning at 8:00 am. Unfortunately, after talking with Dr. next day I began to feel depressed with suicidal ideation involvement, this was approximately 90 hours after getting that damn shot. As a professor of psychology I only every had severe depression with suicidal ideation occur once before and that was after I was giving a new allergy medication which they had to take me off of after one week. It is obvious to me that you people rushed the science on these vaccines  and were pushed to come up with a vaccine before &#34;he should not be named was still President&#34;.  Shame on you for not completely vetting the science and shame on the people who made millions off of these vaccines. In no way were people that have special genetic underpinnings such as myself including in the clinical trails. I read the findings of the clinical trails and it is disconcerting to know that instead of a 2% adverse reactions for the Moderna shot it has now being estimated that 25% or the population has an adverse event after the first shot and now can not get the 2nd and 45% of people who are getting the shot are suffering the ill effects from mRNA and these nano particulars and what is now appearing to be a problem with the lipids (i.e., polyethylene glocol). Stop experimenting with all of us and use the tried and true platforms, even if they are less effective. Or better yet stop ridding by the seat of your parents and get your protocols in order which allows people to choice for themself, in consult with they physician, of which is best for them.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Monday, 2-15-21. 11:45 am. ? Received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  12:30 pm. ? Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

                                                I had the virus in August of 2020 for 30 days until symptom free.  ON 2/6/2021 received first vaccine injection.  within 3 minutes a light headache started.  That evening, rash and itching on right fore-arm and under chin. took benedryl. Woke at 3:30 am on 2/7 not feeling well and left arm very sore and could not touch.  6:30 am - chills with severe body shaking and 101 temp.  7:30 am 102.2  took tylenot 8 hr 650 mg. Oxygen at 96, heart rate at 76 and BP 117/68. 8:00 am 101.9 temp. 10 am 100.6 temp. 1:30 pm 102.9 temp. 2:00 pm 103.3  Took Tylenol, extra strength 2 tabs. 8:30 pm used inhaler due to chest pains  101.3 temp. took benedryl.  Oxygennn @98  HR-82 BP 145/77.  11.00 pm 103.3 temp. took 2 tylenol.  Mon 8:00 Monday am continued/ 100.2 temp  oxygen 97  HR-70; 99.2 temp  BP 110/71.  7 pm. took Benedryl for congestion.   Quit taking stats.  Fatigue and rest took play at this point.  Since then have had intermittent low grade fever in 99.2 to 99.9.  Same with headache and extreme fatigue.  Have high risk husband that I take care of .  He had his first vaccine at same time.  No side effect at all.  I am scheduled for 2nd vaccine on March 6th.  I am very apprehensive about taking it with this reaction.  Please advise/recommend if I should proceed.  My PCP stated that these reactions were evidence the vaccine is working.  Is this because I had the virus???  Both the virus and vaccine have been really hard on me.  I am usually a very active person and since August, I have been struggling with fatigue.  First time in life.   Thank you.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

As night progressed the symptoms worsened - about 2am intense back pain between shoulder blades radiating to chest, heart was pounding, temperature increased to 101 About 3am was in extreme pain throughout entire body, severe chills/shaking,  fever was 102.2, experienced minor urinary incontinence About 3:30am I finally had to take  2 Advil - within an hour the symptoms had lessened and temp had dropped to 100 By noon (22 hours after injection) I was experiencing only mild body aches, temperature was normal, left arm remained sore but I could move it - other side effects had resolved  I am very stoic and have a fairly high pain tolerance. I had no side effects after shot 1. After shot 2 I was sicker than I have ever been in my life ?- for several hours I was concerned I was going to die.

                                                I received my 2nd Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA on 2/24/2021. Had only a mild sore arm. When I woke the next morning I was fine with still just a mild sore arm. Then 21 hours after my vaccine I started getting chills and fever 101.9 which I read I could have after the vaccine. The unusual thing that occurred was how cold my hands got, they became so cold they hurt. I had a difficult time warming them up when I checked my oxygen level it was low, 89. I assume because they were so cold. This was very uncomfortable. I have never experienced this freezing hands before, and I have not seen it has a symptom so I wanted to inform someone. I started taking Tylenol with my fever and it broke overnight and I feel fine now.

We gave her a bottle of water to drink and crackers and she said she felt better. The tongue tingling went away as well before the 30 minutes ended. Her blood pressure was retaken before she left and it remained in the 140s/100s. She said this is higher than her normal but it could be due to anxiety.

                                                Fifteen minutes after injection, I experienced pain in my left chest. It migrated to the center of my chest and could be felt on both front and back. Pain was a dull, squeezing ache that could be mitigated by placing hand over the pain and leaning forward. Pain level was 2. The pain migrated to left shoulder and up left side of neck. Vital signs were normal.  A few dry coughs caused medical personnel to offer water, which was declined. The pain was similar to the pain I experienced after drinking contrast medium (now considered an allergic reaction) but without breathing difficulties. The pain went away after an hour and half. Nurses suggested emergency medical care, which I declined.

                                                First two days after vaccine- tired. By day three began experiencing back pain. By Wednesday, January 20th severe back pain and chest tightening. I went first to Urgent Care. Dr. said EKG ok but I should follow up with Dr. or ER. That evening I went to ER at Hospital. By then it felt like my back and chest were in vice. It did not feel like regular back pain- more searing and deep spasms. Had a gnawing kind of feeling in my stomach and esophagus. Pain in upper part of my body....sometimes waves of pain in shoulders and down back half of my arms. ER Dr gave me shot of pain meds and sent me home after a few hours. Vice like feeling subsided but deep muscle pain in back continued.It was not as severe as the previous day. Over the next week it continued to go from severe back to mild.I visited my primary care Dr/PA and tried changing GERD meds from Famotidine to another- no help. Tried muscle relaxers- I just slept on those. About a week after first visit I went to ER again after a bad night of the vice like feeling in chest and back. ER Dr. did CAT scan of heart and lungs. No sign of pneumonia . Since then I have had an endoscope, seen a cardiologist, and an orthopedic Dr.  After second dose, reaction came back, but less severe than the first time.

Once conscious, patient seemed like they were going to fall in and out of consciousness, so we kept speaking to her and asking her questions to keep her conscious.  Patient began grabbing right upper abdominal quadrant and complaining of pain. She requested ice because she was feeling hot and her abdomen was hurting, ice was provided. AED was connected and 911 was called, no shock was suggested by AED.  EMT arrived and took vitals and blood sugar.  They found no issues with vitals, but suggested that she go to Hospital  for further assessment.  She was taken out on a stretcher, but it is unknown to me what resulted after she left the building.

                                                Sunday, the day of the shot, I was quite dizzy a couple of hours after the injection and my arm at the vaccination site was itchy, but no other significant reactions. The following morning I awoke to a very swollen, hot,  red, and rashy-looking upper left arm at the site of the injection. Had a bit of diarrhea twice in the morning. My temperature 100.4 which is 3° higher than normal for me.  Later that afternoon, I got dizzy again so I took my blood pressure and it was 90/59 which is low for me.   I had been eating normally even though I had a feeling of unease.  The most concerning thing was the discomfort in my upper arm and the swelling.  It was very localized and looked as if my arm had swallowed a tennis ball.  Itchy, red, hot, and very tender.  Today is Day 4 and the swelling has subsided but still not entirely gone and it is still quite warm.  I&#39;ve been applying cold compresses and taking some Tylenol.

                                                Began with stabbing pain in left shoulder that woke me up every 2 hours all night long. Progressed to massive migraine headache in a wide band across my forehead.  Found fluid pooling in a channel from my armpit past my elbow; rubbed on it and raise arm until it went away. Muscles in left arm stopped working; couldn&#39;t move my arm; put left arm in a sling.  Started feeling like I was burning up with fever, but body temperature was normal 98.8 degrees. Several hours later was having sudden chills and found body temperature had risen to 102 degrees F.  Developed high blood pressure for me. The lymph node in my neck were swelling, armpit tender to touch, and left breast tender to touch too.  Started icing the back of my neck to take down temp. Put ice on my shoulder to try to cool the pain.  I was very frightened and worried that: (1) got sepsis bacterial infection from shot (2) got bad lot of Moderna or (3) Moderna vaccine sat out at room temperature too long and had gone bad.  48 hours after the 2nd dose and after icing, symptoms started to ease.

Also couldn&#39;t use arm for over a week, and felt like crap for days.  Did not report to nurse, just got up and went home.  Had no choice. Had a handicapped son with me and he had wandered outside.  He cannot be left alone.  Got home the feeling lingered.

These symptoms went away within approximately 5 minutes. The next morning I woke with a slight headache which didn&#39;t last very long. I had significant discomfort in the left arm at the injection site.  It felt like someone had inserted a balloon in the muscle.  It hurt to raise my arm to 90 degrees and above my head.  I became less aware of it about 9:00 pm the following night.  I called my doctor to report the side effects and it was recommended that I take 2 extra strength tylenol.  I still feel some discomfort at the injection site.

Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).  Patient presented to outlying emergency room with flank pain &amp; transferred here with severe bilateral hydronephrosis on imaging.  Patient had severe left flank pain about 2 weeks ago. Treated with tylenol, motrin, and heat and pain eventually dissipated. Then Tuesday and Wednesday pt did a lot of yard work and lifting. Thursday patient woke up with excruciating right flank pain.  Nothing has made it better.  Patient has tried ice, heat, tramadol Tylenol, Motrin, steroids and pain persists.  Additionally patient having nausea and vomiting.  She has started to have burning with urination.  Pain is excruciating stabbing.  Radiates to the groin.  Patient has also started running fevers today.  She feels pretty miserable.   Also patient notes difficulty with her bowels since her last surgery.  Prior to surgery she took Linzess every day.  Since surgery it has been suggested she does not need this medication.  Patient does note little to no notice when her bowels decide to move.  Severe significant gas.  Other times patient feels quite constipated.   UA suggests possible infection with positive nitrites, 1&#43; leukocyte esterase and 3&#43; blood.  WBC 2.1, Cr 1.0, K 3.0 CT scan with multiple abnormalities, but most notably severe bilateral hydronephrosis without obvious obstructing lesion.  Multiple scattered nodular densities concerning for metastatic disease.    Patient transferred for higher level of care and urology consultation.

                                                Shortly after receiving her  Covid vaccination, patient complained of a weird taste, dizziness and feeling faint. I monitored the patient closely, checked  her vital signs and everything was normal. Medical history revealed patient has type 2 DM and HTN. I asked patient if she had taken her meds and eaten breakfast (time was 11:15am at this point). She said she took her meds but hadn&#39;t eaten breakfast. I bought her orange juice and a few snacks. In less than 5 minutes after eating/snacking. She mentioned that she was feeling remarkably better. I monitored her for 15 minutes more to make sure she was fully recovered. She was very grateful and felt at ease leaving the pharmacy. I will check on her later.

                                                COVID-19; low blood pressure; A spontaneous report  was received from a consumer concerning a 68-year-old, female patient who experienced COVID-19 and low blood pressure/hypotension.   The patient&#39;s medical history included lupus. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) on an unknown date. On an unknown date, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient contracted COVID-19 since an unknown date. They also experienced low blood pressure.  The laboratory investigations included blood pressure performed on an unknown date with result 91/50. The patient was hospitalized on an unknown date and was discharged after two days, date unknown.  Treatment information was not provided.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, COVID-19 and hypotension were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the event of COVID-19. The event of COVID-19 is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.

By the time I sat down, I realized I had no feeling or use from the left side of my body including my face. I also had trouble communicating. Could not form complete sentences. The entire left side of my face was drooping. At that moment my husband immediately called 911.  I was taken to the hospital by ambulance where i was immediately treated and diagnosed with a stroke. They administered TPA. I spent 3 days in the ICU. I have since been treated with blood pressure medication, blood thinners and statins.

                                                At around 9 pm I felt a funny feeling in my lips that made me feel like I might have trouble talking.  It didn&#39;t last long, but my daughter suggested I take my blood pressure.  It registered 177/90 something.  Thought that was unusually high considering we had just been sitting talking for hours after my shot, no exertion at all.  I felt good. We waited 15-20 minutes to check in again.  No nervousness or anything.  It had climbed into the 190/100 range.  My daughter suggested we go to the ER.  I didn&#39;t think it necessary.  After maybe 20 minutes we took it again and it was just over 200/low 100 something.  My daughter said sorry Mom but this is getting very high we are going to ER.  We got there near 11:30 pm I believe.  When we arrived my blood pressure registered 220/116.  Doctors thought I hadn&#39;t taken my blood pressure medication. (wrong, I always take it)  Doctors thought I was nervous about the shot.  (wrong, it had been a very calm afternoon and evening with my adult daughter who is a health care provider.  Tests came back fine.  They had me stay for a little bit but then sent me home with instructions to see my Cardiologist the following week because they felt maybe my blood pressure meds were no longer adequate.  I don&#39;t think they believed that extremely hight BP was from the vaccination, but I absolutely do.  I saw my Cardiologist on Monday. He felt all was fine.  Adjusted the dosage on one blood pressure med but did believe the high BP could have been from vaccination.  On Sunday May 14 I took it easy.  My BP came down slowly by increments of 10 for the systolic throughout the day.  By Monday I was at 140/90 at home.

                                                Felt a bit ill the day of the shot. Tried to help  do dinner later that day and turned white and sweaty and had to sit down for about 15 minutes. The next day injection site began to swell. By the 8th day post injection it was hard to the touch, about the size of a large marshmallow and hard to the touch. No skin discoloration,  but felt warm to touch and very itchy. Used Lanacanevto stop the itch.  Today the 11th, most of swelling is gone and just a little tender to touch. Did not contact anyone medical about this, but a friend said i should report it.

                                                The day after the injection I experienced shortness of breath and a pounding heart, especially going upstairs.  After several days, it became so severe that I had to lie down to catch my breath after climbing stairs or doing anything remotely strenuous.  It would resolve itself after a few minutes of rest.  It continued for 6 days and then stopped on the 7th day.  I felt fine the day of the injection.   I plan to follow up with my primary doctor.  As of now, it appears to be completely resolved but I will not take the second dose for fear of a bad reaction.

Presented to our hospital at 5pm on 2/19 with progression of aforementioned symptoms and found to have left intraparenchymal hemorrhage with midline shift. Her symptoms are currently stable. Our neurosurgical team is not planning any surgical intervention. MRI of her brain demonstrates potential amyloid deposits, which are likely causative.

                                                36 hours later, (approximately), I woke up with a rash. Under the both arms it looked like a sunburn. Across the chest an sides, it was spotty. The right side had more rash than the right, and both sides wrapped around to the back, about 2 inches, on both sides. Less going down the rest of the torso. Took Benadryl, 2-25 mg, 4 hours apart, for a total of 100 mg. 1:00PM, Feb. 26, rash faded significantly.  Also had a dry mouth and a bit of a racing heart, right after being given the vaccination &amp; again when the rashes appeared. However, this could have been anxiety. Both times it went away after walking &amp; deep breathing. Lasted for about 15 minutes each time.

                                                One week after I received the 1st dose of the Moderna  CoVid-19 vaccine, I developed a bright pink, hard, raised area of very itchy rash at the site of the injection. It was about 2&#34;x3&#34; in size, was very warm and painful to the touch. The size increased over the next couple of days to about 3&#34; in diameter but decreased in symptoms (less pain, less itch, less hard, less raised and less warm). I still have the sensitive area today (Saturday, Feb 27, 12:33 pm) but it has continued to decrease in symptoms. The affected area is still about 3&#34; in diameter but has faded in color (now pale pink).

                                                Began not feeling well about 8 hours after my shot. That night I developed a fever (under 100 degrees) and chills. Had some heart palpitations. Next day I still had a slight fever, general malaise, soreness from shot in arm, a few occurances of heart palpitations, sore back. On third day, no fever, but still felt under the weather, with a sore arm plus some hardness in the injection area. Had some palpitations that evening. By the 4th day, felt better in general, but began feeling a very slight numbness on lips and surrounding facial area. Arm still sore with hardness. Better on 5th day. Day 8 &amp; 9 had pains in lower shins. Day 9 I noticed tiny small bumps on upper front and back shoulders and upper arms. They were not hive like and some were itchy. Took some Benadryl that night which didn&#39;t reallly help. Days 10-12 - still have tiny bumps some slightly pink, mostly skin tone, spreading to neck area. Saw my internist on 2/25/21 Day 14 to ask if symptoms related to vaccine shot. He didn&#39;t think the rash was related because it didn&#39;t start away after shot. The continuing ever so slight numbness in lips and surrounding area may be just from anxiety, he said. 3/1/21 - still have occasional slight numbness off and on of lips with &#34;grainy&#34; rash still present.

Fever abated.  24-36 hours after vaccine, I  developed heart palpitations, high heart rate, increased blood pressure Visited primary care doctor and had EKG. Confirmed abnormal EKG, referred to cardiologist. Appointment on 3/4/21. Heart symptoms consistent until two weeks post vaccination, 3/2/21. Heart symptoms seem to be easing.  No previously known heart problem or high blood pressure.

At ~9:45pm, my wife suddenly fell unconscious. Immediate CPR &amp; with Paramedic were not able to revive her. SHE PASSED AWAY at home. We believe it may be triggered by the vaccine.  Did not have a chance to go to hospital or emergency room - it was too sudden. A sad day for us.

I called my primary around 8:15am and was instructed to go to their walk in clinic.  When I got there they took my blood pressure , which was high.  They asked why I didn&#39;t take the Clonidine and I replied I didn&#39;t know.  They proceeded to do a EKG.  The PA came back and informed me that it was different from one that was taken in January. He proceeded to call my heart doctor which wanted to see me at 11. The PA also ordered a ct scan of my head at1:30 that afternoon.  I saw the Heart Doctor around 12 {he was delayed}. They took at least 3 EKG&#39;s while I was waiting for him.  He has ordered a stress test for next Thursday.  The PA has ordered a  carotid artery ultra sound for tuesday.    My blood pressure had been normal for the last three months (I forgot to mention).  Yesterday, the 5th of March I was still dizzy, but not quite as bad.  The pa had ordered Mecizine 25mg for the dizziness.

                                                About 15 minutes after receiving the injection my nose started to itch a little.  It was so minor I was not concerned.  By 40 minutes after the injection when at home I was itching significantly all over my body.  My tongue was red, sore, and swollen.  My mouth and throat were red and sore.  I was having some trouble swallowing and hoarse.  I developed a cough.  I felt very tired and my hands, feet and face were swollen.  Maybe about 50 minutes after the injection, my chest was feeling tight like the start of asthma.  I used a Breo ellipta (100mcg fluticasone furoate and vilanterol 25 mcg inhalation powder.) Maybe 30 minutes later I was breathing better.  As the other symptoms worsened I took benedryl by mouth.I had an epipen, but I did not use it.  I awakened in the night and my joints (hands, knees, feet) were very sore and swollen.  I had a mild headache and lower back ache.  The other symptoms persisted except for the trouble breathing.  The  symptoms have, except the trouble breathing,  continued throughout the day after the vaccination but milder. However the fatigue and joint pain and swollen hands, feet, and face are still moderate.  I am considering taking another benedryl. I sent a non-urgent message today (the day after the vaccination) to my doctor describing what happened and what I did.  We had discussed precautions prior to the vaccinations because of my allergies.

                                                I felt fine after the injection ( approx 10:45 AM) and during the 30 minutes we were asked to wait.  We drove home, stopping to pick up take-out for lunch,  got home and ate.  I was calmly sitting/reading when around 1:30 PM I started to feel my heart beating rapidly.  Using our home monitor, I checked my BP and HR.  (My usual resting values are 130-135/ 75/80  for BP and 80 for HR.)  My reading was 160/90 and 101; 5 minutes later it was 175/105 and 106; 5 minutes later it was 185/122 and 116.  I started to be quite concerned since it seemed to just keep climbing.  I called EMS and they came by to check on me.  As they had me take deep breaths, it began to go down.  But it took several hours to get back to normal values (@ 8:30 PM  it was finally down to 168/79 and 85).  I had the same reaction with the second vaccine on 3/4/21, but it did not last as long.  It again started about 2 1/2 hours after the shot, but was back to normal by 3:30 PM.

Being an ER nurse I went to my hospital and spoke with the charge nurse and got vital signs done.  Other than increase BP I was fine.  I opted not to be seen.  With in less than 30 minutes I was fine.  That night about 11 pm I had fever of 101 chills  and shaking, aching all over.  Lasting most of the night. Next morning I felt better taking Tylenol and Motrin.  The next night fever of about 101 chills and shaking.  Lasting several hours.  Again by morning I was fine,   I am A neg blood type.

                                                spontaneous bleed; bruise on the shin; sore arm; hives; nose bleed; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning a 69 years-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced sore arm, hives, nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin.    The patient&#39;s medical history included Von Willebrand Disease and breast cancer. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 JAN 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 012L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date post-vaccination, the patient experienced a sore arm and some hives. Approximately two weeks after the first dose, the patient experienced a spontaneous bleed resulting in a huge bruise on the shin the size of the palm of their hand. The patient consulted their Hematologist who performed blood work which was perfect. There were no abnormal results. The physician administered DDAVP.  On 09 Feb 2021, the patient experienced their first nose bleed described as &#34;horrific&#34;.  The patient reported they had blood gushing out of their nose and that they bled for four hours. The patient ended up in the hospital emergency department where they were sprayed with DDAVP to stop the bleeding.  Treatment details included DDAVP.  There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the events.  The events, nose bleed and spontaneous bleed were considered not recovered / not resolved.  The outcome of the events sore arm, hives, and bruise on the shin was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and the patient&#39;s history of Von Willebrand Disease, a causal association between the events nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin with mRNA-1273 use is assessed as unlikely.  However, based on temporal association, causality for the events of sore arm and hives cannot be excluded.

                                                1/12 vaccination About 4-5 hours later, I started feeling like I was going to black out; tightness in my chest. Could see little black dots. I pulled over as I was driving. I got off the interstate and was on the phone with my daughter. She told me to call 911, I put my head down and laid down. The ambulance got there, my daughter was there, and they could feel the skipping of beats. My BP was up, my HR was irregular. I still had the tightness in my chest. The medic said I am going to give you some nitro to see if would help with the tightness. I felt like I was going to black out. Arrhythmia was noticed on the monitor; EMT gave me a jolt of  and it immediately stopped the dysrhythmia. Transported to ER, inpatient overnight. Medical team decided I could go home, set up with follow up appt. Put me on a echo, stress test, HR monitor for a month (caught one episode and it lasted 1 hour in the middle of the night).  *i feel better but once in a while I get the lightheadedness and can feel the skipping.

Shortness of breath got worse till I took some prednosone I had, on April 4, 2021 thinking I was having an asthma attack. Helped a few days. Shortness of breath returned on April 9, 2021. On April 10 we went to critical care thinking I was having asthma attack as extremely short of breath! They said it wasnt asthma but sent me to ER as my oxygen levels were low. In ER they took many tests including CAT scan and ultrasound, which resulted in diagnosis of several large bloodclots in both lungs

Not Provided          Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  Because of chemotherapy the patient rescheduled her second shot and so it was delayed. Four days after the second shot she got pressure in the area of her cancer (left lung cancer), it tightened up, she had difficulty in breathing, painful, lot of discomfort, it was like somebody was squeezing her lungs. Few days later (2-3 days) she got really really sick and felt very tired - she was under chemotherapy. This never happened before with the chemotherapy (she has been taking it from several years). Her blood pressure was slightly elevated. Temperature was 100.4F. She felt very unusual and exhausted. All this happened for about for about 4-5 days.  Treatment for the event included acetylsalicylic acid.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Hypoxia. Concurrent medical conditions included Pulmonary hypertension (Reporter states: Pulmonologists disagree about this diagnosis) since May 2019 and Sleep apnea since March 2019. Concomitant products included LORATADINE for Allergy, VITAMIN D3 and CYANOCOBALAMIN (VITAMIN B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]) for Deficiency vitamin.   On 05-Feb-2021 at 10:30 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 05-Mar-2021 at 10:30 AM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 05-Mar-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced PAIN IN EXTREMITY (mild arm pain). On 07-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HYPOXIA (my oxygen saturation again plummeted/getting difficult to maintain my oxygen level during the day) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (minimal pericardial effusion) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, HYPOXIA (my oxygen saturation again plummeted/getting difficult to maintain my oxygen level during the day) and PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (minimal pericardial effusion) had not resolved and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (mild arm pain) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 07-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Low. On 17-Apr-2021, Brain natriuretic peptide: 1064 (High) &#34;nearly 10 times the normal limit and is a strong indicator of heart failure&#34;. On 29-Apr-2021, Computerised tomogram thorax: abnormal (abnormal) minimal pericardial effusion.         Reporter states: I was diagnosed two years ago with sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxia and have used a CPAP device with oxygen every night since. Following the first dose of the vaccine, my oxygen level was so low that I had to go onto daytime supplemental oxygen for the first time. After the second dose of the vaccine, my oxygen saturation again plummeted. I have been on 3-4 L of daytime supplemental oxygen ever since. It is getting difficult to maintain my oxygen level during the day even with supplemental oxygen. The cardiologist has ordered an echocardiogram for May 7, 2021. That should help determine if my breathing difficulties are due to a sudden worsening of pulmonary hypertension, or if this could be related to the vaccines.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination on Saturday January 16th 2021 at approximately 12pm. She completed all necessary screening forms and was deemed to be at low risk for serious allergic reactions. She tolerated the vaccination well, and no complications or immediate adverse events occurred. She was observed for a full 15 mins per CDPHE/CDC guidelines and left the Clinic in stable condition after her observation period was complete. On the morning of Tuesday, January 19th, 2021, the patient was found unconscious and unresponsive by her husband. She was transferred by Ambulance to Hospital shortly thereafter. She was diagnosed with a brain bleed that was determined to be inoperable. She was transferred to other Hospital for higher level care. She was seen by neurosurgery and diagnosed with a ruptured aneurysm. She was treated in the ICU for 24 hours, at which point her team determined that the severity of her brain bleed would not respond to treatment. Supportive cares were withdrawn on Wednesday Jan 20th, and she passed away shortly thereafter.

                                                After receiving the injection, I was directed by an RN to sit in a chair for 15min in the same room. Five minutes after the injection I felt my upper back  muscles, ribcage area, contract.  The contraction continued around to the front of my chest with next 3 minutes.  I felt tightness with each breath.  The RN who gave me the injection came to see if I felt alright. She informed the charge nurse that my chest felt tight and the charge nurse came to ask me questions.  The charge nurse called the hospital pharmacist to come to see me.  The pharmacist arrived with various medications and talked to me.  He instructed me to do breathing exercises and meditate.  I told him that I was familiar with these techniques and using them.  I also informed the pharmacist that I had a heart attack in 2018 and had atrial tachycardia but I wasn&#39;t feeling any problems with my heart, that it was beating normally.  I also informed the pharmacist of my severe allergies to certain items but I wasn&#39;t experiencing any anaphylaxis that I&#39;ve experienced in past allergic episodes.  The pharmacist left and told the charge nurse to keep me a half hour longer under observation and to call him if I felt worse.  During that half hour, the muscle contractions stopped and I was able to breathe normally.  The charge nurse asked me if I was ready to leave after the half hour was up, I told her I was feeling odd so she said to stay another 20min.   I began to experience intestinal cramping and asked to leave to go to the bathroom.  In the bathroom I had a bout of diarreah that lasted 10minutes.  After that I drove home but was experiencing a headache that started.   The headache lasted for 20hrs. It felt like I was wearing tight hat, squeezing.  Iv&#39;e not had that type of headache before.  My right arm site of injection feels a little warm and is pink but isn&#39;t painful.

Considered going to ER. 13 hours post-vaccination normal BP and HR. Day 2 BP and HR normal. Day 3 BP very high 162/89, HR normal. Day 4 BP and HR normal, no headache, no fatigue. Normal since. Been taking BP/HR daily for last 3 months. Normal for me is 135/75 BP, 80 HR. Have not had heart palpitations in very long time prior to this vaccination. Contacted  doctor and was strongly advised not to get second dose of Moderna due to probable allergic reaction. No other allergic symptoms to the vaccination.

It was 184/125 and my heart rate was through the roof. I think it was around 135. I was pale and felt funny!   After around 15 minutes I felt better. My heart rate and bp started coming down but the emt&#39;s advised me to go by ambulance to the ER and be checked out. I was fine once I got to the ER. they did a 12 lead EKG and I waited three hours to see a doctor who discharged me and advised against getting the second dose of the vaccine.

At about 1;30 PM on 2-12-21 I became severely dizzy, very high heart rate (115-120- heart rate was irregular), nauseated and experienced chest tightness.  Moderate shortness of breath.  I was unable to walk unassisted due to dizziness.  This lasted about 3 hours.  When I awoke on 2-13-12 the dizziness and shortness of breath was gone.  I experienced mild flu-like symptoms on 2-13-21 (general achiness, tiredness, slight fever - 99degrees- mild headache).  Symptoms were treated with Tylenol and had subsided by 2-14-12.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up at 2:15 a.m. feeling pains in my chest middle and extending through to my upper back.  The pain encompassed the span of my upper chest and back from one arm to the other.  I experienced very rapid heartbeats that I could feel throbbing from my head to my chest.  I was hesitant to move or rise from my bed because of the pain.  At 3:40 I called 911.  They did an EKG and I was told that my heart was fine.  My blood pressure was 180/90.  I chose not to go to the hospital but to call my doctor when his office opened up at 9:00 a.m. in approximately 5 hours.  My doctor had me come into his office.  I had another EKG which was fine and he sent me to have a Cat Scan. the same day which was also fine.  My doctor spoke to me and said that he felt that this was due to side effects of the vaccine.  I doubled up on my Acid Reflux medicine, taking 80 mg daily for  four days through Monday 2/22/2021.  I could not sleep well for three days after the vaccine experiencing pain in my chest and could not breathe deeply without feeling it.  Then I steadily improved and today I can take deep breaths with little pain.  I also experienced muscle pain in my left shoulder and neck but used Mineral Ice on my neck and was relieved in one day.

                                                I had no reaction after the first dose. However about 24 hours after the second dose my blood glucose levels remained elevated for about 48 hours, regardless of how much insulin I administered both via my pump (increasing basal and bolus rates) and MDI. The levels remained in the mid to upper 200s. With an average A1c in the high 5s and low 6s, this was unusual for me.

As day progressed felt discomfort, site began to get itchy. In evening checked and blotches became one mass, swollen, very warm to touch. Called pharmacy, they never heard of delayed reaction said take benedryl and call primary dr in morning. Went to pharmacy, the pharmacist looked at it and felt it, also never saw delayed reaction, gave same instructions. Sent picture to primary, did video call today, 99.7 temp, elevated BP and pulse. She saw picture, close up on screen, concerned one spot darker might be cellulitis, need to watch, take benedryl, call if changes, report to CDC

                                                symptoms since her dose of Covid Moderna vaccine on Jan the 25th.  In the first 1-2 days she had the usual soreness at the injection site but nothing else. Then, about a week after it, her arm in the area of the injection site gradually became red and warm and indurated slightly without pain About the same time she noted a sense of fatigue and feverishness. Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .  Other symptoms she is complaining of bilateral lateral hip pain. She feels quite achy. She believes this started since the vaccine dose I believe she may have had some complaints prior to it. No joint complaints, no upper extremity symptoms other than as above. No HA, ST. She has had what she describes as &#34;spasms in her chest&#34;) which has improved but presented about the same time as the arm and temperature did. No Gi symptoms. Her activity has not been curtailed. Neck pain bilat was noted starting the end of December without other symptoms and wo any hx of trauma and did not feel like a typical wry neck.    No travel other than for the vaccine, to the grocery store and rarely to another shop. No exposures to anyone other than our grandchildren, son and dau-in-law who are in our &#34;bubble&#34; (the granddaughter attends an out door preschool where they all wear masks and have had no covid cases.Patient walks weekly out doors with a friend. She sees her mother who at 96 resides at home and sees no one.  She had a NP swab for Covid PCR test yesterday (the 17th) which is reported this am as &#34;undetected&#34;.  An evaluation with Doctor led to blood work showing wbc 9.2, hgb 11, plt 546k, ESR 74, CRP 67 a diagnosis of PMR was tentatively made and she was started on prednisone 15 mg /d.  Improvement was seen at 24 hours and persisted. Neck pain is 80% better as well.  Questions: Did the vaccine play a role in exacerbating a preceeding condition of PMR? If the neck pain is a red herring, did the vaccine cause PMR?

I experience shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness.  My left upper quadrant is sore from the  Moderna vaccine.  It appears to be spreading circular to the size of a quarter to about the size of a fifty-cent piece.  I had gone to sleep.  I contacted the veteran 24 hour nurse, my best friend, and my brother to tell them my health status.  I had eaten dinner, taken a Tylenol, and went back to sleep before brushing my teeth.

                                                Woke up at my usual time the day after vaccine. Felt a little warm but not feverish and did not take my temperature. After walking to kitchen to let cat in from garage I stopped at the nearby kitchen sink and began to shake ( I believe just my upper body). I had to grab onto sink to steady myself. Shaking was only seconds long.  Then I must have fainted as I awoke (quickly) on the floor  alongside the cupboards and sliding glass door.  I laid there conscious about 15 minutes till I felt confident I could get up on my own.  As result of fall I bit upper and lower lip on right (no blood just skin injured), must have clenched my teeth because my left posterior teeth were sensitive to cold and I injured my right ankle. After I got up and realized my ankle hurt with pressure I put on a support knee high to control swelling.  Injury seemed to be focused on the ankle bone. I applied ice for recommended 20 on 20 off protocol for most of both 2/25 and 2/26, elevated and took OTC Aleve as directed on package.  Bruising observed from heel, behind ankle bone and front of ankle.   Called PCP, she recommended continue as I have and she will contact me tomorrow, March 1

Pharmacist let me stay until I felt I could drive.  I came home and took Tylenol for headache.  5 hrs later I felt extremely ill with joint pain , fever , dizziness.  Vomiting occured during the night along with fainting.  Next morning drank tea, no food. Slept all day until 5pm.  Slept through night.  Sun. still had extreme joint pain and headache.  Was able to eat a light meal. Today I ate normally, went to physical therapy with a reduced routine.  I still have a headache as of Mon. night. I know these seem like Normal side effects, but these were like having the worst Flu ever.

I checked my blood pressure &amp; it was 199/105,   10 minutes later 197/101. I went to ER arriving at 10 am.  Had EKG, blood work, chest xray, covid quick test.  All ok. BP stayed very high until 12:30 pm then started to go down.  After about an hour bp went back up to 188/99.  I was given a pill to lower pressure but it didn&#39;t  lower.  Finally given a dose of metroprolol &amp; pressure went down. Was released from ER at 3:45 pm.   Today, 3/1/2021 BP is still high,  166/87.   Went to cardiologist 3/1/2021, was told they were having these type issues lately.  No problem with EKG, blood work.  Gave me another BP pill to try for 2 weeks to try lower BP.

                                                About 12 hours after receiving the shot, my wife woke up to severe chills and shaking (with teeth chattering).  She advised that she couldn&#39;t even pick up and put on her glasses.  She woke me and I was able to provide her a heating pad that over about 15 minutes reduced the shivering and chills. Her face was so pale that her freckles literally disappeared.  I was ready to call 9-1-1, but she asked me not to (because they would not have let me go with her).  So, I monitored her and gave her two Tylenols.  For the ensuing 24 hours, she ran a 100-degree fever, had slight chills, and took Tylenol tablets periodcially.

After a few more minutes we tried to sit her up again, she had another syncopal episode, again non-responsive.  We called for EMT transport to the hospital.

                                                On 3/4/21, @ 2:pm, I had a very severe pain between  my shoulder blades that took my breath away, that radiating to the front of my check. I put an aspirin under my tongue, walked around and had some water. Pain kept getting worse. My husband drove me to the ED got there at 4pm. They took blood, did chest x-ray, ekgs. Blood work showed my Troponin level @ .11 and later elevated to 2.1. My blood pressure was 215/99, temp 97.  I started having pain in my right shoulder &amp; right wrist.  I was diagnosed with a slight heart attack. On Friday, 3/5/21, facility did an angiogram, which showed my arteries were clear, no blockage or plaque, no heart damage. Did show it appeared the arteries had gone into a spasm which may have caused the heart attack.  I saw my primary Dr on Monday, 3/8/21, and she said I have no history of heart problems, no high cholesterol, etc. I asked her if this could be a side effect of my vaccine. Dr. said it was a good question &amp; she didn&#39;t know the answer, since not all the research has been done. She suggested I submit my question to VAERS!  I&#39;m now taking  Aspirin 81 mg, daily, Bisoprolol 5 mg Tab, Losartan 25 mg Tab, DOK 100 mg Cap.

Hands, fingers took 10 days to return to normal.  All in all 14 days to recover completely from 2nd Moderna Covid shot.

I began to feel as though I was going to vomit so walked slowly to the toilet, knelt in front, then made a quarter turn,, thinking  this would not happen, and I fainted/blacked out.  I found myself face down in front of toilet and a good bump on my right eyebrow....face turned inward. I stayed still long enough to feel safe to rise and so did.  No  more sense of vomiting, thank goodness.  Just  very very tired.  I did make oatmeal with blueberies for breakfast and ate this slowly.  Just wanted to ask if this is to be expected.  It is now four hours fifteen minutes since this happened.  As I walk carefully ,  I am trusting all will be well ...but when?

There was constant coughing and gasping for air, a tightness in my chest.  I went online to see if there were any other people who had experienced this, and the literature was saying the problems with breathing usually start within a few hours, but mine took longer and I know it was related to the vaccine.  I was given  an ADVAIR inhaler which did nothing to alleviate the symptoms, so then had 3 weeks of prednisone, to the point i did not want to go for the second dose, but my doctor talked me into it as I have so many pre-existing conditions.  I had no problem at all with the second dose and am now off the prednisone and the advair

I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

Since that date we have struggled to maintain her blood pressure over a systolic of 100.  She frequently runs 75/55 sitting down.  She is not orthostatic.  Resting P has increased from 80 to 95.  She is currently taking Droxidopa 400mg tid prn and Midodrine 10mg prn.  Additionally, when these do not raise her systolic to 100, she takes 100 Hydrocortisone.  The presumed diagnosis is dysautonomia, and she has been referred to a specialty center.

                                                Patient suffered cardiac arrest two days  (on 3/5) following first dose Moderna Vaccine at Rite Aid Pharmacy (3/3).  The following is the Discharge Summary From 3/26.    Resident Attestation: I personally saw and examined the patient on rounds with my cariology resident team on the day of the resident&#39;s note. Management was discussed with the cardiology resident and I supervised the plan of care. I have reviewed and agree with the key parts of the resident evaluation including:  Subjective information Objective findings on physical exam Impression and plan Gen: appears comfortable, sitting in bed Resp: clear. no wheezes, rhonchi, rales CV: normal rate, regular, no m/r/g Abd: soft, nt/nd Ext: warm, no edema. Pressure ulcer boots on. Pleasant 70-year-old woman who had a history of PVCs, left bundle branch block, and a mild nonischemic cardiomyopathy, came into the hospital following a VT/VF cardiac arrest. Her echocardiogram done while in the hospital showed a preserved ejection fraction. Her cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. She had implantation of an ICD. Hospital course has been complicated by watershed cerebral infarcts. In addition, she had an episode of C. difficile colitis. She has gradually improved over the course of the past 3 weeks. From a cardiovascular perspective, she is being discharged on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and her home atorvastatin. With regards to her etiology of cardiac arrest, I would be suspicious about the possibility of sarcoidosis. However, we were not able to get a cardiac MR while she was inpatient due to her strokes and inability to consistently follow commands and hold her breath. Would recommend consideration of an outpatient PET. She is ready to discharge to subacute rehab today. I have spent greater than 30 minutes in discharge planning.  Primary Discharge Diagnosis VT/VF cardiac arrest, s/p therapeutic hypothermia S/p AICD placement 3/16/2021 Secondary Discharge Diagnoses Anoxic brain injury, recovering, with persistent aphasia and dysphagia C. difficile colitis Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, resolved DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness 70 y.o. female, with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted on 3/5/2021 after out of hospital VT/VF cardiac arrest. She completed therapeutic hypothermia protocol. Cardiac catheterization did not show any significant obstructive coronary disease. TTE showed LVEF 55%. Patient underwent AICD placement on 3/16/2021. Had some recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia afterward, which resolved after increasing her carvedilol doses. Her course was complicated by a C. difficile infection, treated with PO Vancomycin, with significant improvement in diarrhea. She has had gradual neurologic recovery. Neurology felt she had had several watershed infarcts, but felt that she would continue to have a prolonged recovery over the next few months. Had some recovery of language/cognition prior to discharge. Due to her waxing/waning encephalopathy, she did not qualify for inpatient rehab, but will be discharged to subacute rehab. Discharged with tube feeding continued, though she can begin sips with speech therapy supervision. Patient seen and examined at bedside on the day of discharge. She stated that she had no pain, though HPI/ROS still limited due to aphasia. Discussed above information with patient&#39;s husband, who understood and was in agreement with the plan.  Problem-Based Hospital Course NEURO Acute metabolic encephalopathy, with gradual recovery -Due to neurologic injury from cardiac arrest. -Neurology consult: concern for anoxic brain injury with watershed infarcts, anticipate very gradual recovery over the coming months. No acute process on imaging. -Patient extubated on 3/11, following some commands. Continuing to regain conversational ability and motor function gradually each day. Has some waxing and waning of mental status, but overall her encephalopathy  continues to improve. -Limit centrally acting/sedating medications -Speech following for language/cognition as well as dysphagia requiring tube feeding. Can begin some sips in addition to tube feeds. -Continue tube feeds via Dobbhoff tube per instructions provided on after visit summary INFECTIOUS DISEASE C. Difficile Colitis: -C.Diff Positive 3/18. Continue 125 mg PO Vancomycin Q6H for 10 days (3/18 - 3/27), confirmed with infectious disease -Frequency of diarrhea has decreased significantly, was stable after rectal tube removed 2-3 days prior to discharge Pneumonia, likely due to aspiration, resolved -s/p 5 day course ceftriaxone (3/5 - 3/9 ) -CTA on admission showed significant RUL and RLL consolidation with air bronchograms, as well as some patchy airspace disease in LUL -Had copious tan sputum on suctioning 3/7 - respiratory culture negative CARDIOLOGY Out of hospital cardiac arrest, likely VT/VF -Pt&#39;s husband initiated chest compressions x 10 minutes, until police/fire dept arrival, when AED showed a shockable rhythm. Likely VT/VF arrest. -S/p therapeutic hypothermia protocol. -Troponin peaked at 1.09 -3/16 Successful single chamber ICD implantation Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), resolved Chronic left bundle branch block -Has had multiple episodes of NSVT noted on telemetry 3/19 - 3/20 -s/p ICD as above -Increased dose of Carvedilol to 25 mg BID with resolution of NSVT  History of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 55% -Echo in 11/2019 demonstrated EF 42% (nadir). -TTE on admission showed recovered EF to 55%, mild concentric LVH, normal RV systolic function, no valvular abnormalities -Was initially started on aspirin/statin due to high suspicion for CAD, but as cardiac cath 3/15 was unremarkable, these medications were discontinued. -3/16 Successful single chamber ICD implantation Hypertension -Blood pressure now improved after restarting home lisinopril and initiating carvedilol -HCTZ discontinued as BP now well controlled on above regimen  RENAL Oliguria, resolved -Pt initially had low urine output since admission, improved to 0.5 cc/kg/hr on 3/9.

The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart.

The patient was slurring her words and fell into a deep sleep.  It took three individuals to wake her up.  The patient wondered if she passed out.  She felt tingly in her upper right arm and it felt like her equilibrium was off, and legs were heavy.  The patient was very fatigued.    Treatments of these events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, passing out, unsteadiness, slurring words, fell into a deep sleep, tingly feeling in her upper right arm, felt like equilibrium was off, legs felt heavy and fatigue, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71 year old female subject, with history of epilepsy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness after first dose of mRNA1273 (Lot# unknown).

She went to the ER 02/21/21, which they did a lot of testing, and everything was fine.  They did not know if it was due to the virus.  She saw her PCP today 2/24/21 and she said that it could be from the vaccine, but again not sure.  She called the health dept and told them that she was canceling her appointment and advised that she call us to report the incident.   She has also had pressure in her chest, generally overall not feeling well over the last 3 days.

She then waited in the immediate vicinity for 30 minutes due to an anaphylactic reaction to shellfish in the past.  She felt fine and went grocery shopping after the 30 minute wait. Shortly after 4:30pm pt. was in the check out lane and began feeling light headed.  She sat down and store staff immediately phoned 911.  Pharmacist was notified and went to the scene. Patient was conscious, coherent, pale, cool and clammy feeling, with normal respiration.  She had a strong pulse, BP 110/64. EMS arrived within 10 minutes and took over. Blood sugar was checked as patient stated she had not eaten since earlier that morning - it was 127.  EMT told pharmacist that the patient refused further medical treatment and was released from their care.

                                                Vaccine may have caused flare in Graves Disease symptoms.  4 days after the vaccination, I started having heart palpitations.  6 days after the vaccination, I started having double vision in the morning.  I have never had heart palpitations from Graves before, although it is a common problem with it I have not had double vision since my eye surgery 5 years ago.  Am wondering whether to proceed with second dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                On  1/29, my vision blurred and I could not read the computer e-mails and there were wavy lines in my peripheral left side vision.  My blood pressure sky rocketed to 190/82 and I am always in the 120s over 70s or so.  I went to the ER where I was given an EKG, a head CT scan, blood work was also done.  Next day I had an MRI of my head.  All was done to rule out a TIA.    Final diagnosis was probably an Ocular Migraine which I have never had.  I followed up with an eye doctor who said my eyes were fine.    Whether this was coincidental or a reaction to the Covid shot, no one could tell me.  I felt fine next day and have not had any other ocular migraines.

She is now having incontinence issues after the vaccine as well, is on medication that was working just fine prior. Pt now has swelling, redness, and blood vessel flare ups in her left ankle that hasn&#39;t occurred in a long time. Feels like the vaccine has exasperated some of her medical conditions.

                                                Patient was seated for approximately 10 minutes post-vaccination when she alerted the technician that she was not feeling well. I approached patient and asked her to describe her symptoms. She reported feeling &#34;weird&#34; near and around her mouth. Her heart was racing and she was feeling very anxious - similar to the sensation of a panic attack which she has a history of experiencing. I took her blood pressure and it was reported at 197/120. Due to the high blood pressure and signs of potential allergic reaction I called 911 immediately. Medical services arrived and provided medical care and took her to nearest hospital. The only known thing to have been provided to the patient was an injectable diphenhydramine and EMS did report that she was getting a rash on her stomach by the time they arrived and decided to transport her.

Patient was being treated with antibiotics  for a tooth infection and asked if there were any problems with getting the shot.  The vaccinator explained there was no interaction or contraindication.  Patient consented to vaccine and was reminded of possible side effects.  Within under a minute she complained of heart racing, redness on throat and back of neck.  Patient was able to speak, never lost consciousness and answered questions appropriately.  911 was called when patient continued complaining of rapid heart rate and pain in her right arm, not the arm she received the vaccine.  Vaccinator supported patient while sitting until EMT arrived, then she was transported to Hospital for assessment.

Also, reports she&#39;s had a nonproductive cough for several days. Yesterday, her breathing just sufficiently severe that she could not walk through the house without stopping to catch her breath. No chest pain. She ultimately decided to summon EMS. They reported that her initial SaO2 values to be in the low to mid 80% range. She was placed on 2 L/min of supplemental oxygen and given a SABA updraft in route.  When she arrived at the ED, her SaO2 registered 92%. She denies any prior history of asthma or COPD.

Took Tylenol which did not improve any symptoms.  Got headache and had that with the arm in the pain all night long.  Woke up totally drenched by sweating, and went to the bathroom and felt dizzy yelled for her husband and passed out, and her husband caught her while passing out and woke up on the floor.  On the Thursday she was in her recliner the entire day, had nausea, fever, chills, headache, continued with the pain of the arm in a vice, which lasted all day long.  Her husband forced crackers and water down her as she had no appetite either for 3 days.   She felt so fatigued and her head was not clear.  She slowly gradually improved, and yesterday 3/18/21 she feels her head fogginess has improved, and her arm is gone as she has been exercising with a band.  It is a little sore but otherwise fine.  The excruciating pain lasted for 2 full days.   She put some Lidocaine and it possibly helped.  She called her doctor and they told her to exercise the arm, and to take more Tylenol, which she had tried which did not improve anything.

March 7th right hand went numb again and had vision problems with right eye, cleared up in about 15 minutes.  March 9th right hand and right side of face went numb.  Went to hospital and was examined and told I was having a stroke.  I was admitted to hospital for two days.  MRI showed that I had a stroke and now have some brain tissue damage.  I and now going to occupational therapy to regain use of right hand.  The Doctors thought that it was pretty coincidental that my first stroke symptom (transient numb right hand on the 6th) started just a couple days after I got the second dose of the moderna vaccine.

                                                I felt fine at first and it lasted until I stared coughing Saturday (1/16), I thought it was just post-nasal drip. By Monday (1/18), I had a really bad sore throat, chills and a fever. I had a fever for 26 solid days. My lung capacity was 98-99% the entire time. On Wednesday (1/20), I contacted my doctor and he had me to come in to get tested for COVID. The next day, I got my results and they were positive. It got worse from there and I was admitted to the hospital due to my sodium being low. I was also losing a lot of weight. I was hospitalized for 3 days in order for them to get my sodium up. I also had burning and tingling on the sole of my feet, which they attributed to my lack of sodium. My symptoms lasted for weeks. I have a lot of congestion, but they can&#39;t seem to locate the source. I&#39;m also having issues with my BP, which just started to decrease on 3/21. I was also diagnosed as anemic, which I&#39;ve never had an issue with. I also have a hard time concentrating. I also have spine issues, so I&#39;m not sure if my knee pain is from that or the COVID.

                                                On March 6, I woke up feeling like I had a Charlie horse in my left calf. I tried to walk and it was sore but I felt it would go away in a day or two. By Wednesday, March 10, I called my doctor and after telling them my left calf hurt , they had me come right in. After seeing dr  I was sent to get a sonogram immediately  and was told I had a blood clot  inside my  left knee. I was sent back to Dr and was given Xerelto 15 mg twice a day for 21 days and the 20 mg once a day until gone.  Today,, it is still sore. I am asking if I should take my second shot on March 29 or not.

                                                I estimate the date reaction began. But around that time I began having high blood pressure even though I was on 10mg of Lisinopril. Still ongoing now even though my doctor doubled the lisinopril, and last week changed med to Losarton 50 mg. Now this week this  is doubled to 100 mg. I never had this much high bp before. Maybe it was the Moderna. I do not know what has caused it.

I also had ringing in my ears. I felt like I was going to pass out. It scared me.  I put on my brakes and started to pull over but by the time I started to pull over, the dizziness was slowly starting to clear up.  I had a &#34;foggy&#34; feeling in my head for about a half hour after so I went to my friend&#39;s house and sat down and drank some water. Then I went home.  I have had no incidents since then.

                                                Thrombocytopenia/lowplatelet; A spontaneous report was received from a caregiver concerning a 72-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced thrombocytopenia/low platelet count.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 18 Jan 2021 at 04:00 pm, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 19 Jan 2021, the patient was hospitalized for thrombocytopenia/low platelet count, the patient was in emergency room and was given a strong dose of steroid. Her body did not react to it and she was then given a platelet transfusion. The doctors have given her steroids, immunoglobulin and aminocaproic acid during the hospitalization. They were discussing the next steps of therapy and plan to try rituximab.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the event thrombocytopenia/low platelet count was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 72-year-old, female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of thrombocytopenia. This event occurred 2 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # unknown. Treatment included steroids, platelet transfusion, immunoglobulin, Amicar and pending treatment with Rituximab. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the event a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I stopped and took a Benedryl capsule and turned around and returned to the health facility. The nurses watched me for another 45 minutes during which time nothing else occured. My blood pressure was slightly depressed but not too much. It was 98/ 76 when normal for me with medication is 116- 128 over about 86=92.  I took another Benedryl when I was close to home. The burning continued but did not progress into swelling. It did feel as if I had sores in my mouth that night but they were gone in the a.m.  I felt like my tongue had been burned by much too hot food and/or beverage.

                                                I found her unresponsive in her room, she had some white stuff on her mouth. I called 911. while waiting I placed ice on the back of her neck and she began to respond, as she began to become more responsive she defecate all over herself. I checked her blood sugar it was 159.  The ambulance arrived, they checked her vitals said they were ok, they gave me the option of monitoring her at home or going to the ER. I chose to monitor her at home. Monday all day she still had a fever complaining of headache, joint pain and pain in the arm she received the vaccine, at times she became very delirious, nothing she said made sense. . Her doctor said she had a seizure and offer to place her on seizure medication. I gave her two  500mg Tylenol   she has an appointment on March 7th for the second dose but I am afraid to give her the second dose.

                                                Upon awakening the next day, I began to have extremely painful deep chest spasms starting in outer right side ribs and quickly radiating under breast and up into nipple. Happened in a succession of maybe 2-3 spasms then stopped. Occurred maybe 6 times over the course of about 5 hours, then totally stopped around the 24 hour mark of the injection.

I visited his office at 2:00 pm. He ran an EKG. It was normal so gave me a prescription for a beta blocker. After taking that, my heart rate returned to normal. I also had a slight fever, body aches &amp; headache.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 21 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 043L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021, after vaccine administration, the patient experienced injection site reaction.  On 22 Jan 2021, she was feeling achy.   On 23 Jan 2021, she had nerve pain that felt like cutting on the back, legs, and arms.  On 24 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s muscles were weak and were not working or responsive on both sides.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient could not control her left hand and weakness was more predominant on left side. The patient went to the doctor and was hospitalized with minor stroke for 24 hours. The patient stated that she was still experiencing terrible pain in neck and lower back.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, minor stroke, weak muscles, nerve pain, injection site reaction, and achy, was unknown. The outcome of event, terrible pain in neck and lower back, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and evidence of a temporal association between mRNA-1273 use and the onset of injection site reaction and achy, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. There is limited information to asses causality for the events of injection site reaction, and achy.  Additional information has been requested.

                                                48 hours after my first vaccine I started having a vaginal discharge that appeared the color of milky tea. No obvious bleeding, no cramps, no itching, no odor, no rash or other symptom. It required me to change a panti-liner 6-7 times qd for seven days. Sometimes it was absorbed by the pad, sometimes it appeared to be like jelly.   At the same time I started to feel symptoms of a cold; chest pressure, increased fatigue, mild headache, joint discomfort. Oral temp was 100.2 F. usual is 96.4-97.6F.  Later I woke with a night sweat, my body and the sheets were soaked but I was too tired to change them. The next morning I felt fine. Only the vaginal discharge continued unchanged for one week.  Hx complete hysterectomy.

Went to the bathroom, urinated, took Tylenol and went back to bed. Woke again at 2:00 a.m, still chilled, and tried to stand up and my legs wouldn&#39;t hold me. I managed to lift myself to my feet and clutching furniture get to the bathroom, with complete loss of bladder control on the way. Took more Tyleonol, drank more water, put on clean pajamas but couldn&#39;t lift my knees to step into them, had to put them on the floor and pull them up. Went to sleep eventually. When I woke at about 5 a.m., all was completely normal. No fever, legs fine, usual bladder control.

I called 911 and EMTs checked my vitals &amp; recommended I go to ER.  My husband drove me to hospital. But we waited in the car and I did breathing and husband massaged my neck until my BP and pulse were a bit lower.  We went home as I did not want to go into ER.  The next day, BP and pulse still high, so I called Nurse Line who said to take antihistamine &amp; pain med to lower slight fever.  Today, my BP is  down to 95/58 but pulse is a little elevated at 97

I called the nurse and she had the attending Dr come to me. Dr checked my airway and said it looks beautiful but wanted me to go next door to the ED. We walked over and checked in. I think my BP was 180/100 and elevated heart rate. Nurse took me to examine room. Dr listened to my heart, checked for rash and looked in my mouth. O2 sat was constant between 96-99%. Heart rate was elevated. Right side of face was a little more  flushed than left side. Sensation continued to subside and was gone within the 90 minutes the Dr wanted to contain me. BP was down and HR lower when we left the ED, but not my normal BP No other events. Arm  sore at site of injection.

A moment or two later I began to experience extremely rapid heartbeat.  The rapid heartbeat began to subside after I received medical attention but took several hours to subside completely.  The facial prickling sensation took at least 6 hours to subside.  I also had the arm pain that I know is common, and that took 48 hours to subside.

                                                Blood clot on right lung; soreness in arm; A spontaneous report was received from  a 72 year old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced blood clot on right lung  (pulmonary embolism) and myalgia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient had family history of blood clot (mother and brother). No concomitant product use was reported.  On 02-Feb-2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient had soreness in the right arm which subsided couple of days later. The patient also experienced shortness of breath for a week after vaccine administration. On 17-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and underwent COVID-19 virus test, the results of which were negative. On 17-Feb-2021, the computerized tomography scan on chest showed moderate size blood clot on right lung. On 18-Feb-2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital on recommendation to initiate and continue lifetime treatment with Eliquis (apixaban, 5mg every 12 hours). According to the physician, moderate size blood clot on right lung of the patient could be attributed to the genetic history (patient&#39;s mother and brother also had blood clot). The patient also followed up with primary care physician, who informed that it was genetic and not related to vaccine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism was unknown. The outcome of the event, myalgia was considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient was taken to the ER (emergency room) where an EKG (electrocardiogram) was performed. A few moments after the EKG, the patient had a heart attack. The cardiologist suspected the patient may have had a heart attack two days earlier because her cardiac enzymes were too high to be a result of a recent heart attack. The patient was admitted to the hospital from 28-JAN-2021 until 01-FEB-2021. Catheterization and stent placement were performed. Treatment medications included acetaminophen, clopidogrel, metoprolol, low-dose aspirin, and atorvastatin.

The outcome of the event, fatigue, was not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                She got the vaccine, and they asked her to stay for the 15 minutes and she was fine, but when she went out onto the street she started to have a few seconds of feeling faint but did not.  That feeling passed and was able to walk home and was getting vertigo.  She had a sore arm the next day, very fatigued and exhaustion.  Three days later had redness appear on the arm and then had headaches, and insomnia that night.  Her eyes were burning as well.  A day later had irregular heart beat and then six days later had the red line, raised in a circle that lasted one day.  She then continued to have the itching and then became a rash which was traveling under arm and onto her chest.  She then went to the city UC and was spreading to her breast, and started to subside.  Since then she has been having on and off headaches, on and off itching of both of her arms, as well as her scalp and other parts of her body.   As  a child had a history of hives.  When she went to the UC they did an EKG due to the irregular heart beat and did not want to go to the ER during the pandemic.  He gave her one Benadryl and 3 Ibuprofen which she only took one of, as she has a lot of allergies.  She has been taking Zyrtec 5 mg for the itching when she has it, which works for her.  The symptoms are subsiding, and has transient rashes on the vaccine arm, and on the right arm still have a few areas and still itching on and off.

It took longer for the heart to suction up the blood before each heartbeat and I could feel a beat or a thud after each succioning up of the blood. The sequence felt like: slow suctioning, then a pounding; slow succioning followed by a pounding, etc. I also felt a frequent fluttering of the heart.   The rash on the arm has turned to redness. The swelling and hardness are still there. The feet are still red and swollen and I can feel the enlarged, hard lymph glands. I&#39;m still lethargic and sleep throughout the day. The heart problems only began to subside this afternoon.  Because of the above symptoms (and other symptoms I cannot directly connect to the injection, but that occurred at the same time), I am afraid to get the second injection.

                                                Shortness of breath, cough onset Sunday April 4th.  DATE OF SERVICE: 04.06.2021   CT ANGIOGRAPHY, CHEST (CPT=71275); PULMONARY EMBOLUS PROTOCOL; 3-D RECONSTRUCTION  CLINICAL INDICATION: SOB (shortness of breath)  COMPARISON STUDY: 10/9/2020  TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest were performed during dynamic contrast enhancement for the  optimization of the opacification of the pulmonary arteries, following IV administration of 80 mL of  Isovue 370. Three-dimensional reformation into the coronal plane was performed.  Automated exposure control and ALARA manual techniques for patient specific dose reduction were  followed while maintaining the necessary diagnostic image quality.  ADVERSE REACTION: None  FINDINGS:  PULMONARY ARTERIES: There is a large filling defect within the right interlobar artery, extending  into the lobar, segmental, and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe. There is expansion of  the right interlobar artery by this thrombus. Small filling defect is noted within the distal left  main pulmonary artery, with some extension to the left upper lobe and left lower lobe lobar  segments.  HEART AND VASCULATURE: The heart is normal size. No pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of  right heart strain.  MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:  Heterogeneous densities are seen in the right lower lobe, new since the prior  exam. Scarring is noted in the superior segment of the right lower lobe as well as in the anterior  left lower lobe..  PLEURA: Small right pleural effusion.  CHEST WALL, LOWER NECK, AND AXILLA: Grossly unremarkable.  UPPER ABDOMEN: Grossly unremarkable.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are seen within the visualized spine.  IMPRESSION  1.  Bilateral PE, with extensive thrombus on the right and minimal thrombus on the left as detailed  above.  2.  Small right pleural effusion and heterogeneous right lower lobe consolidation, likely reflecting  pulmonary infarction.

At the hospital they performed EKG&#39;s and stress test. The EKG was slightly off but the stress test was normal. I felt all my body flushed after the Moderna vaccine. my cardiologist I am now seeing and at the hospital I saw another Dr.  I also stayed at the  Hospital one day for monitoring.

The patient&#39;s husband states that &#34;crashed an hour and a half after she got the shot.&#34;  He defines this &#34;crash&#34; as decreased blood sugar, decreased responsiveness, and the seizures.  She presented to the Hospital for evaluation and was subsequently transferred to the Medical Center on April 4th for further workup. She was intubated on April 4th and subsequently self-extubated on April 8th. Nursing staff and documentation indicate that the patient has had no further seizures since her presentation to the medical center.  On April 14th she was found to have an acute lower extremity DVT. She was placed on a heparin drip and her platelet&#39;s dropped to 35. The heparin drip was discontinued, a HIT panel was ordered, and argatroban was started. Heamtology was consulted and the patient was found to have thrombotic thrombocytopenia. An MRI of the brain was ordered to rule out CNS thrombosis given recent seizures. The MRI has not been performed yet and the patient is still hospitalized.

At around midnight the day her shot she started to experience tingling on both sides of my tounge. She an unusually restless night and on 1/12/2021 woke up feeling very tired and over all worn down.  Around 10:45a my I called to check on her she said she had just checked her temp and it was 99.6.  She was complaining of being very cold and had the shivers.  While on the phone she started to develop a stutter. At first it was one word every 14-20 word but it quickly got worse to the point where she couldn&#39;t get a full  word out and just sounds. I immediately left work and went to her house. On my way we contacted 911.  It took me about 10 mins to get to her house and when I got there she was semi- unresponsive on the couch making moaning noises and shaking. She was having severe muscle spasms throughout her body. You could see her muscles tighten and release. EMS got there within a few minutes after me. They checked her temp and it had increased to 101.00 she was a bit responsive and they were able to take her vitals however, it was difficult due to her shaking and convulsing. They transported her to the hospital and by they time they arrived (within 15 mins) her temp was then 102.6. She was still shaking, not lucid and stuttering her words. They hospital ran several tests to rule out stroke and other possible reasons for her symptoms- they said she had to be having a delayed reaction to the shot. She was extremely dehydrated, they hooked her up to an IV, she had an extremely elevated white blood count and was overall &#34;out of it&#34;. She was given IV antibiotics and observed.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                Atrial Fibrillation; Tachycardia (Double heart rate); A spontaneous report was received from a 73-year-old female consumer who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced atrial fibrillation and tachycardia.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Jan 2021, the patient reported having atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. Treatment for the events included metoprolol.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73-year-old, female patient. The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient experienced an unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. The event occurred 2 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

                                                30 minutes post injection-weakness, face flushed, felt minor chest constriction, lips swelled and tongue tingled. I didn&#39;t inform the observers because I felt I could handle this myself. I drank water and rested another 10 minutes until the weakness dissipated. However, the chest tightness and tongue redness and tingling continued so I contacted my primary physician who recommended Claritin or Zyrtec which I took. Most reactions have dissipated but swollen reddened tip of tongue and tingling persist - second day.

                                                About 20 minutes after receiving the shot, I started feeling uneasy.  Realized that my fingers were getting tight with swelling.  I could feet the sides of my chests getting tight - felt like pressures were building up with swelling.  I did not have problems with breathing.  About 10 minutes later I could feel my lips swelling, but stopped after about 10 minutes.  In the evening, felt nausea.  Did not feel well for two days.  Got a little better on the third day but not completely well.  Completely recovered on the fourth day.  Should I get the second shot?  I am afraid it might be worse on the second shot if what I was feeling were due to allergy.

I started having chills. when I checked my temperature it was in the 99s (the highest my temperature 101.9. When I checked my heart rate in the morning and it was in the 90s, and that&#39;s higher than normal for first thing in the morning. My heart rate went high and I had achy muscles. I sat around all day, but I didn&#39;t feel that bad in the morning, I took an extra strength Tylenol and I didn&#39;t have much have an appetite. My heart rate stayed in the 90s-130, so I called my cardiologist and he recommended I alternate Tylenol and ibuprofen and drink lots of fluids. By dinner that night I had no appetite, and then I had nausea and dry heaves, so I took 25 mg of promethazine at about 8 and the dry heaves got better within an hour. I got the COVID tongue. I had a white coating on my tongue and I couldn&#39;t get it off and a weird metallic taste in my mouth, I had a mild headache. The next day I felt much better. I called my PCP and they didn&#39;t think it was necessary for me to come in for a cardiogram because I was feeling better.

                                                Patient reported she began to feel bad on her way home after receiving the vaccine (she had waited at the clinic for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine and felt fine at the clinic).  She reported she began to have a rapid heart rate (which went away that evening) and elevated blood pressure. She normally takes a BP med and took an extra 1/2 pill that evening. Her BP was up to 178/101 and came down to 124/78. She reports she is still not feeling well (but BP is within her normal range). She reports she will contact her PCP. I advised her to go to the urgent care and she wants to wait to see her PCP.  She agrees to go to urgent care or ER if condition worsens.

The patients&#39; medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications list was provided.   On 24 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of symptoms, patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 011J20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID -19 infection.  On 25 Dec 2020, patient experienced shortness of breath with low oxygen saturation levels.   On 26 Dec 2020, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue.   On 27 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s energy was back to normal.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient woke up in the morning with symptoms of almost could not breathe, could not walk across the room.  The patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation 83%.  The patient was struggling for every breath.  The patient tested negative for COVID-19.  On 30 Dec 2020, another COVID-19 test was negative.  On 31 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation closer to 90%, and she reported getting better. Symptoms remained the same for about a week.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient experienced left ankle and foot swollen. The patient was seen by physician and then sent to emergency room where it was determined that the patient had DVT in the left leg. A computerized tomogram (CT) scan found clots in the left lung, or saddle PE.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital.  Treatment for the events experienced included intravenous heparin and blood thinners.   Action taken with planned second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The event, extreme fatigue, was considered resolved on 27 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, slight fever, DVT and saddle PE were not provided.  Follow-up received on 19 Jan 2021 included updated events (DVT and saddle PE), updated event details, treatment, and hospitalization details.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of 73- year-old female patient who experienced serious event of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and non-serious events of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue the next day after administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 011J20A, expiration date-unknown. Based on temporal information provided and the known safety profile of the vaccine and the absence of any other etiology factors, a causal association between the vents of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue and the administration of  mRNA-1273 vaccine cannot be excluded. Fever and fatigue are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine.  There is no enough information t clinically assess the causal association between the events of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis as the patient&#39;s medical history and list of concomitant medications were lacking.

Tightness in chest went away next day. Shortness of breath went away on evening of day 5.

                                                I am not 100% certain of this event being related to the vaccination with the Moderna COVID19 shot or not.  However, in the interest of completeness and for investigative purposes, I am reporting to you the event in relation to the vaccination as the patient reported to me.  She received the vaccination on 2/14/2021 and became very confused.  She had significant left arm swelling much worse than when she had her first vaccination.  Her husband brought her to the emergency room and she was eventually discharged, but she went on to develop significant hypertension and she reported that her blood pressures were normal prior to the vaccination.  She had an emergency room visit in which her systolic pressures were well above 240.  She revisited the emergency room and had elevated blood pressures of 240 and was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy and later found to have posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or PRES.  We have started the patient on medications, and started laboratory work-up for secondary hypertension and her blood pressures have improved with treatment.  We discussed the case with the neurologist, who suggested that we repeat MRI scan to make sure that her punctate lesions noted on MRI on this admission on 2/25/2021, have resolved.  It was advised that if they had not resolved that we should call neurology again.  Hypertensive encephalopathy is rare and press syndrome as a result is also rare.  It is for this reason that I am reporting this event as again, I am not trying to mislead anyone or distort information, but should this be an adverse effect of the vaccine I wanted to make sure that this was reported as the patient&#39;s history prior to the vaccination and developing this complication post vaccination are temporally related at a minimum.  The patient is a known smoker but quit on the 14th of this month.

                                                One day after the vaccine, I awoke with a headache &amp; body aches.  Later that afternoon, I had a fever of 101.4 and chills.  The next day, I had an elevated heart rate and dizziness.  I had several more episodes of a rapid heart rate that day.  I called my cardiologist&#39;s office and they advised me to start on propranolol 20mg twice daily.  They had prescribed that earlier as I have had episodes of that in the past but did not take the medication.  After the 3 doses, approximately 12 hours apart, the lightheadedness and dizziness got worse.  I called the cardiologist on call and they d/cd the med.  Today, the lightheadedness &amp; dizziness is worse.

I am not sure how long I was unconscious,. but when I came to I was on the floor and unable to move.  I called out to my husband and he got me up, but I could not walk. He got me back into bed. Several hours later he assisted me in walking  and I am walking ok now.

                                                On 3/1/21, about 10 AM, I found a new pink oval spot on Left deltoid, about 2 1/2 in tall, 2 in wide.  Pink color,  firm and slightly warm, mildly tender, some rash spots above it.  Edges not raised.  Blanched in center with pressure.  Exactly 2 weeks after 1st dose Moderna vaccine.    No systemic symptoms at this time.     Prior to this:  On the day following 1st dose, the injection site became tender and sore, no change in skin color then, but some induration and was particularly sore when I raised my arm above my head.  That Lasted about 3 days, and has been completely resolved.   On the 3rd and 4th day post vaccination, I had mild fatigue and napped each of those days (very unusual for me).   Otherwise I have had nothing else from vaccination.      I took picture this morning, but do not know how to attach it.

Breathing still a problem and although it does not feel good, I am forcing myself to take an occastional deep breath. Did not report to work.

                                                About 12 hours after vaccine she felt like she had COVID all over again.  She had fever of 101, and then the body aches that were very painful.  She took Tylenol #3 for the pain and didn&#39;t notice the arm hurting yet.  The main thing was the body aches and fever.  She had chills off and on and a headache.  She felt like she just couldn&#39;t get up, wiped out.  She did not eat or drink much.  Through the day Saturday and by Sunday the body aches left, the chills went down during the day but returned Sunday night 2/28/21.  On 3/1/21 she went to the doctor and her temp was down, and is down now 3/4/21.  Through the night Sunday night started having terrible pain in her chest/esophagus, which she could not get the pain to go away.  She did the remedy that she read online, and has had some GERD over the years, but nothing like this.  She could hardly even swallow her own saliva without pain.  She got a prescription for Nexium from the doctor, and started taking that today.  She is trying to eat something, little bity bits to go down without pain in her esophagus.  The pain does get better at times during the day.  She read that it may take 2-3 weeks to heal and the Nexium should be working by then.  She is very fatigued and dealing with the acid reflux issues.   She did also notice redness on her arm was about 3&#34; x 2&#34; down her arm.  It was not at the site of the injection, was a little lower and it was hot to touch.  She kept putting a cold washcloth on it.  She took regular Tylenol.  The body aches went away but was left with such a heavy headache that she took up to 4 Tylenol #4 due to pain.  The redness had faded to about a square &#34; by the time she went to the doctor on Monday, and is still really sore.

I also began running a fever at about that time and ran it for about 24 hours, highest is got was 101 . Arm is swollen. I had covid the first week of October so am not sure if this played into my reaction. I am concerned about taking my second shot if this is what I experienced with my first one.

                                                On the morning of Feb 2, it felt like a switch went off in my head. I felt spacey and disconnected. I went for a walk and felt better but tired. I then started to feel anxious and tired the next day. The third day I not only felt anxious but agitated. This seemed very similar to being on Prednisone. That day I called my doctor and took Ativan. We waited another week to see if the aniety would go away. It did not and I am currently on Lexipro. I walk almost everyday and it really helped with the onset of anxiety after the shot. However, F Feb 14 I felt chest pressure while walking which I had never felt before. After returning home, I went to the ER. All tests were negative for a heart attack. I am hesitant to get the second dose. I am currently seeing a cardiologist to determine what may have caused the event.

At this time urine was orange in color and had a foul Oder for 3 days followed by stomach pain still but more intense and dysentery.  Called Dr office when I had blood clots the size of quarters or better, Nurse suggested I go to emergency.  I did not, this continued for 3 days and then subsided. I still am having chills and a temp of 96.7.. At this point I am concerned to get the second vaccine on the 29 th of this month.

By evening an continuing into the night of March 3, these red rash areas with large welts spread all over body. A steroid ointment and antihistamine were used to calm. After approximately 5 days the rash was gone. This rash appeared to look like the internet article pictures from BFF and Self, only the pictures were of the arm of injection.

Within an hour, my arms and legs were tingling and felt numb, much like when a leg or arm falls asleep, with intermittent chills running down the limb then gone. I had five episodes of tachycardia on 3-12-21, only two brief episodes today, 3-13-21.  48 hours later and I still experience a brief surge of the numb and tingling feeling, but it&#39;s so much better. The vaccination site itched profusely but that has eased.  I began taking Benadryl and Advil approximately four hours after receiving the vaccine and it did help.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 13 Feb 2021, the patient received the first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch# 007M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the night of 13 Feb 20212, the patient experienced arm hurt a little bit and she felt fatigued.  In the early morning of 14 Feb 2021, the patient went to the bathroom.  On her way to the bathroom,  she felt confused and had overwhelming nausea.  She lost consciousness and banged her head on the cabinet.  Within second, she regained consciousness but felt extremely weak.  She could not recall how she got back to her bed.  The patient said she was cold and clammy at that time and she never got back to sleep.  During the day on 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt a throbbing pain on the arm where she got the injection.  She was not sure whether that was due to the injection or due to her fall when she lost consciousness.  She could barely move the arm.  Then she took a nap in the afternoon and was able to recover from her lack of sleep that night.    Treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown (although her doctor advised her not to get the second dose given the reaction she had).  The outcome of the events was resolved on 15 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Additional information has been requested.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded

                                                On  Sunday 2/14, pt notes that she experienced chills and &#34;just felt out of sorts.&#34; On 3/15 at 1:30pm, she was scheduled for a wellness exam with her primary care provider. She notes that when staff took her vital, they were concerned because she seemed short of breath. Pt notes that she is overweight and does have dypsnea on exertion at times, but staff were concerned because she had been at rest for some time and they considered the shortness of breath unusual. Pt reports that her blood pressure was normal and her O2 sats were running 97-98% on room air. However, her pulse was 150. An EKG was done and the physician voiced concern over how long her pulse had been elevated. She was transferred to the ED,  where per her report another EKG showed that she was in  atrial flutter. Pt reports that she was treated with IV Cardizem and given and IV bolus of magnesium.  At approximately 4:30pm, a CT with contrast was completed to rule out blood clot or PE. A third EKG done in the ED revealed that she had returned to normal sinus rhythm. She was discharged home at 6:30pm.  Pt reports that she was seen for follow up on 3/20. At that time, her physician ordered repeat labs - CMP, potassium, magnesium, and thyroid - all of which were normal per her report. He changed her medication from baby aspirin 81 mg to Zarelto 20 mg, noting that she is at high risk for stroke. Cardiology has been alerted and she has an ECHO scheduled . Since her discharge from the ED, pt has been monitoring her pulse daily and it have ranged from 66-72 bpm/

                                                Woke up at 3:30 am after getting the shot.  Was shaking uncontrollably, freezing, deathly sick at my stomach.  Fever.  For next 24 hours I was deathly sick at my stomach.  Dry heaves.  Fever and chills.  Could barely raise my head.  Couldn&#39;t even eat a cracker.  Then my arm started hurting, got big long red knot,hurt down the inside for about a week.  I was sick like this for almost 48 hours.  I was exhausted, so tired.  This lasted for a week.  After the first week, every afternoon I would get exhausted and have to stop and rest.    First shot effected my breathing, causing rapid breathing, like I was anxious.  Had a headache.  My heart beat fast for about 20 hours.  Then all of it stopped.  Several days later I got a round red hot knot that stayed about a week or two and was really sore.

I was in the hospital for two days and had a series of CAT scans and ultrasounds.  Loud ringing in my head has not stopped. Never had a history of high blood pressure, but now they put me on high blood pressure medication along with the baby aspirin. I was a relatively healthy woman until I had these vaccinations.

I was transported that evening to the stroke  division that same evening for further evaluation, tests and care.  I have never had a mini stroke before this.The doctors said it may have been from the vaccination, or it may not have been precipitated by it.  They said they don&#39;t have enough information on the Moderna vaccine to make that call.

These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

On 21 Jan 2021, the patient reported she got very dizzy and passed out. Her husband relays that she was totally out for a couple of seconds. She went to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a vasovagal reaction and urinary tract infection. Premature ventricular contractions were also discovered and was not known prior to this event. Patient reports a normal blood pressure of 114-120/75. Patient also stated her arm was sore the day after vaccine but not hurting much during her usual four mile walk.

The outcome of the events, urinary tract infection and premature ventricular contractions were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of dizziness, passed out, vasovagal reaction, urinary tract infection, premature ventricular contractions and arm pain.  The events occurred the next day after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current limited available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.  Further information have been requested.

And the next morning I had a cramp in my leg that was the worst cramp I&#39;ve ever had. There were stabbing pains in my body all through the day and I felt nervous.

She felt weak and tired  after this episode and so went back to bed for several hours.  Later that day she had another episode of feeling lightheaded as if she might pass out, while sitting at a hair salon waiting for her appointment, but did not actually pass out, just felt a wave of heat and slight nausea, but did not faint.  She had one further near syncopal episode at home later that night when she also noticed she was a little &#34;jittery&#34; and noted a strange smell that the rest of her family did not notice.    She also reports that she has had near syncopal episodes in the past and thinks she may have been a little dehydrated the day these incidents occurred.

About 10 minutes later, stood up and walked about 4 meters to the refrigerator, grabbed onto handles and my husband rushed over and grabbed me as ir seemed I was going to fall. Sat me down in sofa, where after short? while  I recovered. After getting up to go to refrigerator, no recollection of anything that followed. My internist?s diagnosis - síncope.

The patient&#39;s medical history included heart surgery on an unspecified date in 2017. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of event, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 015L20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unspecified date in FEB 2021, the patient experienced fast heart rate, felt weakness, dizziness, and had atrial fibrillation. No treatment medication information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable.   The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on current information the event was assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 vaccine, because of biological implausibility, no clear temporal association, and the patient&#39;s history of heart surgery which may promote atrial fibrillation episodes.

                                                Day of injection- I had a sore arm.  )n the day following the injection;  started experiencing the following s/s including arm soreness, body aches, headache, extreme fatigue, and fever (  my normal temperature is 96.4-97.4 F ) My temperature began to increase throughout the day until it reached 99.5 F about 7:30 pm .  The most serious adverse reaction was the 18 hour spike in my blood glucose level which was elevated to the high glucose level .  I ended up taking over 200 units of insulin in a 30&#43; hour period (normally would use this amount of insulin in a 36 hour period.  I was unable to lower my blood glucose level from the range (200-300mmg) despite repeated doses of insulin during the time period of reaction (8:00am- 4:00 am).

Was told to wait another 15 min and was given water and snack to elevate blood sugar in case it had dropped (I do not have diabetes or history of sugar drops).  When I stood to leave, I stumbled in the hall and was told to stay and blood pressure was taken, which was elevated to about 170, which I had taken as I do daily, before I arrived and it was 119/60.  This was done at hospital by nurse. It was taken again, and it had gone down to 145, and I felt well enough to leave and drive home.  Stayed home, and vertigo was obvious, have had years ago, not recently, so I knew it was side effect.

Went back into pharmacy and they called 911.  EMT took me to ambulance to check vitals and this took about 45 minutes.  They offered to take me to hospital but declined as had my husband suffering from cancer who also had shot and can&#39;t drive was waiting in the car.  We drove 1/2 mile to friends home and waited to make sure felt ok to drive back.  Drove home ok and have been feeling tired for 3 days but otherwise ok.  Pharmacy followed up next day.  Today feel a bit of pressure in the chest and have placed a call to my doctor but he has gone for weekend.  I will go to emergency room if I feel worse and will call him on Monday to report incident.

She put devise in my finger that measures oxygen exchange and heart rate which was 105. She also got ice packs and a cold neck towel to put on. Gradually everything subsided, but I was unable to drive home so my husband did so. I developed a significant headache, so I went to bed when I arrived home.

I left and continued my day but felt increasingly itchy and hours later developed a few hives.  I took a Zyrtec and after a few more hours it all went away,  For the next few days I had tiredness, joint pain and some chills. Completely better after a week.

                                                Saturday, 02/20/2021, 1 week after receiving the vaccination, I noticed my left shoulder was itching. When I looked at it, there was sort of a blotchy crescent moon of pink color to the skin, not AT the injection site, but toward the front of the shoulder. The injection was toward the back of the shoulder, as I recall. There were no bug-bite-swollen-raised bumps.  There was intense itching the next morning, 2/21, and the pink color was more of a 1 3/4&#34; circle. Itching subsided but came back that afternoon. I applied a bit of hydrocortisone to the area and the itching subsided.  The next morning, Monday, the area was more filled in with pink and there was a new peninsula of pink descending about 2&#34; below the circle. It throbbed and itched when I first got up. Again there was another surge of itching in the late afternoon. I applied hydrocortisone twice. Tuesday there was no change in the rash or itching in the morning, but no second surge of itching in the afternoon. I messaged my Primary Physician&#39;s office and heard back that this could be a reaction to the vaccine, and that I should apply cold compresses to the area. I did. On Wednesday, the bottom of the rash was redder, but the top was fading.By Monday, March 1, no pink was visible.

                                                Tuesday evening I started feeling itchy and creepy crawly under my skin. I had red spots and itchy and the more I itched it the itchier it got. I had hives under the bra line on my right side, hives on my right arm and on my stomach. My hands were getting swollen. I took Benadryl a few times. On Thursday I was starting to get chest pain so I went to the ER and I was getting more blotchy and my hands were more swollen. they kept me over night and I had a chest x-ray,  CT Scan, an EKG and a stress test. all these tests were negative. My hands were so swollen that you couldn&#39;t see my knuckles.I developed hives under the blood pressure cuff and under the iv arm wrap.

Hospital admission that evening. 2/26 Steroid treatment stopped headaches and eye pain. 2/27 released from hospital after BP was &lt;160.  Diagnosis-migraines possibly triggered by vaccine.  Pain/nausea elevated BP and decreased food intake which caused low blood sodium levels. IV treatments to increase sodium and lower BP. Dizziness from low sodium and high BP created fall risk, so bed had alarm.  Bed confinement necessitated daily injections to prevent blood clots.  Twice daily blood tests done to monitor sodium and potassium levels &#43; kidney function.

                                                Woke Friday am with no control over my bladder and violent shaking of my legs with pain radiating from my hips. Fever of 100.9.Couldn&#39;t move my legs or sit up and eventually fell to the floor on my back.  Spent over an hour using my elbows to scoot across floor. Hit head 3 times and passed out for awhile. Got help and went to the ER.  CT showed no concussion. Pain reliever helped and after several hours was discharged with instructions to use a walker. Used walker for 2 days and then cane. Still have leg pain on occasion and now the Vertigo is worse. Also had reaction to first vaccine but just high fever, 101.4 and aches.

                                                Faint; Dizzy; Slight reaction; Very tired; A spontaneous report, was received from a consumer (patient), a 74 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced faint (syncope), dizzy (dizziness), slight reaction (vaccination complication) and very tired (fatigue).  The patient&#39;s current conditions included atrial fibrillation, back trouble and peripheral neuropathy (diagnosed years ago). The patient had medication allergies to pain medications and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Concomitant products included digoxin, carisoprodol, metamizole sodium and warfarin sodium.  On 09-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09FEB--2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had a slight reaction and became very tired, faint and dizzy. The patient&#39;s husband helped her to bed. The next morning on 10-FEB-2021, the events were resolved. The patient was scheduled for next Moderna vaccine (second dose) on 09-MAR-2021. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, faint, dizzy, slight reaction and very tired was recovered/resolved on 10-FEB-2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

My weight before the vaccine was 116 lbs, now it is 110 lbs. I am of a small frame, 5 ft. At the time, I was unable to contact my physician to report the problems before I receive the second dose that was scheduled on March 10, 2021, due to death in his family. I wrote to the Physicians who were communicating with me about my appointment and reported the above symptoms. An Administrative Assistant responded that these symptoms are not known to be associated with the vaccine.On March 16, 2021 I was able to get an appointment and on that date he did a series of blood tests.

                                                The injection was at 1p.m.  That night I woke up at 2 a.m. with an extreme headache, facial flushing and a feeling of not being well. BP was taken later and was 205/155-59. My normal is 117/70. Surprisingly, this high BP did not dissipate on it&#39;s own.  IT lasted a total of 26 days but gradually the highs lowered. Headaches woke me at night. (Facial flushing with high BP was first noted by a neurologist years back and I was found to have surges of nor-epinephrine. I was tested for a pheochromocytoma but that was negative. I normally have small self limiting surges for 4-5 hours once every month or two. I do not need medicine with those. I have longer surges after steroid injections I get for bursitis.

                                                Patient is a lovely 74-year-old female with a long history of PACs and hypertension.  Her blood pressure has been getting a little bit worse over the past years.  She was admitted through the ER with 1st known episode of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She reports that on 02/02 she received her 2nd COVID vaccine.  She had joint achiness and a low-grade temperature.  She rested the following day but then on 02/04 went for her usual hour long runs/hike.  She did not feel very well during exercise and started have a headache and some increasing palpitations.  Later that evening she was watching TV and started to have significant tachycardia that was irregular. Symptoms persisted and she presented to the ER which sound to be in AFib with rapid ventricular response with a blood pressure of 215/158. She was started on a diltiazem drip and has converted to sinus rhythm with PACs.  Blood pressure has improved significantly.  Troponin negative x2.   Her last evaluation at a Heart facility was  in 2017.  She had an echocardiogram in 2014 with normal EF, mild MR and mild TR with normal estimated PA systolic pressure.   She denies chest pain or dyspnea.  No history of syncope.  Sometimes with palpitation she does get lightheaded.  She gets occasional lower extremity edema that seems dependent in nature.  She is still having palpitations but recognizes that she is no longer in atrial fibrillation as that was more severe in terms of symptoms of tachycardia.

Hospital course: 74 y.o. female admitted on 4/8/2021 for abdominal pain. Notable PMHx: aortic valve replacement, HTN   On morning of admission, patient woke up with severe epigastric pain.  Describes pain as a pressure.  Has had vomiting.  Had bowel movement after pain started.  Patient came to the emergency room.  Patient received an antiemetic and Demerol.  Patient has continued to have pain in got a dose of morphine as well.  Pain eased some but was still 7/10.  In the ER, blood pressure was very elevated with systolic in 200s.  Cardiac enzymes negative.  EKG look good with normal sinus rhythm.  Patient has aortic valve replacement and is on Coumadin with INR goal of 2.5-3.5.  INR was elevated at 4.3.  D-dimer was negative.  Amylase and lipase negative.  Creatinine normal at 0.9.  Chest x-ray done which showed no acute disease.  On the floor, we ordered a CT abdomen.  It did show gallstones, but nonobstructing.  It showed kidney stones in the renal pelvis, but none obstructing.  No other inflammation or signs of bleeding.  Blood pressure came down after medicines in the ER.  Did have some lower blood pressures through the afternoon evening which was felt to be a combination of blood pressure low in medicines in the ER and pain medication.  From 11:00 p.m. onward blood pressures were controlled.   Patient continued to have severe abdominal pain.  Hemoglobin down to 9.0 from prior 12.4 yesterday.  Creatinine up from 0.9 yesterday to 1.8.  White count up from 8.3 yesterday to 14.4.  INR from 4.3 yesterday to 4.2.  Coumadin was held yesterday.   CT abdomen was repeated. CT abdomen was read as worrisome for necrotic gallbladder and small bile leak Contacted transfer line at hospital.  Surgery accepted and wanted transfer to go through the ER. Patient has PCN allergy.  Surgery said that if reaction was not severe, they wanted Invanz given before she left.  Patient says that she had a itching rash in the 70s.  No trouble breathing or swallowing.  No other reaction.  Dose of Invanz ordered.  IVF were increased.  HPI from hospital: 74 y.o. female who presents with Chief Complaint Patient presents with? Abnormal Scan   Patient presents via EMS as a medical transfer from hospital after having gallbladder necrosis seen on CT imaging.  She was given IV Invanz there.  General surgeon was contacted by that facility and he accepted the patient for transfer to this facility.   Apparently, the patient began having abdominal pain yesterday. Timing of onset was gradual.  Severity is rated as severe at maximum intensity. Quality is described as aching abdominal pain.  Symptoms have been improved after IV pain medicine.  Symptoms worsen with nothing, and improve with IV pain medicine.     History was provided by patient, EMS, transfer paperwork and EMR, and I spoke with treating doctor in general surgery who accepted the patient for transfer.

That subsided for a minute or two, then started again with a flush feeling down my body.  Nurse took blood pressure 140/80.  Breathing fine. Heart rate fine.  Flush feeling started again, and blood pressure dropped  to100/70.  I was then given 50 mg of Benadryl and an ambulance was called.  My blood pressure stabilized but I was very shaky.  It was recommended that I go to the hospital for observation for a couple of hours, which I did.  I only had the flush feeling once at the hospital.  I was released after two hours.

This started shortly after the injection, It subsided after about 15 to 20 minutes. This is similar to reactions that I&#39;ve had to flu vaccines when I last had one nearly 25 years ago.  It is also similar to my reaction to numbing shots where epinephrine is in the shot.

I called her around Noon the next day to check in on her and she said she was in hospital still being monitored. Was advised not to get second dose of vaccine from hospital.

It was a consistent flow and had been going on for 5 minutes before calling the pharmacy. She had placed a clip on her nose to see if it would stop, but when asked to check she said it still has not stopped. Asked her what medications she was taking and if she was on blood thinners. she indicated no. Looked up adverse events on Moderna covid-19 vaccine and it didn&#39;t indicate nose bleeding, package insert states &#34;intentionally blank&#34;. Advised patient to head to the ER and I would call to check up on her.

Blood pressure rose to 170-190 over 110 and would not go down.  Doctor advised I go to the E.R. for assessment, which I did. Blood pressure remained elevated for days . Noted the systolic was higher , mostly in the 80&#39;s.  I do not have hypertension BP this morning  in the 120&#39;s over 70.  Needed Alprazolam to calm my anxiety since.  Not every day. Very concerned about having the second dose. Doctor has advised me to only drink water the day of shot, take a tranquilizer an hour before and has given me BP med to take if my BP goes over 150.

                                                Adverse reaction began around midnight with chills, continued throughout the night alternating chills and hot flashes, severe backache, muscle aches in thighs and general malaise.  Got up around 8 to try to take a warm shower to ease muscle aches but as soon as I got into the bathroom I felt very hot, very nauseated and lightheaded.  I suspected hypotension but of course I wasn&#39;t able to prove it at the time. I attempted to get back to my bed but had syncopal episode a few feet from the bed where I collapsed onto the floor.  I just stayed on the floor and rested because it actually felt better lying down. I am a retired RN and suspect this adverse event was related to orthostatic hypotension.  Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

                                                I am a 75 year old female with severe Cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20% and an implanted defibrillator. I had my first COVID vaccine on Sunday, February 28.  I had had sinus problems with a little runny nose the week before...no fever, no chills, normal temperature.  Other than my arm being a little sore, i took two Tylenol the night of the vaccine and had no problems until Tuesday afternoon, March 2, 2021. i felt perfectly Sunday after =noon, all day Monday and Tuesday.  However while shopping at a nearby store as I got to the checkout counter I started having shortness of breath, It was hard for me to walk and I was very shaky.  I have an apple watch so I was able to check my heart rate.  The heart rate was anywhere from 58BPM to 177BPM and all over place in between,  i got in my car, trying to calm myself then called the EMTs.  They took me to hospital to the Emergency Room.  Several tests(see below) were performed.  The final diagnosis was hear palpitations.  They did a COVID test and I did test positive for the Rhino virus.  The doctors didn&#39;t know if my incident was related to receive the COVID vaccine and my defibrillator was checked, and a test was run that indicated it wasn&#39;t bad enough to activate the defibrillator.

At 1;00PM  I woke up and stood up out of bed and collapses onto the floor.  I was unable to get up.  I found my phone which had fallen onto the floor.  I was shaking so bad I kept dropping it.  I looked and my phone and was  unable to figure out how to make a call.  The screen did not make sense.  Eventually I was able to call my daughter who decided to call 911.  The paramedics came, picked me up  off of the floor and helped me walk to the living room.  My legs kept giving out like I was going to fall again.  They were asking questions but I was unable  to answer coherently. I was so confused.  My brain was not working.  They took me to the hospital where I was admitted and many tests were done.

This is very unusual for me.  Until I was dizzy &amp; checked my blood pressure on March 1, I didn&#39;t attribute the drop in Bp to the vaccine.  But then I recalled the dizziness I experienced the night following the vaccine.

                                                Received the second dose of COVID 19 on Feb. 24, 2021, at 2:20 pm.  After the injection, I sat for 15 minutes, felt fine, then left, went home.  The next morning at 5 am, woke with right arm throbbing and a huge swelling where the vaccine was injected.  I got up, felt dizzy, and went the the bathroom, took my temperature, which was 101 F, then got the chills and had chest pains across my entire chest. Tried to go back to bed but the symptoms got worse.  Called my neighbor and asked him to take me to the ER.  He took me to the ER and I was checked for fever, had a chest x-ray, urine test, blood pressure checked and at 5 PM was admitted.

On 1/26/20 she was exposed to COVID and in Feb 20 had COVID vaccine and given inhalers, antibiotics and was sick until mid April with the virus especially with the coughing and extreme weakness.  She never bounced back from the COVID 19 with possible pneumonia.    She had a lot of pain everywhere that was very distinct.  She then had nausea, diarrhea, a temperature of 99.7, runny nose like having a cold, itching really bad, and pretty much in bed for 2 days, her blood sugar and blood pressure went up when she was not eating anything as she had no appetite.   She also had a slight headache.  By the third day she felt much better.

The patient stayed in atrial fibrillation for four days and on an unknown date the patient went to the Emergency Room (ER). On 24 Feb 2021, Wednesday the patient was admitted to the hospital. Cardioversion was performed to return heartbeat to a normal rhythm as patient&#39;s heart rhythm was not stable with intravenous (IV) medication. The patient was buildup of body fluid.  Laboratory details included cardioversion.  Treatment information for events could not stabilize her heart rhythm (arrhythmias) include Flecainide.

Because I very rarely drink alcohol, a little bit makes me sleepy.  After about 4 sips, I broke into a cold sweat, could barely manage to stand up and call out to my husband.  I then lost consciousness  (and wet myself).  (My husband caught me).  I have never fainted or passed out in my entire life!  I regained consciousness about 2 minutes later and then had the shakes for quite a while.  For the next day and a half I felt as if a truck had run over me.

The next morning my right hip was very sore, so I concluded I had been unconcious ancd fell out of bed I&#39;m reporting this on the hope  that cases ofothers who had similar cases can help me understand.
