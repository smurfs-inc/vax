                                                Developed a severe headache within 2-3 hours of receiving vaccine. Took 2 Tylenol. Headache abated but did not resolve. Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

                                                Within about 2 days a round red sore appeared on my left arm just below my elbow.  Each day it became more sore and inflamed.  Within one week it became filled with puss, erupted, bled and now seems to be filling with puss again.  Now, within the last 2-3 days the injection site has suddenly developed a large red patch of mildly itchy irritation surrounding the site, with one or two other small patches starting to appear nearby.  During the last few days I have also notice a dull pain coming and going in my left arm.  Using my cell phone, I have taken photos of the sore in 3 stages and of the red injection area.  Those photos could be submitted to my doctor or this office, via text, if helpful.

I called both Medical Center and Hospital but pt had not been admitted to the ER this afternoon.

Critical care was necessary to treat or prevent imminent or life-threatening deterioration of the following conditions: cardiac failure, circulatory failure, CNS failure or compromise, dehydration, hepatic failure, endocrine crisis, metabolic crisis, renal failure, sepsis, respiratory failure, shock, toxidrome and trauma.  I provided critical care services requiring my management in the following manner: chart data review, documentation time, medication orders and management, re-evaluations, vital signs assessments and reviewing monitor data, and ordering and reviewing lab tests.  Aggregate Critical care time was 30 minutes.  My time did not include minutes spent treating any other patient simultaneously or on activities that did not directly contribute to the patient&#39;s treatment.  It did not include time spent performing other reported procedures.  Medical Decision Making:  This is a 76-year-old female who presented ER today for evaluation of syncope.  Patient was reportedly mildly hypotensive which improved with IV fluids.  I suspect that patient had dehydration given 4 episodes of large watery stools.  Patient had no recent antibiotic use and has no C. difficile risk factors, suspect this may be related to her Covid vaccine, she had no evidence to suggest anaphylactic shock, patient felt better after IV fluid bolus was able to ambulate around the emergency department without lightheadedness or near syncope.  She had troponins x2 which were negative, her EKG was nonischemic and there was no evidence of ectopy or arrhythmia.  Patient did have syncope and fell onto her side, she denies discrete head injury although patient is anticoagulated, CT head was obtained to rule out intracranial hemorrhage given the syncopal event.  Patient CT abd/pelvix was negative for obvious cause of patient&#39;s abdominal tenderness may be related to her diarrheal illness patient will be prescribed Bentyl.  She will call her primary care doctor in the morning to arrange close follow-up.  She understands need for aggressive oral hydration at home.  She will have low threshold to return should she develop lightheadedness syncope chest pain shortness of breath palpitations worsening abdominal pain bloody or dark stools any new or concerning symptoms.  The patient presented to the emergency department with potentially life or limb-threatening symptoms.      After my history, examination, and workup have decided that the patient is stable.    My impression is that they are safe to go home at this time.  I have reviewed ED return precautions with the patient. They understand to return if they are concerned for any reason.   They will follow-up with their PCP in 1-2 days.        Impression:  Syncope, hypotensionimproved, dehydration  Plan:   Discharge   Follow Up    Within: 1-2 days    Comments: Please call your doctor in the morning to arrange follow-up with your primary care doctor in the next 24 hours.  Please stay well-hydrated and eat regular meals.  Please take Bentyl as needed for abdominal cramping with diarrhea.  Please return to the ER if you develop worsening abdominal pain, feelings of lightheadedness passing out any new or concerning symptoms.    Patient Education  Syncope, Easy-to-Read  Diarrhea, Adult    Discharge Meds  dicyclomine  10 mg 1 cap, PO, QID, 20 cap  Referral for suspected pre-hypertension or hypertension was given.

                                                Began to have slight wheezing and coughing on Wed afternoon, the day after getting the shot.  Thursday wheezing and coughing increased and woke me up during the night several times.  Cough was productive with clear sputum.  Friday felt very tired all day and coughing and wheezing increased substantially, producing shortness of breath upon any exertion, like going up and down the stairs.  Very tired.  Began to think I&#39;d have to go to see the Dr. because wheezing was significant with every breath.  Cough was racking, increasing through the day into the evening.  At 10 p.m. I began to wonder if I&#39;d make it through the night without calling the rescue squad.  Couldn&#39;t take a deep breath or speak a whole sentence with out a coughing jag.  Then, suddenly about 11:30, it just ceased.  The tightness in my chest went away, the coughing with every inhalation stopped and I could take a deep breath.  It was a bit stunning.  Because I had pulmonary embollisms about ten years ago, my lungs have been a weak spot in my body with bronchitis occurring frequently.  I hadn&#39;t seen reports of this side effect of the vaccine, so I thought I&#39;d report it.  This morning, Saturday four days after the shot, I am breathing much better, not coughing, and do not have any wheezing.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 025LZ0A) intramuscularly in her right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient experienced heart beating very fast and feeling uncomfortable; it lasted for a few hours. She stated it was atrial fibrillation, she had a diagnosis of this, and it only lasted a few hours. The patient also stated that her blood glucose was 150, which was higher than normal.  Treatment for the events was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, increased blood sugar, was considered not resolved. The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and feeling uncomfortable, was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76 year-old female patient with a significant medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and non-serious unexpected events of Discomfort and Blood glucose increased. The events occurred one day (same day) after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 025LZ0A. Treatment was not reported. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the event a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes were considered strong confounders.

                                                About 9:00 pm in the evening I first noticed an unusual racing of the heart while watching television. It subsided and I proceeded to bed.  About 10:30 while in bed and reading it occurred again and continued for a few minutes. It continued to wake me a couple of times in the night before stopping about 4:00 am.  No further occurrence so have not sought medical assistance.

I went to Clinic Saturday 2/13, for being unbalanced and weak, but not so dizzy. Sunday 2/14 I was extremely weak with low blood pressure and fast heart rate.  Monday  2/15, in the morning,  my left arm started hurting, swelling, was feverish, red, itchy and I had a rash at the injection site. I went to my doctor on 2/19 and he stated that maybe I should not get the 2nd vaccine shot. He stated that he was not certain that everything that happened was a result of the vaccine, but that he couldn&#39;t say that it wasn&#39;t.

                                                Almost exactly 24 hours after 2nd shot, my mom was getting her hair done and she started breathing hard.  Hairstylist removed her mask and she then passed out.  Called 911.  They observed my mom sweating, her lips and hands were swollen, she was slack jawed, pale and clammy.   After several minutes she came out of it.  Was given a piece of candy thinking it was a sugar low, but her sugar was high 285 @9:00am.  Her color was still pale and she was still incoherent.  While still on with 911, she became more lucid and said she was feeling better, so ambulance was canceled.   I drove her home and checked her sugar @11:00 - 295 and BP 125/55 pulse 75.  She stayed with me for the rest of Saturday.  Her sugar was still high Saturday evening and Sunday morning.  Upon checking her blood sugar log, her sugar had gone up for a week following the first shot.

Vitals, EKG, CT scan, and MRI conducted. MRI showed an acute mild stroke on R side of brain.  Over-night stay was recommended. Echocardiogram was performed the following day and nothing was abnormal. I am now on a heart monitor for 30 days. Upon departure of hospital the symptoms in L leg and arm have nearly resolved but face is still numb/decreased sensation. Plan to contact PCP tomorrow.

                                                Patient has known lymphoma but was on break from chemotherapy. No known lung disease. She developed a very large left pleural effusion and became markedly hypoxia need chest tube drainage. Multiple fluid cultures were negative for infection and fluid sent twice for cytology and flow cytometry were negative for tumor cells. She was too  ?sick? for thoracoscopy. Over the next  7 days the symptoms resolved and the effusion has not returned which speaks against this being from the lymphoma. She had symptoms the night of the vaccine but did not become critically ill for about 36 hours as the effusion was developing. Her oncologist and I both believe this was related to the vaccine and will not give the second dose.

Rapid heart beat followed by afib that was not terminated with normal medications. Dizziness and shortness of breath. Hospitalized with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It resolved after getting two injections of a medication called diltiazem in the emergency department, after which I was monitored overnight in the hospital. Underwent stress test and echocardiogram - results  normal. On the day I write this (March 1) continue to have  shorter periods of rise in blood pressure and heart rate,  diaphragm tightness, insomnia and lethargy.

Next morning after around 11 am patient started to vomit almost a lot, her fever went up to around 38.5C auxiliary, she reported extreme weakness and shakiness, her blood pressure also increased to 160s/high 90s, she complained of extreme shortness of breath. Elevated BP could be related to the fact that she was vomiting so much, she had hard time taking her scheduled medications, included BP medications.   This lasted for 3 days. Patient was taking Ondasentron and that was only reliving nausea for 2 to 3 hours. She was taking Tylenol to bring her fever down. 650 mg Tylenol was only lowering temp to about 37.8.  For about 72 hours she was complaining of extreme generalized pain and weakness and had very hard time getting up to go the bathroom.  She started to fill a little better on March 27, 2021. Shortness of breath disappeared in the morning. Temperature fell to 37.1C. She stopped vomiting and was able to eat.  Generalized weakness and shakiness persisted till March 2, 2021. At the moment of submitting this report, patient is still reporting that she does not feel that she is &#34;100% back to normal&#34;

It is now 3/6/2021 and I still have swollen underarm glands (right arm), right arm soreness at injection site, and some itching there as well. But no fever just now.  I&#39;m VERY CONCERNED the swollen glands will not go away in time for my aortic valve replacement surgery on 3/15/2021.

I had brain fog for the next 2 weeks.  Tylenol and Advil mostly relieved physical discomfort.    I had the second shot March 16.  The next day I had a severe headache, no energy, achy body,  chills and fever and on the second day after the shot my temperature was 101.4 - 101.8.  Tylenol and Advil relieved the symptoms.  Today, one week after the second shot I developed a pungent chemical taste in my mouth and a similar sense of smell.  The tip of my tongue is tingling, and while I can breathe in deeply,  my chest feels heavy, like I&#39;m not getting enough oxygen.

The patient&#39;s medical history included breast cancer in the right breast. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included cholesterol medication and once weekly Fosamax with calcium and vitamin D.   On 10-MAR-2021, the patient received a dose of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 026A21A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Mar 2021, immediately following the vaccination, the patient reported she experienced overheating, became beet red and her blood pressure was over 300. An ambulance took her to the emergency room. She had her troponin levels checked which were over 4000 that lead to a hospital admission and required a unspecified catherization. The patient was discharged home on unspecified date. She reported still feeling groggy and having difficulty with her cognition but it was improving throughout the day. The patient also reported her arm was still swollen, but improving.   Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine and other unspecified medications and treatments.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The events, blood pressure over 300 and troponin over 4,000, were considered recovering.   The events, flushing beet red, overheating, and grogginess were considered not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I was sitting in a well organized waiting area I started feeling flames in my throat. My throat was literally on fire. I raised my hand as I was instructed to do. I asked for water, they brought me a bottle water, I started to drink it. My throat was having a difficult time swallowing. They brought me over to nursing area. I went into this area and the nurses were there. They made me take my mask off, they took my blood pressure was way lower then normal (110/30). Then they gave me 50MG Benadryl. They called EMS and I refused to go. I had to wait at the clinic until the Benadryl took effect. The &#34;flame&#34; feeling began to lessen. When I got home I took another dose of Benadryl.  The &#34;flame&#34; feeling went away but then I was left with a sore throat for the rest of the night and the following morning. It felt like there was an actual fire in my throat that the Benadryl put out but then it felt as if the after effects of a burn in my throat.    I do have a call in to my primary care provider and still waiting for a call back.

                                                I awoke on 1/23/2021 (Saturday) morning to find my face and especially my lips swollen.  Contacted doctor&#39;s office for the on-call; he strongly suggested I visit the ER. Was kept there for 2-3 hours for observation.  Was considered &#34;hypertensive,&#34;  routine blood work done (CBC, metabolic panel) all of which were normal.  Was given Prednisone and ZyrTec.   After no change in my condition, was discharged with instruction to contact primary physician and continue to take Prednisone and ZyrTec for the next four more days.   The reason for the facial and lip swelling could not be determined......It was indicated that the swelling could be one of several things including an allergic reaction to something topical like a lip balm (I used a Blistix application before bed), a reaction to one of my medication (BP med-Olmesartan, which they told me to discontinue) or less likely a reaction to the COVID vaccine.

                                                Ischemic attack; Severe high blood pressure; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 77-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced severe high blood pressure (BP) and ischemic attack.  The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included atorvastatin calcium, bupropion hydrochloride, gabapentin, ibuprofen, estradiol and metformin.  On 08 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 12 Jan 2021, the patient was taken by ambulance to the hospital with severe high BP. During her hospital stay the patient&#39;s BP readings were 190s/109. The patient was diagnosed with ischemic attack.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital. Her BP readings since then have been 179/85.   On 19 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s BP reading was 145/80.   Treatment for the event included lisinopril.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome of the events, severe high BP and ischemic attack, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 77-year-old female patient with medical history of diabetes who experienced the serious unlisted events of Hypertension and Transient ischaemic attack that required hospitalization. The events occurred approximately four days after receiving their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A), Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. Of note, patient&#39;s elderly age and history of diabetes are considered risk factors for the occurrence of the events.

                                                The patient had her second Moderna shot on Feb 17, 2021. At 3 am the next morning she reported to the ED c/o being &#34;fluish&#34; and short of breath. She was found to be hypoxic to the upper 80&#39;s on RA, and a CXR was consistent with CHF.  She stated she had some off and on chest pain for the last few weeks, especially with exertion. Ultimately it was found that she had an elevated troponin and was felt to have had an MI. She underwent cardiac cath and a stent was placed in a 95% ostial right coronary stenosis.   Although she was reported as having had a &#34;hyperimmune&#34; response to the vaccine, I can only say for certain she had flash pulmonary edema due to cardiac ischemia that was due to a stenosis in her RCA that had been there for quite some time, but possibly just happened to become critical right after her second COVID vaccine. It would be hard to blame the vaccine, but it is also impossible I guess to absolve it from any role in her MI.

                                                I had no reaction to the first shot , except sore arm for one day.  After the 2nd shot, the next day I developed a high fever (103) and chills.  I called urgent care that evening to see how to bring the fever down.  They told me that was my body building antibodies.  The fever &#34;broke&#34; later that night.  I never have gotten rid of the chills.  I did not see a doctor for this reaction. During this time, not exactly sure of the dates, the cardiologist started me on a new medicine - Verapamil.   I thought the chills might be from the medicine.  She reduced the dosage due to low heart rate, and I&#39;m still taking the medicine.   I now have a rash on my side and on my left thigh, which is blotchy, red, and itchy.  I do not know if these reactions are from the medicine or from the vaccine, but I suspect it is the Moderna vaccine.  The chills are mostly centered in my legs.  They are not letting up.  I have not seen my doctor about the rash yet.  I have had the rash for a couple of weeks, trying to get rid of it myself.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

I was blind in that eye for about 10 minutes. We drove  right away to my eye doctor, who sent me to the ER. The hospital is Stroke Certified. They admitted me and did a stroke workup. I was in the hospital for 1 day (24 hours) which included overnight.  The treating HCP concluded that I had experienced an ocular stroke. Since it was exactly 4 days after my second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, it most likely was caused by that vaccine.

This spontaneous case was reported by a nurse (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)), ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) and ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty) in a 77-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 025L20A and 042L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Mercury sensitivity (itching, tearing; reacted once), Shellfish allergy (rash) and Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Concomitant products included AMIODARONE from 06-Feb-2021 to an unknown date for Atrial fibrillation, METOPROLOL SUCCINATE (TOPROL XL) and RIVAROXABAN (XARELTO) for an unknown indication.   On 05-Jan-2021 at 1:00 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021 at 4:00 PM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 05-Feb-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 06-Feb-2021, the patient experienced HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heartbeat after cardioversion). On 14-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and FATIGUE (more fatigue). The patient was hospitalized from 14-Feb-2021 to 16-Feb-2021 due to CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE. At the time of the report, CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)) and ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) had resolved and ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty), HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heartbeat after cardioversion) and FATIGUE (more fatigue) had not resolved.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation and 2 ER visits, 2 days in a row) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (Congestive heart failure (Stage 2)), ANGINA PECTORIS (occasional angina during acitivty), HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heartbeat after cardioversion) and FATIGUE (more fatigue).    The patient was treated with cardioversion on 06-FEB-2021 and IV Lasix.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The CHF was attributed to the use of the amiodarone for aggravated atrial fibrillation. No further follow-up information is expected.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-006529 (E2B Linked Report).

Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

Previous dose of COVID vaccine had created a similar response but she had just adjusted medications and attributed it to that. In this case she had taken all her medications. Took rx medication for high BP while being monitored but BP increased to 201/104. Her PCP was notified and she took a second dose of her BP medication. By 1500 her BP had improved to 155/89 and she was no longer dizzy. Taken home with instructions to follow up with PCP if symptoms return or worsen.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Pleasant 78-year-old female with history of lung cancer with remote partial pneumonectomy, some element of COPD and chronic respiratory failure on home oxygen therapy. She presents with worsening shortness of breath, which started rather abruptly the day prior to presentation. On arrival to the ED she was mildly tachypneic and slightly tachycardic and appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. Her O2 had been titrated to 4 L/m nasal cannula in order to sustain SaO2 values in the 90% or above range. Patient also noted to have pallor. No hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, fever, cough or known exposure to COVID. Patient reports having received her first COVID vaccination just over one 1 week ago. A hypochromic microcytic anemia, progressive, was noted with a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Patient reported that she was up-to-date on EGD and colonoscopy within the past year without findings of acute pathology or bleeding. A CTA of the chest was conducted with findings of bilateral pulmonary emboli. She denies lower extremity swelling, pain or tenderness. Patient placed in observation in order to provide palliative blood replacement therapy and commence with anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism.  DISCHARGE SUMMARY/OBSERVATION COURSE: Uneventful observation course for this pleasant 78-year-old female who presented with somewhat sudden worsening of her chronic shortness of breath and was found to have CTA evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli. This in the setting of a progressive iron deficiency anemia without evidence of active clinical gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells in a palliative fashion for her presenting hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Posttransfusion hemoglobin was 10.1 g/dL. Concurrently, she was placed on weight-based low molecular weight heparin for full anticoagulation. I examined the patient on the morning of February 12 and found her to be nondistressed. Her SaO2 value was 96% on 4 L/m nasal cannula O2. Recall that her baseline flow rate historically had been 2 L/m his cannula. Etiology of the patient&#39;s thromboembolism uncertain. She had no clinical findings of unilateral or bilateral lower extremity swelling or tenderness. Patient noted to be a survivor of both breast and lung cancers but without known evidence of active persistent malignancy. Of interest, she had received a COVID-19 vaccine just over one week prior to presentation. I contacted pharmacy in this regard and encouraged him to report possible adverse event via VAERS. I recommended a course of rivaroxaban and provided a prescription with a VTE dosing schedule. Patient was advised to followup with Dr in 10 days.  M.D., Hospital Medicine    MD Feb 12, 2021 08:40

                                                I had Soreness on the arm the same day of vaccination, redness, achy in the muscle area on my arm. I think the injection was administrated to high in my arm.  The within the next 24-48 hours I had a headache and was tired. About the 4th-5th day I had tingling, prickly feeling across right shoulder, down both arms down to my fingers and down  my legs down to my toes. This lasted about 5-10 minutes. Then on the 16th it happened again but this time it was my whole body the torso area and my limbs. I also had weakness, I felt like I needed to hold onto to someone to be able to stand. I had an unstable feeling while standing. The headache has occurred on and off since time of vaccination  about 4-5 times.  I  went doctor on Tuesday 2/16/2021, I did not see my doctor this time I see a different  it was a lady doctor.  She wasn&#39;t aware of this being one of the side effects and just to monitor myself and return if the symptoms worsen. She thought it was safe to get the 2nd dose. I have a virtual visit scheduled with Dr. on 2/23/2023

She received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccination yesterday and complained of fatigue, body aches, and general malaise all day.  Later in the evening she noticed that her blood oxygen level was low.  She denies having any more shortness of breath abnormal.  She has had no vomiting, headache, or chest pain.  On arrival she was noted to be febrile and required 6 L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  She usually uses 2 L nasal cannula at baseline, occasionally increasing it to 3 or 4 with exertion.  She also had elevated troponin levels and noted leukocytosis.  There was radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  On exam, she is tired and wants to go to sleep.  She is still requiring 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.  Her daughter is at bedside.  Plans are discussed for admission and she is agreeable.   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: * Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Admit to medicine- hypoxic requiring 6 L nasal cannula, utilizes 2 L nasal cannula baseline Hypoxia appears to be secondary to robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Increased hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure Will repeat troponin level in the morning, daily chemistry and blood count, will treat congestive heart failure as below     CHF (congestive heart failure) (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Transesophageal echocardiogram from October 2020 noted preserved left ejection fraction, and had no evidence for diastolic dysfunction Radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure, normal BNP, elevated troponin with an increase of 18 at the 2 hour mark, will recheck in the morning As this is her 2nd hospitalization since that echo with hypoxia and concern for CHF, will obtain repeat echocardiogram Received 80 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department, will continue 40 mg IV Lasix 2 times a day Daily weights, 2 L fluid restriction Patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. I think this is due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure that was brought on after she was sleeping most of the day without her BiPAP. She says she got her COVID-19 booster shot and felt so tired she slept all day. She did not think she needed her BiPAP during the day even if she was sleeping. She has not had a recent sleep study. Patient is diuresing and will likely be able to discharge tomorrow.

She went to the ER with no treatment. About 5-6 hours after discharged she returned with her leg turning purple and uncontrollable pain. She was diagnosed with venous thromboembolis and transferred to a larger facility where she underwent lytic therapy and venous angioplasty. She is having to go for venous stenting in the next two weeks. She continues to have pain in her leg, chronic fatigue and weakness, as well as being lightheaded with a stable BP (no orthostasis). She has been diagnosed with anemia since vaccination and is being worked up for that.

                                                Day of injection arm a little sore. Next day (Friday) felt perfectly fine and spent the day at home doing usual house cleaning and laundry. Felt fine in the evening and Saturday morning was extremely fatigued, loss of equilibrium, and elevated blood pressure. This condition remained for a few days and on Tuesday my pressure was somewhat down and I saw my doctor. He suggested that since I was doing a little better had NO other symptoms such as fever or chills or muscle aches I would be better in time. It was a rough week feeling so unlike my self but I pushed through. I see the doctor again on Tuesday the 26th. I have never had any reaction to any other vaccine such as flu or shingles vaccine at any time. I am an active woman who exercises and walks to the beach near my home frequently every week. I am anxious about the second dose of the vaccine. I have an appointment on Thursday, February 4th. Hopefully all my strength will have returned by then. I feel like I&#39;m still only 80% back to normal. I have spoken to a young woman who called me back. I would like very much to speak with a medical person who can give me some feedback on my response to the vaccine. That would be reassuring that I am not alone with these side effects. Thank you.

This area was especially painful when pressure applied. No shortness of breath.  Symptoms lasted for about 10 hours and  subsided somewhat on 1/29/2021.  Severe pain symptoms returned early morning on 1/30/2021 and resulted in my going to the ER at the local hospital around 10:00 a.m.  An EKG , CT scan, and blood tests determined no heart attack or other life threatening conditions and I was released from the hospital around 4:00 p.m., still experiencing pain without a cause being determined.  Pain and painful area were no longer present on 1/31/2021.

                                                Patient came with husband to Vaccine clinic today 3/5 for 2nd dose of vaccine. Did well during and immediately after vaccine. Husband states patient has c/o severe chest pressure and pain for several weeks but has refused to come to ER for evaluation. Today, after getting vaccine dose and going to local bank, patient was in passenger side of truck when chest pain started again. Husband begged patient to let him take her to the ER but she said no, I?m fine and I don?t want to go. She then went unresponsive. At a stop light, he was next to a couple of cops who he was able to wave down and proceed to escort them in to ER. Upon arrival to the ER, patient was unresponsive and pulseless. CPR was initiated, 1 defib, and 1mg of epi was given. Return of pulse was obtained, but husband asked for no life support and only comfort measures. Patient was admitted for comfort measures.  I do NOT think this was related to her vaccine, but rather the unfortunately end to a sub-acute chest pain patient that declined multiple urgings to seek care.  Patient then expired on 3/5/21 at 2037.

                                                Following the vaccine she was at the grocery store around 5:00 PM, her granddaughter asked her why her mask was red, and she noticed that she had a dripping nose bleed, and left and by the time she got home it was done.   Then, 2/21/21, she had another nose bleed, was at a pizza place in the car, and felt like she had to spit and it was blood and had a smaller nose bleed that did not last night.  The next one 2/26/21, was in the store and had a dripping nose bleed again, took a while to get it stopped, but by the time she left the store she was fine.  Then Saturday 2/27/21, she kept getting up in the night and had nose bleeds off and on, and managed through the night and the morning.  She went to the ER in the morning on 2/28/21, and her nose was packed with dissolving packing and gave her a prescription for 3 pills to take to prevent her from getting an infection.    During the night Sunday night she had a very bad night and went to the ER again on 3/1/21 at around 5:00 AM.  They then packed her nose with a balloon and then got the first prescription filled that she took.  On Wednesday she went back to the ER and they removed the balloon and now has been fine.  Her Coumadin has been up and down during this period of time.  Her INR reading was 4.5 on 2/28/21, and subsequently has gone down to where it is quite low.  No issues with the injection site.  She has never had nosebleeds prior to the vaccine.   In October/November she had a procedure she had a hernia repair and had a COVID test and since then she has had a tinge on tissue, but not a nose bleed.   These were mainly on the right until she had the profuse one, and then it was both nostrils as well as coming out of her mouth.   Has an appointment with the ENT on 3/18/21.

I did feel fine until I got severe chills about 6 PM.  Chills remained for several hours.  Went to bed with heavy covers.  Woke up about 2 AM with stomach not feeling well.  Was dizzy walking into kitchen getting a Sprite.  Set in recliner with heavy covers.  Took my blood pressure at 5AM &amp; it had dropped to 104 /44 which was apparently why I was so dizzy.   I then took a Tylenol and felt fine after 9AM.  I still feel fine but wanted to report my extremely low blood pressure which usually is 135/65 in mornings.    I&#39; m thankful for the vaccine.

                                                Was napping the day after receiving the vaccine and woke up about 3:00 pm to severe chest pain on the right side radiating deep into the shoulder blade.  It would last about 5 - 10 min., stop for the same amount of time, then start up again.... on &amp; off until close to 11:00 pm.   Since someone else I know had the same thing happen the day after her shot, I assumed I had the same symptom, tho&#39; it was very frightening.  A week later after going to bed on Friday night, I woke at 2:00 a.m. to the same pain only this time on my left side.  Thinking I could be having a heart attack, I went to the hospital where I was admitted after having a series of tests.  I was there for 2 days during which time I also began to have un-controllable diarrhea.  Altho&#39; they could find nothing wrong with my heart,  after scans, x-rays, a stress test, numerous blood tests etc., they cannot say positively whether or not it was from the Covid vaccine.  I tho&#39;t it best to report this in case others have similar events.  I had the MODERNA vaccine

                                                I became progressively more sleepy the afternoon after the vaccination, as expected.  I did get up and make dinner, then went to bed at 9:15 p.m. on March 8th and slept until 9:15 a.m. March 9th.  I felt unstable walking into the bathroom to urinate, and even more unstable waking into the kitchen to take my meds. I passed out and woke up on the floor.  I was weak but managed to pull myself up holding on to the kitchen range. I headed for the living room sofa and passed out again, waking up on the floor by the sofa.  I&#39;m guessing I was unconscious about 2 minutes each time, but don&#39;t really know. I lay down on the sofa and called a neighbor.  He thought I should call 911, and they came and drove me to  ER .  They did an EKG, chest x-ray, and CAT scan of my brain, and drew blood.  All results were normal. I returned home that same day (March 9)  and had little energy, and ate lightly.  When I was getting in bed about 10:30 p.m. I let my head drop on the pillow and the room started to whirl around me for about six seconds.  Sometimes when I roll over in bed during the night there is a pause before   it feels like the room gives one spin.  My scalp is very tender in the large area where I hit it twice when passing out.  I&#39;m taking it easy again today, but do feel a little stronger.  I am normally exceptionally healthy for my age, and work , traveling to destinations to research and photograph my articles. Both the travel and article take stamina, and I thrive on the work.

EKG with new left BBB and troponin mildly elevated 8-17-35-26. She was seen by Cardiology and determined to have NSTEMI and taken for cardiac cath with drug eluting stent placed to LAD. Echo was also ordered with evidence of murmur. Cavity size is normal. Wall thickness is normal. Systolic function is normal. The estimated ejection fraction is 55%. Dyssynchronous interventricular septal motion, likely related to conduction abnormality/bundle branch block. Grade I diastolic dysfunction. Annulus is severely calcified. Severely calcified and restricted opening of posterior mitral leaflet. Mild mitral valve stenosis at the max.  She remained stable post stent placement. She remained on dual antiplatelet therapy

I am a 2 mile a day walker and very healthy. It was below freezing and I attributed the shortness of breath to weather. I went to an ER on March 8, 2021  after realizing symptoms were worse. I was admitted with Pulmonary embolism in both lungs and pneumonia in both lungs. The hospitalist could  not give me a reason why this happened. He encouraged me to report this incident. You would need to contact him for tests and such. I am a patient. I live where medical help is limited. The vaccine was administered at a clinic but the ER I went to was a different system.

Symptoms continued intermittently until 03/23/202 when a cardiac ablation was performed at a Cardiovascular Center.  I also experienced some post-op Afib in first 2 weeks following the procedure.

She was putting drops in her husband&#39;s eyes around 11pm and told him she needed to sit down that she was going to &#34;pass out.&#34; Her husband said she did pass out and he called 911. He said she was unconscious maybe 3 or 4 minutes. She woke up alert and knew what had happened. The EMT&#39;s checked her out--said she had no temperature, blood pressure was ok, and blood sugar was 280. They told the couple they thought it was probably from the vaccine. They wanted to transport her to the ER to be &#34;checked out&#34; but the patient refused to go. She has not had any problems since the incident except some fatigue

She states these are not necessarily associated with any exertion and seemed to be somewhat better after antacids.  She notes she has not had anything to eat or drink this morning which is not unusual for her and her blood sugar was 117 this morning.

The next day felt normal, except for arm being slightly sore. The worse part was the severe shaking  from chills and nausea. I did take a Tylenol before going to bed.

                                                Suddenly this morning, 13 days after receiving the first Covid Moderna vaccine - my arm is red and feverish at injection site.  In the meantime starting Sunday, Feb. 14th, I had pain in right chest and right upper back, that I contributed to making a wrong move and straining muscles.  The back pain is better, but I still have it when I reach high , move wrong, or take a deep breath.

The second day she shaking and jerking, couldn&#39;t hold on to anything.  Her blood pressure was up and down that day. She said she felt like she was dying and then she vomiting where she bruised both elbows on the toilet bowl due to the jerking movement she was experiencing.  She took a nap and woke up confused.  She was hallucinating saying she felt like she went from a small box to a blue box to red box and didnt recognize her room.  Her sitter said her eyes were glazed but was able to recognize her sitter at that time.  Blood pressure dropped so the sitter then called EMTs where they checked her out.  Vital signs were good but she declined to be transported to the hospital via ambulance.  The third day she was feeling some better where she was able to eat and get a sponge bath.  Fourth day she was better so was able to shower.  She states she is better now with just a little soreness and redness around the injection site.   Pt has contacted her PCP and spoke with the nurse about her symptoms.

We left the facility and on the way home, approximately 45 after she received the vaccine, she began slurring her words ands was confused. The slurring lasted for 2-3 minutes The confusion continued. I brought her the ER where she was immediately taken in for  a CT Scan. She later had an MRI, and met with a Cardiologist. She later had an EEG at the request of a Neurologist. She spent three nights in the hospital.  All tests showed no acute signs of stroke, etc.

Staff cannot answer what caused the seizure though they found a 4mm bleed on her brain; believed unrelated to seizure; on an MRI.

I laid there for a while and finally crawled back to my bed.  I was able to get back in bed.  By then it was 3:00am.  The next night I woke in the night and had an irregular heartbeat.  I could not get back to sleep until it finally went away.  For several days after the vaccination, I had very little energy.

                                                My mom received her second covid shot at 10:05 AM on 3/26 and experienced no adverse symptoms. At around 6 am the following day, on the morning of 3/27 she was found on the floor, and presumably suffered from a heart attack. After devastation to our family, we called her physician and he himself was also surprised. Although she is a type 2 diabetic with high blood pressure she has maintained great health and kept her conditions under control with her medications. This, unfortunately, seems too coincidental to not have been in some way or completely caused by the second dose of the shot.

I was going to go sit down, but I passed out and fell onto the kitchen floor for a few  seconds.   I have never passed out before or felt such light-headedness.  I went to lay down.   I vomited a bit of liquid.  I lay down and several hours later my husband drove me to the emergency room.  After many tests they said I had suffered a Syncope and had a slight concussion.

No official diagnosis, treat as  ITP.   Follow up visits with oncologist/haematologist to keep an eye on platelets as they increase.   March 30-Apr 4 - ER visit due to swelling of ankles, feet, and left arm. Tests show superficial blood clot, fluid on lungs, and pneumonia. Oncologist said that &#34;we have no official diagnosis&#34;, that she&#39;s being treated for ITP.   April 6-14 - follow up visit to oncologist/haematologist show elevated kidney enzymes, then later liver enzymes,  low sodium.   April 14 - decision to move to short term rehab for regular PT and OT. Continued swelling (fluid in third spaces.)   April 21 - visit to cardiologist to perform cardioversion, successful (during first week of hospital stay, heart rhythm med had to stop).   April 23 - facility nurse discovered significantly low Hemoglobin and a blood transfusion was ordered.    April 24 - returned to short term rehab facility.   April 25 - discovered my mother on O2 and state of health was different,  extremely weak and not moving, arm hurting badly. I insisted that her oncologist is contacted. Transported to ER. Discovered her blood work abnormal. After stabilizing her, rushed to the hospital ICU.   April 26 -  Discussed with her ICU doctor the history of what you have read above. He explained that the covid-19 vaccination has a tendency to affect three proteins specifically that clot and thin blood. I begged him to &#34;get it out of her system.&#34; Her bleeding was significant and platelets dropped, again. Still has her mental facilities. Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were &#34;confused&#34; and everything happening to my mom was &#34;a mystery.&#34; Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she&#39;s worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn&#39;t be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and &#34;confused,&#34;  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn&#39;t indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system &#34;go crazy.&#34;   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother&#39;s blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother&#39;s eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.

She stated that around 1pm yesterday that she got really dizzy so she took some medication that she had for dizziness, she had it for a previous fall d/t dizziness.  She stated that the medication helped, but around 8pm yesterday her head felt like it was going to explode and her heart was racing, so she called her daughter and her daughter called the ambulance and she was taken to the ER.  She said they ran a bunch of tests at the ER, including a CT scan, she is doing okay now, and is at home.  She stated that she is calling because she does not want to get the 2nd dose of COVID vaccine because she does not want to go through that again.  Client stated that she lives alone but her daughter checks on her frequently.

                                                Had a stroke; A spontaneous report was received from a caregiver concerning an 81-years-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine and had a stroke.  Patient&#39;s medical history included a mini stroke (5-6 years ago). Concomitant medication included blood thinners.  On 02 Feb 2021 at 4:30 pm, ten days prior to onset of the event stroke, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot/batch: unknown) for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient had an event of stroke for which was hospitalized. The patient was on a lot of medications (not specified).   Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not recorded.  The outcome of the event stroke was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event of stroke, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s elderly age and prior history of TIA are considered as risk factors.

After the 2nd dose, she experienced chest pain, jaw pain, body numbness and tingling, and nausea. She did not have vomiting, shortness of breath, syncope, or headache. She was hypertensive on the cardiac monitor and EKG with T wave inversion in lead III, otherwise unremarkable. Heart rate stable, alert and oriented, cardiopulmonary exam benign. She was sent to the ER for further workup, but did not seem to have any allergic reaction to the vaccine. It is unknown what occurred at ER, as she either went to a separate health system or did not go at all.

                                                Pain in my heart; A spontaneous report was received from an 81 year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced pain in heart.  The patient&#39;s medical history included heart problem and concomitant medications included Metoprolol.   On 12 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 031L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date, the patient experienced pain in her heart and went to emergency care. The patient said the doctor asked for stress test but the patient could not walk on the treadmill so she was given a shot instead of walking. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable.  The outcome of the event, pain in my heart, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I felt really funny after the vaccine. I picked up my girls and we went to eat. They told me I was very quiet. When we were going home they told me I was swerving, all over the road and they told me to stop, they would drive, I said no, i don&#39;t trust anyone with my car. We got home, I remember changing into my nightgown and was texting someone and I suddenly I stopped. After that I was unresponsive. I would not answer anyone, they said I looked pale and stared into the air. They called my children and they came and emergency personnel was called. I was taken to a hospital and they transferred me to another hospital. I stayed there for 3-4 days. After going home it took me some days to be able to walk without assistance. I wanted to say I had covid in May (1st time) and September (2nd time) . I still do not have taste or smell back from the covid. I can only eat 3 or 4 bites and then I am done.

                                                Patient reported feeling weak, fatigue, fever (102), and loss of appetite. Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

Then she called her brother who is a doctor and he told her to go to Cardiologist and get in. She was talking normal by the time she talked to him.  Adverse reaction was TIA.    TIA symptoms lasted 5-10 minutes max per patient.

I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

                                                Chills, fever, headache, body aches, A couple of nosebleeds, and my arm hurt from the injection site down to the end of my fingers. Headache continued for  four days and fever would come and go but usually at night. I did not receive treatment but I did let my cardiologist office know what was going on. When I continued with the headache, I contacted the internist?s office and I only had a TelMed visit with them. My nostrils had something like cold sores but then I started sneezing and realize there was infection also. Had a second TelMed visit with the PA who started me on an anabiotic Amoxicillian. The infection is clearing up in my sinuses but I am coughing a lot. Overall continue to feel very tired and weary

I was seen by emergency medical personnel, had an EKG, and then my children, with whom I live, took me to see my primary care provider who ordered some basic blood tests: a CBC and panel.  All blood tests were normal as well as the EKG, I assume.  We think the faint was perhaps triggered by the diarrhea and exertion of chores in addition to the vaccine&#39;s effect .    Since then I have had fatigue.

Back in the middle of February the patient had a high-grade small-bowel obstruction ended up with laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.  She was extremely deconditioned.  She came to swing bed here and states here for about 2 weeks.  She thought she was ready to go home and be successful at that time.  Unfortunately, she has gotten home and found that she can barely take care of herself.  She is extremely deconditioned.  She thinks she just needs to be built up for another week or 2 and then could be very successful at home.  She does have a friend that is helping her, but is worried about getting so weak that she end up hurting herself.  I saw her yesterday in the office and thought that another swing bed stay a might be in order.

On an unknown date, the patient experienced a superficial blood clot in her leg (medically significant). She also reported that the area was sore to touch. The doctor prescribed medication to treat her problem, but they said to wait a week to see if it solved on its own before taking it. She was also applying ice pack on the affected area. No further information as reported.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.   The event of superficial blood clot in the leg/area is sore to touch (thrombosis) was unresolved.  The reporter did not provide assessment for the event of superficial blood clot in the leg/area is sore to touch (thrombosis).; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Started feeling weak next day after shot.  As days went by I became increasingly short of breath.  This continued for over 2 weeks and then started having chest pain.  Went to ER and admitted with pericarditis.  2 days later I went into Atrial fib.  The next day I had a cardioversion.  Home the following day.  One week at home not feeling well, I was readmitted with increased chest pain and shortness of breath.  Pulse very low and needed a pacemaker which was inserted Easter Sunday.  Home now and still not feeling well.

Could hear her heart pounding and racing really fast.  Laid down and after 45 minutes to an hour was still racing, so laid back down and when got up the 2nd time her heart was still beating fast but not as bad as when it first happened.  Gradually the symptoms subsided.  Not having problems now.  Did not feel very good Saturday or Sunday, but today is feeling fine.  The first day was the worst.

In addition to the  fast and hard heartbeating for 20 minutes in the evening, I should tell you that I decided to take my Blood Pressure before retiring.  I usually have low BP at about 125/68 or so.  That night I took it and it was  182/160.  I decided that HAD to be wrong so I took it immediately again and the next time it was 165/82.  I decided that this must be anxiety and went to bed.  My son suggested that I should report all this to you anyway.

Can and does happen from time to time for a couple heart beats.  Has all my life.  This time did not stop for 20 or more minutes.  I took an extra propranolol and it went back to normal in a few minutes.  Not positive it was result of injection but thought I should mention.

                                                On January 1, 2021,  patient was admitted to Medical Center with COVID. Tested positive on January 2, 2021. Spent 10 days in hospital. Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

Lasted all night and next day started to get less until Friday morning.  Feeling good that day and went to friends house for dinner.  At end of dinner felt like going to throw up but instead I passed out for 1-2 minutes (have never passed out in my life!).  Medics came and ran several tests but all was okay and I have had no trouble since.

                                                Got the vaccine and was feeling tired, and her arm hurt, an all she wanted to do was lay in bed with her heating pad.  The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

I don&#39;t know how long it had been going on.  Kept pressing nostril for about 30 minutes, bleeding didn&#39;t stop.  I got an ice pack and pressed against nose for 20 minutes, did this off and on 3 times and bleeding finally slowed down and stopped at about 11:00 a.m.  There have been no problems since.  I have had very few nosebleeds due to dry air and they have been short and light.  I have never had one like this.  I don&#39;t know when it started during the night but ended about 11 a.m.  There was a already a lot of blood by 8 a.m.  My daughter thought such a rare event might be connected to the vaccine and that I  should report  it.

We called 911 right away but, by the time EMS arrived, she was unconscious and didn&#39;t appear to be breathing. Patient was not sick at the time this occurred but she was hospitalized in December of 2019 and was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension which required her to go home with and continue on supplemental oxygen. However, she never experienced pulmonary distress after coming home and her SPO2 levels consistently ranged between 96 and 99% with supplemental oxygen. Patient&#39;s death was very sudden and unexpected.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   On 14 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had no pain or soreness, but the area was a little tender if you pushed, and she waited one hour in the hospital afterwards.  As the patient was getting ready to leave, she felt a little lightheaded.  She was driven home, she ate lunch and then worked in the yard for a little bit. As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again. Consent given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, Afib started to act up, blacked out and hit forehead on the door jamb, were resolved on 15 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, area was a little tender and had some bruising near eye, were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 84 year old female patient with medical history including atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, her medical history of heart condition and medication she took could remain a confounder.

On Friday Feb 5 one week later she suffered a major heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital.  There has not been any heart conditions in her medical history her entire life.  The family is wondering is the COVID shot had any thing to cause this and if there have been any other reported cases.

After getting up from bed and eating her usual breakfast, she was returning to her bedroom when she became dizzy and fainted, falling to the floor, hitting her head and suffering other effects, including rhabdomyolysis from being on the floor for a long time after the fall as she was unable to get up. She was transported to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days. She was treated with IV fluids, Tylenol and a short course of antibiotics. While hospitalized, she had a repeat of a rash/swelling at injection site that began about 48 hours after vaccination.  The hospital treated the rash with some barrier cream and within 48, the redness, rash and swelling abated.

The dizziness and vertigo continue through the day Along with chills and nausea throughout the day. My biggest concern was the dizziness which has never happened before. I took her to the emergency room which resulted in a diagnosis of a fractured and displaced clavicle . The dizziness was the most concerning part and they ruled out any cerebrovascular causes. A meclizine 25 mg was given and also prescribe for her when she was discharged. I am a registered pharmacist and is a healthcare provider I looked into the side effects listed. Vertigo and dizziness is not commonly communicated as a adverse effect.

                                                Patient fully recovered from natural SARS-COV-2 infection in early December 2020.  Patient was doing quite well between mid December and mid January.  Patient was hospitalized with congestive heart failure in late January 2021.  Received first dose of Moderna COVID19 vaccine shortly before being discharged around February 1 (not sure of exact date).  Patient was feeling well at that time.    Patient became quite ill within 24 hours of Moderna COVID19 vaccine. Patient steadily worsened during February 2021.  Was hospitalized in mid February (unsure of date) and diagnosed with kidney failure and liver disease.  Congestive heart failure rapidly worsened and previously stable leukemia flared up.  Patient was discharged from hospital February 19 and was placed in quarantine at Care Center.  Patient was considered terminal and was to go into hospice care.  Patient was administered second COVID19 vaccine on February 25, rapidly deteriorated, and died on March 1.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history). Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension.   On 28-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 25-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 20-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficult breathing) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 27-Feb-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood clot in lung) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and PYREXIA (fever). At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (Blood clot in lung), DYSPNOEA (Difficult breathing) and PYREXIA (fever) outcome was unknown.            Treatment details included Heparin, Xarelto.

                                                The following day, food did not taste as it should and water tasted like metal.  By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

She stated it was intense and severe but can&#39;t say how long it lasted.  She was about to call 911 when her symptoms subsided.  She fell asleep and didn&#39;t tell anyone until the next day.  She has felt ok since then but we will be following up with a doctor next week.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine 15 hours after I received the vaccination (3 AM of the morning of February 24) I went to the bathroom to take two Tylenol for a headache. I then used the toilet and started walking back to bed (less than 20 feet away). About halfway there, I I realized something was wrong. The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground right next to my bed. On the way down I think I heard crashing into wood furniture. I don?t know how long I was blacked out; it might have been 10 minutes. I managed to get up onto the bed and felt something wet on my pillow case. It was blood coming from a deep laceration on my chin. My doctor told me to go to urgent care. They sent me to the emergency room. I was kept overnight for observation and give three stitches in my chin. I have felt woozy ever since, but all the tests administered in the hospital showed no damage.

Patient had blood taken at her appointment and was waiting when the nurse came back out and said her blood had clotted so they needed to redraw her blood. She states this has never happened before and wondered if her blood clotting would have been due to her covid vaccine the week prior. She states the first girl who drew her blood was slower than the second time around when a different nurse drew her blood.

Requested vaccine be administered without moving patient from wheelchair. After administration, patient remained in waiting area for recommended 15 minute observation time, then patient&#39;s wheelchair was moved nearby, but still waiting area. Approximately 20 minutes after vaccination, granddaughter called me over to help. Patient was unconscious and appeared not to be breathing, but pulse was palpable. Called for code white. Pharmacist asked granddaughter to hold patient&#39;s head up. Pulse remained palpable, pharmacist administered 1 dose of 0.3mg epinephrine via epi-pen into patient&#39;s left thigh. Patient quickly regained consciousness, spoke to family, said she didn&#39;t feel well. EMS arrived. Patient began to vomit, was placed on stretcher by EMS and left with EMS. A few hours later the granddaughter reported to us that the patient had a UTI and physical exam by ER attributed her experience to untreated infection.

Reports also began having swelling in her feet. Reports having nausea and pain in her chest with walking. She reports she already had trouble with ambulation prior to vaccine, but it has been worse since receiving the vaccine. She reports as of 3/3/21, the pain is still occurring and not getting better.  She has not seen her primary doctor since being vaccinated. I encouraged her to speak with her doctor or schedule a visit with them as her pain is not improving.

                                                Got shot on Wed. 2/10/2021. Started feeling ill within a few hours. Next day, was &#34;sick&#34; and needed to vomit (but didn&#39;t).  Temperatures for 3 days was less than normal.  95.6 to 96.1.  FridayI I started vomiting and had incidents of a pain in my stomach area and by that night became sicker and dehydrated.  Was so sick I couldn&#39;t get out of bed to get water (I live alone).  By midnight Friday (12:00) Feb. 13 I was so sick I called daughter to take me to hospital.  Went to ER and then did blood work.  Blood work showed  liver enzymes were over 500 and eventually reached over 600, when normal is under 100.  Was admitted to hospital.  My electrolytes were out of &#34;whack&#34; too.  My doctor told me in 11 years practice she had never seen a liver enzymes reading over 600.  I am scared to take another vaccine shot at this point.  Note:  I had blood work done Friday, March 5, 2021 and my liver enzymes was 26 -- normal but I am not interested in getting that sick again and I have concerns about my liver.

This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) in an 87-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 029L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Penicillin allergy, Syncope (granddaughter states patient has episodes of syncope) and Wheelchair user.    On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 22-Jan-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) (seriousness criterion medically significant). 22-Jan-2021, the patient experienced URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), BEDRIDDEN (Bedridden) and VOMITING (Patient began to vomit). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) had resolved and URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), BEDRIDDEN (Bedridden) and VOMITING (Patient began to vomit) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   After administration, the patient remained in waiting area for the recommended 15 minutes observation time. Approximately 20 minutes after vaccination, patient was unconscious and appeared not to be breathing, but pulse was palpable. Pharmacist administered 1 dose of 0.3mg epinephrine via epi-pen into patient&#39;s left thigh. The patient quickly regained consciousness, spoke to family, said she did not feel well. Emergency medical services (ems) arrived. The patient began to vomit, was placed on stretcher and left with ems. A few hours later the granddaughter reported that the patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) and physical exam by emergency room (ER) attributed her experience to untreated infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Vomiting is consistent with event safety profile.

Then on 2/11/21 she had an ocular migraine, and as that ended she was hit with an intense pain in her head that she had never experienced before.  It lasted for hours, for the rest of the day.  She took Ibuprofen which did not do anything.  She looked up online and the  clinic had a report on what to do for the migraines, and she took Ibuprofen and strong coffee.  She does that and was able to ward it off and stop it some.  Then it continued to happen during the day and the pain is so intense.  The day before yesterday, 3/9/21 the regimen of coffee and ibuprofen did not improve.  It goes from the top of her head, down to her neck and sore to touch behind her ears.  It is now a dull headache around her whole upper skull.  She lives alone and her children do not live anywhere close to her.  She is also having horrendous fatigue and is not able to get much done such as shopping, also shortness of breath and pounding heart beat generally is very active and some days she is not able to get dressed due to the symptoms.

She knew she did not have macular degeneration as it centers it.  Sometimes it sparkles and has grain to it.  He said that she had an arterial blood, and that leaked from the carotid artery into the eye has not completely sealed off.  She can see out of the right eye perfectly, but she cannot see a little out of the left eye.  If she&#39;s watching the TV she can see the top of the newscasters hair, but she cannot see anything below that.  Her vision is upward either, can see out of either side, but cannot below horizontal down.  He told her that it was basically a stroke that didn&#39;t reach her brain and went to her eye.  He told her to return to see him (ophthalmologist) on 5/18/21 at 10:00 AM.  She also is to see her PCP on 5/20/21.

She was started on a little bit of oral Lasix and was supposed to come see provider later in the week.  She states she has diuresed very aggressively the last few days and is feeling quite a bit less short of breath.  In the ER, her EKG did not show anything acute.  Troponin was normal.  BNP was mildly elevated, but her imaging did not show any signs of acute congestive heart failure.  Her D-dimer was elevated.  However, she was not having any pain while she was in the emergency room.  Her pulse was normal and her oxygen saturations were in the high 90s.

Please see PA&#39;s note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure &#43;/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient&#39;s response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time. Please see MDM section and the rest of the note for further information on patient assessment and treatment.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history reported).    On 12-Mar-2021 at 1:30 PM, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 13-Mar-2021, the patient experienced OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED (oxygen level was low) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (could not get up or walk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (muscle weakness in her legs) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 14-Mar-2021 to 17-Mar-2021 due to GAIT DISTURBANCE, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS and OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED. The patient was treated with Rehabilitation therapy for Gait disturbance. At the time of the report, OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED (oxygen level was low), GAIT DISTURBANCE (could not get up or walk) and MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (muscle weakness in her legs) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 13-Mar-2021, Blood test: normal (normal) Normal. On 13-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Low.         No concomitant medications were reported.  The treatment information included oxygen for 2-3 days.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Further information has been requested.
