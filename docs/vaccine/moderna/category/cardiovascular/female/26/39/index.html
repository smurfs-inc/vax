                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

Starting 1/3, I have a swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit (the same side I received the vaccine). My employer is sending me for a COVID-19 PCR today to rule out any active infection. Tylenol has been taken as needed for the headache.

                                                It was noted during injection a tremendous amount of pain/stinging/burning that lasted a few minutes. About 20 minutes post injection, numbness/tingling noted in pinky/5th finger radiating down palm to wrist on same arm as injection as well as dizziness. Notified observation RNs and moved to a separate room. Mildly elevated BP but normal HR noted. No rash/hives/difficulty breathing. Numbness and tingling would migrate - most often to thumb but sometimes up entire arm. Released 1 hour after injection after no life threatening signs noted.  Visited PCP the next day (1/6) at 10:15. Professional opinion that it is due to swelling from injection - now noticeable area of swelling around injection site. Recommended ice and NSAIDs.

                                                Beginning 1/11/2020, I began experiencing an uncomfortable sensitivity in my left axilla. I have a history of  inflamed lymph nodes that occurs 1-2 times a year under the arm and in the groin, and this felt similar to those episodes. The lymph node is hard to touch and the sensitivity continues today. Today (1/13/2020), I noticed an inflamed, red patch of skin that is hot to touch over the region where the injection occurred. Additionally, I have experienced diarrhea 1-2x/day for the past two days.

                                                Received first injection 1 weeks ago. The first few days I experienced normal symptoms such as pain and redness. Following that I had no symptoms. On Friday, (1/15) I noticed that the left-side lymph node in neck/collar bone area was swollen. The area felt similarly to that of a cyst. Starting Friday night, I began taking amoxicillin to prevent a bacterial infection. The swelling/cyst like bump on my neck/collarbone has decreased in size, but the vaccination sight has become very red, swollen, and itchy at times.

Then on day 4 a dull chest discomfort started again which I have had every since (now on day 8 post vaccine).  When i woke up on day 8 post vaccine I noticed left deltoid swelling and tenderness in the arm that I received the vaccine a week ago. I only had arm swelling for 1-2 days post vaccine and then another onset on day 8 (1/20/21). Also have some left armpit tenderness 3 days ago.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received my first dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 15th. My arm was a little sore that day and the next, but it really wasn&#39;t that bad. Late on Saturday, January 16th I noticed a rash around my neckline/collar bone area that was on both sides, but more prominent on the right. The rash was red with many bumps that were not raised and were not fluid filled or blistering. The next day, Sunday (17th) the rash seemed to worsen but stay localized to that area. Monday morning (18th) I woke up with a tender right armpit indicating to me that I have a swollen lymph node. I noticed later that morning that the rash had spread bilaterally to my biceps and chest. Today is Wednesday the 20th, and while the rash looks slightly better around my neckline, the rash has now spread all over my breasts, abdomen, and a little bit to my hips. The right arm pit continues to be tender today.  I took Benadryl (25 mg) Sunday night (17th) and applied hydrocortisone cream to the rash when it was just along my neckline.

Later that morning I was light headed, fatigued, sore throat, nausea. The fever continued to increase. By 2200 that day my fever was 104.7 and that was with Tylenol on board. I also iced my groins and axillary areas to help cool my body. Today is the second day out from the vaccine and I have recovered from the fevers. My fever early this morning was still 102.5 but has since passed and I am normothermic. I am very fatigued with some chest pains.

                                                Two days after the shot in Colorado I began to develop a rash on my right arm at the injection site.  I had flown back to North Carolina where I am on a student rotation at a hospital the day after the vaccine (Sunday 1/17).  Since then (Monday 1/18) the rash has expanded to my entire upper arm and is continuing to extend downwards.  I had swelling for about a day but that went away.  I had some swollen lymph nodes in my axilla and neck but they are no longer swollen.  Now my arm remains extremely itching and red.  I went to the ED this evening and they gave me IV Solumedrol, Pepcid, and famotidine.  The rash went away except for outside of a line of demarcation we made earlier in the day.  This morning I woke up with an intense itching in the arm.  I rubbed my hand over it (didn?t itch it) and the redness  came right back.  It is continuing to expand down my arm.

                                                I am not sure if the event that happened Sunday was directly related to the vaccine at all since it happened two days later, or if it was just a coincidence, or if the vaccine was just a physical stimulus trigger. I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

At approximately 1:00 AM, I started experiencing a fever (101.3 F), chills, aches, and some heart palpitations. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen, which helped to reduce the fever and chills.  When I woke up, I was nauseous, had a serious headache, fatigue, minor chills, a fever (101.3 F) and more noticeable heart palpitations (when measured with my smartwatch, it reported bpm of 118-124). I had a virtual consult with a physician who advised me to be seen by urgent care immediately.

                                                I first started feeling very cold around 5:00 PM that day. Once I went home I went to sleep around 10:30 and work up at 2:30 AM with vomiting and 8/10 epigastric pain that radiated to my back. I went to the hospital. They gave me morphine and Zofran but within 5 minutes of the first dose of morphine, my pain returned even more intense and I still vomited 20 minutes after the Zofran. So they pushed another Morphine and Zofran. Zofran helped at this point but the Morphine did not. At this point they gave my three different oral liquids to help calm down my epigastric region, including mylanta, lidocaine and a third medication. I went home and slept the rest of the day but Wednesday night I got diarrhea and spike a fever of 102.7 around 8PM. Now it&#39;s thursday morning and I still have a 2/10 epigastric pain, physically exhausted and had a fever this morning as well.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes under both arms, urgent care, referred to ultrasound tech, mammogram, referred to general surgeon (awaiting appointment). Lymph nodes stayed swollen after first dose, got worse after second dose, and have been swollen since.   Swollen lymph nodes in neck, hard to breathe, went to hospital, told it was just the vaccine and to wait it out. Lymph nodes in neck went down in swelling after 2-3 days.  Irregular menstrual cycle, started approximately 2 weeks after first dose. Have had a menstrual cycle for 5 days every 9-12 days since first dose.  Hospitalized for stroke-like symptoms (lost vision, couldn&#39;t form sentences) on 5 Feb 21. Discharged after CT scan and MRI came back fine.

D/c on steroid dose pack, beta blockers, cough suppressant. Follow up with cardio and pulm. Now seeing immunologist as well who started me on corticosteroid inhaler, monteleukast. Running more blood work soon. PCP gave albuterol inhaler, did round of antibiotics, orders to use incentive spirometer for breathing capacity. Waiting on pulmonology follow up and 30 day holter monitor, stress ecg, and other cardiac tests.

                                                I received my vaccine in my right arm around 3:20 pm on 1/5/21. My right arm started getting sore later that evening. The following day, 1/6/21, my arm was very sore and the injection site was tender to touch. I felt feverish and had chills. I also had a headache and felt very fatigued. I took some Advil that morning. I evaluated my arm in the evening and noticed a large red rash streaking down my right arm from the injection site. It measured approximately 3.5 in X 1.5 in. The rash was red, raised, painful, and firmer than my surrounding skin. I took 500 mg of Tylenol before bed. The next morning, 1/7/21, the rash had grown larger. The border of the rash was marked and I took an antihistamine around 7:00 am. At 1:00 pm the rash had grown larger, now measuring approximately 4.25 in X 2.25 in. My lymph nodes in my right armpit were also beginning to get sore. I visited the nurse practitioner at my hospital?s employee health clinic around 1:40 pm and we agreed to monitor my signs and symptoms at that time. The following morning, 1/8/21, the rash was bigger, but my skin was softer and more of a pink color than red. My arm did not hurt as much, though my right armpit was slightly more sore. Today, 1/9/21, my symptoms are much better. I have only slight soreness in my right arm and armpit. My rash has nearly resolved, though it is slightly itchy where the rash was.

I had nausea, chills, felt very lethargic and sore to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand at work, and had a pounding headache.  The site where I got the vaccine was also more tender and sore than usual after a vaccination.  I left work early around 3 pm, took 400 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and tried to get as much sleep as I could.  By 6 am on 1/13/21, all these symptoms had gone away, but now I&#39;ve noticed a very swollen lymph node just above my left clavicle.

About 10 minutes after that, I became light headed and dizzy again along with chest tightness, palpitations and an itchy throat. My heart rate was in the 110s. My symptoms would be on and off. I received more Benadryl in the ED with no resolution. I then was given an epi pen and prednisone. After this the itchy throat and light headedness resolved. I was observed in the ED for a total of 4 hours. I was discharged with 4 days of prednisone and 2 days of Benadryl.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

                                                She presented to the hospital with acute typical angina approximately 72 hours after receiving her 2nd vaccine dose. The morning following her vaccine she developed fever, chills, generalized malaise, myalgias, and fatigue lasting about 48 hours. The following morning, she was awoken from sleep by a crushing substernal chest pain with associated typical anginal symptoms. Her initial troponin-I was elevated at 7.47 ng/mL and peaked at 19.19 ng/mL. An ECG demonstrated minimal ST elevations followed by an echocardiogram demonstrated preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of 60-65%. Due to her elevation in cardiac enzymes and persistent angina, coronary angiography was performed revealing no obstructive coronary artery disease. She was diagnosed with suspected myocarditis and treated successfully with anti-inflammatory medication. In follow-up, she had an uncomplicated treatment course with complete resolution of anginal systems and improvement in troponin and inflammatory markers.

                                                So I got the vaccine Monday night after work. Tuesday and Wednesday I ran a super high fever, body aches, lymphnode swelling on that side. No big deal . Well Thursday morning I woke up with a rash on both of my legs and my legs swollen like tree trunks. It?s a petechial rash. I called the pharmacist told to take Benadryl and Zyrtec since Friday. So I went to the doctors last night since I still have this rash and it hasn?t gotten any better with Benadryl and Zyrtec.  I got blood work done today. And I have  to get an arterial and venous Doppler done on Wednesday next week. They are concerned I may have blood clots since my legs are so swollen with a petechial rash. They are also giving me steroid tapper.

On 1/3/2021 my armpit became very swollen and painful, on 1/4/2021 the Right arm where I received the injection became severely painful, dull throbbing ache from shoulder down to my fingers. On 1/5/2021 my Right arm was now swollen, hot to the touch and a small red circle was forming on my bicep and pain continued to worsen. Today 1/6/2021 I saw my primary care physician that confirmed there is swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit and swelling at the site. The redness of the spot increased in size from the size of a dime to now the size of a half dollar.

Heart rate was checked by medical professional in household and was found to be 120 and irregular. This lasted approximately 2 minutes. At this time also felt shortness of breath which lasted 30 minutes. Once the tachycardia and shortness of breath ended, I was getting chills and continued to have nausea and extreme fatigue. Since the vaccination my arm has continued to be very sore. When I woke up on 1/8/2021 I am still very fatigued and still have a sore arm.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 15 Jan 2021, approximately five minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 15 Jan 2021, five minutes after the vaccine was administered, at 11:15am, the patient complained of lip swelling and throat itching. A healthcare provider assessed the patient and vital signs included, pressure 132/103 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats per minute, and 100 percent oxygen saturation. At 11:22am, the patient had facial edema, oropharyngeal edema and attempted to clear her throat. Vital signs reported at that time included, blood pressure 143/106 mmHg, heart rate 121 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 99 percent. Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine 50mg and epinephrine by injection twice. Emergency services were called to transport the patient, however, the patient declined transport.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, lip swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of lips swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema. The events occurred within minutes after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

                                                I had arm soreness the day of the vaccine (2/11/21). The following day I noticed an erythematous round lesion that was very tender and when palpated felt like a lump. The pain went away 2-3 days after the vaccine and the erythema/lump went away on 2/21/21. On 2/19/21 my left internal arm felt sore. I thought I pulled a muscle perhaps. On 2/21/21 the arm pain was worse and didn&#39;t feel like typical soreness that would come from exercise or sleeping in the wrong position. It was painful when I pulled my arm close to my body, as if something were being compressed. I palpated in the armpit and found a large lump slightly smaller than a golf ball. It was extremely tender and sent me into a panic. Someone pointed out it was the same arm as my vaccination, so I looked it up and learned about this side effect. Today (2/22/21), the pain is gone and the lump is smaller (feel like a typical enlarged lymph node).

She had localized increased warmth over the left upper outer arm where the vaccine was given at the deltoid.  There was a raised area of skin in a serpiginous pattern circumferentially 3.5 across and 4.5cm in length.  It was blanching and not firm. She had 1 soft lymph node palpable at the left axilla, tender and 1.5cm in size.  She has had no other symptoms other than pain at the injection site for 2 immediately days after the injection was given.  I advised that she fill out the information for v-safe and asked that she report any further program to both v-safe and our office.

As she parked her car she saw another vaccine recipient walking to the ambulance for treatment and started feeling very anxious with a faster heart rate.  RN spoke to patient on site and she had no other complaints.  Patient monitored for a total of 30 minutes without further complaint.  Patient advised to call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room for any additional issues if needed.  Also advised to sign up for v-safe.  Patient left site stating she was feeling better (also saw other vaccine recipient return to car quickly and she said that helped).

                                                This is my second pregnancy and at the time of my vaccination, I was 32 weeks 6 days gestation with an estimated delivery date of 2/15/21.  I tolerated the vaccine well initially with only a very minor sore arm the day after the vaccine. On 12/31/2020 (4 days after vaccination), I felt muscle fatigue around my hips and buttocks as well as significant fatigue. It seemed to improve over the course of the day and was not very noticeable for the next few days. On 1/4/21 (8 days after vaccination), my muscle fatigue in my hips, buttocks, thighs, and hamstrings bilaterally became very significant, preventing me from doing some activities that I had planned. I also had generalized fatigue. On 1/5/21, I had similar symptoms, but the muscle fatigue also began to include my shoulders bilaterally. 1/6/21, the muscle fatigue also included my neck and I was physically exhausted. 1/7/21 I started to note some improvement, and I also saw my OB who did bloodwork but also did suspect a possibly delayed reaction to my vaccine. Today (1/9/21) I am still experiencing muscle fatigue, but it does seem to be improved from several days ago.

Swelling and redness lasted two days. Swelling was circular around injection site--still swollen now/4 days after. Aches lasted about 2 days. Once the redness subsided, the injection site became extremely itchy and still is to date.   Please note, I am 10 months postpartum and still breastfeeding.

Then I started having progressive redness, swelling and itching at injection site. By day 8 (after vaccine) I had a 4x4? hard lump at injection site spreading from my deltoid to my elbow. Numbness and tingling in hand. Swollen, palpable lymph nodes in left armpit. Treated with Keflex and Zyrtec. Symptoms improved after 2 days on antibiotics and resolved after 7 days with the exception of tenderness and soreness which is ongoing. There was question if the vaccine was given too low and how much was in deltoid.

On 1/7/2021 I started to feel short of breath and run down. Sinus infection symptoms. I was sent home from work to get a COVID swab. That evening I lost my taste and began to feel achey. Negative test on 1/10/21. Saw urgent care on 1/9/21 for Covid swab and visit. He diagnosed viral and was sure I was positive. On 1/11/21 my energy returned and I wasn?t achey. Congestion and cough. By 1/13/21 felt fine other than lingering wet cough. This morning, 1/14/21 I noticed my arm itched and looked at it and I?ve got a small red rash around the injection sight and tenderness on palpation.

                                                Rash similar to Sulfa rash, started about 24-30 hours after first shot (taken in my left arm). I noticed an eczema style patch on my right hand then shortly after my arms started resending and looking splotchy. I had a sulfa rash reaction to a steroid in 2009 that also showed up after a day or two so I recognized it and started taking Benadryl.  It seems to be helping but not completely clearing the rash. My blood pressure was also high this morning, which is abnormal for me.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

                                                On day 5 after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I woke up in the morning to feeling pain on my left armpit where the lymph nodes are located. The pain feels tender and constant. It helps to take tylenol to decrease the pain.   My left armpit feels tender and sore. It looks a bit swollen. I know I slept on my left arm, so it may be sore from that, but it does not feel like arm strain. It is just on my armpit area I feel the pain and discomfort. I do not feel pain on my injection site.  It is now day two that I am experiencing this pain. I do not feel pain on my right arm or armpit.

Dizziness and severe nausea started and blood pressure decreased. Trouble concentrating and tingling in hands and feet. I was taken to the Emergency Room and hooked up to an IV and Heart Monitoring. I was given IV Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, and Zofran. I was going to get an injection of Epinephrine but my heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly after the first batch of IV meds and they were concerned that the Epinephrine may have made things worse. I was monitored for 4 hours and then discharged with instructions to take Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for 5 days, Prednisone 60mg every day for 5 days, Pepcid 40mg twice a day for 5 days and given a prescription for an Epi-Pen. I remained very nauseous and dizzy foe the next 48 hours. My injection site became swollen, red, and tender 48 hours after my injection and then re-flared up 11 days after my injection on 01/17/21.

                                                Around 5:30 PM I began experiencing normal symptoms like headache and muscle ache. At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

                                                12/31 8:30am noticed maculopapular erythematous rash mostly on torso (few lesions on extremities), itchy scalp, and mild edema/erythema at RT corner of bottom lip. Also had mild pain on ball of RT foot, thought I had stepped on something. 1:30pm woke up with severe edema of bottom lip, rash also on scalp next to ears 3pm seen at urgent care, received and filled prednisone prescription  4pm lip edema started improving, so did not end up taking the prednisone 8pm lip edema gone, erythema and mild edema to DIP joint and tips of fingers, all fingers of LT hand and RT pinky. All hand joints and wrists sore. Soreness to toes and heels while walking but not at rest. Applied ice to fingers, then turned up heat. 1/1 3-4am finger edema/erythema totally resolved 8am foot pain starts resolving 5pm still with mild wrist pain, mild foot pain. Rash evolving -- most lesions improved but some have coalesced, new lesions on neck  Never any fever, checked x2, Tmax 99.0F. Did not end up taking any medications since my symptoms seemed to be resolving. Only other possible recent exposures were a new lotion tried 12/27 (but only applied to face, was careful to keep it away from my lips, and I did not have any rash on my face except the swollen lip) and a new dress that I did not pre-wash (but I had few lesions on my arms which would have also been exposed).

                                                A week after receiving the COVD19 vaccine, red patches of skin started appearing around the injection site.  Patches were not itchy.  Armpit area (lymph nodes) was painful, as well as general pain in left arm.  The next day the rash had gotten larger and left arm started tingling.  Arm pain persisted.  On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

                                                The onset of symptoms started around 9:15am. I experienced numbness and tingling to bilateral feet and lower legs. I experienced dizziness. I also experienced an increased heart rate (160s-170s BPM). I was hyperventilating and had difficulty with breathing. I was pale and cold.  I had uncontrollable shakes. My BP was a bit higher than my normal but not hypertensive.  I was given candy and juice after onset of symptoms. ( I did have an English muffin prior to receiving the vaccine). My symptoms subsided for some time but then came back about 15 minutes later. These symptoms continued to occur about every 15 minutes for a period of close to 2 hours. I was given Benadryl 50mg PO after the first hour of symptoms. I continued to experience the symptoms for up to about 45 minutes after being given Benadryl. My symptoms began to subside and eventually stopped after the 2 hour mark.

She was scared to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Then she said she did feel SOB and throat feels tight. I grabbed the EPI pen and injected 0.3mg into lateral right thigh. Brought patient to our emergency room, administered Benadryl 25mg (2 caps) po. Started IV NaCl 1000 mL in RAC. Administered famotidine 20mg/2ml IPV over 2 minutes. Currently on slow IV drip, 2nd bag. Patient is doing well. She was initially shaky after the EPI pen but throat did not feel tight less than 10 minutes after injection. Currently is relaxed as I monitor her. Vitals have been stable.

I felt asleep around 0100 the next morning- missed work this day. Went for COVID test (negative) and about 30 minutes post test began feeling weak and faint. Went to Emergency Dept, receive a liter of normal saline.   By vital signs I remained orthostatic( hypoxia and tachycardia upon standing) symptoms remained the rest of the day.  1/5- fatigued but other symptoms resolved  1/6-  symptoms resolved 100%

                                                I received my vaccination at my place of work. Local pharmacy came in to administer them.  In less then a minute of recieving the vaccination I experienced a tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  I told my symptoms to the  pharmacist that was there.  I had to take my mask off due to the difficulty breathing.  I sat down and was trying to catch my breath.  Roughly 10 -15 minutes passes then my throat began to swell.  My extremities were feeling tingly and I was very dizzy.  I sat with my neck extended to maintain my airway until they could locate some benedryl.  My voice was wheezy when attempting to answer questions the pharmacist was asking.  The pharmacist wanted to administer the EpiPen but I would not allow her to because then they would have to call 911.  It took about 45 minutes in total to locate benedryl.  I took 50 mg.  Roughly 15 -20 minutes after taking the benedryl I was able to breath with ease.  I waited about another 15 minutes at the facility to ensure I was ok.  I was told I would not be recieving the second dose due to my anaphylactic reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I spoke with the nurses regarding previous vaccine reactions, and we all agreed that I would take Benadryl first, and then get the vaccine. However, about 5-10 minutes after I got the vaccine, I began feeling very itchy, which is usually a precursor to when I develop hives. The nurses kept a close eye on me and got my vitals. They said my pulse was a little high, but that I was ok to go, since I had stayed my 30 minutes afterward and my vitals were ok. Throughout the day, I became even more itchy, and that night, I had hives everywhere, a low grade fever, and a migraine like headache. Because I did not have an itchy throat, and I have developed these symptoms before with the flu vaccine (and other allergies), I did not go to the doctor. The side effects took about a day to a day and a half to go away.

                                                Beginning on Thursday, I had pain under my left arm, likely in lymph node. By Friday, I had pain under my right arm as well. On Saturday morning, I had a large red oval-shaped spot on my arm, starting about half an inch under the injection site. It was hot to the touch and the skin felt harder than the surrounding skin. It was not itchy or painful, but did cause some minor discomfort if I raised my arm high. Today, the color has faded to pink, but it is still a similar size.

                                                Moderate pain at the injection site lasted ~36 hours after shot. Six days after vaccine was given, I experienced an enlarged lymph node on the left side base of my neck. The lymph node was about the size of a dime, firm, and tender to the touch. Minimal armpit pain was experienced (similar to an ingrown hair), except there wasn&#39;t an ingrown hair. On the 7th day, about  15 hours after noticing the enlarged lymph node, swelling and tenderness has reduced, but has not disappeared completely.

                                                About 10pm I developed chill but was already taking tylenol and motrin because I had a headache.  About 1am I developed a fever of 101.5 which had went to 102.1 and for 24 hrs I could not get it down below 101.   On Tues I woke up at 2am soaked in sweat but the fever had broke for about 12 hrs. I developed another fever of 100.5 but it went away with no medication.  I felt better the next day but the fever returned later along with SOB and because the fever returned it prompted me to go to the urgent care where a chest xray was done.  The xray showed my lungs were inflamed.  On 1/19 I developed the same SOB, chest tighness and another fever of 101.  I reached out to my doctor and had an office visit where another xray was done but normal and was started on the Flovent enhaler to help with the SOB and breathing.

                                                After the vaccine I got chills beginning at 10pm.  About 1am I got a fever but was already taking started tylenol and motrin because I developed a headache also.  The fever went as high as 101.2.  On Tuesday I woke at 2am soaked in sweat and the fever had broke.  Later that day the fever returned at 100.5 but broke on its on.  By Saturday I woke up again with SOB and super cold.  Fever had returned at 101 so I went to Urgent Care  because the fever just kept returning.  A chest xray was done and it showed my lungs were really inflammed.  The fever returned later but went away.  The SOB is still here.  And on  1/19 I got the same feeling with SOB, 101.1 fever and felt awful all over again. So I visited with my PCP and another chest Xray and blood work was done again.  The chest xray showed normal but was started on a Flovent enhaler to help with the breathing and SOB.

Chest felt tight, upper stomach in extreme discomfort,  Hard to see, lights hurting eyes, seeing spots in the air.  Sound became amplified and began to experience a migraine.  &#34;People talking low to me felt like they were screaming into my ear drums.&#34; Extreme fatigue so could barely keep eyes open.  Standing was difficult; moved to wheelchair. Most symptoms lasted 2 to 3 days.  Fever of 102 on first day only.  Fatigue for one week.  Right upper arm, not at the injection site, had a &#34;hive&#34; about the size of a nickel that has not gone away (as of 2/23/21).   New migraines with light sensitivity that affect ability to work also have not gone away (as of 2/23/21).

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

This got better. On day 7 after getting the vaccine I developed a firm, raised, HOT and extremely itchy area at the site of injection. This is measuring at 5cm by 5 cm on my Left deltoid.  This continues to get larger and larger.  I have also had daily headaches since the vaccine was given. I seen a doctor who recommended calling the CDC who then advised me to complete a VAERS report.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the first dose of moderna vaccine on my right arm, my arm felt numb and tingly.  My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

                                                Just over 24 hours after I received the COVID-19 vaccine I had a syncope episode while standing talking to others at work. I began feeling hot, started feeling like I was sweating, started seeing black and white lines, and then fainted. The symptoms came on very quickly. I did not remember falling and we believe I hit my head on the corner of a table when I fell, and I had to get 3 staples in my head. I have no other medical concerns at this time, and all of the test run at the ER showed no concerns. At the ER they ran labs, took a CT scan, and did an EKG. I was released from the ER after about 4 hours. I have had a 3 other episode previously when I felt like I was going to pass out, most recent March 2020, but they were linked to the flu and strep. This event has not been linked to either of those conditions at this time, and my doctor encouraged me to report it.

This happened during the observation period and then I was sent to the ED.  About a week later, on the left arm, looked like I had hives, it was swollen and warm to the touch, pain went down into my wrist. I went to Urgent Care.

                                                Painful arm until Sunday, then throat felt tight, thought it was acid reflux so I took some tums. The heart palpitations started shortly after. Worse when lying down and almost felt short of breath. The heart palpitations continued until Monday night and Tuesday I woke up and palpitations resolved. I have only ever had this reaction one other time when had the Mirena. Symptoms resolved after having it removed but wasn?t sure what ingredients caused it. Now I believe there may be a common ingredient.

Then rapid heart rate and chest tightness by 2.5hrs post vaccine. I went to urgent Care and they thought it was an allergic reaction (BP 182/90, HR 82) and gave me 125mg solumedrol and Benadryl intramuscularly which caused worsened dizziness and a racing heart which caused me to collapse and they gave me a epi pen and called 911. I was transferred to ER and they completed EKG which was normal and monitored vitals for a few hours and I was released. I continue to remain extremely dizzy and nauseated 2days after the vaccine.

My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

                                                12 hours after injection (1/8/2021) I began running a low grade fever (99.8), experiencing a debilitating headache, had injection site tenderness as well as swelling the size of a baseball. I iced the injection site and put compression on, in case it was a hematoma from the injection. From 1/8/2021 -1/10/2021 I continued to run a low grade fever, never reaching above 100 degrees. I had full body aches and was exhausted as if a bus ran me over. The injection site swelling slowly reduced with continued ice and compression. From 1/10/2021 - 1/13/2021 I did not have a fever, however I continued to experience intermittent headaches that were as painful as several days prior. I felt chronically exhausted as well. On 1/14/2021 I began to run a low grade fever again (99.8). At this point the injection side swelling was a 6.5cm x 5cm ring of what I believe to be induration. Headache and exhaustion persisted. Friday 1/15/2021 I did not have a fever, but I began to notice that simple tasks such as walking to the kitchen were increasingly difficult. When checked, my oxygen saturation was 98 percent, but my heart rate was 115 while sitting. Saturday 1/16/2021 I began running a fever again, this time reaching 100 degrees. I developed a full body rash, red spots never raised. Again, I continued to have extreme exhaustion and headaches and tachycardia. I took some benadryl to help with the rash. Sunday 1/17/2021 the rash and fever returned, headaches and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia continued. Monday 1/18/2021 I began having a sore throat, fever and rash developed again. Headache and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia as well. Tuesday 1/19/2021 my fever elevated to 100.5, headache, exhaustion, sore throat, tachycardia. However, by Tuesday there was no longer red visible spots. My entire body still itched and felt as if there was a burning sensation, however I could not find any visible red spots to correlate with the itching and burning. Today Wednesday 01/20/2021 I have never felt worse. My entire body feels like it has been repeatedly ran over by a semi truck. My throat hurts. My head hurts. My body burns as if it&#39;s on fire. I am so incredibly tired I feel like it&#39;s an extreme sport just to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom. My fever today 01/20/2021 reached a new 101.4, I&#39;m still tachycardic. Oxygen saturation is within normal limits. However, the induration around the injection site seems to have almost completely resolve.

                                                The vaccine itself was well tolerated with just some injection site pain and minor body aches the next day. Then, last night I took miralax and had an allergic reaction to it. I have taken miralax in the past and I have tolerated it well. This is my first time taking miralax since the Covid vaccine and I suspect it is related since there is polyethylene glycol in the vaccine. About 10 minutes after taking the miralax (in water) I had chest and throat tightness, rash on my chest and face, severe facial flushing, and itching. After that began to resolve I had chills, rigors, and aches in every joint. I had not eaten or consumed anything else and had no exposure to any other potential allergens.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 10:45a, I then went next door to be monitored for 15 minutes. Within a few minutes, I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I waited out the 15 minutes and went back to my office. When I got into my office I still felt lightheaded and I informed my supervisor. I explained to him that I was going to try and eat something and drink some water and I would feel better. I went into my office and continued to work for the next hour. After that hour, I began to feel very dizzy and &#34;out of it&#34; as I almost didn&#39;t know where I was at. I went to speak to my supervisor and I sat down in his office where I almost fainted. He took me back to my office where I sat with another co-worker. Duri time, I continued to feel light headed, although it came in waves. My husband drove me home, I showered, ate something and was feeling better. Around 6:00p, I began to feel lightheaded again and began to experience body aches, hot and cold flashes that would come in waves. Saturday morning, I woke up feeling better, but around 10:00a I began to experience the same symptoms. I laid down for a few hours that would get up and attempt tasks around the house, then I would  ended up back in bed at 6:00p with the same symptoms again. I did meet virtually with a doctor and she explained to me to wait it out. On Monday, I met with my pcp and she informed me of the same, that these symptoms would eventually go away. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the only symptom that remained was the dizziness. At times, I still will feel dizzy for instance Saturday morning I woke up and felt pretty dizzy throughout the day.

                                                It was 7 mins after the shot, I started feeling my throat closing up, like a golf ball. they gave me an epi pen it helped a little bit but went to the ER. When the epi wore off I was having issues, I had it again 4-5 times. I had a hard time getting air in and out. I was admitted to the ICU for an Epi drip. The stayed over night and they winged me off the Epi and sent me home.  I was home for a couple days, and in my kitchen not doing anything I felt like my air way was closing, my husband gave me Epi pen and took me to the ER. They have more IM Epi  (3x) and steroids and Benadryl.  I had  a CT of my brain because I had the worst headache and it came back ok. I was there for 6-8 hours and it cleared up after 3 doses of Epi.  A week after I was eating in the Cafeteria, my throat started to itch and took the Epi pen and gave myself a dose and took Benadryl, it did not get better. I ended up really struggling to catch my breath, I went down to the ER and they gave me another Epi and started Epi drip- I went again to the ICU for the night, more Epi, steroids and Benadryl. By the morning I felt a lot better and went home.  I have seen my PCP and waiting to see my Allergist.  Randomly I have just been getting rashes, my face, cheeks and nose, patchy rashes that will come and go.

The nurse who administered the vaccine inspected the injection site and did not see any issues. The patient stayed in the area for 50 minutes for monitoring. Her vital signs were taken and were within normal limits, she ambulated in the room and moved her right upper extremity freely including coordination exercises.  Numbness/coldness was still present at 13:42, but slowly improved.  As of 01/07/2021, patient&#39;s arm numbness has resolved but has had intermittent tingling in legs and feet.  Continuing to monitor.

At got better and was normal by day 3.  Today, 7 days from day of injection, I woke up with my left arm (injection side) sore and inflamed, arm was warm to touch and hurt when I pushed. There&#39;s a mass of dense/sore area, sort of feels like a dense lump.  Area around on skin is itchy - has been this way all day. Tonight the swollenness and itchiness is traveling into left armpit as well.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

I was told that my lips and cheeks were swollen and that my eyes were red. I was first given benadryl (25 mg) and prednisone (20 mg). I was later given epinephrine ( 0.3 mg/0.3mL injection). I was then taken to the emergency room where they prescribed the above medications to be taken for 3 days (minus the epinephrine).

                                                Beginning Saturday morning, I began to experience hives, coming and going throughout the day. There were 2 significant episodes on Saturday, one Sunday morning, two throughout the day on Monday. Beginning Tuesday morning, I experienced hives that continued throughout the day. Starting around 1:00 pm, they moved from a more localized area on my upper trunk to covering my entire body, head to toe. I became hypotensive (lowest was 90/60), tachycardic (pulse rate ranging from 100-125), low grade temperature (100.4), noticed a tingling feeling in my lips, a new onset sore throat, and ringing in my ears. My pulse ox remained stable, no oxygen required. I took a claritin chewable approximately 10 minutes after onset of worsening symptoms, then 50 mg of benadryl 3 hours later.  I have continued to take 25 mg of benadryl BID since Tuesday and have remained without any new onset of hives. No medical admissions were required, although I do work in a medical clinic and close observation was available for me.  Only symptom remaining is fatigue, unsure if this is related to benadryl usage or remaining vaccine reaction.

At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

My pulse and blood pressure went up. I got dizzy and lightheaded. Maybe 5-7 minutes after the onset, it started to get better on its own. No medicine was given. The paramedic did an ekg which was normal. My blood pressure and pulse also went back to normal.  My oxygen level was normal. Later that evening and the following day, the only noticeable difference was extreme fatigue and a headache. I was dizzy and lightheaded for a few hours after.

Diphenhydramine, famotidine, methylprednisolone, and a LR bolus was administered.  Following IM epinephrine administration, the patient&#39;s hemodynamic instability promptly improved along with her mentation.  Patient was monitored for 4.5 hours before being discharged home under the care of her partner with a EpiPen autoinjector kit.

                                                Patient had her first Moderna COVID vaccination at 4:00 PM today and 5 min later felt dizziness, worsening, associated with headache, nausea, sore throat, hot flashes, and dizziness is from side to side when she looks at her phone, no dizziness when she does not look at it. Patient primary complaint is headache on bilateral temples. All other symptoms resolved, and no dizziness if not looking at phone.  Patient has history of headaches, similar in quality, but this is more intense (6/10 intensity, less than her scoliosis pains, but more than usual headache pain), but otherwise the same, pounding sensation, and she can feel throbbing. Headache is about the same currently. Started simultaneously as dizziness, immediately, unchanged. No changes in vision. Peak intensity of headache around 30 min after onset, peak at 4:30 or so.  Patient notified the vaccine clinic staff and was instructed to be observed in another area, and did not improve. Patient remembered that her initial blood pressure was low and it fluctuated. Patient was then sent to the ED.  Upon initial assessment in the Emergency Department 2 hours after her initial injection, the assessment is likely vasovagal near syncope with tension headache, rather than true allergic reaction. Given metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, normal saline, and obtained labs.

Shortly after that shot i had a sore arm and left armpit lymph nodes for a few days. I noticed yesterday, a week after the shot, the lymph nodes were still a little sore. Then yesterday afternoon, my left shoulder started itching like crazy at the injection site, lasting for a couple hours. I looked and it was red where it itched, like three splotches the size of quarters but not very defined. This morning it is red over a larger swath, like a palm and a half on my shoulder. Feels sore and slightly hard under the skin, rather than itchy.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  SHORTNESS OF BREATH (CHEST PAIN, sob , BACK PAIN STARTING TODAY AT 0900, STATES ADVIL AT 1000, SSENCOND COVID VACCINE YESTERDAY AT 1500) 32-year-old female with past medical history of anxiety, asthma, Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, psoriasis who presents the emergency department with chief complaint of body aches and shortness of breath.  Patient is a nurse.  She received her 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19 the day prior to arriving in the emergency department.  This morning she did feel some mild body aches but otherwise was feeling fine.  Starting later today after her shift at work she developed severe body aches bilateral upper shoulders and down her spine, she also reports some shortness of breath, dizziness.  She felt unsafe to drive home feeling like this.  She had taken some Advil earlier in the day around 10:00.  She denies any fever, nausea or vomiting.  No history of severe vaccine reaction or anaphylaxis.  She has had anaphylactic reaction to Enbrel prior.  She denies any throat swelling, muffled voice, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain.    patient is mildly tachycardic and hypertensive.  Likely due to pain.  Patient is experiencing adverse reaction to the 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  I discussed with her she is having an immune response to the vaccine.  She does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis which could contribute to the elevated immune response as well.  The patient is given 30 mg of IM Toradol for body aches here in the emergency department.  She is instructed to call PCP for close follow-up, rest, drink plenty of fluids.  She has no signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis at this point.

                                                Started feeling a lump forming under my right armpit. At first it wasn&#39;t hurting that much I just felt it was normal of the swelling and soreness, but then I started feeling more pain at night time when I tried to sleep. On Monday the 25th woke up feeling more pain bigger then a pea on my right armpit had a fever of 100.1 in the morning. I went to the doc around the same day in the afternoon. The doc said it was an infection and inflamed from the vaccine I recently got on Friday.

                                                Received shot at 11:15 am and by 10pm I was freezing cold to the point shaking uncontrollably.  By 11pm I had a horrible headache and my body was aching. At midnight I still was feeling horrible and my chest was hurting and I was having difficulty breathing. Checked my heart rate with a pulse ox and it was in the 150?s. I realized had not taken my clonidine pill yet for the evening so I  took it and waited about an hour to hour an a half and my heart rate was still not coming down below 125. I ended up going to the emergency room and getting there by 3am. They immediately started running tests. My heart rate was in the 138 and my blood pressure was 148/100

Approx a week and a half later I noticed broken blood vessels over my body, went to my PCP had a blood draw and was informed I had a platelet count of 1. I was sent to the ER then to hematology. I received an very large  infusion and was put on 40 mg of Dexamethasone for 4 days. The next step is to get more blood work and see if I need another infusion. After the infusion I was really sick and passing out .

The next day I felt like I had been hit by a mack truck. I felt like that until about January 6, 2021. I also had SOB, joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue and body aches, sore arm and redness at the injection site.

I took Ibruprofen that evening and when I woke up the next morning I had a low grade fever of 99.5, I took Ibruprofen that morning and began sweating. I was sweaty/clammy all day, had a headache and tired. Around 4pm I took a 1.5 hour nap and felt better after that. The next morning I believe I had another low grade fever because I was really cold when I went to sleep, but woke up sweating. After that I have not had any symptoms.

This first presented around 11:00pm on Saturday 01/02/2021. I received my first dose of the moderna covid-19 vaccine on 12/28/2020. I did look on Moderna&#39;s website for further reaction information and it states that 4% of their test group reported this same symptom 5 to 7 days after first injection.

Woke up Jan 4th at 2:13am feeling the place of injection swollen, itchy and with a single hive like a bug bite, felt another on torso on the right side. Felt rapid pulse, got up to check the mirror, eyes swollen and itchy, tongue beginning to swell. Within minutes, started feeling itchy all over my body, specially mucosae, and scalp. Took 360mg of fexofenadine and 20mg famotidine, reaction started to subside. Was up monitoring until 3:45am. Still feeling itchy but significantly less at the before medication. Plan to continue with 180mg fexofenadine a day until all itchiness goes away.

Numbness in tips of hands and toes.  Widespread bodyaches.  Swelling in lymph nodes of neck.  Cough, Stuffy nose.   In my clinical judgment, I also suspect a coincident viral upper respiratory infection in additional to vaccine adverse effect.

                                                On 1/7/21 I noticed a slightly enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node. There was a small amount of edema in the area surrounding it. I applied heat to it and this seemed to relieve some of the swelling. Around noon on 1/8/21 the lymph node and the tissue sounding it had approximately doubled in size from the night before. I went to my local urgent care center. The doctor seemed to think that there is a very high probability that it is my body reacting to the vaccine, especially since I still currently have a visible bruise on my arm from the injection.  The injection was on the same side as the swelling. She couldn&#39;t confirm that it is a reaction with 100% certainty, I was prescribed Keflex 500mg tabs TID for a week just in case there is an infection present.  I am supposed to monitor the size of the swelling and follow up with a PCP.

                                                Within 5 min of vaccine developed LEFT chest &amp; neck rash / hives. Within 10 min entire neck / chest rash / hives with palpitations, tachycardia, flushing, &amp; itching occurred. Took Benadryl 25 mg with no improvement. Monitored in ER for 2 hrs with additional dose of Benadryl 25 mg given.  Rebound rash occurred about 24 hrs after injection, but no further rash / hives. Left supraclavicular lymph node swelling noted 3 days after vaccine administered. Saw PCP 01/08/2021 with persistent lymph node swelling. Starting Medrol dose pak to see if improvement occurs.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

These symptoms resolved after a day, but I have had a poorly delineated area of erythema, warmth, edema and pruritus at the injection site that began on day two post-vaccine and has been increasing in size until today (day 5 post-vaccination). Started as a small (2 cmx2cm) wheal, now  appears as painful/itching and warm blanching urticaria that takes up the entire width of my upper arm and half the length of the upper arm.

Rash resolved on Day 14. Applied topical prescription steroids on Day 9, which did not significantly improve rash. Rash essentially self-resolved.  On Day 5 developed left axillary lymphadenopathy that self-resolved on Day 11.

                                                Around 2 AM, roughly 14 hours after receiving Covid Modena vaccine (1st dose) I woke up in a violent shaking situation.  I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

All symptoms resolved by the next morning except for  the arm pain which is much milder, like a 1/10 dull pain but still persistent.

                                                1 week after my injection I developed a approximate baseball size circle at my injection sight with mild warmth and tenderness and swelling. I had axillary lymph node swelling, neck muscle soreness, fatigue, and frontal and temporal headache. I still have a red circular area at my injection sight but it is gradually improving (4 days out from redness occurring). The symptoms seemed worse than the initial reaction the first few days after my injection. I am a health care provider and have taken photos daily but have not gone for an office visit at this time.

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

                                                I woke up lightheaded. I had dizzy spells throughout the entire day, starting at 6AM. I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

                                                Almost immediately my arm was sore (as expected). However, about 7 hours after the shot I developed a fever (101), body aches, weakness, reduced O2 saturation (95-95), tightness in my chest,  fatigue, nausea, and headache. These symptoms were severe and persistent from 8pm 2/19 through overnight on 2/21. I treated it with Extra Strength Tylenol 1,000mg every 6 hours like clockwork, hydration and rest. I slept about 18-20 hours each day (Saturday and Sunday).   I awoke on 2/22 with only fatigue, sporadic tightness in my chest and O2 at 95 remaining. As of today 2/22 at 2:40pm the tightness in my chest has gone and my fatigue is gone. I do not know my O2 saturation right now as I left my reader at home.

During 1st 24 hours of having the 2nd dose I had chills, fever, body aches, sleeplessness. Symptoms subsided within 24-48 hours with the arm soreness taking about a week to completely go away.   A week and a half after receiving the 2nd dose I noticed a lump on my neck, lower middle near the collarbone. It is significantly pronounced. I saw my primary doctor for an already scheduled physical and she said I was fighting off an infection and it was normal. I mentioned I had the COVID vaccine and she said it isn&#39;t uncommon to see the lymph node swell after vaccination and it should go away in a couple of weeks. I wanted to report this because it can freak people out to see a lump in their neck so long after being vaccinated without any other symptoms. We need to list this as a possible side effect on the vaccine information. I feel completely fine except my neck is a little tender/sore from the swollen lymph node.

She was sent to Cardiology and they diagnosed her with pericarditis and she was started on scheduled NSAIDS. - Cardiology recommended ESR, CRP and CBC and they were negative. - CXR was normal - Echocardiogram was suggestive of pericarditis. Cardiology told her to follow up in 1 month is symptoms did not improve and they have not. Also she stated she has developed mild, intermittent peripheral edema that resolves without intervention but this is new.  I am also ordering the cardiac MRI which the cardiologist recommended if symptoms did not improve with NSAIDs.

                                                2/5- administered 2nd Moderna vaccine dose. 2/6-chills, body aches and pains, arm pain and welt, alternated Tylenol and Motrin q4 around the clock. 2/7-2/8 rested and was off of work (no symptoms- felt fine) 2/9- returned to work, passed safepass and while on zoom call at 9am developed wheezing and cough and slight low grade temp (99.5). Took symbicort (I have normally well controlled asthma). Called clinic and was advised that I was fine and could continue to work and to follow up with MD if symptoms got worse. Did virtual visit with Pulmonologist at 0945 and he advised me to get COVID swabbed and prescribed prednisone taper and albuterol MDI. COVID swabbed 2/9 at 5pm. Out of work 2/10 &amp; 2/11 awaiting test results. Returned to work 2/12 after negative COVID result- passed safepass- worked, still SOB, but manageable. 2/13-2/14 had increasing SOB- albuterol MDI 6x/day. Monday 2/15 returned to work- saw doctor in person- increased prednisone from 20mg (tapered down) to 40mg (original dose) and added Spiriva. 2/17- Went to ED for status asthmaticus after using albuterol MDI 5-6x/day without any relief. Admitted 2/17 for asthma exacerbation- discharged 2/20. Discharged home with nebulized albuterol, prednisone slow taper, symbicort, Spiriva, Singulair &amp; Claritin. 2/23-2/24 Albuterol nebs 5x/day, still SOB. Pulmonary visit 2/24 - added inhaled budesonide nebs. Out of work 2/25-2/26. Returned to work 3/1- finally feeling better!

I did not experience shortness of breath or have trouble breathing at any point.

Next day, 1/6, she called work to say she had chills and headache and would not be reporting to work.  At 2:00 pm, she felt her heart racing, and noticed face and lip swelling and tightness in her throat.  She called her PMD who directed her to go to urgent care.  At urgent care, she got an EKG, IV fluids, IV steroids, and IV antihistamine.  Symptoms resolved within 2 hours.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post injection, I felt a burning sensation move from my left deltoid, up my shoulder, and across my chest. I experienced burning in my chest for about 10 mins, and then it subsided. About 8 mins after that, I experienced moderate to severe cramping in my lower back and thigh muscles; which completely subsided after 10-15 mins. Two days after the initial injection, the injection site began burning/aching again, with movement up to my shoulder joint. It was to a point where I was tearful and unable to sleep. The following morning it had subsided, and just remains slightly sore.

She is having some tingling in her mouth and tingling in her feet. No obvious facial swelling or hives.   She denied rash, hives, welts, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, wheezing, throat tightness, hoarseness and stridor.   This provider was notified of patient reaction and she was then assessed in the emergency bay area.   Monitored patient for severe reaction symptoms, including but not limited to abdominal pain, blood pressure abnormality , chest pain, hypotension, increased swelling and rapid progression of symptoms.Treatment included: zyrtec 10 mg, pepcid 20 mg,  Follow up response to treatment: good. Patient discharge: Stable to go home and follow up with PCP.     Observed in the vaccine clinic for 1.5 hours I do not see a reason for ER assesment since she is improving.  Tingling in her mouth has improved.    This pt was encouraged to go home and rest She was encouraged to take a dose of benadryl at home. She may call me if worsening. Given precautions for her next vaccine. Discussed with pharmacist.

                                                5 days after my vaccination I woke up in the middle of the night to pain in my arm pit of the arm the vaccine was administered. My lymph nodes in my groin, neck, clavicle, and arm pit are visibly inflamed. The left side of my face and neck are swollen as well. I am having tingling and numbness down my left arm and in my fingers. I am feeling very light headed and short of breath.

                                                on Wed 1/6/21 I had an allergic reaction and am unsure what set it off.  My eyes became itchy, watery and my corneas swelled.  I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

                                                The following day, 12/23/20, I kept feeling like I was having brief waves of anxiety, with nothing to be anxious about. The anxious feeling kept occuring, but it wasn&#39;t until a week later than I realized that each time I felt that anxiety, my heart was actually palpitating.  I had a 12 lead EKG done via local EMT to confirm that it was actually happening, then made an appt with a local cardiologist.  Stress test, cardio sonogram, and 24 hour heart monitor tests were completed on 1/13/21.  My follow up is on 2/3/21.  Fortunately, I have not felt a palpitation since 1/10/21.

After Moderna vaccine, injection site reactions developed for 48 hrs following administration (moderate pain, swelling, warmth to touch). Injection pain then subsided. At 10 days after injection, large swollen lymph node under arm on injection side was noticed. The swelling of lymph node seems slightly diminished today (day 14 post injection #1). In conjunction with swollen lymph node, experiencing generalized malaise, fatigue, and neck lymph nodes seem slightly swollen. Routinely taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen for some symptomatic relief.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I began feeling an increase in heart rate about 5-8 minutes after injection. I reported symptoms and site began to monitor my pulse, which was 160. I then drank 32oz of water and took 400mg ibuprofen. I then began to feel dizziness. Blood pressure was normal. My chair was reclined and I was given about 2oz of orange juice. I was then moved to a stretcher and my legs were elevated on a chair. I took a restroom break. I began by walking, but started to see spots in my vision and sat in a wheelchair. I was able to use the restroom and return to stretcher and elevation of my legs. I was then taken to the ER. I used the restroom once more independently. Blood sample was taken. Heart rate was  160, blood pressure was normal. EKG was abnormal and I was given dosage of adenosine. First dose did not show necessary improvement and I was given a second dose, which dropped my heart rate to the 90s. I used the restroom independently and was given an additional EKG, which was normal. During this time my Physician contacted a Cardiologist, for consultation. I was then discharged with recommendation to follow up with cardiologist in 2-4 days.

                                                At 3am on 1/26/2021 I woke up feeling sick I had a fever of 102F, chills, muscle aches, nausea. I understand that these were expected with the second dose. However at 9:40am I began vomiting. By 11am my throat started to close so I went to the ER. I had a minor asthma attack while I was there (coughing fit and slight wheezing). I was evaluated and they gave me IV fluids as well as other medications through the IV. I received solu-medrol, Benadryl, antacid, and anti-nausea. They took blood tests, urinalysis, and chest x-ray, all of which were normal. I did not have a rash around the injection site this time. I was discharged at about 3:10pm

                                                I was experiencing what I understand to be one of the more common side effects: pain at injection site. This pain kind of traveled to other parts of my arm and eventually my arm pit. I noticed the pain travelling around the date of 1/2/2021, and by 1/6/2021 it getting more intense. As I was trying to massage out the soreness, I noticed a palpable, painful lump in my right breast. I did not immediately recognize it as a swollen lymph node at that time, but after several Dr exams, and the lump and pain decreasing, I believe that is what was happening. I do still have the lump, and it is tender, so I am currently monitoring it.

Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

                                                About 15 minutes later - body felt like it was on fire; shortness of breath; heart rate was pounding very fast. I stayed in an observation room for about 3 hours. Next day, I couldn&#39;t feel my right arm. I started getting fever, chills. I had all symptoms of the coronavirus. Saturday at 03:00 am - I woke up and I couldn&#39;t feel my arm or my fingers on my right side. I called the Emergency number. I stayed home and took Tylenol. Couldn&#39;t feel my arm at all that Saturday - dead. Sunday - same thing. Monday morning, I woke up, I could feel a little bit of my fingers but I noticed that I had blisters full of blood between your index finger and your thumb. I didn&#39;t go to work that day. The doctor wrote me out of work for the rest of the week. I didn&#39;t have any sensation on my pinkie or ring finger. I had a little bit of sensation on the rest of my fingers. I stayed at home and I didn&#39;t do anything with my arm and it slowly started getting better. That whole week I was having symptoms that were just like coronavirus. They came and went. the following Saturday, I started being able to move my arm around and doing more stuff and slowly it came back but I&#39;m not 100%. I can&#39;t lay on the right hand side too long - it starts feeling like my arm is asleep. I got the second dose February 12th.  I spoke to an allergy doctor and an anesthesiology doctor (video and telephone visits) - they told me I was having common side affects that people were having from the vaccine but they didn&#39;t know why.

                                                Passed out for 40 secs; Chills; Cardiac issues; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 34-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced passed out for 40 secs/ loss of consciousness, chills, and cardiac issues/ cardiac disorder.  The patient&#39;s medical history included depression. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) since 2014.  The patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 039K20A) on 12 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 028L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10 Feb 2021, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine the patient, had experienced cardiac issues.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient started experiencing chills and passed out for 40 seconds (secs). The patient had visited the emergency room (ER) and EKG (electrocardiogram) showed slight abnormality. She was given heart monitor for 14 days. She was scheduled for Stress test and Echo. She was on antipsychotic medications for seven years. She was curious whether the antipsychotic drugs caused the cardiac abnormalities in response to Covid-19 vaccine. Treatment information was not provided. The adverse event of passed out for 40 secs was assessed as medically significant.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events chills and cardiac issues was unknown. Outcome of the event passed out for 40 secs was recovered on 11 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Muscle aches, fatigue, just felt off.  Then arm was very sore.  Sunday night my arm pit really started hurting.  Hurst over my shoulder, clavicle, and down into the lateral side of my breast.  Bothered enough in the night that I didn&#39;t sleep well.  This morning 1-5-21 I have a red rash over the injection site, arm is swollen over deltoid and hot.  Arm pit and down into breast is still hurting significantly.  I took Ibuprofen yesterday and helped some with pain in arm pit.  Off an on SOB and chest feels tight.  No cough

                                                12 days following the vaccine administration I noticed redness on my arm around the injection site. This redness was hot to the touch and rather large, exceeding the deltoid muscle and going down into my bicep. I also felt radiating soreness into my armpit and left breast.  The following day the rash had grown in size and felt hot to the touch on my entire upper arm with swelling and edema that affected the movement of my arm and hand. Continued soreness and pain in my armpit, left breast and down my arm into my fingers and up into my neck.  I proceeded to go to the urgent care as directed by Clinic employee health and my PCP. There was I was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescriped Keflex for 7 days, 3x a day.  It has been recommended that I seek further medical care due to my reaction, but this has yet to be scheduled.

                                                I received the moderna covid vaccine at approx 0930 and waited in waiting room of facility per policy after injection.  I felt ok once wait time was up so I left.  I was driving approx 15 min later and (which was approx 30) after administration and pulled over to side of road due to getting chills and shaking and feeling faint.  Also, the left side of my face went numb and tingling.   I called for an ambulance and once they arrived I had started feeling normal again.  Facial tingling still persists at this time hours later.  I also had another sync opal episode once I got a ride home that resolved.  Left side of face feels like after being numb from a dentist.

Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

Chest tightness and heart beat flutters continued and I saw Nurse Practitioner on 1/04/21 and EKG showed frequent premature ventriculations (pvcs). Then referred to cardiologist for follow-up and possible treatment. Currently on a heart monitor as of 1/06/21 and waiting to get into see cardiologist for treatment for continuing pvcs and chest pressure and sometimes pain as of 1/08/21. outcome is yet to be determined as of 1/08/21.

My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

Lasted approximately 3 days then resolved. 1/1/2021-In the morning noted hives/rash/itching/obvious line of demarcation to the injection site in my left shoulder.  Through the morning noted the hives spread up my neck and angioedema noted to both sides of my neck, lymph nodes swelling on both sides and the injection site became more swollen and turned very hard to the touch.  No difficulty breathing at baseline, but it becamer difficult to take a full breath and chest tightness with exertion.  Benadryl 50 mg was taken 4-6 times a day for 3 days.  PA consulted, who stated to stay with Benadryl regimen, steroids not currently recommended, call 911 if symptom worsen.

                                                A little over 2 days after the vaccine, I had a horrible headache. Thought nothing of it, took Excederin migraine and went to bed. Woke up Thursday feeling fine, then by 5 pm, was very run down, had a mild headache, and had an intense sinus pressure under my eyes. My neck hurt and was sore to the touch in the front. When I bent over, it felt like my head was going to explode from pressure. No other symptoms or anything to be alert about. Took a Mucinex before bed, hoping that it would move anything that might be clogging my sinuses, went to sleep. Woke up Friday feeling okay, with just a tiny remnant of a headache. Around 1 pm, intense sinus pressure returned, worse than the previous day. Decided to go to local healthcare clinic around 3:30 pm. PA looked at ears, throat, all looked okay. Only symptom was swollen lymph nodes in neck, same side as the vaccine was administered. Covid tested (subsequent results were negative). Saturday, had less pressure, and spent the day laying around. By Sunday, was feeling back to normal. Peak of incident was definitely Friday.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   I received the vaccine yesterday 1/11/21 at 1135.  About 2 hours later I started feeling symptoms :   Headache dull still.  I&#39;ve been having this pain/ache in my ribs and upper torso of it is crushing inward. My ribs feel like they are being squeezed too hard like a person hugging so tight that you are having difficultly breathing. And the upper torso under my ribs feels like when you have not ate anything in days of hunger pain (but I am not at all hungry) and it start to hurt soo bad that you can only hunch over and hope it goes away.   These issues have been on and off yesterday and today with the dull feel that has not gone away of a 3 or 4 to in a moments notice 8. Currently it is a 3 with a dull squeeze to ribs and barrable hunger pain (I am not hungry).

Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

                                                As the injection day wore on, my arm increased in soreness. By 9:00 pm on day of injection, I was unable to lift or move my arm, due to the pain. For 2 days after the injection, I was unable to perform many activities becuase I could not lift or move my arm. By 11:30 pm on Saturday 1/16, I started to be able to lift and move my arm, a tiny bit. On Sunday the 17th, I was able to lift my arm to shoulder height, but still had a great deal of pain. The pain started to lessen throughout the day on Sunday. When I woke up Monday morning, I was able to use my arm, but it felt &#34;dead&#34; (like when you sleep on a limb wrong). This feeling continued through Tuesday, and Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, into Wednesday the 20th, it feels like there is a tennis ball in my arm pit - when my arm is in normal position. When my axillary lymph nodes were felt, there is no swelling, but a greater amount of pain.

                                                I developed a rash about 6 inches long and 3 inches wide (long oval). The first rash developed 6 days after vaccination and went away about 5 days later. The second vaccination was this past Saturday and the rash developed the following day and is worsening at this time (which is the trajectory of the last rash before it healed). I also experienced cold extremeties about 2 weeks after the first dose.

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

Oxygen fine the whole time; heart rate regulated after the beginning and no fever - feeling a bit better within 1 hour. Headache started that night and lasted until midnight the next day. Very tired the whole next day until about 5:30pm.

                                                approximately 45- an hour after the injection I had some rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

I noticed all over body rash, macular papular rash redish whitish throughout body, it became very itchy in my arms and legs, I noticed numbness in right and left arm and legs numbness, shooting pain in left side as well, I experienced neurological symptoms and went to ER. They did a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, they said it was probably a immune response and was told to take antihistamines at home. symptoms started to subside after a couple of days, I then developed intermittent chest pains in the left side and the pain became more consistent and then a week later it was consistent with every breath and I went to the ER again, they did an EKG, Troponin, all cadiac workup and chest xray said it was not cardiac but possibly a chest wall issue, I was referred to cardiology, cardiologist thought I may have pericarditis, I started taking 800mg of ibuprofen for management. My pain has began to subside and now I only have a couple of minutes every other day that I still have pain but stopped taking medication the third week in February. Because of the intensity of my immune response they recommended I not take the 2nd dose. If symptoms subside I will let my dr know

                                                I started having minor body aches about six hours post vaccine. I woke up that night nauseous and dizzy. I passed out on the way to the kitchen to get water. My husband somehow heard me and helped me back to the bedroom where I passed out again. I was eventually able to get back in bed without passing out, though I couldn&#39;t get warm and had severe body aches for most of the night. It was like having a very high fever, only there was no fever. I was clammy, but no fever. Around 4:30 a.m. the &#39;non-fever&#39; broke and the chills and body aches stopped. I was extremely fatigued for the next two days and felt myself again by the third. The arm in which I received the shot hurt pretty bad Friday too but that was the least of my concerns.   I did not seek medical treatment for these symptoms.

                                                A few hours after the vaccine my arm hurt. The next day (1/5/21) the body aches and nausea started. I wasn&#39;t worried because this is well known for side effects from the vaccine but I wasn&#39;t prepared for the heart palpitations and tachycardia I had for about 4 hours the night of 1/5/21. I had COVID in May 2020 and per my cardiologist probably had myocarditis that I am still taking a beta blocker for as a result of the COVID infection. There may or may not be a link between the immune response to the vaccine and my previous COVID complications. The morning of 1/6/21, I am pretty much back to normal.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

The rest of the symptoms just described continue this evening which i attribute to the covid vaccine.

                                                Two days after my vaccine I noticed some pain in my low back and in my left hand and left foot. I also had one night where I woke up and had soaked through my blankets with sweat. Otherwise, felt fine. On January 7th I noticed that the injection site was suddenly very red and swollen and a dull ache had returned. On the 8th the redness was more filled in and less bright, still swollen and painful. I tried to go paddle boarding and all of my muscles were very weak and I got dizzy and nauseated. I felt like my body was full of lactic acid and that my muscles would not work properly. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and 50mg of Benadryl and got in bed and slept. On the 9th, the redness was almost gone, swelling still visible and muscles very weak, along with a strange tight feeling in my neck and head. My left toes went totally numb. I mainly stayed in bed and slept until the 12th when a precautionary COVID test was negative and I was able to get lab work drawn. I tried biking 2 blocks and felt that my muscles were a little stronger, however my joints felt very fragile and I was short of breath. On the 13th I got some tingling in my left foot and toes went completely numb on 2 occasions. Today, (14th) I do not have the lactic acid feel, however I am very tired and continue to have the head and neck tightness.

                                                there was bleeding at the injection site more than from a typical vaccination I have recieved in the past. I sat to wait and within five minutes was lightheaded, overheated but having chills and having intense abdominal cramps. My pulse ox and bpm were fine but my blood pressure was low for me; normal is 110/70 and emt&#39;s confirmed that I was 90/60 and then 98/62 after 40 minutes post vaccine.  I waited longer and then not feeling worse left. Advil fixed the cramps. So far it&#39;s only been pain at the injection site.

My lymph nodes on my left were very sore, I also had a sore throat, body chills, joint pain, mainly in my hands and fingers, extreme fatigue and it lasted through Wednesday and Thursday. My cough got really bad and I had to start on an albuterol nebulizer because of my cough/wheezing.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins sitting after infection. I left and was driving and started feeling disoriented, dizzy, shaking and throbbing headache. I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

Thought I was starting to feel myself by Sunday midday but then suddenly on Sunday afternoon almost exactly 48 hours after the shot I started to feel extreme confusion and short term memory loss. My body started shaking, I felt very hot and then very cold (back and forth) and began experiencing shortness of breath. It was all very scary and I ended up in the ER.

                                                Full anaphylactic shock; Hives; Low blood pressure; Dizziness; Stuffy nose; Bad headache; Nausea; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare facility staff member who was a 36-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine, and who developed full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose.  The patient&#39;s medical history included a latex allergy and pregnancy.  Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06-Jan-2021, approximately 30 minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT 01122019) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient received her Moderna vaccine on 06 Jan 2021 at noon.  She reported that approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she went into full anaphylactic shock.  She stated that the reaction began with nausea.  She then developed hives, got low blood pressure, and was dizzy.  She was taken to the hospital.  There, she received two rounds of epinephrine along with diphenhydramine and famotidine.  She was released that same day from the hospital once she stabilized.   On 07-Jan-2021, a full 24 hours after receiving her vaccine, she experienced another anaphylactic reaction.  She stated that the reaction happened exactly like it did on 06 Jan 2021 and presented with all the same symptoms.  Patient injected herself with the epinephrine pen that she had at home as soon as the symptoms started.     In addition to the anaphylactic reactions she experienced, patient reported that she had a bad headache since receiving the vaccine as well as a stuffy nose that comes and goes and coincides with hives.  As of 10 Jan 2021, she stated that the flare ups had finally subsided, however, she continued taking diphenhydramine and famotidine as prophylaxis for anaphylactic reaction.   Treatment for the event included epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and famotidine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events, full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose, was not provided.   The events, full anaphylactic shock and low blood pressure were considered resolved on 07 Jan 2021. The events, nausea, hives, and dizziness were considered recovered/resolved on 10 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the events, bad headache and stuffy nose, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 36-year-old female patient with medical history of latex allergy, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 01122019), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock, the non-serious listed events of Headache and Nausea, and the non-serious unlisted events of Urticaria, Hypotension, Dizziness, and Nasal congestion.  Based on the current available information and temporal associon between the use of the product and the onset of events starting on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

The next day (morning after) I developed low grade fever, chills, back pain, general malaise, weakness, and a lot of pain on the arm I recieved the injection . I also had tender axillary lymph nodes, first on the same side I recieved the vaccine, a day later on both sides. Symptoms were the worst during the 24 hours after recieving the vaccine. After this, the only remaining symptoms were tender axillary lymph nodes and pain in the injection site. I used Acetaminophen for symptoms.

The above symptoms subsided some approximately 24 hours post vaccine and were resolved by approximately 40 hours post vaccine. However, 1 p.m. on 1/22, noticed injection site was itchy, red, swollen, and sore. Took Benadryl that evening and swelling subsided some by next morning and completely resolved by 1/25.

Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

                                                6 minutes after receiving vaccine patient reported that her tongue was starting to swell and that her heart was racing.  Staff called 911 immediately.  Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

On 2/9 those symptoms subsided, but I started to get right-sided flank pain with pain on inhalation. I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, used a heating pad on 2/9 and 2/10, but pain progressed.  Mid-day on 2/10 the pain was so severe, I went to urgent care. They said it was gastritis and released me. I went back 2 hours later and saw a different doctor. He diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and pleural effusion. I was sent by ambulance to the hospital and admitted. I was treated for pain and started on Eliquis. I was discharged the evening of 2/12. The morning of 2/13, I woke up with 100.6 F Temp and 85% O2 at. I went to urgent care again, they thought I had pneumonia and referred me to the hospital. I was admitted to a different hospital on 2/12 and continue to antibiotic s and a heparin drip

                                                3 days after vaccine (2/5/21): mild fever (normally 96.5 - consistent temp over the course of several months on two different thermometers, was 98), worsening of sore throat, runny nose, fatigue, chills/feverish feeling. Negative strep that day, negative covid test the following Monday. Resolved within 48 hours.  8 days after vaccine (2/10/21): developed rash at injection site, tenderness, swelling, and itching - right arm had very minimal, minor rash at the same time. Pain was more significant than the two days post injection and improved within 48 hours (still have itchy, dry, raised skin but minimal redness as of 2/22/21).  16 days after vaccine (2/18/21): lymph node in front of neck area by collarbone swollen. No pain but minor discomfort. It feels like a 2 inch squishy mass with a hard node in it. I&#39;ve never had swelling here before. If my other lymph nodes are swollen as well I cannot tell.  I had the flu shot at the end of December, 2020. Not sure if that was close enough to matter, no symptoms after that one.

I cold compress was applied to my forehead and I was put in a reclining position &amp; then received Epinephrine at 1:28PM. EMS (present onsite) arrived for transport at 1:31PM. 4L of oxygen was applied after O2 sat of 89% noted by EMS. Blood pressure was elevated to &gt;200/100 initially by EMS. Symptoms improved quickly following epinephrine, with some residual feelings of very mild throat fullness, and I developed chills which improved over time.  I was transported to emergency department where I was evaluated (symptoms mostly resolved at that time, but ED physician noted a little swelling remaining in my uvula), then IV Benadryl and Decadron were given. Later acetaminophen was also given for headache that developed during my ED stay.  My vitals were monitored throughout and observation occurred until I was discharged at approximately 5:00PM, as symptoms had not recurred.

Milder on day 8, less itchy and swollen, but still red and a little raised.  Mild shortness of breath.

The person took me to the ER in a wheelchair, since it was across the hall.  They did an EKG on me, and evaluated me for an hour, and I was released once my pulse slowed down to 99 and I felt better.  It has been 7 days and I have continued to have tachycardia while sitting, with my pulse going from the 70s to to 130s for no reason.  It will come in episodes. I went and saw my primary care doctor today and my pulse was 105-115 sitting.  I have cut out coffee since the incident on 12/29/2020.

                                                At minute 12 after injection (8:31am on 1/5/20), the pruritis started on my scalp and my back. I informed the volunteer at the end of the drive line. She offered to have EMS evaluate me, however I declined as I thought the reaction was mild. Over the next 10 minutes, after being released from the driveline, I was so itchy I wanted to literally rip all of my skin off. The back of my throat started to itch, but never felt tight or swollen. No SOB or chest tightness. I checked my temp at 8:45 and I was at 101.0 and HR was 110bpm. I am a PA working in dermatology and got to work and took 50mg of diphenhydramine PO but was not improving. One of the doctors I work with and I decided it was best for me to get checked out in urgent care. I had my MA drive me there and was seen immediately. I had a blotchy rash over my entire body, but not raised or hived. Temp was 100.6, HR 86 and BP 127/78, respirations 16/min O2 sat 98% and the itchiness was still severe but I could tell the diphenhydramine was kicking in. I was then given 40mg of famotidine PO and 10mg Dexamethasone IM in the right buttocks while in urgent care. After about 15 minutes, my symptoms were improving, but not resolved. I was released and went home to rest. Throughout the day yesterday (1/5/20) my heart rate would spike as high as 130bmp (my normal is 60-70bpm). Then it would come down within a few seconds to about 100bpm and steadily stay between 90-100bpm all day. Last night I was woken up at 3:30am (1/6/20) with a HR of 132bpm and O2 at 97%. I took a few deep breaths, and it slowly started to drop to 100bpm. Since 6:00am, I am steady at 70-80bpm with occasional spikes of 96-100bpm and I can feel when my heart is starting to race. I have my pulse ox on for the day and will continue to monitor my symptoms. I still have occasional pruritis, but it&#39;s tolerable. I was discharged from urgent care with PO Prednisone tapered dose, however, I am very shaky already and do not want to make it worse, so have not started it yet. Not sure if I should? And I would like to know if I should receive the second dose? If so, should I pre-medicate? Please let me know if you have any further questions about my event. Thanks.

                                                Symptoms started as a cold chill, shaking, and weakness. This started a little after I breastfed my baby. I felt as if my blood sugar levels dropped. I have eaten very light meals earlier.   Symptoms lasted for about 40 - 60 min. By 9 pm and after dinner I was back to normal.

All symptoms resolved in about 15 minutes with the exception of  numbness/tingling to tongue and lips which lasted 3 hours. Symptoms resolved on their own without treatment/medication other than lying flat with feet up and drinking a bottle of water. I was assessed by medical professionals at the vaccine clinic which was located inside of the hospital. I consulted with an ED physician but did not require any additional treatment.

Bull&#39;s eye Rash on the vaccine site. I have taken a photo if ever needed. 2. Swollen lymph nodes.  I wanted to emphasize on the bull&#39;s eye rash which started after 5 days after vaccination. it&#39;s itchy and swollen. No pain or other discomfort.  I never noticed lymph nodes  before the peculiar rash.  I am overall health and has no other contra indications.

The back of my tongue became very dry.   I felt better after 10 minutes and never passed out.  They took my vital signs and everything was normal.  I have never been bothered by needles before at all so it was strange.  However I do have a long history of anxiety so it?s possible it was just that.

Day 3---no side effects Day 4 to Day 5---At about 8 pm, I noticed slight swelling underneath my left eye, that looked like a bag.  My face was also red.  The sides of my face, jaw line,  &amp; both sides of my neck were itchy.  I went to bed since I was supposed to work the next morning at 6 AM (OB Nurse).  I work up at 4:15 AM &amp; my face was quite swollen, specifically my left side, my face &amp; neck was warm to the touch &amp;  itchy.  I immediately took 50mg of Benadryl &amp; called my internal medicine doctor. Day 5---I was to be seen in the clinic at 7:00 AM.  The Benadryl helped some.  I was not having any breathing difficulty.  I was prescribed 5 days of Prednisone.  By about 1:00 PM,  the swelling was worsening &amp; my lips were tingling.  I called the doctor again &amp; they told me to go to the ER.  I never had issues with my airway.   The swelling was always worse on my left side of my face.  I received IV fluids &amp; Solumedrol &amp; was discharged with an epi pen, &amp; told to continue the Benadryl, Prednisone, &amp; Pepcid bid.  CoVid test done in ER was negative. Day 6---The facial swelling/redness/itching remained but was improved.  I was very tired. Day 7---Same as Day 6, but less swelling. Day 8---Facial swelling/redness/itching gone, but tiredness remained.  Started to notice a chest heaviness/feeling of constant excitement in the center of my chest, even when at rest. Day 9-10---Tiredness remained.  Intermittent Chest heaviness/feeling of excitement in the center of my chest remained. Day 11---Feeling more normal.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

Following day rash was bigger and now solid, hot to touch and itchy. Over the course 6 days the rash has continued to spread down and up my arm in a circular shape. Lymph node located in my armpit also became swollen a day after the rash appeared.  I saw the doctor on the 4th day after the rash had appeared. That doctor consulted with dermatology and infectious disease. They are saying that it is a &#34;site&#34; related reaction. Recommendation for treatment is OTC allergy med, ibuprofen and ice.  I&#39;m 12 days post first vaccine and 6 days post start of rash and it&#39;s still ongoing.

                                                30 minutes after receiving the vaccine I began to have tingling in my throat, tongue, and lips. Also had a slight metallic taste in my mouth that subsided within 10 minutes. My upper lip began to swelling along the edge only. The tingling and swelling subsided after 3 hours. On day 4 after the vaccine, my left arm felt &#34;cool and heavy&#34; for 3 hours, and returned on day 5 (02/01/21).

                                                Temperature was 102 F; Lips turned blue; Wheezing; Heart rate was elevated to 105-112 bpm; A spontaneous report was received from a dentist, a 37-year old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced heart rate was elevated to 105-112 bpm, wheezing, lips turned blue, and temperature was 102 F.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included monk fruit allergy and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications reported included hydrochlorothiazide.  On an unknown date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273.   On 28 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28 Jan 2021, following vaccination, the patient experienced an elevated heart rate of 105-112 beats per minute (bpm). The patient stated that 80 bpm was normal for her. At 7:30 pm, she began wheezing and her lips turned blue, both of which resolved within 2 hours. The patient took ibuprofen, naproxen, and diphenhydramine and sat in a warm tub for an hour and felt better after she covered up in bed.  On 29 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102 degrees Fahrenheit (F) at midnight and 99 degrees F at 5:00 am.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The events, wheezing and lips turned blue, were considered resolved on 28 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, heart rate was elevated to 105-112 bpm and temperature was 102, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 37-year-old, female patient, with medical history of high blood pressure and allergies to monk fruit, who experienced serious unexpected event of cyanosis, non-serious unexpected event of wheezing, heart rate increased, and non-serious expected event of pyrexia. The event of cyanosis, wheezing, heart rate increased occurred 1 day (same day) and fever occurred 2 days after mRNA-1273 (Lot# 030L20A). Treatment included Ibuprofen, Benadryl and Naprosyn. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information has been requested.

She was pretty much herself on morning of 2/13/2021 - got up, had shower.  caregivers noted her extremities were cool and face was red.  temp was 97.4.  She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.  CPR was continued until family could be reached and decision was made to stop resuscitation.

                                                Shot given at 3:47- approximately 3-5 minutes later started to experience blurred vision, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.   Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

Progressively, left arm became red, warm to touch, hard, swollen, itchy and painful through the course of the day. It spread rapidly and pain was radiating under left breast, where the lymph nodes are located, behind back/shoulder. The following  day it has spread even further,  down to elbow; numbing/tingling sensation radiating to left pinkie and left ring fingers.   Vital signs: higher than normal systolic BP 130-150s (normal for me:100-110s); tachycardic with HR in 130-140s on the first day of the adverse event, O2 sats normal high 90s to 100% on RA.

                                                Employee Recollection: Wednesday and Thursday  felt kind of weak and more tired than normal, but thought nothing of it.  In the early afternoon on Friday the symptoms got worse.   Tired and confused.  I slept through my alarm and woke up to my mom, who was watching my daughter for me, trying to wake me up.  I was very confused, dizzy and weak.  My mom said I was really out of it, and that I had a really hard time focusing on what she was trying to say to me.    When I checked in for work my O2 stats were in the upper 80&#39;s lower 90&#39;s.  My temp was also in the lower 90&#39;s.  That was after numerous attempts at taking my o2 stats and temps.  Co-worker said I was very confused, tired, dizzy and weak.  She said there were times when I was walking that I would reaching for walls and railings to regain my balance.  I left work at 6am Saturday morning.  I went home and went straight to bed.  Slept all day long until a few hours before my shift started at 9:30 P.M.   since then I&#39;ve been feeling better, but my temp and 02 stats are still low.  But I&#39;m continuing to monitor symptoms.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if anything changes.

                                                Just about 15 mins after recieving vaccination, I  experienced increased shortness of breath, feeling weak, slight headache, and my heart seemed to race.  When I shared this with the pharmasist, she did not offer to take vitals nor seemed concerned.  She suggested that I was experiencing anxiety, and that it was not a typical reaction to the vaccine.  However, each day since vaccine I have continued to have episodes of shortness of breath.  Today, 3 days after the vaccine, I had more shortness of breath than I had since first contracting Covid-19(which was on 10th of Dec).  I also was having to stop walking several times every 5 mins or so in order to catch my breath, feeling weakness and fatigue.  My sense or taste/smell is gone as well. I was so short of breath today, work was worried anough about me they urged me to go home and call my doctor.  I now have a tele-visit set up with my doctor today.

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

I was evaluated by the emergency room. Numbness to left-arm last 6 hours. During this time, I developed tingling to the tip of my tongue and tingling to lips. Later, I developed tingling to fingers and toes. The following day, the palms of my hands were tingling and turned red then a bluish discoloration. I have has extreme fatigue for 4 days starting on January 6th. Also, on the day of the vaccine December 30th, I had pain at the injection site immediately in addition to redness and swelling that lasted 3 days. On January 10, I have developed a headache. I no longer have numbness but have cold sensitivity and tingling in fingers.

                                                I was given the Covid Vaccine in my left deltoid on a Saturday morning. I developed severe heartburn/indigestion that day but was unsure if symptoms were related to vaccine. My arm was sore for about 3 days after injection which was a common side effect. After that, my arm felt completely fine although I continued to experience severe heartburn. I made an appointment to see my PCP that following Thursday for the heartburn and he ordered a CT Angiogram to r/o thoracic aneurysm. During the imaging test the nurse injected contrast dye into an IV in my left AC, below the site of my Covid vaccine injection 5 days prior.  That night I began feeling pain in my arm and noticed that my lymph node in my left axilla had become swollen. I ignored the symptom, assuming that it was yet another symptom of the vaccine. 3 days later on Sunday evening (8 days after my initial covid vaccine injection), I noticed that my shoulder on and around the vaccine injection site  was  swollen, very warm to touch and was extremely tender and itchy. I immediately called my PCP. The next day (today), on Monday afternoon. A fine red rash has developed.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

                                                On 12/28/2020 at 1930 I had a throbbing HA, nausea, chills, no appetite, body aches, extreme fatigue and low grade fever. Temp was 99.4-100.3. 1 gram of Tylenol was taken that evening, to relieve HA pain. Zofran 4 mg ODT was also taken for nausea. The following morning,  I felt extremely fatigued and had a persistent headache that was not consistently responsive to OTC meds. I developed a fever on 12/29/2020 in the evening. Low grade and ranging 99.3-100.6. Along with fever, my s/s were extreme fatigue, no appetite, headache, body aches, chills. On 12/30/2020, I spiked a Tmax of 101.0 around 11 am. Again, the same s/s were there. I went home from work early.  Same s/s and low grade fever persisted past 7 days, so I called my PCP as well as the Pharmacy where I received the vaccine. On the 10th day after vaccination, I notified my Infectious Disease Dr. He advised me to wait 6 months to 1 year to receive the second injection. He stated that my s/s were likely vaccine related and would go away with time. Fever persists through every day for the month of January 2021, with exact same symptoms. Started to notice Shortness of breath with activity, occasional sharp pain in chest. Presented to ER on 01/09/2021 with chest pain and shortness of breath. Labs revealed Acute Kidney Injury and Transaminitis. Cardiac work-up was performed, all tests negative. I was hypotensive. MD recommended I either get transferred to hospital, or stay in ER for min 23 hours observation for monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure. I received 2 L of Normal Saline. BP eventually began to rise with SBP above 90 and DBP above 40. (Normal BP range for me is 120/60-70&#39;s. Baseline Creatinine is 0.9. Discharged from ER per patient request, after second Creatinine level came down to 1.5. MD advised patient to not return to work for the next 2 business days. Spoke with PCP on 1/11/2021 in AM, and informed him of the events over the weekend. Also informed him that I am still febrile with same symptoms as reported previously. Was told I could not return to work until I was fever free. Was fever free for about 12 hours, until evening of 1/12/2021. MD not allow patient to RTW.

I took a Benedryl or Claritin and Advil.  Eight  hours after the 1st vaccine, I experienced severe aches and pain, fatigue lasting almost 72hrs. Even the joints of fingers aches but the pain in my lymph node in my left armpit felt like someone hit me with a baseball bat (injection was in left arm).

Tongue was a little swollen at this point. Airway was regularly checked and did not close.

                                                Injection site became red and itchy at 10:30 am the following day, then proceeded to become a raised welt, 2mm high and roughly 2.5 inches in diameter after 24 hours and remained this way for 72 hours.  It was warm to the touch, painful, and itchy.  After 72 hours, welt went down and a small brown bruise remained.  On Thursday, January 14, my heart was racing on and off all day - I was off work and sitting in a calm and relaxed position with no reason for an increased heart rate - my resting heart rate was approx. 112 bpm and remained this way for 4 hours beginning around 1pm.  When changing for bed, I noticed that the welt at the injection site had returned but was doubled in size.   I applied ice to the area and hydrocortisone cream and went to bed.  The welt was still there the following morning (Friday,  January 15) and was slowly decreasing in redness and size.  At 7:30pm on Friday, January 15 I went to express care at the advice of my PCP and was evaluated.  I was told to take Zyrtec and continue to ice the area, apply hydrocortisone cream if I found it helpful, and to report symptoms here.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

                                                About 5-6 days after vaccine injection on 1/15/21, I developed a rash, itching, and pain on the same arm as my injection. It is also warm to the touch. I went to Urgent Care and they think it is cellulitis from the vaccine. I am on Bactrim DS to see if it will help. My blood pressure was low as well, not sure if it&#39;s related but usually by pressure is fine. I had cupping done at the chiropractor on 1/22 on my neck and back, symptoms started later that evening. Not sure if is is a coincidence or not.

                                                Received second COVID vaccine Moderna on Wednesday evening at 6pm.  Later that night, I was a little light-headed and achey, but went to bed. On thursday, my legs and arms were extremely achy. I took Tylenol and Motrin in the morning. It seemed to help some, but continued to feel very achy in my legs. I left work early (I am a pediatrician) on Thursday and went home and just sat and rested.  I felt terrible, but had talked to other colleagues who felt very bad that first day after the shot. Friday morning, I woke up still achy but feeling better overall. I took motrin and Tylenol again on Friday morning. I worked the whole day seeing patients. Was tired, but got thru the workday. At around 6pm, I noticed petechiae rash on my lower legs. The rash started spreading thru the night- up my legs and to my arms. I went to ER. They did order CBC, CMP. Platelets were undetectable- 1 platelet was seen under microscope. CMP was normal.  I was told to go to bigger hospital. I went, My platelets read as 4. I was admitted for two nights. Two doses of IVIG were given and I was put on Decadron 40mg PO daily for 4 days. I had tylenol, benadryl, zofran before the IVIG and after.  I will see Hematology next week for follow up. Platelets yesterday at discharge were 60.  Will be checked frequently for the next few months. ITP= diagnosis. COVID shot was trigger.

On Saturday the redness and I ring was gone, but I started having pain in my armpit and when I moved my arm in different positions. Hand was tingling with certain positions suggesting nerve pain. Lasted 2 to 3 days and got worse before better. Was mostly gone by Tuesday. Wednesday 8 days after injections the redness, itching, and swelling in my arm returned. Same size as the day after my injection. Called the doctor to see if I need to be concerned that the redness, itchyness, and swelling returned after completely going away 4 days earlier. Also feeling tired for the past 3 to 4 days but otherwise good. Some minor discomfort/pain in collar bone around and lump node in neck but is not consistent. Comes and goes. Not sure if the nerve pain in arm was related to the vaccine, but since the redness returned it may all be related.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart started racing and I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

                                                7 days after receiving the vaccine, I developed intense, deep muscle pain and swelling. The arm where I received the vaccine was very hot to the touch. The next day, I had chills and a mild fever, along with swollen and sore arm. Through the weekend, I developed redness in splotches that were similar to hives in appearance. My arm has been intensely itchy. On Saturday, 2.20.21, the lymph node under my left arm became very swollen and painful. I am currently still experiencing a mildly sore arm (pain has lessened since yesterday), arm is still very hot to the touch, still have red rash/hives and my lymph node is still very painful.

Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

I went to urgent care and the PA was unable to diagnose what caused the lump or what the lump was.  On 12-31-20 and 1-04-21 had nose bleeds. Nose bleeds are not a normal occurrence for me and I emailed my NP for further treatment options.  No response yet.

                                                On my 12th minute in the waiting area, I started having itchiness on my legs then it spread to my arms and face. I felt lightheaded and started having difficulty breathing. I approached the paramedic nearby. By then, the itchiness was all over my body from head to toe. They alerted 911 and monitored my vital signs. My 02 sat was 100% and BP was 140/90 mmHg. I asked if I can take Benadryl. They said wait for the ambulance. I declined to go to the hospital unless my symptoms get worse. I then took 25 mg of Benadryl. Shortness of breath and lightheaded ness was slightly relieved but the itchiness was still there. I waited for 30 more minutes in the waiting area. When the itchiness subsided a little bit, I went home. After 3 hours, the itchiness and SOB returned so I called my PCP and I was informed to take Benadryl q4 hrs until symptoms are resolved. As of today, 1/12/21 at 7:18pm, I still have itchiness but not as bad as yesterday.

                                                Pt received first dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/2020. Initial question of whether vaccine was administered correctly - administering nurse never felt arm before administering and did say she thought she gave the injection &#34;too low&#34; and not on deltoid. The nurse mentioned that someone else had gotten a reaction from receiving the dose &#34;too low.&#34; Pt developed a red lump the next day at site of injection.  For first week or so, patient&#39;s symptoms decreased although she still experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness. Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again. Pt talked to infection control nurse at hospital, who advised her to go to clinic to get it seen by a provider because it looked like it might be cellulitis.  Pt presented 1/7/2021 with complaint of possible infection in right arm where she received the vaccine. Area was red, swollen, warm to the touch. Pt also had some breast tenderness. Pt was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 in clnic and discharged.  Pt followed up the next day, 1/8/2021. At that appointment, symptoms had decreased. Redness and firmness of area had decreased and range of motion had increased. Pt continued to endorse soreness that traveled from right side of neck all the way down right elbow, but states it had decreased since 1/7.  1/12/21 pt followed up in clinic and stated arm was much better. Swelling almost gone and erythema much improved. Pt was able to use arm normally. Axilla still a little swollen, but no fever/nausea/vomiting/rash. Pt thinks she had ANA positive in past and c/f collagen vascular disease, in part because she has muscle ache flares for days to weeks.

Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccination around 10:00am. It was confirmed that it was okay to get the vaccine being that I tested positive for Covid on 12/23/20. Around 19:00 I started to get cold and by midnight I was shivering uncontrollably, I had a fever and had a massive headache. I alternated ibuprofren and Tylenol which did not work. I was only able to sleep from midnight to about 3:00am. The entire day I was shivering with a massive headache. It hurt so bad that I wanted to cry but it hurt worse when I did cry. My highest fever was 101 degrees. My fever broke around 19:00 on 01/05/2021 but the massive headache and body aches lasted the entire week. I felt like I was &#34;hit by a bus&#34; and my entire top part of my arm was in pain . I was seen by a doctor  at HS on Thursday the 7th to have my medical condition documented. My arm felt better by then. She had me take off the rest of the week and to return to work on the 11th. I finally started to feel somewhat better by the 9th

                                                ABOUT 6 DAYS AFTER RECEIVING MY COVID19 VACCINATION. I STARTED TO DEVELOPED MOUTH BLISTERS OR COLD SORES. THEY WOULD GO AWAY AND RETURN DAYS LATER ON OTHER PART OF THE MOUTH. THIS HAPPENED ABOUT 3 TIMES AND THE LAST TIME WAS ON TUESDAY 1/19/21 WHERE I DEVELOPED A HUGE PAINFUL LUMP UNDER MY JAW BY THE EVENING. I DON&#39;T USUALLY SUFFER FROM MOUTH BLISTERS. I HAVE ONLY DEVELOPED THEM 3 TO 5 TIMES IN MY ENTIRE LIFETIME. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY PRIMARY DOCTOR, WHO CONFIRMED THAT THE LUMP WAS A SWOLLEN LYMPH NODE, IT WAS HUGE, THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL. SHE DID A PHYSICAL ON ME TO CHECK IF I WAS SICK AND HAD NO OTHER SYMPTOMS ASIDE FROM THE MOUTH BLISTERS AND THE HUGE LYMPH NODE.

No shortness of breath (apart from discomfort due to the tightness). I did not have any other symptoms at that time (e.g. fevers, cough, muscle/body aches). Over the next 5-6 days, the tightness moved progressively upwards into my upper chest, then my lower esophagus, then into my neck before spontaneously resolving.

Upon returning to work in the pharmacy, she sat down at her desk and noted her HR to be 159 via her Apple watch. She felt slightly lightheaded, so returned to  Auditorium for monitoring. On arrival, she complained only of high HR, no other symptoms. We checked her VS: BP 140/78, HR 132, RR 20, SaO2 94. She denied chest pain or SOB. We monitored her for about 15 minutes, and her HR decreased to 103-110. We monitored her for another 15 minutes or so, at which time her HR spiked again to 132, and she felt heavy in her chest and tight in her throat. At that point, we moved her to a gurney and called a Rapid Response. We administered 50mg of Benadryl IM per protocol, foregoing the Epinephrine, due to her tachycardic state. The Rapid Response team arrived and she was transported to the ED for evaluation. She maintained consciousness and was A&amp;Ox3 the entire time.

                                                I had previous anaphylaxis events that were treated and did not require hospitalization. I brought epinephrine pen and premedicated with Xyzal 5mg 9 hours before and Benadryl 25mg 1.5 hours before vaccine. 20 minutes after vaccine I felt flushing, nausea, low blood pressure. They had released me from the drive through vaccination site and I was driving and felt panicky, so I pulled over. I waited 10 minutes because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anaphylaxis or not. I felt OK after 10 minutes, so I drove to nearest ER and waited in parking lot several hours then drove home. I probably should have administered epinephrine and called 911 when I had that reaction. Continued with 25mg Benadryl every 4 hours and nightly Xyzal 5mg. The next morning (24 hours later)  I woke up scratching my face. I had a diffuse sandpaper rash all over my head and neck and was very itchy. Doubled my dose of Benadryl to 50mg every 4 hours. Also took 400mg of quercetin. The itching resolved and the rash was gone the next day, which was 48 hours after vaccine. I was fatigued for several days but fatigue is my baseline as a narcoleptic plus I was taking benadryl. I continued the Benadryl for a total of 4 days. I normally do not develop rashes unless I rub against hay and I did not have any contact with hay.
