                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

                                                It was noted during injection a tremendous amount of pain/stinging/burning that lasted a few minutes. About 20 minutes post injection, numbness/tingling noted in pinky/5th finger radiating down palm to wrist on same arm as injection as well as dizziness. Notified observation RNs and moved to a separate room. Mildly elevated BP but normal HR noted. No rash/hives/difficulty breathing. Numbness and tingling would migrate - most often to thumb but sometimes up entire arm. Released 1 hour after injection after no life threatening signs noted.  Visited PCP the next day (1/6) at 10:15. Professional opinion that it is due to swelling from injection - now noticeable area of swelling around injection site. Recommended ice and NSAIDs.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Dec 2020 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: OU520A/011520A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.     On 23 Dec 2020, within minutes of receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction and was rushed to the emergency room (ER). When transported to the ER she began to experience throat swelling, redness of arms and chest, trouble breathing with lower chest pain shooting into lungs, and numbness with tingling in her right arm. Treatment for the event included epinephrine, steroids, and diphenhydramine.  She was released from the ER on 23 Dec 2020.  On 24 Dec 2020 patient awoke with a headache, fatigue, and generalized itchiness. Treatment for the event included ibuprofen and diphenhydramine.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, anaphylactic reaction, right arm numbness and tingling, were reported as resolved on 23 December 2020. The events of headache, fatigue, and generalized itchiness were considered resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 26-year-old female patient who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot OU520A/011520A), and who experienced the unlisted events of anaphylactic reaction, right arm numbness and tingling, and generalized itchiness, and the listed events of headache and fatigue.  The events were considered to be possibly related to the vaccine due to the temporal relationship with onset on the day of vaccination.

No shortness of breath or trouble breathing, just general chest tightness. Got a little better the next day, but still a bit of chest tightness. Almost feels like the type of chest pressure you get when you have a bad cold with postnasal drip.

                                                Saturday- felt fine for a Couple of hours after vaccine. Felt fatigued around 4 PM, laid down, lost ability to move arm, extreme pain in neck.  Sunday- more of the same throughout the day. At night when I took a shower the pain moved over the course of a few minutes in the shower from my arm to my lower back. Arm was fine, Lower back pain bad enough that I was limping.  Monday- woke up &amp; pain was evenly dispersed between lower back and head. Slight soreness in arm and neck. Took extra strength ibuprofen because I had to work. Totally fine for the rest of the day time. At night my arm and neck started to become very sore again. After I ate dinner I developed a very intense fever, chills/ shakes, my arm felt like it had a heartbeat and my heart was racing. Laid in bed all night. Felt scared and disturbed that this was happening days after the vaccine. Considered going to the hospital but I couldn?t move. Slept for 10 hours.  Tuesday (today)- feeling almost all better aside from slight pain in neck.

                                                Had chest tightness for 2 days after the vaccine, which went away on day 3. Then on day 4 a dull chest discomfort started again which I have had every since (now on day 8 post vaccine).  When i woke up on day 8 post vaccine I noticed left deltoid swelling and tenderness in the arm that I received the vaccine a week ago. I only had arm swelling for 1-2 days post vaccine and then another onset on day 8 (1/20/21). Also have some left armpit tenderness 3 days ago.

Later that morning I was light headed, fatigued, sore throat, nausea. The fever continued to increase. By 2200 that day my fever was 104.7 and that was with Tylenol on board. I also iced my groins and axillary areas to help cool my body. Today is the second day out from the vaccine and I have recovered from the fevers. My fever early this morning was still 102.5 but has since passed and I am normothermic. I am very fatigued with some chest pains.

I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

                                                I was very sore at the site of injection around 6-7 PM. At approximately 1:00 AM, I started experiencing a fever (101.3 F), chills, aches, and some heart palpitations. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen, which helped to reduce the fever and chills.  When I woke up, I was nauseous, had a serious headache, fatigue, minor chills, a fever (101.3 F) and more noticeable heart palpitations (when measured with my smartwatch, it reported bpm of 118-124). I had a virtual consult with a physician who advised me to be seen by urgent care immediately.

Around 6:30 pm body spasms began (they were more rapid and out of sync than normal cold/flu shaking) with extreme dehydration. At 7:30-8pm a fever set in at 101.0, body continued to have shakes/spasms, nausea still around, aching joints, and blood system felt extremely warm as if hot water was flowing through veins/arteries. Next morning fever spiked to 102.7 and stuck on until 48 hours later. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea kept staying for about a week.

                                                About 2 to 3 minutes after receiving my injection, I began to feel a burning sensation in my nostrils. It felt like a 4/10 pain. The burning sensation worsened when breathing through my nose. When trying breathing techniques to calm down (breathing deeply through the nose, exhaling out the mouth), the burning sensation deepened towards the back of my throat - but I never felt it in my lower throat and chest - only the top of my throat and nose.  The nurse on staff took me to a corner for closer evaluation. She had me remove my mask and checked my body for hives. I had no hives and the burning sensation occurred even after my mask was removed. She asked if I had trouble breathing or itchiness, I had neither of those symptoms. My heart rate was high and I began to hyperventilate because I was having a panic attack. I had no other symptoms besides the panic attack symptoms (tight chest, tingly face and hands, rapid heart rate, and dizziness) and the burning nostrils.  The sensation lasted about 5-10 minutes, then dissipated. I then put my mask back on after it was requested. I continued to be monitored by the nurse for another 20 minutes until I gained back my normal breathing and my heart rate lowered. I was scheduled for a 2nd dose and was dismissed with no other treatment or issues. I drove myself back home and rested for the remainder of the day.  I had no other symptoms that day, other than the typical sore arm, fatigue, and mild chills, which resolved themselves in a couple days. I had no other complications.

Both symptoms seemed to have faded before I left the monitoring area. Proceeded to drive home (20 minute drive) and nausea returned, as well as increasing pressure and pain in chest. I decided to turn around and go back to the urgent care clinic. Arrived back at clinic by 0900am. Pressure in chest had receded but there was still some aching/occasional sharp chest pains and nausea. Clinic referred me to the ED for further workup. Most symptoms had stopped by 1000am when I went to the ED.

                                                Roughly 10 hours after receiving the 2nd Moderna covid vaccine my hand turned red and swollen bilaterally and from the 2nd knuckle down to the end of the fingers they were completely pale and the nails began turning blue. The change in color was a very defined straight line border. It was not painful and there was no numbness or tingling. I had not been outside or done anything involving a change of temperature. Along with my second dose I also experienced severe chills/shivering , nausea, sweating, fatigue, and body aches. These also happened with the first dose. The change in color to my hands lasted about 2 hours. There does not seem to be any lingering issues since then.

                                                Experienced an increase in heart rate from 10 p.m. on 1/26/2021 for approximately 24 hours. According to the data on my fitness band, my heart rate averaged at 130 bpm during sleep and rest, and was approximately 170 bpm when standing despite taking metoprolol succinate. I usually take 12.5mg of the metoprolol, and took another 12.5 mg the morning of 01/27/2021, which seemed to help with the increase in heart rate. Despite normally experiencing an increase in heart rate due to my diagnosis of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia, my heart rate usually drops into the 60&#39;s at night and during the day if I am moving, is about 120-130 bpm. Additionally on 01/28/2021, I had difficulty standing due to feeling faint and dizzy upon standing. All symptoms appeared to resolve by 01/29/2021. Besides taking extra medication, I spent the day resting and hydrating with water.

My calfs hurt like they had previously had muscle cramps. I went to ER, blood and urine tests were fine, heart and blood pressure was fine. Dr said he did not believe it was an allergic reaction, and that it was a stress response. I am not sure if it is because I had COVID in December.

                                                3 hours after the vaccine I started running fever. I had a headache and severe pain in my right side. 2:00 am on February 12,2021 I woke up around 3 am in unbelievable pain and swelling starting at the right side of my face, down into my armpit, through my collar bone, chest and back. I had been running a fever and could not keep anything down. The swelling and unimaginable pain led me to go to ER where they treated me for anaphylactic shock. I received intramuscular shot of epi, IV Benadryl, toridol, famitodine. I was sent home, but ended up coming back after about an hour because I had gone into SVT.

At 2:00 pm, I tried to sit up in my bed - I proceeded to throw up and faint. I contacted doctor to see if I should take anything. I took an ibuprofen and drank fluid - but didn&#39;t drink as much as normal because of nausea. I was nauseated all day. It stayed about 102 until about 8:00 pm. At about 10:00 pm that night, I started feeling a bit better. The next day fever was 99.7 and with more ibuprofen it normalized to 98.6. If I didn&#39;t take ibuprofen for awhile it went back up to 99. something so I had to keep taking ibuprofen for the rest of that third day. Fourth day - mild fatigue and muscle aches. Everything was normal other than that. Fatigue and muscle aches were gone about Friday morning.

                                                Around 6 pm I got a severe headache, very bad body aches, trouble breathing, and a very fast heart rate. I felt faint and had cold sweats so I went to ER after work. The ER doctor gave me fluids, a vial of tylenol through IV, and just observed me to make sure my heart rate and blood pressure came down. They said it sounded like a normal reaction. Fever of 101. I am getting a MRI of my brain on Tuesday 3/9/21 for continued severe headaches.

                                                Very swollen and painful lymph nodes all over entire body (chest, shoulders, arms, stomach, calves) for 1 week. Felt nauseous, dizzy, and exhausted. No appetite. Struggled to read and process things. Could not work. Sharp pains in lymph nodes at various times throughout the day. Chest felt very tight and arm hurt to the point I thought I might be having a heart attack. Had trouble sleeping due to lymph node pain. Ibuprofen did not help. The arm pain at injection site was annoying but I barely noticed it due to my other symptoms.

These feelings lasted for about 30 minutes and my vision and feeling in my fingers and hand came back as the dizziness subsided and my body temp returned to normal.   Around 40 minutes after the vaccine I started experiencing echoing in my left ear (the side I got the vaccine on) and soreness around the vaccination site.   The echoing in my left ear lasted about 30 minutes and then subsided. The arm pain spread to the rest of my arm and I began to get a headache.  About 4 hours after the vaccine I began to experience intense back, hip, foot and hand pain making me unable to do any regular activities. The back pain feels like intensely sharp pain in my spine and hurts to the gentle touch. I previously had no back pain prior to the vaccine. The muscles surrounding my spine up to my shoulders were also painful/sore.  This pain subsided after 6 days. On about the 4th day after the vaccine I began experiencing underarm and breast pain on the side I got the vaccine.  It is now exactly 1 week since my vaccination and I am still experiencing the underarm and breast pain.  I have experienced lethargy since vaccination.

Patient had head leaned back, seemed to be unconscious, and had some shaking/convulsions. Shaking occurred for about 45 seconds and patient then vomited.  911 was called. Patient became responsive but was very pale and sweaty though she did not have any breathing issues, so EpiPen was not administered.  EMS arrived and patient left with ambulance on a stretcher, though she was conscious and communicating with the EMS team.

At 9pm that night when I took out my dog outside for a couple minutes I started uncontrollably shaking and I couldn?t stop. My chest started hurting and my breathing was difficult. I went back inside and laid on the floor and waited for the symptoms to stop. Once they finally stopped after about 10 minutes I just had the sore arm and chills again. It?s now been 2 days sense the vaccine and the chills hasn?t gone away. But I don?t have the uncontrollable shaking anymore.

                                                One hour after vaccination on Saturday got lethargic and so tired. Same the next day. Monday, the fatigue improved but Instartes to get muscle aches and stiffness. Soreness in my joints. By Wednesday evening my chest started to hurt for a few minutes and my heart rate temporarily Increased. As the days went on the symptoms became more regular. I also got extreme anxiety, a very fast heartbeat (up to 130 BPM), insomnia, sweating palms and feet, and very difficult to breathe. I couldn?t even get up to take a shower sometimes or sit up. I was admitted to the ER on I believe Tuesday the 23rd of March. This is all in the records. All tests came back normal  aside from low iron, but anemia tests came back negative. After all doctors refused to give me medication to directly treat it, I finally went to an urgent care where they gave me prednisone. It?s currently helping me. I was finally able to go for a walk today.

She was told to sit down near pharmacy for 15 minutes after receiving shot for observation.  However, since she is an employee, she decided to sit in the break room.  For 15 minutes, she was fine and she came back to pharmacy to let staff know she was fine.  At 30 minute point, she started feeling lightheaded, heart racing, shaky, foggy, and some nausea.  She sat down, was given ice pack for back of neck, instructed to put head down between legs and rest.  After talking to patient, she had eaten some after her shot, she was well hydrated.  She has had no previous major adverse effects from shot, aside from sometimes sore arm.  She is alert, communicative, and aware of her surroundings when I spoke to her.   At 2:17pm, patient is feeling a bit better, but still has lessened but similar SE.  Also, reports she has a bit of headache now.  Another coworker has offered to drive her home and she has her grandmother at home to watch her too.  Advised her to rest at home, take tylenol if headache persists, stand up and sit down carefully, and drink chicken soup until nausea is over.

                                                I took Benadryl before this dose per my allergist. About 3 minutes after the dose I felt a little light headed and dizzy that shortly resolved. About 10 minutes after that, I became light headed and dizzy again along with chest tightness, palpitations and an itchy throat. My heart rate was in the 110s. My symptoms would be on and off. I received more Benadryl in the ED with no resolution. I then was given an epi pen and prednisone. After this the itchy throat and light headedness resolved. I was observed in the ED for a total of 4 hours. I was discharged with 4 days of prednisone and 2 days of Benadryl.

                                                Within 1.5 hours, I started getting a bad headache.  She was not hungry, was nauseated and was becoming clammy.  She tried to eat but it did not make it better.  When she got home, she continued to feel &#34;really bad like she was getting over the flu.&#34;  She slept for over 10 hours.  When she got up, she could not move her arm and her arm was sore at the injection (it was hard, a little swelling but was not red).  Then she started feeling worse with bad pain (like she had a stroke).  This was around 12 noon to 1 PM on 1/21/21.  Around 7 PM that night, she presented to the ER.  The ER doctor said he thought she was having a migraine but she has never had one before.  Her blood pressure was high at 127/110.  Her supervisor walked into the room and said her face was pulling and it looked like a stroke to her.  She reported severe pain from her ear to her neck on the right side of her head.  She left due to having to provide care to her newborn.  She went to hospital on 1/21/21 about 2100.   Her blood pressure was still high and she had a heart rate of 120 bpm.  She did lab work and CT scan.   ER doctor believed she was experience Bell&#39;s Palsy and that she had had a mini-seizure.  She provided prednisone 60 mg X 1 dose, Valtrex tid and shot of Toradol.  She prescribed Toradol for outpatient pain relief.

                                                I received the shot a 5:30 pm and just had arm pain. At 3am, I woke up with fever, chills, a migraine, dizziness and lightheadedness that prevented me from walking without assistance. I began feeling pain while breathing and was very weak when standing. My fever reached 102.9 while taking Tylenol. The body aches and Migraine were a 10/10. I went to hospital where they treated my migraine and the benedryl seemed to ease much of my pain and dizziness related to the vaccine. I was told I was having a vaccine reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I started to have an increased heart rate and heart palpitations that lasted about a second/1.5 seconds on and off. The increased heart rate would persist for quite some time (an hour or two), and then would stop, and happen again on and off.  The heart palpitations would occur multiple times per day. This lasted for about three days from the start date of the adverse event. On that start date, I also had some muscle cramping in my left arm (arm of vaccine injection), and had soreness beginning around my lymph nodes in my left armpit (that radiated into my chest a bit)  which was enough to make me want to life my arm up so it wasn&#39;t pressing down on it. The soreness is mostly gone now, but still there. I also had what I believe is muscles in my chest (on the left side mainly) cramping, as I had some aching and brief sharp pains occurring mainly during the time I had heart palpitations and increased heart rate, but it was hard to tell. I still get an occasional heart palpitation (one or two per day), but it is much less frequent than before.

Initial vitals showed HR of 155, and cardiac monitor appeared to show SVT. After 2 valsalva maneuvers, the patient&#39;s HR had lowered to about 120, and ECG showed sinus tachycardia with some ST depression in V1 &amp; V2. CBC, CMP, and TSH were all normal except for mild hypokalemia (potassium = 3.1 mEq/L). Bedside ultrasound was performed as well. Patient received 1L of normal saline and was sent home after about 3 hours with a mildly elevated HR. In the following 24 hours, pt experienced headache, fatigue, and somnolescence, with brief episodes of mildly elevated HR without palpitations.

After 30 minutes, we came back to give the pt her vaccination card and as soon as she stood up, she fell slowly onto the floor and started having seizure (pt didn&#39;t hit her head per technician on scene) around 3:50 pm and became unconscious for a few seconds. She was able to answer our questions when she woke up, but was confused of where she at. She continued to call out random names.  We called the ambulance and assisted her while she was on the floor.  She had another seizure 5 minutes after the first seizure and became unconscious again for a few more seconds. After she woke up, we placed her on her side and monitored her pulse rates and her breathing while on the phone with 911 personnel.  The paramedic came 10 mins after the call. Pt had a history of seizure (she wore epileptic tag around her neck). Pt was taken by paramedic to the nearest hospital for further observation.

Around 8:30 pm I experienced extreme chills and had a 100-101 F fever all night. I woke in the morning still feeling weak because I spent the whole night uncomfortable from the fever and flushed  face I had. I walked towards another part of my house and fell down and fainted. I was unconscious for a few seconds before a family member was able to shake me and wake me up. I take no medications and am a generally healthy individual with no prior medical history or underlying Heath conditions. I also do not have a history of falls or issues from taking any past vaccines. I also am not allergic to anything or have experienced any allergic reactions in my life. It?s the second day now and I am still experiencing a 100 Degree fever and face flushing. I am currently self medicating at home with Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not gone to see a health care professional yet.

                                                She presented to the hospital with acute typical angina approximately 72 hours after receiving her 2nd vaccine dose. The morning following her vaccine she developed fever, chills, generalized malaise, myalgias, and fatigue lasting about 48 hours. The following morning, she was awoken from sleep by a crushing substernal chest pain with associated typical anginal symptoms. Her initial troponin-I was elevated at 7.47 ng/mL and peaked at 19.19 ng/mL. An ECG demonstrated minimal ST elevations followed by an echocardiogram demonstrated preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of 60-65%. Due to her elevation in cardiac enzymes and persistent angina, coronary angiography was performed revealing no obstructive coronary artery disease. She was diagnosed with suspected myocarditis and treated successfully with anti-inflammatory medication. In follow-up, she had an uncomplicated treatment course with complete resolution of anginal systems and improvement in troponin and inflammatory markers.

These symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes and then they resolved. I did not have any of these symptoms since it initially happened on 1.8.21 at 230am. I did not seek medical care at the time since my symptoms resolved. I did contact my doctor on 2.1.2021 about this and he stated the symptoms I described aligned with symptoms of a panic attack, but if I felt it was related to the vaccine that I can report it.

                                                Received around 2pm on Friday, 1/15/21. Not sure exactly when this started, but noticed redness around injection site  that evening around 8pm, mildly itchy. Also felt a little bit tachycardic and anxious about 2 hrs after (4pm Friday) for 15-30 mins, but I think that may have been lack of sleep and my own nerves! But redness persisted at injection site, and had intermittent hives around injection site (smaller area within area of redness, about silver dollar sized hive area intermittently), noticed probably 5x over the next 8 days (last had hives on 1/23 PM, 8 days after). Hives were sort of raised white weals with red border. Redness persisted and began to resolve at around 10 days s/p shot, fully resolved by about 12 days s/p shot. Also seemed to have decreased appetite over that time, but also could be totally unrelated with stress

HR elevated; having difficulty breathing so EpiPen 1:1000 given IM in left thigh.  Adult code blue called.  Code team arrived within 30 seconds to one minute and employee transported to ER via gurney.    Per ER Notes: DEXAmethasone (DECADRON) 10 mg/mL injection for oral use 10 mg (10 mg Oral Given 12/28/20 1301)  Patient is in no acute distress, states that she feels well.  History and physical exam as above.  Patient states that her symptoms have resolved as of arriving in the emergency department.  We will assume that this was an anaphylactic reaction, she was not given time to develop all signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, however she was given an EpiPen and her dyspnea rapidly improved and therefore we will treat her as if she experience anaphylaxis.  She will be kept in the emergency department for 6 hours for observation, she was given 10 mg of p.o. Decadron.  At the time of my shift change she continued to be hemodynamically stable, awake, and talkative. She still required ~3 hours of observation at that time. I saw this patient with attending physician, please see her note for ultimate disposition or further developments.

                                                Received my first vaccine 1/6/2021. I was very nervous about the vaccine, so I brought 4 epi-pens with me. My PCP and allergist advised me to sit x30 minutes after the shot. 25 minutes after receiving the shot, I felt very warm.  I looked at my hands and they were fire-cracker red in color. I began doffing my sweatshirt and my arms/neck/stomach and back were had a spotty rash. There was no hives/areas of elevation.  Nurses took my BP.  40 minutes without medication, rash and warmth resolved. A few hours later, I had a terrible headache and then around 8pm, I started with bad aches, chills, fever of 101. I took tylenol and did not resolved. The next AM, symptoms continued. I took advil and this had a better effect with sx resolving. My second dose, I received on 2/5/2021. I had a similar response about 10 minutes after the shot but warmth/reddness did not last as long, ~5-10 minutes. Had my BP taken, which was elevated (probably from my own anxiety). a few hours after the shot, I began with the headache, chills and fever--- though all mild. fever was 99 degrees the next day. 2/8/2021, I felt very fatigued and weird for a few hours. this seem to pass and I have felt normal since; just very tired. *** additionally, I did have COVID-19, testing positive 11/11/2020. my sx were mild compared to others.

Not clear what was being asked in previous page for address - of doctor or vaccination site. I had vaccine at 730-740am and by 430pm, I had heavy onset symptoms of body aches, chills, fever etc. I took 1000mg of Tylenol and began feeling better. Still exhausted so I went to bed around 630pm but because I was pushing so much fluid, I kept getting up to pee. I was still freezing. Around 940pm, I woke up to pee and again freezing still. I sat on the toilet and started having full body convulsions and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor. My husband found me passed out, face first on the tile floor with my pants still down. I hit the left side of my face very hard. My husband helped me to bed where I took more ibuprofen and tremored for the next hour before I fell asleep. I woke up completely drenched and sweat and with a headache.

                                                Within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I was dizzy, nauseous, and elevated BP (140?s/90?s). After about 30 minutes, these symptoms subsided. At 1:30 AM on 2/13, I woke from sleep with severe epigastric pain, chest pain, and pain between my shoulder blades. My arm (where I received the vaccine) was throbbing and I had severe under arm pain on the same side. Symptoms lessened with 2 extra strength Tums, 500 mg Tylenol, and 30 mL of Pepto, but were still present. I was able to sleep, I woke up later in the morning with these persistent symptoms, as well as fatigue. All of these symptoms continued for 24h. On 2/14, I had lessened arm pain and fatigue but continued to have epigastric/chest/back pain. I was seen at the urgent care near me and my physical was normal, they indicated that the chest symptoms were likely from epigastric pain since I was not having shortness of breath. I?ve continued to have these seemingly random chest pains and back pains, they?re very intense throbbing sharp pains in my chest and back that do not always coincide with exercise or stress.

At around 2AM, I had vasovagal syncope (I lost consciousness and then woke up covered in sweat). Directly after I regained consciousness, I vomited several times over the next couple of minutes. I drank water and took Tylenol to try and alleviate symptoms. After that, I no longer vomited or lost consciousness but I continued to feel feverish, had a severe headache, fatigue, chills off and on, nausea, and muscle and joint pain until around 4PM on 2/24/21.

                                                Spells of extreme dizziness/vertigo about 2 hours after the vaccination; it subsided about 10 hours after vaccination. Sharp pain in the chest/side/back (opposite the arm it was injected in) but I am also guessing this was stress related pain as I was very nervous about the vaccine (wanted to report anyway just in case) the pain subsides with 400mg ibuprofen. Then swelling, redness, and itchiness at the vaccination site starting the next day (3/6) and growing in intensity after (today). Currently the swelling is about 1.5 inches in diameter, it does not seem serious so I&#39;ll be treating it with topicals to ease the itching.

                                                Starting on March 13, I noticed the injection site was extremely red and swollen. On March 14 the muscle stiffness had moved from the injection site to my left shoulder. The muscles felt tight and bruised. The following morning, March 15 @ 10:30 a.m, the same pain has spread to my upper chest, around the collar bone. The area around also appears to be swollen, most noticeable on the neck. This is all accompanied by headaches increasing in severity as well as extreme exhaustion.

Defined welts appeared whenever skin was abraded and subsided within about 15-20 minutes, not itchy unless i scratched more. Inflamed areas were red, warm to touch, blanchable.  I first thought it was an allergic reaction to some unknown substance but elimination and reintroduction of all creams, cosmetics, suspect foods has not resulted in relief or identification of causative agent. Food habits have not changed significantly either in time between vaccination and appearance of symptoms Symptoms made better with use of OTC antihistamine (Cetirizine/Zyrtec) but are otherwise manageable with self-control, not scratching.

                                                I have been experiencing shortness of breath, swollen arm, red rash around injection site, fever, fatigue, increased heart rate, headache, and joint pain. Most symptoms appeared overnight (about 8-12 hours post injection on 3/24) and have continued throughout the day (3/25). The shortness of breath began about an hour after injection (3/24), and has continued through the next day (3/25). So far treatment has involved taking ibuprofen at 10:30pm (3/24).

                                                A patient presenting to hospital OB department received Moderna doses on 1/20/21 and 2/18/21.  She received them from health department at a clinic.  She self-quarantined from 3/15 to 3/31 due to approaching her delivery date.  She was in contact with 2 friends on 3/10 which both tested positive on the 22nd and 26th respectively.   She presented to OB initially on 4/1 for labor &amp; delivery.  She was found to be COVID positive at this time after being COVID tested - she had no prior symptons of COVID.   She had to have an unscheduled c-section after 24 hours in labor.  While laboring she did go into a critical blood pressure range.  She was treated appropriately with medication.  Patient did well postpartum and postop.  Lungs were clear and patient afebrile.  Patient discharged 4/4.    Patient returned to hospital on 4/6 for elevated blood pressure (was advised on previous discharge to monitor blood pressures at home and to report if elevated).  Her inpatient stay involved being treated for elevated blood pressure with magnesium sulfate, nifedipine, and labetalol.  She had swelling in lower extremities and has had a Doppler study which showed no DVT.  She was on a blood thinner enoxaparin though because of postop status and also COVID.  She went home on 4/10 advised to follow up with provider if any more issues were to arise.  She went home on enoxaparin 40mg subcutaneous for 10 days, nifedipine ER 60mg daily, and labetalol 400mg three times daily.  Blood pressure elevation probably related to course of L&amp;D case but reporting due to the fact that patient had received both doses of the COVID vaccine and had tested positive during the course of the L&amp;D.

Heart rate was checked by medical professional in household and was found to be 120 and irregular. This lasted approximately 2 minutes. At this time also felt shortness of breath which lasted 30 minutes. Once the tachycardia and shortness of breath ended, I was getting chills and continued to have nausea and extreme fatigue. Since the vaccination my arm has continued to be very sore. When I woke up on 1/8/2021 I am still very fatigued and still have a sore arm.

                                                The day after my vaccination after I got home from work, I started to develop a cough, followed by chest heaviness. I then noticed that I couldn&#39;t get warm and started taking my temperature every half hour. The highest it got was 101.6 at 11:30pm that night. I couldn&#39;t sleep, so after eating some soup and talking one Tylenol PM, I did finally get to sleep. The next morning, my temperature was 98.6 and I felt perfectly fine. Summary of symptoms -cough -heaviness in the chest -body chills (was still cold in a really hot shower) -fever of 101.6  -fatigue -duration: only lasted for one evening from about 6pm until I woke up the next morning feeling just fine

Within 30 seconds of administration, my hands and feet immediately went cold and numb and dropped my phone on the floor. I blacked out for 2 seconds. (I was told I also flailed my arms and legs as it happened, this I do not remember). Following this, my heart rate was fast and blood pressure were elevated. I felt extremely dizzy for about 90 minutes following. It took approximately an hour for me to get taken to the emergency department.

She was taken to exam room where she received 0.3 mg Epinephrine IM into her right thigh. She was tachycardic in the 150s but was normotensive and satting 100% on room air. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving Epi, her breathing slowed down and symptoms began to fade. She was transported via ambulance per protocol.

                                                I received the second dose of the Moderna COVID19 vaccine at approximately 2pm on 1/28/21. Starting at 10am the next morning I noticed I was feeling fatigued and my heart rate was starting to increase. By 11am, I was experiencing diffuse myalgia, fatigue, and malaise. By the time I went home at 11:30am, I had a fever to at least 101F, chills, body aches, and headache. I rested in bed the whole rest of the day and the night. I felt better taking Tylenol but it only relieved my fevers somewhat. I had no GI symptoms, rash, or difficulty breathing. By the next morning my fever had abated and my energy level much improved.

Around 6:00 pm, I measured my temperature and it was 95.0 degrees Fahrenheit. I could not get warm for and experienced tingling and numbness in first my feet, then arms and hands, and finally my face. This passed and I was left feeling nauseous and still extremely cold. After tossing and turning for most of the night, so of these side effects have resolved, but I have a splitting headache and muscle and joint pain throughout my body. No treatment has been undertaken. Some side effects have resolved while others continue.

My arm was immediately hot and tender after administration. The area around the injection site had less feeling than the rest of my arm - it felt almost numb. My arm was very sore and warm the rest of the evening. I began having fatigue, muscle aches, and joint pain last night as well. I woke up around 6 this morning and the room was spinning. I was also nauseous. I tried to roll over in bed but was unable to feel my arms and legs. I was also temporarily unable to see. Right after, I passed out and lost urinary continence. I regained consciousness a minute later and had normal functioning again. I have not had any more dizziness today but am still sore and fatigued.

She was taken by EMS to the  Emergency Department and evaluated, here it was discovered that she has a history of nonepileptic seizure episodes and the Physician Assistant providing care did not think this episode was &#34;measureable allergic reaction to her vaccination however perhaps the stress and worry of having this shot just prior to her symptoms&#34;.  Followed up with the employee today and she is having expected side effects from vaccine administration (body aches, fever up to 102-103, and headache), no further seizure like activity.

I have never gotten Covid-19, as far as I know. I contacted my doctor over the phone about my toe numbness and color changes, due to concerns about circulation, and she informed me that my most recent comprehensive bloodwork taken in January of this year showed me in excellent health. No concerns noted for anything such as lupus, hypo or hyperglycermia, or poor circulation. I am concerned about this ongoing.

                                                Facial edema, oropharyngeal edema; Lip swelling; Throat itching; Tachycardia; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 28-year-old female, patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed lips swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 15 Jan 2021, approximately five minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 15 Jan 2021, five minutes after the vaccine was administered, at 11:15am, the patient complained of lip swelling and throat itching. A healthcare provider assessed the patient and vital signs included, pressure 132/103 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats per minute, and 100 percent oxygen saturation. At 11:22am, the patient had facial edema, oropharyngeal edema and attempted to clear her throat. Vital signs reported at that time included, blood pressure 143/106 mmHg, heart rate 121 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 99 percent. Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine 50mg and epinephrine by injection twice. Emergency services were called to transport the patient, however, the patient declined transport.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, lip swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of lips swelling, throat itching, facial edema, and oropharyngeal edema. The events occurred within minutes after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

I have had a steroid shot on 2/18/2021 and was started on a Medrol dose pack, no relief and the rash got worse. I contacted my doctor/dermatologist over the weekend and was prescribed Prenisone 60 mg. I have been taking Prednisone 60 mg daily since Sunday 2/21/2021, with Zyrtec tid, Pepcid tid and Benadryl twice daily. I have been using my bronchodilator (Albuterol) about 3-4 times daily with my daily Brillinta (diskus inhaler) to prevent airway issues. I have had no relief. My rash and hives are not fully suppressed and I they move over my body. They burn, and get hot. Ice helps but doesn&#39;t seem to make them go away.

                                                I am twenty-eight years old, young, healthy active girl. I have always been into fitness and yoga. I live a generally healthy lifestyle. I have been a singer, a dancer, and a flight attendant! I decided sign up for the COVID-19 vaccine in order to help our world fight against this pandemic. I wanted to protect my family and friends to eradicate this virus once and for all. It was with no hesitation did I jump at the opportunity to get this vaccine when it became available to me on February 12th, 2021 at the Convention Center. As soon as I received my shot I proudly posted my photo with tears in my eyes letting the world know that we were one human closer to a COVID-19 free world. I was Moderna proud.   My entire family had already received their Moderna vaccines because I come from a family of nurses, but none of them had experienced any side effects. I was confident I would be in the clear after their clear symptom free vaccine. Immediately following my vaccine my arm was a little sore, as expected. However, I did experience fatigue and mild leg cramps in my calves. One very odd symptom was that I could taste the vaccine in my mouth, like a metallic, strange taste, which I reported to my family, but everyone just laughed it off. The leg cramps went away after a day or two as well as the taste, but the fatigue continued throughout the week. I felt these symptoms were pretty average. I signed up for the V-Safe reporting system and put in my report and thought nothing of my initial vaccine symptoms.   Things took a very strange turn on the morning of February 20th, 2021 at about 10am. I woke up and my face was numb, tingling all over, twitching in different parts of my face pretty severely and uncontrollably. By 4pm the tingling moved into both of my arms and hands and by 5pm it moved into both of my legs. Shortly after the cramping and twitching began in both of my legs and I lost the ability to walk, lift my legs, and just the ability to feel my legs at all. I could not walk.  Obviously concerning, I thought I was originally having a reaction to a medication I had been taking for over a year called, Topamax, a nerve pain medication which can cause numbness and tingling as a side effect. I called my prescribing physician and he immediately ruled out the possibility of a reaction to this medication due to the length of time I had been on this medication, that I had not missed a dose, I had not increased or decreased the dose, and I had not experienced a reaction like this in the time that I had been taking the medication. He recommended I keep an eye on my symptoms and go to an emergency room if things worsen.   Overnight, my symptoms remained the same. I woke up on Sunday, February 21st, 2021 and I still could not walk, I could not feel my legs. My legs were still twitching and cramping. My face was still numb and tingling, but the twitching had stopped in the face. My hands had stopped tingling. At this point my mother who is a nurse suggested that I call Moderna, the vaccine provider, to report a possible side effect of the vaccine. Upon contacting Moderna, the company thought that it could possibly be a reaction between the Topamax medication and the vaccine, but they had no current information about these two having any interactions. They thanked me for reporting and told me to go to an emergency room if my symptoms continued or worsen.   Throughout the day on Sunday, February 21st, my symptoms remained. I was able to get to my feet, but I walking like a newborn baby giraffe or as my mother described, like a 105 year old woman. I was unable to feel my legs completely, lift them, move them without lifting them with physical help of my arms moving them. At this point on Sunday night I decided to contact my Primary Care Physician. She noted that this sounded similar to Guillain-Barre and that I sound immediately go to an Emergency Department before the symptoms get any worse. It was late on a Sunday night and I was unable to drive myself, so I waited.   Overnight on Sunday into Monday I began experiencing light flashes in my eyes, heart races, lower back pain, and worsening cramping in my legs. I knew that I needed to seek treatment in an emergency room.   On Monday, February 22nd, 2021 I was taken to the Emergency Room Department. They conducted blood work and a physical examination, but did not want to proceed with any MRI?s or CAT scans. The ER the doctors were baffled. They could not figure out what was causing my paralysis other than the vaccine was the only new thing that had been introduced to my body, but they could not verify or diagnose anything. They let me go with a referral to neurology.   While we were sitting in the ER my cousin, a nurse anesthetist at another local hospital, called my mother who was with me with some very alarming news. Her co-worker, had experienced the same symptoms back in December and was just going through recovery after his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He was told by the CDC there had been 19 reported cases through the CDC where after the first dose of the vaccine people have reported numbness, tingling, and the lose of the ability to walk after receiving the first dose of the mRNA vaccine, both Moderna and Pfizer. Her co-worker was also in the same age range as myself, very healthy, young, active. He was officially diagnosed with Transverse Myletis. He has taken a full two months to regain the ability to walk and still has numb patches on his legs. He walks very slowly, but is walking. He returned to work, but cannot return to his normal life working out and being active because he does not have the strength. He was told not to get the second dose of the vaccine.   There are unreported cases in this area by physicians who do not know where to turn with this information. It is hard to link these symptoms and cases because they are so obscure, but these same symptoms are occurring with those who have also had COVID-19. When I was being seen for an EMG test of my legs the physician performing the test said to us, ?I have a patient who received the vaccine and has the symptoms, maybe I should report it!?. My Grandmother?s physician just last week just sent a patient of hers with the same symptoms to neurology. I think this uncommon side effect is more common than is being reported and no one knows where to turn with the information.   I finally got into the head of Neurology. I was told, ?it?ll probably get better?, basically saying that they don?t know what they can do and they are at a loss for knowing what this is and why this is happening to people after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine. Doctors don?t have answers and the vaccine companies aren?t offering information to help link these side effects together. The physician told me not to proceed with the second dose of the vaccine due to neurological side effect that I have had. I should benefit from the first dose and it is not safe for me to get the second dose from this side effect.   I was unable to walk for weeks since this began on Feb. 20th. It is just now that this week I am slowly able to move my legs, but they are still very numb and heavy. I haven?t been able to drive or live my normal life. I cannot use stairs, walk long distances, stand for very long periods of time. I am twenty-eight years old and I walk like an eighty year old woman, wobbly.   I have reported my case to CDC, V-SAFE, Moderna. The CDC said they would be in contact with me due to my report of extreme adverse side effects via the V-SAFE report, but I have not heard anything from them as of today.  These are the uncommon side effects that need to be heard and reported. I don?t know why they are being ignored because I have been left without answers and without hope.

As well as my arm at the site of injection. My temp was 99.8. I took  one tylenol around 8:30 am. As the day went on it got worse. I took one tylenol at 10:30 am. I was nauseous, my heart was racing, I felt like I was going to pass out, my arms and legs began to tingle. My temperature peaked at 102.5 around 5pm. All of my joints ached severely. It felt like my pelvis had been crushed. Even laying my knees on top of each other while laying on my side was too much pressure on my knee joints. The only other time I&#39;ve felt like this is when I had Influenza A. At 8:30 pm I took one tylenol and one benadryl and was finally able to sleep. A few hours after taking the medication the joint pain had greatly decreased.  In the morning I no longer had a fever.

                                                The patient did report swelling, induration and pain at the injection site. The patient  reports onset of headache, fever of 100.6, chills, body aches, night sweats, and malaise within a couple of hours of receiving dose 2 of her Covid 19 vaccine.  Due to how she felt, she went to bed soon after, and slept until the next morning. Upon waking up she noticed resolution of all her symptoms except for night sweats, and malaise.  She continued feeling hot and having night sweats but did not appreciate having a fever.  She also reports  the onset of significant facial swelling, periorbital swelling and swelling of her hands and feet, basically her entire body.  She also reports an onset of &#34;foul smelling&#34; diarrhea.  Her chronic eczematous areas which are her eyebrows, posterior neck, and scalp became more itchy and flaking and peeling.  She developed new areas of eczema and itching over her torso located at her mid axillary areas from her braline down to her waist area.  She also reports the onset of browniish red/ amber colored urine since receiving the vaccine. She continued to flake and peel over her eyebrows and cheeks in  continuously and in large amounts for the next 10 days.  She reports taking no antihistamines, or antipyretics.  She went to urgent care and was treated with 0.5% clobetasol cream which after 2 applications to her face caused a chemical, sun burn like reaction and more severe swelling over her cheeks and periorbital areas.  A photo shows that her left eye was so swollen it was half closed and the skin color was purplish. She returned to urgent care on March 11, 2021 and was prescribed a medrol dose pak.  She started it right away and her facial swelling improved.   On March 13 she came to see me.  with improvement in her swelling, peeling and flaking.   She was noted to have a fever of 101.6, then it was 100.6 after recheck and finally 99.6 before the end of her appointment.   It isn&#39;t clear whether her temp decreased because her medrol taken earlier that morning had kicked in or by removing her sweatshirt and being out of the sun allowed her to sweat and decrease her core body temperture to that level.She was asked to continue checking her temp which she reported as 99.8 on March 13, 100.6 on March 14, and 100.5 on March 15.  She has been instructed to check her temp everyday for the next 14 days.  Her urinedipstick showed 1&#43; bilirubin and ketones with trace blood and all other indicators were negative.  Patient was sent for stat bloodwork to evaluate for possible hemolysis.

                                                Patient had appointment at 9:20 am. She was fine during the check in process, while receiving the imz and the 15 mins post vaccination wait time. Approx 10 am she left the IMZ room and about halfway through the store, she fainted. CSM said the fell outside of patient&#39;s room and did not seem to hit her head or neck. 911 wasn&#39;t called because she came to right away. They got her water and a chair. I was brought over approx 10:10 am. I talked with her and she seemed cognitive, lucid and understands who she is, where she is and what happened. She said she waited the 15 min and felt totally fine but then she got up and fell about halfway through store. Approx 10:20 am we brought her over to pharmacy area for more privacy and RPH checked her BP. reported 130/90. I asked patient if she wanted the paramedics called just in case of a head injury. I asked her before palpating her head and neck. She said she felt no pain, no visible bleeding or lacerations, no inflammation or redness and she has full mobility in her neck with no pain. Patient said she did not want paramedics called and instead called her mother in law who lives nearby to see if they can come get her. She is worried about  40 min drive home. Pt overall physically seemed fine. She was just shaken, nervous and embarrassed as she&#39;s never had something like this happen before. She waited for about 20 mins until her father in law came and picked her up. I updated him of the situation and they left together.

She had localized increased warmth over the left upper outer arm where the vaccine was given at the deltoid.  There was a raised area of skin in a serpiginous pattern circumferentially 3.5 across and 4.5cm in length.  It was blanching and not firm. She had 1 soft lymph node palpable at the left axilla, tender and 1.5cm in size.  She has had no other symptoms other than pain at the injection site for 2 immediately days after the injection was given.  I advised that she fill out the information for v-safe and asked that she report any further program to both v-safe and our office.

As she parked her car she saw another vaccine recipient walking to the ambulance for treatment and started feeling very anxious with a faster heart rate.  RN spoke to patient on site and she had no other complaints.  Patient monitored for a total of 30 minutes without further complaint.  Patient advised to call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room for any additional issues if needed.  Also advised to sign up for v-safe.  Patient left site stating she was feeling better (also saw other vaccine recipient return to car quickly and she said that helped).

                                                This is my second pregnancy and at the time of my vaccination, I was 32 weeks 6 days gestation with an estimated delivery date of 2/15/21.  I tolerated the vaccine well initially with only a very minor sore arm the day after the vaccine. On 12/31/2020 (4 days after vaccination), I felt muscle fatigue around my hips and buttocks as well as significant fatigue. It seemed to improve over the course of the day and was not very noticeable for the next few days. On 1/4/21 (8 days after vaccination), my muscle fatigue in my hips, buttocks, thighs, and hamstrings bilaterally became very significant, preventing me from doing some activities that I had planned. I also had generalized fatigue. On 1/5/21, I had similar symptoms, but the muscle fatigue also began to include my shoulders bilaterally. 1/6/21, the muscle fatigue also included my neck and I was physically exhausted. 1/7/21 I started to note some improvement, and I also saw my OB who did bloodwork but also did suspect a possibly delayed reaction to my vaccine. Today (1/9/21) I am still experiencing muscle fatigue, but it does seem to be improved from several days ago.

I noticed an eczema style patch on my right hand then shortly after my arms started resending and looking splotchy. I had a sulfa rash reaction to a steroid in 2009 that also showed up after a day or two so I recognized it and started taking Benadryl.  It seems to be helping but not completely clearing the rash. My blood pressure was also high this morning, which is abnormal for me.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

                                                I received the first dose of the COVID 19 (Moderna) on 01/15/2021 in the evening. The next morning I woke up at 05:45am with a sore arm, which I was told was one of the side effect. However I was sore and aching all over my body. As my day continued, I became tired and feeling flushed within the face. I felt my heart rate beating faster than normal. I began having cold chills and the aching within my body progressed through out the day (12 hr shift). When I clocked out at 07:08 pm and got home from work, I was unable to hardly move with out hurting and I felt like I had a fever. My husband checked my temperature and I had a low grade temp of 99.4 with an increase work of breathing and had ,a difficult time catching a breath. My husband took me to the hospital ER and before arriving to the ER I was having a stridor episode and when the nurse checked my temperature it read 102.3. I could not complete a full sentence and began vomiting. I was given epinephrine nebulized, solumedrol, benadryl, zofran, lidocaine nebulized. I had a CT with contrast of my neck and a chest xray. All images came back normal, I had been treated for an allergic reaction from the COVID vaccine and discharged home once the symptoms and stridor subsided.

Dizziness and severe nausea started and blood pressure decreased. Trouble concentrating and tingling in hands and feet. I was taken to the Emergency Room and hooked up to an IV and Heart Monitoring. I was given IV Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, and Zofran. I was going to get an injection of Epinephrine but my heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly after the first batch of IV meds and they were concerned that the Epinephrine may have made things worse. I was monitored for 4 hours and then discharged with instructions to take Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for 5 days, Prednisone 60mg every day for 5 days, Pepcid 40mg twice a day for 5 days and given a prescription for an Epi-Pen. I remained very nauseous and dizzy foe the next 48 hours. My injection site became swollen, red, and tender 48 hours after my injection and then re-flared up 11 days after my injection on 01/17/21.

                                                Nausea, feverishness and chills started on Sunday morning, January 24th at around 2:30 AM. I was very pale and felt clammy, and the muscles in my upper arm, shoulder and neck were hurting more than just the normal ache from the shot. I had a hard time falling back asleep until I took more ibuprofen until the fever was gone. When the ibuprofen started to wear off I started to feel nauseous and fevered again, until I was able to take my next dose. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen every six hours for 24 hours to make the fever down to 99 degrees F. (My average body temperature is about 97.6 degrees F) At the time of this form I am still experiencing muscle pain, but it is more of a sore pain than the stabbing pain is had been on Sunday the 24th.

Following vaccination, the patient immediately developed numbness to her body, chest tightness and abdominal discomfort. She remained alert and oriented but voiced concern that she felt like she was going to pass out. She developed blotchy skin to the chest and neck area within minutes of injection. Her vital signs included blood pressure of 140/98 and a pulse of 123. She was given water to drink which she tolerated well. She continued with symptoms of nausea, blotchy skin, heart racing and weakness.  Dizziness was also reported. She was taken to the Emergency Room.  Treatment for the event included epinephrine, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, diphenhydramine and lorazepam.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events was reported as recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 29 year-old, female patient with medical history of asthma, who experienced events of numbness, chest tightness, abdominal discomfort, felt like she was going to pass out, blotchy skin to chest and neck area, racing heart, weakness, dizziness, nausea, blood pressure of 140/98 and pulse of 123.

My partner was with me and said that after I got up I began shaking and he helped me to the ground where I continued to &#34;shiver&#34;, as he called it, for another few seconds before going limp. Once I came to (a few seconds later) I felt very confused at where I was and had a pounding headache and my ears were ringing loudly. It was all I could focus on. After that my partner helped me to bed where he continued to check on me and I slept for 5 hours.

This writer instructed her to sit down.  This writer then requested assistance from RN.  As RN approached where patient was sitting, patient stated &#34;yeah I&#39;m going to faint&#34; she then fell forward from her chair onto the floor, with the top of her head hitting the floor first.  RN instructed staff to call the Rapid Response Team who was unavailable.  This writer gathered the anaphylaxis/reaction supplies that were on hand.  Patient&#39;s body postured and at that time RN rolled her onto her side.  Patient quickly regained consciousness.  Vitals were taken and stable. Patient was given the opportunity to be seen in the ED multiple times but she declined.   She stated that her lips felt &#34;tingly&#34; and was given 50mg/20mL Diphenhydramine oral solution.  She remained in the COVID vaccination clinic at Medical Center for observation for 40 minutes, at which time her husband retrieved her and escorted her home.

Symptoms include severe myalgia, arthralgia, and constant chills but no fever. Moderate headache and tachycardia (100-130, most likely due to pain level). I had to leave work after about 2 hours d/t symptom severity. Symptoms were only slightly improved with 1gram of Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not history of adverse vaccine reactions. Symptoms resolved about 24 hours after onset.

This was also present after the first dose of the vaccine, but much milder. I also experienced, chills, headache, and body aches. I took Tylenol for these symptoms and took 2 zyrtec for the shortness of breath. All symptoms lasted only about 24 hours. They seem much better on 2 days after the vaccine.

                                                32 weeks pregnant and second dose of Covid vaccine received on 1/21 at 11:00. Flu like symptoms (fever, chills, headache) began 0100 on 1/22 and lasted until about 1300 on 1/23. I had to call out sick from work on 1/22. Worked a 7L shift on 1/24 and at about 2000 noticed a petechial rash on bilateral lower extremities that spread up to lower abdomen. Called on-call L&amp;D Doctor and she advised for me to be assessed at L&amp;D triage. I was then admitted for 4 hours due to my rash and further workup concerning for DIC, thrombocytopenia and/or other possibilities. My petechial rash was very concerning for coagulation disorders and prompted many lab draws to be obtained. My labs showed elevated AST &amp; ALT that were previously normal, low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), protein in urine, elevated alk phos. I was discharged around 0100 for further workup the following day.  On 1/25 I went to clinic to have more labs done per Doctor. 1/26 at about 0830 I was called by my OB Docotor to immediately go back to Labor &amp; Delivery triage to be admitted for what she thought was preeclampsia based on my labs from 1/25 and 1/24. I was again admitted for about 4 hours for monitoring of baby, and myself for preeclampsia. My labs were still elevated and out of range mirroring preeclampsia, but my blood pressure was stable, so I was discharged around 1300. I followed up with labs at clinic on 1/28 and again on 2/2 as well as with home blood pressure monitoring.  My labs on 2/2 showed everything back to normal, causing the doctors involved in my care to believe this was an adverse event due to the moderna covid vaccine.  As a result I missed one day of work, was admitted to the hospital twice, and had 4 days of lab draws which will result in an excess of medical bills.

I was not having stomach issue nor did I have a fever. I had eaten and drank enough fluids before and after the vaccine. I could feel that I was going to faint and started to sit down, luckily I did not fit my head only had a bruise on my forearm and hip. I woke up quickly and family members were nearby to help me slowly sit up. I did not faint anymore after this. I was very fatigued for the next 2 days. I contacted my health care provider, but did not need to be seen or treated. Medical History with fainting: I have fainted before, once in my teens when I had a very high fever and once after my first pap smear (vagal response).

At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

                                                Around 10 minutes after the dose, I started feeling my throat close up, I could not concentrate and felt very dizzy. 20 minutes later I felt a sharp stabbing pain in right side of my throat and my chest/lung area. I started feeling itchy in that area as well. I started getting bumps all over. I took 2 puffs of my Symbicort, Benadryl, and Loratadine. I continued taking the Symbicort and Benadryl. I fell asleep siting up. By 12/24 I could not swallow and it would hurt my chest to breath so I decided to go to the ER.

We offered her a bottle water and then walked with her (with an arm on each side) to another room, where we had her sit down against a wall and put her head between her knees.  She also stated she felt very hot, so we got her a cool compress for the back of her neck.  We had her wait for another 15 mins (total of 30mins) before she started feeling better, her coloring looked better (she was very pale at first) and she felt better enough to drive home.

I proceeded to the Emergency Room where I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy.

                                                On the day following my second dose, I woke up with a headache around 6am (expected this may happen and took Tylenol). A little before noon my partner and I got in the car to run an errand. In the car I started to feel worse and I fainted. I was out for about 30 seconds according to my partner. I came to and had my vitals checked at an urgent care center (all vitals WNL). During this episode in the car I think I also had chills. The onslaught of symptoms in the car lasted only about an hour before resolving. I continued to have a off and on headache for the rest of the day but other symptoms resolved. By Sunday I was pretty much back to normal; any headache symptoms were pretty much resolved. I am not sure if the fainting episode was related to vaccine or not. I have had fainting episodes in the past (2-3x at dentist office and 1x at optometrist when having eye pressure checked).

                                                Sharp upper back pain that radiated into chest. Pleuritic in nature, seemed to be concentrated at base of lungs bilaterally.  Slightly worse when taking deep breath. Not really associated with shortness of breath. No other associated symptoms. Made worse by lying down. Slightly alleviated by raising shoulder blades up and sitting with head in hands. Lasted approximately 1.5 hours with periods of worsening and getting slightly better. Was considering going to emergency room given severity of pain, but eventually resolved on its own with no further symptoms since that time. Have never experienced symptoms like that before. Pregnant at time of occurrence, 15 weeks 4 days along.

                                                Had two syncope events 10 minutes after receiving first dose. On day 8 (3/22/2021) I started to get a red itchy circle around the injection site which I am assuming is &#34;COVID arm.&#34; Still have a red circle today (3/23/2021).

I called my doctors office who advised me to go straight to the hospital where I was admitted right away and given benadryl, apinephrine, famotidine, methylprednisolne, and racepinephrine around noon. I was release around four only to have swelling in my face tongue and arms, around 11pm when I went back to the hospital for more of the same treatments and was again released around 6 am on Wednesday the 24th. I have been suffering with headaches, dizziness tiredness and pain in the bottoms of my feet for the last four days.

I went into the ER after 4th day of pain.   ER did a CT scan and found a couple blood clots in my right lung (pulmonary embolisms) along with tissue  on lung. An ultrasound of my heart and legs were done to find the source of these blood clots and neither tests found blood clots or indicators that this is where they originated.   I am currently in blood thinners in order to reduce the clots.

The pain extended through all of it - from my elbow through both my little finger and ring finger, and I could barely move my arm without it making it hurt more. The intense pain slowly went away within the next 3 hours.  - About an hour later I was really exhausted.  -Around 4pm, I was extremely tired, had a really fast heartbeat, and I was having difficulty breathing (similar to when I have asthma). The fast heart rate and the breathing difficulties went away around 6/6:30pm. The fatigue went away the next day.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Lactose intolerance (Mild), ADHD (Stable) and Depression (Stable, medication Wellbutrin discontinued due to pregnancy.). Concomitant products included METHYLPHENIDATE from 01-Feb-2018 to an unknown date for ADHD, MINERALS NOS, VITAMINS NOS (PRENATAL VITAMINS [MINERALS NOS;VITAMINS NOS]) from 01-Jan-2019 to an unknown date for Nutritional support.   On 31-Dec-2020, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 27-Jan-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was on 14-Apr-2020 and the estimated date of delivery was 18-Feb-2021. On 31-Dec-2020, the patient experienced EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Exposure during pregnancy). On 27-Jan-2021, the patient experienced BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASED (Elevated blood pressure) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 28-Jan-2021, the patient experienced HEADACHE (Headache), CHILLS (Chills) and FATIGUE (Fatigue). On 29-Jan-2021 at 5:30 PM, the patient experienced INDUCED LABOUR (Induction via balloon catheter due to elevated blood pressure) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 30-Jan-2021, the patient experienced PREMATURE DELIVERY (Premature delivery) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged). On 30-Jan-2021 at 6:00 AM, the patient experienced UMBILICAL CORD PROLAPSE (Cord prolapse / Hand presentation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged). The patient was hospitalized on 29-Jan-2021 due to INDUCED LABOUR. The patient received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) beginning around the  forty-first week of the pregnancy. The cesarean delivery occurred on 30-Jan-2021, which was reported as Premature. For neonate 1, with an APGAR score of 8 and 9 at (1, 5 minutes). The outcome was reported as Pre-Term Birth NOS. The baby, female, was delivered at 37.2 weeks and therefore it is considered pre-term. Cord prolapse/hand presentation was discovered at cervical check post-induction by balloon catheter, therefore an immediate C-section delivery was performed. No abnormalities/complications for the infant, currently breastfeeding. On 27-Jan-2021, EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Exposure during pregnancy) outcome was unknown. On 29-Jan-2021, HEADACHE (Headache), CHILLS (Chills) and FATIGUE (Fatigue) had resolved. On 30-Jan-2021, UMBILICAL CORD PROLAPSE (Cord prolapse / Hand presentation), INDUCED LABOUR (Induction via balloon catheter due to elevated blood pressure) and PREMATURE DELIVERY (Premature delivery) had resolved. At the time of the report, BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASED (Elevated blood pressure) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 10-Jul-2020, Ultrasound abdomen: normal (normal) normal-8-week ultrasound.. On 10-Aug-2020, Ultrasound abdomen: normal (normal) normal. On 02-Oct-2020, Ultrasound abdomen: normal (normal) normal. On 30-Nov-2020, Glucose tolerance test: normal (normal) Normal. On 27-Jan-2021, Blood pressure measurement: 142/94 (High) abnormal. On 29-Jan-2021, Blood pressure measurement: 142/98 (High) abnormal, sent for induction..     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient reports she had an unwanted/unplanned induction 2 days after her second Moderna vaccine dose. Her blood pressure was found to be elevated on 27-Jan-2021 at her 36 weeks prenatal visit and she was informed she will be admitted for induction if the blood pressure does not return to normal. Between 28-29 of January, 2021 she experienced mild side effects, which she managed with ibuprofen and rest. On 29-Jan-2021 her blood pressure was re-checked and confirmed to be elevated so she was admitted for induction at 5:30pm via balloon catheter. Approximately at 6:00am on 30-Jan-2021, the patient was found to have a cord prolapse/hand presentation and was immediately scheduled for C-section delivery. She delivered at 6:10AM. No family history of congenital abnormalities/genetic diseases. Besides the mild lactose intolerance, no allergies reported.  Treatment medications were not reported.  This is a case of drug exposure during pregnancy with associated AEs (elevated blood pressure, umbilical cord prolapse, induced labor, premature delivery) for this 29-year-old female. Patient delivered a female child at 37 wks. 2 days. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events (headache, chills, fatigue), a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                A week after receiving the COVD19 vaccine, red patches of skin started appearing around the injection site.  Patches were not itchy.  Armpit area (lymph nodes) was painful, as well as general pain in left arm.  The next day the rash had gotten larger and left arm started tingling.  Arm pain persisted.  On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

                                                The onset of symptoms started around 9:15am. I experienced numbness and tingling to bilateral feet and lower legs. I experienced dizziness. I also experienced an increased heart rate (160s-170s BPM). I was hyperventilating and had difficulty with breathing. I was pale and cold.  I had uncontrollable shakes. My BP was a bit higher than my normal but not hypertensive.  I was given candy and juice after onset of symptoms. ( I did have an English muffin prior to receiving the vaccine). My symptoms subsided for some time but then came back about 15 minutes later. These symptoms continued to occur about every 15 minutes for a period of close to 2 hours. I was given Benadryl 50mg PO after the first hour of symptoms. I continued to experience the symptoms for up to about 45 minutes after being given Benadryl. My symptoms began to subside and eventually stopped after the 2 hour mark.

                                                CO came to me at 1105 C/O fast heart beat and feeling a little SOB, thinking she was possibly having an anxiety attack. She was scared to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Then she said she did feel SOB and throat feels tight. I grabbed the EPI pen and injected 0.3mg into lateral right thigh. Brought patient to our emergency room, administered Benadryl 25mg (2 caps) po. Started IV NaCl 1000 mL in RAC. Administered famotidine 20mg/2ml IPV over 2 minutes. Currently on slow IV drip, 2nd bag. Patient is doing well. She was initially shaky after the EPI pen but throat did not feel tight less than 10 minutes after injection. Currently is relaxed as I monitor her. Vitals have been stable.

                                                I received my vaccination at my place of work. Local pharmacy came in to administer them.  In less then a minute of recieving the vaccination I experienced a tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  I told my symptoms to the  pharmacist that was there.  I had to take my mask off due to the difficulty breathing.  I sat down and was trying to catch my breath.  Roughly 10 -15 minutes passes then my throat began to swell.  My extremities were feeling tingly and I was very dizzy.  I sat with my neck extended to maintain my airway until they could locate some benedryl.  My voice was wheezy when attempting to answer questions the pharmacist was asking.  The pharmacist wanted to administer the EpiPen but I would not allow her to because then they would have to call 911.  It took about 45 minutes in total to locate benedryl.  I took 50 mg.  Roughly 15 -20 minutes after taking the benedryl I was able to breath with ease.  I waited about another 15 minutes at the facility to ensure I was ok.  I was told I would not be recieving the second dose due to my anaphylactic reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I spoke with the nurses regarding previous vaccine reactions, and we all agreed that I would take Benadryl first, and then get the vaccine. However, about 5-10 minutes after I got the vaccine, I began feeling very itchy, which is usually a precursor to when I develop hives. The nurses kept a close eye on me and got my vitals. They said my pulse was a little high, but that I was ok to go, since I had stayed my 30 minutes afterward and my vitals were ok. Throughout the day, I became even more itchy, and that night, I had hives everywhere, a low grade fever, and a migraine like headache. Because I did not have an itchy throat, and I have developed these symptoms before with the flu vaccine (and other allergies), I did not go to the doctor. The side effects took about a day to a day and a half to go away.

                                                20 minutes after receiving the vaccine 1/11/21 I had a skin reaction on the left side of my face also felt a little dizzy. I took Benadryl for my skin and was fine after about a hour. Exactly a week later the injection site was red/hot and itchy. The next day which is 1/19/21 same thing the injection site was hot red and itchy. I also felt chest tightness, headache, nausea and dizziness. I spoke with my doctor over the phone and she prescribed me Albuterol which helped with the chest tightness. I also took Benadryl for my arm which helped. The very next night 1/20/21 the same thing happened to my arm again. It got red and itchy and I felt nauseous.

Here, she is slightly tachycardic, but her oxygen level is good, her lungs are clear.  She has no urticaria, she has no stridor or wheezing.  She does not wish to receive epinephrine because she has had such bad effects from it in the past, and is agreeable to Solu-Medrol and Benadryl.  She took Pepcid prior to having her injection.  Her friend who is with her recommends that she has a history of severe events like this in the past, and she usually does better after breathing treatment.

Around 10 minutes after receiving the second dose, the patient experienced some syncope which subsided about 10 minutes later and did not leave the vaccination site until she was feeling better. The other side effect that the patient experienced was redness/swelling/irritation at the injection site for about 24 hours after the injection.

I fell back asleep until 3:30 AM. I woke up with a racing heartbeat, chills and shortness of breath. My oxygen saturation which is usually normal was in the high 80?s. I took another dose of Motrin 800 mg and was able to break my fever and this reduced my heart rate. My oxygen saturation was still low. I fell back sleep around 4:10 AM and was able to sleep until 7:00 AM. I took another dose of Motrin around 8:00. I had a persistent headache and general malaise the day following vaccination. 2 days after vaccination I still felt very tired and weak and had a persistent headache. Day 3 was symptom free.

                                                About 10pm I developed chill but was already taking tylenol and motrin because I had a headache.  About 1am I developed a fever of 101.5 which had went to 102.1 and for 24 hrs I could not get it down below 101.   On Tues I woke up at 2am soaked in sweat but the fever had broke for about 12 hrs. I developed another fever of 100.5 but it went away with no medication.  I felt better the next day but the fever returned later along with SOB and because the fever returned it prompted me to go to the urgent care where a chest xray was done.  The xray showed my lungs were inflamed.  On 1/19 I developed the same SOB, chest tighness and another fever of 101.  I reached out to my doctor and had an office visit where another xray was done but normal and was started on the Flovent enhaler to help with the SOB and breathing.

As a result, I had mild nausea. If went away after 20 minutes. As the expected chills, headache, and fever continued, I started to develop tachycardia at rest (107-172bpm) with heart palpitations around 9:30am. The palpitations went away approximately 2 hours later. I still continue to have tachycardia with minor shortness of breath sensation.  My heart rate is currently 115bpm at rest. My typical resting heart rate is 65-70bpm.

                                                Patient received the 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/28/20.  The next day, on 12/29/20, she developed a fever &gt;100, fatigue, chills, sore throat, new anosmia/dysgeusia, chest tightness, headache, GI symptoms, and nasal congestion.  When the symptoms did not resolve, she contacted her doctor on 1/2/21.  They referred her to get a COVID test and that test from 1/2/21 returned positive.  Follow-up on 1/4 showed symptoms stable.  No hospitalization required.  Treated with albuterol inhaler and pseudoephedrine.  Not believed to be related to vaccine, however reporting since my understanding is that VAERs is interested in reports of positive COVID cases following vaccination.

I was instructed to wait in my car for 15 minutes to monitor myself. At about 3:02PM while waiting in my vehicle, I became dizzy and lightheaded and blacked out for approximately 30 seconds. I walked myself back into the clinic and notified the registration desk and a physician assistant came to assist me. They took my blood pressure and O2 levels, which were all were in normal ranges.

Broke out in a cold sweat. Started to loose consciousness. Arms (middle-upper) to my hands began to tingle and went numb. I lost muscle control in both of my hands and my fingers were very stiff, I could not move them. My feet and lower legs were also tingly. I felt nauseous and in need of the toilet. I was able to crawl to the bathroom at which point I had diarrhea. I regained feeling and motor control of my hands shortly after but continued to experience extreme light headed ness for the next hour.

For the rest of night I felt quite terrible and the next day I felt similarly but with a temp of 100, and less vital sign related symptoms. Around 5 PM on 2/7 I started feeling better and my body started responding to Tylenol. The swelling persisted. I marked the erythema  and measured it as 6 inches of swelling at 9PM, 7 1/2 inches by midnight, and this morning it?s 8 inches at 8am.

I finally took Tylenol at 2pm and it worked wonders. I was still sick but was able to relax and sleep. Felt like mild flu after Tylenol. Next day (2 days after vaccine) felt much much better. Still have slight weakness like after being sick and some light headedness but feel like I should be back to 100% tmw.

I experienced headache and fatigue yesterday afternoon and developed back aches at 2030At 2330, I developed fever (100.5) with chills, nausea, diarrhea and faint feeling. I started blacking out while walking to get water and had to kneel down to the floor to prevent myself from passing out. I had tingling in my hands and feet for an hour after. I took ibuprofen at 0145, and fell asleep around 0230. As of now, I feel back to normal, other than sore arm and lingering fatigue. My fever is gone and temp back down to 98.3. I had COVID back in early December, so I expected this type of immune response with the first vaccine dose.

This fall was witnessed by another patient, who flagged the medical staff for help. A medical assistant notified me of the incident and I went to examine the patient, who was sitting on the floor, alert and conscious. I asked the staff to get the patient an ice pack, which was placed to patient&#39;s forehead and back of neck, and glass of water. Patient is able to swallow.

I was having severe chills - never experienced these kinds of chills before. I took Tylenol. I tried to still go to work but I by was having difficulty breathing and on January 11, I called my primary care Dr. and waited for appt but on January 13, there was no appt available and she told me to go ER. ER  part of medical group/hospital. They told me I might have COVID.  Dr said severe reaction to vaccine. I was still having trouble breathing. I have albuterol inhaler that I use as needed. I had it in my bag and I used that (and I had been using it when I was having trouble breathing but it wasn&#39;t helping like it could have ). They sent me home but I was still having trouble breathing. I had difficulty breathing for about about three days and then it resolved. I followed up with my PCP - video visit after two days after ER and then I had an office visit with her. After two weeks, I felt recovered. Although my right arm still have pain - pinching sharp pain in my arm that comes.

A week later in the afternoon of 18th, i began to have episodes of high heart rate and heart palpitations that would occur randomly without relation to movement. This happened for 24 hours and then disappeared the night of the 19th. I did have to take off work on the 19th because of it. I checked in with my OB ( I am 29 weeks pregnant) and they were not able to think of anything that would be causing the random periods of high heart rate that only lasted 24 hours as I had not been experiencing this previously.

Over the course of an hour the swelling in my right side of my face became so pronounced that my gums were hard affecting the shape of my lips. I got out of bed and brushed my teeth, flossed, mouthwashed and salt water rinsed wondering if I&#39;d maybe gotten something stuck in my teeth and went back to bed. By 1 am I was awoken by feeling like my teeth were going to fall out of my head it kept me up most of the night. I could feel my heart beating in my teeth. By morning, I had a small tear in my gums and the fluid had drained from the gums but there was an excess of tissue kind of hanging off my gums. I had typical mild fever and fatigue on Saturday, I took one dose of motrin. By Sunday the swelling was gone and my mouth felt better but I do continue to have some numbness on my upper right lip.

                                                While getting the vaccine, there was a malfunction of the syringe and it seemed to fall apart in the nurses hand. She stated that approx 80 percent of the vaccine was injected and asked if I wanted another dose. I agreed without thinking. Afterwards, i experienced nasuea, body aches, chills and a nosebleed. After discussing it with my coworkers, it was pointed that the vaccine may be unsafe in the quanity I was given. I was hoping to get information on whether I should be worried about a getting nearly twice the recommended dosage.

I went and spoke with my clinic manager and relayed my symptoms. She directed me to go back to the observation area and speak with someone. I walked quickly back to the hospital and reported to a nurse about the symptoms. She took my vitals and informed me that my temp was normal, but BP and pulse were high. After waiting approximately &lt; 2 mins, BP  was taken again. Was informed I had to be taken to the ER to be evaluated. BP and pulse were taken again and no changes, numbess continue to remain.

Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

                                                I was 30 &#43; 2 weeks at the time of my second Moderna vaccine. My due date is 4/22/2021. Pregnancy has been uneventful until the second Moderna vaccine. At 3:00 am (14 hours post vaccine), I woke up with the urge to go to the bathroom. I went, urinated, and had a small amount of diarrhea. I laid back down and within 30 second had urge to go again. I repeated this six times back to back. I began to have severe lower abdominal cramping and could not sleep again. I didn&#39;t know if I had to urinate or defecate but the urge was extremely severe and constant. My temperature began to rise, and I was shaking/aching severely. I took 500 mg tylenol at 5:45 am and that kept my temperature around 99.5 (normal 97.5).  Around 7:30 am I called my OB and they told me to go to emergency/labor and delivery ward of the hospital. At this time, my diarrhea and urge to defecate to stop and it turned to a constant urge to urinate with near constant, severe, lower abdominal cramping. At the labor and delivery ward, they monitored the baby (stable and moving the whole time), did a fetal fibronectin (normal), did a CBC (normal except preexisting mild anemia), and a urinalysis (normal). Hospital determined I was not in labor and did not have UTI so they sent me home. I continued to have temperature raises (up to 100.4 but always took tylenol at this point), severe lethargy, no appetite, severe abdominal cramping, constant urge to urinate, severe shaking, etc. until approximately 8 or 9 pm that evening (32 hours post vaccine). Everything except the constant urge to urinate resolved. Three days post vaccine (evening of 2/15/2021), I began to urinate large blood clots. I scheduled an appointment with my OB for a repeat urinalysis and urine culture. I had the appointment on 2/16/2021 and the only abnormality was hematuria. Urine culture was negative. Doctor prescribed 7 days of antibiotics just in case (while waiting for urine culture). My symptoms finally resolved on 2/19/2021 (7 days after vaccination), with slow improvement after urinating the large blood clots. I have not had any symptoms since then and my baby appears healthy still in utero. I have no history of UTIs.

My husband heard and ran to the bathroom. He held me and I fainted again in his arms. He called 911, while the medics were on the way I threw up very dry and hard throw up. I started to feel a little better after that. Medics said everything looked ok and did not take me to the hospital. The following morning we went to the hospital, got a cat scan and everything luckily came up fine. Currently, I have a terrible ear ringing and muffledness from the concussion.

State had one small seizure episode yesterday. States her doctor is aware and is running more tests and changing her medications around. States her doctor is aware about her COVID vaccination and made no mention that she should not get the vaccine. She states she is comfortable getting it. She states she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine and did ok. The only symptoms she had was fever for about a week. Again she states her doctor is aware and has not told her not to get the second dose of the COVID vaccine.  Consent and history were reviewed and COVID vaccination was given at about 14:27 with LVN. She was told because of her medical history, she will need to be monitored for 30minutes instead of the 15 minutes; she agreed.  After vaccination was given, patient sat with another co-worker talking and appeared in no distress. Co-worker left shortly after while she was still there for monitoring.  At about 2:30ish pm notice that patient was starting to slide down her chair appearing to have a seizure. Immediately rushed over to her, guided her down to the carpet, supported her head, she was lying to her side. She was not conscious, eyes closed, teeth clenched, no foaming of the mouth were noted. &#43;strong radial pulse. Can hear her loudly breathing through her nose. Pulse oxygen on room air, 92% and heart rate was 67. She was not turning blue. Arms and legs were mild jerking. Called out to have staff called 911 simultaneously while supporting and monitoring patient. About 5 minutes into this, patient started to slowing open her eyes, still altered, teeth still clenching and extremities stopped jerking. Slowly, she started to relax, asked her name and where she is at and why she was there, which she was able to answer slowly. Asked her if she wanted us to call her daughter, she said he because she is a minor. Asked her who she is with and she said her husband is outside.  Paramedic arrived and took over care and she was told she will be transported to the ER.  Her husband, came into the room. After patient&#39;s husband spoke to paramedic, I also introduced myself to him. Per her husband, patient has a history of seizure that has not been controlled. Per husband, he states she had 5 episodes on Sunday, 3/21/2021. Her doctor is aware and is doing more testing and changing her medications around. Per patient&#39;s husband, he states she was doing an MRA yesterday to further evaluate the seizure and they were not able to complete it because she had 2 episodes. When asked if her doctor mention anything about getting the COVID vaccine, per patient&#39;s husband he states they did not say anything. Per husband, she did ok with the 1st dose of the COVID vaccine and only had fevers. Per patient&#39;s husband, there was no change in her underlying medical condition with the seizure with getting the vaccine.

I kept saying i needed to go home, so he called an uber to my apartment. Nose was running, blurry vision, unable to walk alone when uber came to pick me and partner up. Kept seeing black and white stars when trying to cross the road to uber. Once I got home, I had watery stool in my underwear and had to stay on toilet for 30 minutes for watery stool to pass. Then kept alternating between feeling cold and hot while under blankets. Slept for 5 hours. Then felt fine. On Sunday, slept for about 15 hours - 18 hours. Throat kept hurting. Today, Monday, feel better but throat feels like there is a lump in it.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the first dose of moderna vaccine on my right arm, my arm felt numb and tingly.  My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

This got better. On day 7 after getting the vaccine I developed a firm, raised, HOT and extremely itchy area at the site of injection. This is measuring at 5cm by 5 cm on my Left deltoid.  This continues to get larger and larger.  I have also had daily headaches since the vaccine was given. I seen a doctor who recommended calling the CDC who then advised me to complete a VAERS report.

I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

                                                Just over 24 hours after I received the COVID-19 vaccine I had a syncope episode while standing talking to others at work. I began feeling hot, started feeling like I was sweating, started seeing black and white lines, and then fainted. The symptoms came on very quickly. I did not remember falling and we believe I hit my head on the corner of a table when I fell, and I had to get 3 staples in my head. I have no other medical concerns at this time, and all of the test run at the ER showed no concerns. At the ER they ran labs, took a CT scan, and did an EKG. I was released from the ER after about 4 hours. I have had a 3 other episode previously when I felt like I was going to pass out, most recent March 2020, but they were linked to the flu and strep. This event has not been linked to either of those conditions at this time, and my doctor encouraged me to report it.

                                                Painful arm until Sunday, then throat felt tight, thought it was acid reflux so I took some tums. The heart palpitations started shortly after. Worse when lying down and almost felt short of breath. The heart palpitations continued until Monday night and Tuesday I woke up and palpitations resolved. I have only ever had this reaction one other time when had the Mirena. Symptoms resolved after having it removed but wasn?t sure what ingredients caused it. Now I believe there may be a common ingredient.

This happened during the observation period and then I was sent to the ED.  About a week later, on the left arm, looked like I had hives, it was swollen and warm to the touch, pain went down into my wrist. I went to Urgent Care.

Then rapid heart rate and chest tightness by 2.5hrs post vaccine. I went to urgent Care and they thought it was an allergic reaction (BP 182/90, HR 82) and gave me 125mg solumedrol and Benadryl intramuscularly which caused worsened dizziness and a racing heart which caused me to collapse and they gave me a epi pen and called 911. I was transferred to ER and they completed EKG which was normal and monitored vitals for a few hours and I was released. I continue to remain extremely dizzy and nauseated 2days after the vaccine.

My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

                                                The vaccine itself was well tolerated with just some injection site pain and minor body aches the next day. Then, last night I took miralax and had an allergic reaction to it. I have taken miralax in the past and I have tolerated it well. This is my first time taking miralax since the Covid vaccine and I suspect it is related since there is polyethylene glycol in the vaccine. About 10 minutes after taking the miralax (in water) I had chest and throat tightness, rash on my chest and face, severe facial flushing, and itching. After that began to resolve I had chills, rigors, and aches in every joint. I had not eaten or consumed anything else and had no exposure to any other potential allergens.

                                                12 hours after injection (1/8/2021) I began running a low grade fever (99.8), experiencing a debilitating headache, had injection site tenderness as well as swelling the size of a baseball. I iced the injection site and put compression on, in case it was a hematoma from the injection. From 1/8/2021 -1/10/2021 I continued to run a low grade fever, never reaching above 100 degrees. I had full body aches and was exhausted as if a bus ran me over. The injection site swelling slowly reduced with continued ice and compression. From 1/10/2021 - 1/13/2021 I did not have a fever, however I continued to experience intermittent headaches that were as painful as several days prior. I felt chronically exhausted as well. On 1/14/2021 I began to run a low grade fever again (99.8). At this point the injection side swelling was a 6.5cm x 5cm ring of what I believe to be induration. Headache and exhaustion persisted. Friday 1/15/2021 I did not have a fever, but I began to notice that simple tasks such as walking to the kitchen were increasingly difficult. When checked, my oxygen saturation was 98 percent, but my heart rate was 115 while sitting. Saturday 1/16/2021 I began running a fever again, this time reaching 100 degrees. I developed a full body rash, red spots never raised. Again, I continued to have extreme exhaustion and headaches and tachycardia. I took some benadryl to help with the rash. Sunday 1/17/2021 the rash and fever returned, headaches and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia continued. Monday 1/18/2021 I began having a sore throat, fever and rash developed again. Headache and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia as well. Tuesday 1/19/2021 my fever elevated to 100.5, headache, exhaustion, sore throat, tachycardia. However, by Tuesday there was no longer red visible spots. My entire body still itched and felt as if there was a burning sensation, however I could not find any visible red spots to correlate with the itching and burning. Today Wednesday 01/20/2021 I have never felt worse. My entire body feels like it has been repeatedly ran over by a semi truck. My throat hurts. My head hurts. My body burns as if it&#39;s on fire. I am so incredibly tired I feel like it&#39;s an extreme sport just to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom. My fever today 01/20/2021 reached a new 101.4, I&#39;m still tachycardic. Oxygen saturation is within normal limits. However, the induration around the injection site seems to have almost completely resolve.

Muscular pain continued through 01/22, worsening in the evening. Additionally very mild pain/tenderness by left wrist and thumb, some numbness in fingers, possible slight dizziness earlier in the day, 2 min in length.  Pain continued 01/23, some soreness developing in lower arm, and rash developed near injection site, noticed around 12 pm but may have been present earlier. Rash: red small raised bumps close to injection site, span 3 in x 2 in. No itch at first, but has become mildly itchy.  Area tender to touch and warm. Have only taken 500mg acetaminophen, and used a heat pad on the muscle last night.

                                                Was fine immediately post vaccine. Drove home and proceeded with a normal rest of the day at home. Went to sleep around 10 pm. Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

Her blood pressure was taken multiple times ranging from 145/80 to 155/95.  After approximately 40 minutes after the vaccine, the patient stood up and fainted. We kept the patient on the floor as she was light headeed and not very responsive. At that time, 911 was called.  She was taken tp the ER and discardged the same evening.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/29 at 5 pm and was feeling fine afterwards with only a slightly sore arm at the injection site.   Then yesterday, 1/30 around 6 pm, I started to have a very fast heart rate, despite not exerting myself and only sitting down at the time. Between 6-6:45 pm, I had a heart rate between 125-140 bpm, according to my fit bit device that tracks my heart rate on my wrist. Anyways, after that I was going to the bathroom and started to feel nauseous, light headed, felt hot and chills like a fever, abdominal pain and vision issues (blackening in some spots and blurry on and off) so I went to lay down. I didn&#39;t vomit and the chills/hot fever feeling went away in 15 minutes. I also took my temperature and it was normal. My abdominal pain continued but the light headedness and nausea and vision issues subsided. I was unable to get up and do other stuff, so I just slept it off. I&#39;m feeling better this morning. I  had also drank about a half glass of wine (maybe 2 oz), so i&#39;m not sure if that contributed to it, but i&#39;ve never felt that way after drinking wine, especially that small of an amount. I had also drank this wine around 4 pm and that was 2.5 hours before I started feeling this way and did not drink anything on the day I received the injection.

Profuse sweating most likely due to fever and extreme arm soreness for the first 24 hours. Headache remains through day 2 post injection. Fever and chills subsided around the 24 hour mark. Day 2 arm soreness, redness, and swelling at injection site. Pain in chest, shoulder blade, and shoulder of the injected side feels like muscle soreness similar to that experienced after a hard workout Day 2: discover presence of lump near neck just above collar bone I am inclined to believe it is an inflamed lymph node, but I am no doctor).

I slowly laid down with feet above heart until it subsided and slowly went back to bed. My galaxy watch says pulse dropped to 40. Normally 60&#39;s. Later in the morning at 7am chills started and migraine with light aura (kind of like the pixels on an old tv). Took asa, tylenol, and drank water to help. Feeling hazy all day.

                                                Very early menstruation, occurring a couple of hours after the vaccine. It started as spotting that night, (I never spot) then a gradually heavier flow, working up to an unusually heavy &amp; painful period over the course of the next 2 days. Also some very light clotting, which rarely happens for me. I was not due for my period for 2.5 weeks. My cycle is extremely regular and has never deviated from 28-31 days in the last 6&#43; years. I have a copper IUD (for 6 years), and have never been pregnant.

                                                Patient developed near immediate flushing, itching, and discomfort in her face and neck. Her heart rate sped up (&gt;120) and her blood pressure was elevated (&gt;140). Her oxygen saturation level was normal. She was observed at the vaccination waiting area for 30 minutes, but ultimately moved to the urgent care for additional monitoring and management. After 15 minutes there she was given a dose of epinephrine. She reported relief from her clinical symptoms including abatement of the  flushing, itching, and anxiety. She will take Benadryl at home and consider her Epipen if needed. She will follow-up with me on the increased blood pressure and heart rate

                                                Developed hives on opposite arm shortly after shot (but idiopathic hives are normal for me and it was the wrong arm so I thought nothing of it). Full body aches, especially in legs, from about 6:30pm on 3/13 to midnight of 3/14. Location of shot was warm to the touch, sore, and slightly swollen. Temp was 98.6 F.  After midnight the aches became centered on my legs and became more severe coming in waves every few seconds. Tachycardia. Muscle weakness. Nausea. Teeth began to hurt (from clenching?). Severe dizziness and vertigo starting from 7pm on 3/13 and peaking around midnight. Migraine with visual disturbances beginning at 7pm on 3/13 peaking at about 9pm and lasting at least several hours. Vertigo and migraine seemed related. Former worsened every time the pressure in my head did. Looked like the room lit up briefly every few seconds. My sense of touch felt off - textures felt different than normal and couldn?t feel my back when I touched it. Leg pain began to lessen around 4am, and fully resolved around 7am. Dizziness began to improve around 6am but persisted, albeit to a milder degree, for most of 3/14. Brain fog and sinus pressure from around 7pm 3/13 persisting through the following day. Some nausea throughout 3/14 but less severe than on 3/13. Poor temperature regulation from about 6pm 3/13 to 3pm 3/14. Symptoms became tolerable around 3:30pm on 3/14 and had mostly resolved by evening. Muscle weakness resolved by evening of 3/15. Pressure headache resolved by late morning 3/16.

EMS was called and arrived within 3 minutes of being called, before a second set of vitals could be taken.

We called 911 and I talked with her after she came to and until paramedics arrived. She was sweating and just felt out of it right away. Pulse and blood pressure were low when paramedics took her vitals. Within 10 minutes of assessment vitals were back normal and they told her she could go home. I called and followed up today and she stated she woke up this morning feeling &#34;normal&#34; and she thinks the episode was related to her hormones and not the vaccine.

                                                Patient reported in chart notes a history of fainting after vaccinations. Pharmacist asked patient about this before administering vaccine, and patient said she often faints in regards to blood draws or vaccines. Patient was prepared to sit in waiting area for at least 15 minutes. Patient was given vaccine and pharmacist confirmed patient was feeling okay. Patient returned to waiting area to sit, then allegedly decided to stand up and go to the in-window when beginning to feel faint. She fainted in this process. RPh and store manager immediately rushed to patient, who returned to consciousness right away. Patient stated to RPh that she did not hit her head nor did she have any pain in her legs or trouble breathing. She felt  mostly embarrassed. Store manager called paramedics, who arrived, examined patient, and the patient let them leave and proceeded to shop in the store aisles until her husband arrived.

                                                About 3-4 hours after receiving my second dose of vaccine on 1/30/21, I began to experience side effects including headache, myalgias, and fatigue (which I had also experienced with the first dose of vaccine). I had no nausea or vomiting until around 8-9 pm on 1/31/21. At that time I began to have severe nausea and had 1-2 episodes of emesis before falling asleep. I woke up around 3 am and had another episode of emesis. This continued every 15-30 minutes. I was unable to keep any fluids down as a result. After a couple of hours of this I became lightheaded and began to experience abdominal pain after repeated retching. Sometime between 6 am and 7 am I called 911 and was connected to nursing line. I was advised to go to the emergency department. After vomiting another 2 times I called 911 again and asked for an ambulance to be sent. I vomited again in the ambulance before arrival. Once in the ED I was examined, found to be tachycardic, and started on 1L of IV fluids. I was informed lab tests were being drawn, including pregnancy test, urinalysis, CBC, CMP, and toxicology screen. I was given one dose of Zofran IV. Nausea began to subside, and I was able drink fluids without nausea or vomiting. I was informed that lab tests were unremarkable. Another 1L of IV fluids had been started, but I was disconnected after maintaining PO intake and eventually discharged around 12 pm.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

                                                Beginning Saturday morning, I began to experience hives, coming and going throughout the day. There were 2 significant episodes on Saturday, one Sunday morning, two throughout the day on Monday. Beginning Tuesday morning, I experienced hives that continued throughout the day. Starting around 1:00 pm, they moved from a more localized area on my upper trunk to covering my entire body, head to toe. I became hypotensive (lowest was 90/60), tachycardic (pulse rate ranging from 100-125), low grade temperature (100.4), noticed a tingling feeling in my lips, a new onset sore throat, and ringing in my ears. My pulse ox remained stable, no oxygen required. I took a claritin chewable approximately 10 minutes after onset of worsening symptoms, then 50 mg of benadryl 3 hours later.  I have continued to take 25 mg of benadryl BID since Tuesday and have remained without any new onset of hives. No medical admissions were required, although I do work in a medical clinic and close observation was available for me.  Only symptom remaining is fatigue, unsure if this is related to benadryl usage or remaining vaccine reaction.

                                                Severe arm pain at injection site night of.  At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

My pulse and blood pressure went up. I got dizzy and lightheaded. Maybe 5-7 minutes after the onset, it started to get better on its own. No medicine was given. The paramedic did an ekg which was normal. My blood pressure and pulse also went back to normal.  My oxygen level was normal. Later that evening and the following day, the only noticeable difference was extreme fatigue and a headache. I was dizzy and lightheaded for a few hours after.

                                                Patient had her first Moderna COVID vaccination at 4:00 PM today and 5 min later felt dizziness, worsening, associated with headache, nausea, sore throat, hot flashes, and dizziness is from side to side when she looks at her phone, no dizziness when she does not look at it. Patient primary complaint is headache on bilateral temples. All other symptoms resolved, and no dizziness if not looking at phone.  Patient has history of headaches, similar in quality, but this is more intense (6/10 intensity, less than her scoliosis pains, but more than usual headache pain), but otherwise the same, pounding sensation, and she can feel throbbing. Headache is about the same currently. Started simultaneously as dizziness, immediately, unchanged. No changes in vision. Peak intensity of headache around 30 min after onset, peak at 4:30 or so.  Patient notified the vaccine clinic staff and was instructed to be observed in another area, and did not improve. Patient remembered that her initial blood pressure was low and it fluctuated. Patient was then sent to the ED.  Upon initial assessment in the Emergency Department 2 hours after her initial injection, the assessment is likely vasovagal near syncope with tension headache, rather than true allergic reaction. Given metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, normal saline, and obtained labs.

                                                About a minute or 2 after receiving the vaccine my heart rate increased. I advised the nurse and they hooked me up to a monitor for my heart rate and O2 levels. My O2 was fine, however my heart increased to about 192 bpm at resting. After a couple minutes it slowed down to a resting rate of 130 This continued for 20 minutes until I took my beta blocker atenolol. After that it would only increase to 150 bpm during an episode and resting rate was 100-115bpm. I had a headache and was a little light headed.

                                                Initially after vaccine within an hour I felt fatigue(drained within 1 hour of receiving vaccine). Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine I was having fever, chills, body aches, nausea, and vomiting, and diarrhea and dizziness and weakness and heart palpitations(probably related to dehydration). Symptoms remained for 3 days. Unable to hold down anything. Felt like I had covid all over again just without the respiratory issues and loss of taste and smell. Arm was very sore almost like a deep bone bruise. Brain fog developed again like after initially recovering from covid as did the fatigue. Still having lingering fatigue and now carpal tunnel like symptoms in both hands, slight weakness and numbness at times in right upper arm where vaccine was given. Reported event to Pharmacist to administered the vaccine and the CDC.

Felt cold with pale hands. Seen by ambulance crew at clinic site and given IV fluid, steroids and benadryl. Had dry mouth and itchiness in throat. Taken to hospital and developed red blotches on hands and arms.  I was given epinephrine around 5:30 when nausea,  dry mouth, and itchy throat did not subside. Discharged at 9:30.

Patient is a nurse.  She received her 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19 the day prior to arriving in the emergency department.  This morning she did feel some mild body aches but otherwise was feeling fine.  Starting later today after her shift at work she developed severe body aches bilateral upper shoulders and down her spine, she also reports some shortness of breath, dizziness.  She felt unsafe to drive home feeling like this.  She had taken some Advil earlier in the day around 10:00.  She denies any fever, nausea or vomiting.  No history of severe vaccine reaction or anaphylaxis.  She has had anaphylactic reaction to Enbrel prior.  She denies any throat swelling, muffled voice, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain.    patient is mildly tachycardic and hypertensive.  Likely due to pain.  Patient is experiencing adverse reaction to the 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  I discussed with her she is having an immune response to the vaccine.  She does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis which could contribute to the elevated immune response as well.  The patient is given 30 mg of IM Toradol for body aches here in the emergency department.  She is instructed to call PCP for close follow-up, rest, drink plenty of fluids.  She has no signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis at this point.

They came in waves or rushes for the next hour. Doctor said i look like im getting oxygen and confirmed i had a racing heart. I took lorazepam to calm myself down and doctors concluded it was a panic attack although i know this was something i had never experienced before.

                                                1/26 evening I developed body aches, lower back pain, nausea, brain fog, fatigue.  On Friday I started my period a week early and it was unusually heavy (this hasn?t happened much since I was a teenager) on Saturday I was bleeding so heavily and had lightheadedness, near syncope, headache, nausea, weakness, fatigue and brain fog. Usually menstrual cycle is not as heavy and doesn?t come early and I don?t experience these types of symptoms (usually just bad cramps and back pain with less heavy bleeding).

By 11pm I had a horrible headache and my body was aching. At midnight I still was feeling horrible and my chest was hurting and I was having difficulty breathing. Checked my heart rate with a pulse ox and it was in the 150?s. I realized had not taken my clonidine pill yet for the evening so I  took it and waited about an hour to hour an a half and my heart rate was still not coming down below 125. I ended up going to the emergency room and getting there by 3am. They immediately started running tests. My heart rate was in the 138 and my blood pressure was 148/100

These symptoms persisted, so I continued Benadryl every 4 hours for 2 days.  On Saturday 01/30/2021, when symptoms continued.  She advised switching from Benadryl to  a once daily dose of Claritin and Pepcid AC. Switched to Claritin and Pepcid, symptoms persisted but started to diminish in severity. Planned appointment with Primary Care Physician is scheduled for 02/19/2021.

States she experienced the same symptoms after receiving first injection.  After first injection she went to PCP lab work done and per employee hgb 7.6  As a result we directed her to local ER. ER did EKG only and per employee was normal. Next day at employee clinic labs and chest xray were obtained.

No illness reported, 11 days later I had a small red spot at injection site that was hard and hot to touch but went away on its own in about 1 week. 2nd shot: I had the vaccine on Friday, Feb. 5, 2021 at 5:05p.m. and had immediate reactions. That night I had a racing heart (which I had with the first vaccine)The next morning, Saturday the 6th, I woke up very sick. Symptoms included total body aches, pounding head, loss of appetite, racing heart, general flu like symptoms. I noticed a large red knot/rash on my arm at injection site. By Sunday the 7th, the symptoms had subsided mostly but the knot/rash was larger. Sunday night the knot/rash was even larger, hard and hot to the touch, the redness has darkened. I went to urgent care and they said it was not an infection since I had no pain (just uncomfortable and slightly itchy) they thought it was an allergic reaction and gave me steroids. Monday the 8th (today) the red rash/knot is less dark and hard but larger/wider in size. I had dizziness, lethargy, racing heart and loss of appetite.  I have not worked since Friday the 5th.

                                                The same day as the shot I had an extreme headache and arm was sore. Approx a week and a half later I noticed broken blood vessels over my body, went to my PCP had a blood draw and was informed I had a platelet count of 1. I was sent to the ER then to hematology. I received an very large  infusion and was put on 40 mg of Dexamethasone for 4 days. The next step is to get more blood work and see if I need another infusion. After the infusion I was really sick and passing out .

                                                Patient stated that her adverse symptoms started 6 days after she got the first vaccine, on 29 January 2021. It began as swelling, and redness at the injection site. She stated she had hives that were itchy and raised on her left arm around the site, and on 30 January 2021 the hives spread down her arm. She also noted that the lymph node in her left axilla was swollen.  On 6-7 Feb 2021 patient stated that the rash has mostly resolved, but that she started having neck pain, on the sides of her neck, near her collar bone. This pain leads to a headache, which she has been taking Ibuprofen for. The Ibuprofen only helps with the headache pain, not the neck muscle pain. She also stated that since the 6 and 7 of Feb in the evening her chest begins to feel &#34;heavy, like something is sitting on it&#34;. Patient stated that she went to see her primary care provider at the end of January and was sent to an allergist, who did not believe it was an allergic reaction. She was not prescribed any medication.

Patient was given cold water to drink and I put a fan on her to help cool her off. Once her mouth became tingly, we agreed to call EMS to come check her out. Once EMS arrived, patient was feeling better. EMS checked her vitals and released her. We called her Aunt to come pick her up.

                                                Arm soreness and fatigue the first evening post-vaccine. Around approximately 2300, I had chills, hot flashes, and a low fever (101) along with tachycardia, which lasted several hours. My heart rate was up to 150bpm at its highest while at rest. I took 800mg ibuprofen which seemed to help.  The next day I was very fatigued and nauseated. I started to have some gum soreness as well. The next day (2/21) I felt much better, but my lips felt very chapped along with some gum pain. As the days went on, the inside of my lips against my gums and teeth felt very raw and painful, and my lips became extremely chapped, while the corners of my mouth were cracked and painful as well.  On or around 2/24, I began to have some very sore spots on my soft palate, inner lips, and inside of my cheeks. They mostly became small white sores, except for my lips, which became very red with tiny blood spots just under the skin.  As of today (2/27), I still have sore gums, small sores on the inside of my mouth, several under my tongue, and the red sore spots on the inside of my lips.  It isn&#39;t life-threatening, but it is very uncomfortable, and makes eating and drinking painful. I don&#39;t feel the need to go to an ED or urgent care at this time, but will try to make an appointment with a GP as soon as I can.

About 2 hours after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced severe tachycardia (210 beats per minute). It came on suddenly, lasted for about 5 minutes, and then disappeared. Had no other symptoms (no lightheadedness, no shortness of breath, no nausea). Told my OB about it the next day at our routine visit; no other follow-up.

                                                Patient neglected to tell the nurse administering COVID vaccine that she has fainted in the past. After getting the vaccine she seemed fine and walked over to the observation area. She suddenly stated she felt dizzy to a companion then collapsed onto the floor striking her forehead. She was unconscious briefly and a little dusky around her mouth. She awakened upon stimulation and was evaluated. Her vital signs were reassuring but a growing hematoma on her forehead prompted ac referral to the ED by ambulance. She was seen there and discharged without imaging. She had some fatigue, headache and vertigo for several days.

By that evening (unsure of time), started with my usual asthma flare-up symptoms. These include, soreness of breath, chest tightness and pain, wheezing. I started treatment at home with q4h DuoNeb breathing treatments and a decreasing prednisone prescription.  This treatment did not work so I followed up with my pulmonologist and his PA-C for a follow-up. They made the decision that this flare up was caused &#34;by my immune response to the covid vaccine.&#34;

                                                I felt fine after the shot until about 7 pm when I started experience an intense, pressurized sensation in my head, jaw, chest, and arms. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ringing in my ears, and feeling flushed. Over night I felt some numbness in my hands and arms. The next day the feeling of  pressure and tightness was gone but the dizziness and nausea has remained. I have more energy but  am feeling concerned about the persistent vertigo.  I have a history of allergic reactions. I was also scheduled to begin my menstrual cycle this weekend and it has been delayed.

The following day the patient&#39;s care giver noted a purple-ish rash of the feet and ankles. By the following day the rash was progressing and more prominant.  On 03/19/21 Patient presented to the emergency department with progressive rash on legs and new rash on hands.  Patient had no other symptoms, rash was otherwise asymptomatic except for feelings of cold extremities. Rash was identified by myself as Livedo Reticularis which is a moderate sized vessel vasculitis. This can be immune complex mediated. Sent to Dermatology for same day punch biopsy. Results currently pending.

                                                Between 45minutes to 1 hour following injection of the vaccine, I experienced a tightness in the jaw and an extremely fast heartbeat lasting roughly 10-15minutes. As I had left the vaccination facility and was on my way home I was prepared to inject an epipen sensing an anaphylaxis  reaction, however my heartbeat went back to normal at around the 15 minute mark. During these 10-15minutes, I felt that there were a couple of times where I might lose consciousness, but did not.   Prior to leaving the vaccination center, I placed an ice pack on the injection site for roughly 45 minutes, only removing for my drive home. There was no redness or apparent swelling at the injection site.

                                                I am writing to you in regards my Moderna adverse reaction. I got your information from a small Facebook group that?s going through the same issues as me. On 1/31/21, I received my first shot of Moderna. I was told to stay 30min because I have a Sulfa allergy. I also received a flu shot 3 weeks prior. After 15 min I started to feel tingling in my face and throat tightness. As time passed, I started to feel like I couldn?t breathe at one point. As I continued to have issues breathing and started getting nauseous and lightheaded, they informed a nurse to look over me. The nurse had a student nurse do my vitals manually. She gives out standard numbers 60 heart rate and 120/80 blood pressure. My normal blood pressure is elevated in 130-140/80-90. I had to be picked up due to feeling unwell. I went home took Tylenol and slept.  The next few weeks I kept feeling zaps of sharp pain in my chest area. On the 12th day after the vaccine, I had a panic attack. The panic attack started with a sharp pain in my neck and when I inhaled it hurt. I got heart palpitations and again felt like I couldn?t breathe. I never suffered from a panic attack, so we called 911. The EMTs came my blood pressure was 200s/100s and elevated heart rate (sorry don?t remember exact numbers). It was suggested I go to the ER since my numbers were high. In the ER I told the doctor about my vaccine incident. They got blood work done and she decided to do a CT scan and X-ray since something was elevated ( I don?t remember what was elevated. I am working on getting that info). My EKG, CT scan and X-ray all came out fine. I was then diagnosed with panic disorder. I was sent home and after a few hours I started to feel an internal tremor.  I describe the tremor as having a cell phone on vibrate its usually is in my lower abdomen to pelvic area. My blood pressure kept spiking up into 180-190/80-100. I kept reaching out for help by going to ER once more, 3 urgent care visits and my primary. No one could help me, and I kept getting labeled as having panic/anxiety disordered. My primary doctor said I could be having adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I just have to wait it out. The internal tremor I feel constantly and sometimes it?s in my chest. I have muscle twitching, tingling in my lower limbs, muscle pain, and blood pressure spikes. I do feel like my symptoms cause anxiety because ill have these spells where I feel adrenaline running through me which will cause anxiousness. My blood pressure is getting better, but I still have spikes and have had another panic attack.  I have been on Lexapro 5mg and gabapentin 300mg 3x a day for 5 weeks. During that time, my symptoms have not improved. I will be getting off the medication soon. I never had any of these issues prior. I don?t drink, smoke or do any drugs besides the medication prescribed.   On 3/30/21, I reached out to my psychiatrist again and went into more detail about everything and she said she believes me about the vaccine side effects.  She recommended I go back to my primary care doctor and ask to be referred to UCSD covid long haulers study to see if they can help me. I wanted to share my information to see if it might be help to your research.  Thank you for your time

I had no anxiety surrounding the receiving of the vaccine nor anxiety about potential side effects. I was standing still and upright at the time of the attack and it lasted appx 30-40 min, subsiding to feelings of heightened anxiety through the remainder of the night. While anxiety and panic attacks have occurred in the past, it is not on a regular basis, nor has either occurred in over 6 months.

Woke up Jan 4th at 2:13am feeling the place of injection swollen, itchy and with a single hive like a bug bite, felt another on torso on the right side. Felt rapid pulse, got up to check the mirror, eyes swollen and itchy, tongue beginning to swell. Within minutes, started feeling itchy all over my body, specially mucosae, and scalp. Took 360mg of fexofenadine and 20mg famotidine, reaction started to subside. Was up monitoring until 3:45am. Still feeling itchy but significantly less at the before medication. Plan to continue with 180mg fexofenadine a day until all itchiness goes away.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

                                                Expected symptoms in first 24 hours - fatigue, muscle aches, extreme arm pain. These symptoms resolved after a day, but I have had a poorly delineated area of erythema, warmth, edema and pruritus at the injection site that began on day two post-vaccine and has been increasing in size until today (day 5 post-vaccination). Started as a small (2 cmx2cm) wheal, now  appears as painful/itching and warm blanching urticaria that takes up the entire width of my upper arm and half the length of the upper arm.

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

                                                I woke up lightheaded. I had dizzy spells throughout the entire day, starting at 6AM. I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

                                                In day one I felt a little off and weak after the injection. This was a few minutes later and lasted about 2 hours. I took a Tylenol PM to sleep, but didn?t sleep well at all. On the second day, in the morning when I woke up the arm where the injection was administered was extremely sore and I couldn?t lift it. It felt almost numb, but I was in pain. I took Advil late morning and felt better but still couldn?t lift my arm above my chest. Around 4-5pm that evening, I was feeling tightness in my chest. Felt like something heavy was sitting on top of me and I developed a headache at this point. I felt super tired so I took an Advil PM to comfortably take a nap. When I woke up I still had a headache and chest tightness. At this point my body started to feel sore. The next day, 1/31/21, I am still feeling fatigued. Headache did not go away or subside. My body still feels sore especially my back, top area (I would say around shoulder blades). I still have chest tightness and had a fever of 101 today. I have taken an Advil for headache and body soreness - after an hour of taking Advil, still feeling the same.

Heart rate would increase to 120-130 with simple activities like cooking dinner or taking a shower. This was sometimes prolonged with standing and associated with shortness of breath.  The night sweats continued for the next 6 weeks until time of submission. The lymphadenopathy was also noted L axilla and R supraclavicular and has also persisted. 2nd covid moderna vaccine received 1/30/21 with only mild headache.

This continued from 8:00-3:00 when things then got a lot worse.  The nausea increased, body chills started, tingling of body, body aches and vomiting.  This continued until around 11:00 pm when I finally started feeling well enough to get some rest.  I slept through the night and felt much better in the morning.  I still feel very tired, weak, and slightly sick but much better than the first day.

                                                At 1:17 PM, I received the vaccine. Around 1:30 PM I started itching and breaking out in hives. I did not say anything because I thought it was my eczema reacting to my nerves. I went home and felt fine for a while. Around 5:30 PM I told my husband my stomach hurt and I had a slight headache, and I was going to lie down. Around 8:30 PM I woke up. Around 11 PM I was feeling kind of light-headed but did not say anything to my husband because I just thought it was my thoughts. I went to bed. Around 3:45 AM I woke up feeling sick, went to bathroom in master bedroom and dry heaved. I returned to the bed from our bathroom, and told my husband I thought I was going to pass out. I have no recollection of the following events, this is information my husband (Brian) shared with me. He said I then stayed standing on the floor, laid my head over on my pillow, and started breathing heavily, and it became progressively heavier to where he stated I sounded like a &#34;wart hog.&#34; He said he jokingly said to me, &#34;Are you mutating,&#34; then I collapsed onto our bedroom floor. He said he got up immediately, was saying my name as he was walking to me, and I was not responding. He then got on the floor by me, and was rubbing me and trying to wake me, and it took about a minute before I came to. When I came to I was laying on our floor, keep in mind I feel approximately 5 feet as our bed sits 4 to 4.5 feet in the air, and I am 5&#39;8&#34;. I hit my hit on our floor, and when I came to I could barely hear him calling my name as there was a loud rushing noise like water in my head. It took about 2-3 minutes before the ringing was completely gone. I then had cold chills off and on for the next 24 hours with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. On Tuesday following the initial encounter, I went to the ER due to nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe headache on right side of head. The ER doctor diagnosed me after a CT with a closed head injury that occurred at initial encounter, so Thursday around 4 AM.

Fatigue, headache, and arm pain subsided, but shock-like pains continued over several weeks and have traveled to other parts of the body. These pains have been felt in the back, abdomen, chest, legs, feet, ankles, toes, fingers, and wrist. They occur on and off throughout the day and in the last two weeks, tingling has also been noticed in legs and feet. Muscle spasms have also occurred in feet and legs in the last week. I have seen a cardiologist and a neurologist. I completed an echocardiogram, heart monitor, and MRI. Those results have returned normal, but neurologist believes this is neuropathy that was triggered by the vaccine.

                                                I was vaccinated on the 14th of January. Initially I just had a sore arm and fatigue on the 15th. The night of the 17th I was working out and had a vasovagal type episode (never had this before). By the morning of the 18th I was fatigued and had a cough that can be described as a bronchial spasm type cough, I assumed that it had to do with the work out and the episode the night before. I woke up on the 19th very sick. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea. Because I am a healthcare provider I was able to go strait to the hospital and get an expedited COVID Test. By that afternoon I had my test back with positive results. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed. I had extreme headache, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath if I moved around at all, cough, loss of taste and smell, nausea, abdominal px, diarrhea, lac of apatite, extrema &#34;brain fog&#34;. These symptoms continued for about a week. Most of the symptoms subsided after that time except for the fatigue off and on and a continuous cough that as of 2/11/2021 has still not gone away.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine on December 31, 2020. That day (Thursday) and Friday, I had expected side effects such as fatigue, headache, and extreme pain on the injection-site arm. I also experienced sharp, shooting pains though in my back, chest, and abdomen. The expected side effects subsided, but the sharp pains continued and still do. I saw my cardiologist because I have a congenital heart defect. They completed an ECG, Echocardiogram, and heart monitor study. All came back normal. After a week of the first vaccine, the shooting pains were mainly in my back and I experienced back pain. Shortly after that, I started experiencing shock-like and burning pains in my feet, ankles, legs, toes, right hand fingers, and right hand wrist. These pains continue to happen on and off and I also continue to have pains in my back and abdomen on and off. I saw a neurologist who ordered an MRI. The MRI came back normal, but the pains persist. Within the last two weeks, I have also experienced tingling in my legs and feet and muscle spasms in my feet and calves. I saw my neurologist again today and she believes I am experiencing neuropathy which was likely induced by the vaccine. She recommended holding off on getting the second dose until we know more about how this might progress. She also reported that she has seen some others in her clinic now with the same symptoms following the COVID-19 vaccine. She is unsure if this will resolve or not and we are planning to monitor the condition.

However, about 7 hours after the shot I developed a fever (101), body aches, weakness, reduced O2 saturation (95-95), tightness in my chest,  fatigue, nausea, and headache. These symptoms were severe and persistent from 8pm 2/19 through overnight on 2/21. I treated it with Extra Strength Tylenol 1,000mg every 6 hours like clockwork, hydration and rest. I slept about 18-20 hours each day (Saturday and Sunday).   I awoke on 2/22 with only fatigue, sporadic tightness in my chest and O2 at 95 remaining. As of today 2/22 at 2:40pm the tightness in my chest has gone and my fatigue is gone. I do not know my O2 saturation right now as I left my reader at home.

                                                The patient is a 34yo female seen about 1 month ago for SOB - it developed 1 week after the COVID vaccine. She was sent to Cardiology and they diagnosed her with pericarditis and she was started on scheduled NSAIDS. - Cardiology recommended ESR, CRP and CBC and they were negative. - CXR was normal - Echocardiogram was suggestive of pericarditis. Cardiology told her to follow up in 1 month is symptoms did not improve and they have not. Also she stated she has developed mild, intermittent peripheral edema that resolves without intervention but this is new.  I am also ordering the cardiac MRI which the cardiologist recommended if symptoms did not improve with NSAIDs.

                                                I experienced an immediate metallic taste in my mouth. My pulse shot up to the 120s-130s and stayed elevated for about 12-24 hours. My body felt like it was in fight or flight for about 6-7 days. I had foul smelling diarrhea, weakness, fatigue and fevers. I have been experiencing random blood pressure spikes since being vaccinated and also cardiac issues. I saw two different allergists to get opinions on whether or not I should receive my 2nd dose. I also saw a cardiologist and had an echocardiogram done. My echo showed mild pulmonary hypertension which I have never had before.

                                                The day of the injection I began with a headache and sore arm but for the most part was fine. Then around 7:00 pm that day I started to get the body aches and so I went to go lay down for bed. I started to shake uncontrollably, have horrible body aches and chills, I went from hot to cold to hot again all through the night, i had a fever all night long, bad stomach cramps, super nausea all night long, and bad headache. This last all the way into the following night having me miss a whole day of work because I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. Since this second shot I have had severe heart palpitations, prolong period, blurred vision and severe body aches.

Went into the ER and was admitted to the hospital for monitoring. Doctors changed medication to an antiarrythmic beta blocker, Sotalol (80mg 2x/day). Still being monitored in the hospital to make sure that I tolerate the drug.   I had not had a cardiac event since by initial one in March 2019.

                                                My heart started racing within a couple of minutes. I felt nauseous and my throat felt like it was closing. My mouth got dry. I had my son with me and didn?t want to scare him so I kept taking deep breaths and focusing on whether the side effect were getting worse. They didn?t. After another 5 minutes I could fee the pressure in my throat lessening and my heart rate slowed. It was terrifying but I?m thankful it didn?t progress. I didn?t seek assistance from the personnel on site. I was aware of what was going on but I?ve had anxiety attacks in the past and thought that was what it may have been until I read that an allergic reaction feels the same. If the second dose is stronger I don?t think it would be wise to attempt receiving that one.

                                                33 year old female with no preexisting health conditions received her first Moderna vaccine on Saturday, March 13 at 9am in the left deltoid. Patient immediately felt weird after receiving the vaccine - tingling and accelerated heart but no intervention occurred. Patient started with the basic side effects headache, sore arm, shakes/chills and fatigue/weakness and brain fog.  Starting around 24-36 hours after injection patient started to notice mild muscle spasms and tingling sensations. That has progressed to full paresthesia of the arms/hands and legs/feet. Patient also states paresthesia occurs in the face, neck, lips, torso and even occasionally in ears - but these seem less severe and wax and wane. The patient noticed vision changes and muscle fatigue described as muscles feeling like &#34;jello.&#34; Due to weakness, patient also complains of continued brain fog. The patient is also occasionally getting twitching and pulsating muscles.   The patient describes the neuropathy &#34;like my limbs are defrosting.&#34; It was described as cold tingling but at times intense. Patient noticed that cold temperatures make it more pronounced and movement helps to temporarily make it seem a bit better.

                                                My arm started hurting a bit in the evening, but had no issues going to bed.  I woke up in the middle of the night around 1am, shivering, with chills and my teeth clattering.  I was so cold, I had to put on socks and was using two blankets.  I went to the bathroom and was very dizzy that I almost fell twice.  I also noticed my lips were blue/purple and my temperature was 99.9.  I struggled to go back to sleep because I was still very cold, but also very tired and felt my body drained of energy and had the most intense headache ever.  I felt my head throbbing and like it was about to explode.  I was still cold, dizzy and with a headache the next day.  Two days later, I still had a headache but lighter.  Took Tylenol since Friday night, but I did not feel a difference.  I missed two days of work because of my symptoms.

                                                I developed severe hives all over my body hours about 19 hours after the shot.   Intense itching woke me up at 4:40am the day after receiving the vaccine.  The reaction worsened for the next 3 days and began to settle/decrease at the end of the 3rd day.   I also felt somewhat disoriented through  the allergic reaction period, and on the day after the vaccine I felt slight pain on my chest.  I did not experience shortness of breath or have trouble breathing at any point.

I experienced burning in my chest for about 10 mins, and then it subsided. About 8 mins after that, I experienced moderate to severe cramping in my lower back and thigh muscles; which completely subsided after 10-15 mins. Two days after the initial injection, the injection site began burning/aching again, with movement up to my shoulder joint. It was to a point where I was tearful and unable to sleep. The following morning it had subsided, and just remains slightly sore.

I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

                                                The following day, 12/23/20, I kept feeling like I was having brief waves of anxiety, with nothing to be anxious about. The anxious feeling kept occuring, but it wasn&#39;t until a week later than I realized that each time I felt that anxiety, my heart was actually palpitating.  I had a 12 lead EKG done via local EMT to confirm that it was actually happening, then made an appt with a local cardiologist.  Stress test, cardio sonogram, and 24 hour heart monitor tests were completed on 1/13/21.  My follow up is on 2/3/21.  Fortunately, I have not felt a palpitation since 1/10/21.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I began feeling an increase in heart rate about 5-8 minutes after injection. I reported symptoms and site began to monitor my pulse, which was 160. I then drank 32oz of water and took 400mg ibuprofen. I then began to feel dizziness. Blood pressure was normal. My chair was reclined and I was given about 2oz of orange juice. I was then moved to a stretcher and my legs were elevated on a chair. I took a restroom break. I began by walking, but started to see spots in my vision and sat in a wheelchair. I was able to use the restroom and return to stretcher and elevation of my legs. I was then taken to the ER. I used the restroom once more independently. Blood sample was taken. Heart rate was  160, blood pressure was normal. EKG was abnormal and I was given dosage of adenosine. First dose did not show necessary improvement and I was given a second dose, which dropped my heart rate to the 90s. I used the restroom independently and was given an additional EKG, which was normal. During this time my Physician contacted a Cardiologist, for consultation. I was then discharged with recommendation to follow up with cardiologist in 2-4 days.

                                                patient was administered Moderna COVID vaccine approx 415pm and about 5-7 minutes after she reported being lightheaded. Also reported neck pain, chest/throat tightness, slightly itchy throat, clogged ears, and a cold feeling. I took her BP and it was elevated at 156/94. I monitored patient over the next 30-35 minutes and she asked for water and crackers. She was not having any difficulty breathing, did not complain of throat closing so epi pen was NOT administered. She slowly improved over those 30-35 minutes. She declined me calling 911. She left with her boyfriend approx 45 minutes after onset of symptoms. I called her at approx 7pm the same night and she reported feeling &#34;fine&#34;.

I also started feeling tightness in my chest during inhalation. I took 2 Acetaminophen pills, 500mg each.  It helped with the flu like symptoms yet the injection site was (and still is a week later) warm, raised, very tender and itches.  One week after the vaccination I started feeling malaise and queasy. I took Tylenol again to help symptoms (two 500mg each) and did help. I did that twice, 5 hours apart. A week and one day right now and still don?t feel completely back to normal, no change to my left arm.

                                                I had a vasovagal response- vasodilation. I felt hot, flushed, nauseous, then it developed into feeling dizzy and feeling like I might be sick. I was brought outside and asked to lay flat on the ground and I felt much better. The doctor came out to check on me and said that I looked pale, and that my blood pressure had dropped and asked if this has happened before and if I exercise regularly. After laying down for a little bit, I was guided to sit up slowly as I felt ready. Later that evening within 3 hours or so from the injection, I felt joint pain, and nerve &#34;pinches&#34; throughout my body. This continued through the night and into the next day 2/3/2021. These nerve pinches were mostly on my hands, left wrist, feet, legs, and jumped around a bit throughout my body-shoulder, back etc. I&#39;ve experiences sciatica and other nerve pain before so know what nerve pain &#34;pinches&#34; feel like,

                                                The day of the injection I had a very sore arm, just like my first dose. Then around quarter after midnight, I got up to use the bathroom. I recall extremely vivid dreams, and a little bit of disorientation. On my way back to bed I thought I?d take another ibuprofen to help me sleep because my arm was so sore. I remember feeling very dizzy, I did take my pill, and then I woke up on the floor. I was extremely disoriented and there was a shrill ringing in my left ear. As I came to, I recall really finding relief in the cold tile, and being concerned that I may have hit my head. I did a mental scan of my body and nothing felt painful, though stiff and sore, as I had the flu. I got back in bed and looked at the time, about 20 minutes had elapsed. The rest of the night I tossed turned, and felt quite feverish. I attempted to find radial and carotid pulses, which were extremely weak. That night, I  never did get a temperature, because I was quite disoriented. This morning I?ve been quite stiff and low energy. I feel discomfort in my kidneys, and have taken care to stay hydrated. I have reduced appetite, and some achiness in my body. My temperature right now is 100 even. It?s almost 3 o?clock, so about 28 hours has elapsed. I did not seek further medical care, as I live alone and transportation i would be a hurdle. I also not super concerned, mostly I just want you all to document that I painted, as I have not found that to be listed as a common side effect for the Moderna vaccine. I did call up a friend who is a paramedic, and feel reassured by her two cents.

The patient&#39;s medical history included anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 09 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 026L20A) intramuscularly in her arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 09 Jan 2021 at 13:30, immediately after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient reported having a flushing sensation and felt anxious. At 13:36 the patient&#39;s vital signs included blood pressure 131/87 mmHg, heart rate 99 beats/min, and oxygen saturation 99%. Doctor noted hives around the injection site and on contralateral arm and chest. Patient was moved to a separate room to lie down on a bed; on route to the new room, the patient developed diarrhea. Treatment included diphenhydramine.   At 13:49, the patient reported having shortness of breath and throat tightness. 99%. Intramuscular epinephrine was given and 911 called. The patient&#39;s vital signs included heart rate 133 beats/min and oxygen saturation  At 13:55, the patient&#39;s vital signs included blood pressure 145/76 mmHg, heart rate 137 beats/min, and oxygen saturation 99%  At 14:00, emergency medical services arrived, and patient was transferred to hospital. Patient left the office in stable condition with vital signs within expected range and fully conscious.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The events, flushing feeling, felt anxiety, blood pressure fluctuation, hives around injection site and contralateral arm and chest, diarrhea, shortness of breath, throat tightness and heart rate abnormal, were considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 34-year-old, female patient who experienced serious events of shortness of breath, throat tightness and heart rate increased and non-serious events of flushing feeling, felt anxiety, blood pressure fluctuation, hives around injection site and contralateral arm and chest and diarrhea. The events occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of mRNA 1273 (Lot # 026L20A, expiration date unknown). Treatment administered include diphenhydramine and epinephrine. Outcome is resolved. Based on the information provided, which indicates a strong temporal association of the reported events with the administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded. The event of hives around injection site is consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA 1273 vaccine

Pain increased over the course of the next 1.5 days until I found it was necessary to go to the hospital.  Trouble taking deep breaths and moving around was painful. Wheezing and crackling in lungs would occur if exposed to cold. Increased temp  occurred on day 4 (99.8). Currently am on day 8 and am mostly back to normal with occasionally chest pains/wheezing. I believe pleurisy was the final diagnosis.

                                                Patient came back to pharmacy two days after she received the vaccine and admitted that immediately after receiving the vaccine, her heart was racing and she was having feelings of swollen throat and tongue. However, at the time, she did not say anything and went home after 30 minutes of observation. After the vaccine, her arm was first sore and a couple of days later, the soreness turned into an itching. The itch is local around injection site on left arm. Potential allergic reaction, lasting for days post injection.

                                                I developed nose bleeds after taking COVID shot and saw on the news that I?m the vaccine could cause thrombocytopenia. I had my doctor order a CBC on 2/17 and platelets came back at 89.  I did have a past history of thrombocytopenia throughout my pregnancy from 07/2019-01/2020.  Thrombocytopenia went away after delivering my baby and I haven?t had an issue since. Last CBC was 10/16/20 and at that time platelets were 156. Last abnormal platelet level was on 1/9/20 and level was 132.  As of now Dr. is monitoring me and will have me repeat CBC in 2 weeks.

I stayed in an observation room for about 3 hours. Next day, I couldn&#39;t feel my right arm. I started getting fever, chills. I had all symptoms of the coronavirus. Saturday at 03:00 am - I woke up and I couldn&#39;t feel my arm or my fingers on my right side. I called the Emergency number. I stayed home and took Tylenol. Couldn&#39;t feel my arm at all that Saturday - dead. Sunday - same thing. Monday morning, I woke up, I could feel a little bit of my fingers but I noticed that I had blisters full of blood between your index finger and your thumb. I didn&#39;t go to work that day. The doctor wrote me out of work for the rest of the week. I didn&#39;t have any sensation on my pinkie or ring finger. I had a little bit of sensation on the rest of my fingers. I stayed at home and I didn&#39;t do anything with my arm and it slowly started getting better. That whole week I was having symptoms that were just like coronavirus. They came and went. the following Saturday, I started being able to move my arm around and doing more stuff and slowly it came back but I&#39;m not 100%. I can&#39;t lay on the right hand side too long - it starts feeling like my arm is asleep. I got the second dose February 12th.  I spoke to an allergy doctor and an anesthesiology doctor (video and telephone visits) - they told me I was having common side affects that people were having from the vaccine but they didn&#39;t know why.

Squeezing sensation self-resolved after call. Paramedics arrived about 1 hr post-vaccination. BP 89/66. (Note my normal BP runs 90-110s/50s-70s.) HR 70s-90s. Pulse Ox high 90s. Paramedics not concerned that reaction was allergic, no rescue meds advised. I felt well enough to drive home despite persisting facial tingling and tight breathing.

                                                I received a vaccine at 4 PM on 2/23/21. In the middle of the night I started having the chills. I woke up around 6 AM the following day and felt extremely fatigued. Around 6:30 AM I became nauseous and very lightheaded. I had to brace myself against a counter so I would not fall down and faint. I rested all day then around 1 PM I got up and fainted. I woke up a moment later and had an intense ringing in my ears for several minutes. I felt fatigued the rest of the day.

Was also advised to check her BP again, as she previously was on blood pressure meds but stopped due to her BP being controlled without meds. After 1st dose of vaccine, BP started fluctuating and worsened after the 2nd dose to the point where PCP started her back on amlodipine 5mg. Also had headache and severe pain from left side of head down to ear after 2nd dose.

I had 911 called after I identified no shortness of breath or other breathing issues. HR over the next 10-15 mins went from 115 to150 before medics arrived. Her was taken with a finger pulse ox/HR monitor. She was able to walk from car to ambulance and then put on a gurney. After transport to Hosp., the patient-reported to me today she went through 4-5  &#34;episodes&#34; of waving tachycardia before it altogether subsided. She felt recovered entirely today (3/3). The patient never lost conscious.

                                                Symptoms of weakness, tired, mild fever and headache starting the day after COVID vaccine.  The following day woke up at 6am with chest pain, described as mild to moderate in severity with no radiation.

                                                Pt has history of anaphylactic allergic reaction (not to vaccine or contraindicated material), made aware of risk (was told she would have to stay 30 minutes) and decided to be vaccinated. Approximately 20-25 minutes after her vaccination, she mentioned to the living facility manager that she wasn&#39;t feeling well. I checked her blood pressure (142/111) and pulse (82) at 8:27am. She said that was elevated for her and she felt as though she was having difficulty breathing. I had the living facility staff member call 911. At 8:29, I proceeded to help the patient self inject in her right upper leg with a generic epipen (this was her preference since she has used before) - I added with counting to 10. I then gave her 50mg diphenhydramine IM in her left upper arm (Moderna injection was in right upper arm). Within 1-2 minutes, she said that she could tell the epipen was working and helping her to breathe more easily. At 8:34am, I took her blood pressure (148/111) and pulse (90). By 8:38am, she said she was starting to struggle to breath again. Per the pharmacy emergencey protocol, epipen can be given again in 10-20 minutes. At 10 minutes, since she still said her breathing was getting more difficult and the EMS had not arrived, she was given a second dose of a generic epipen in the left upper leg. EMS arrived 2-3 minutes later and was provided with all above information. Follow up phone call with doctor at the emergency department, said that she was monitored for an hour and then sent home. He advised that she not get the second Moderna shot or if determined necessary by her PCP to get it in a doctor&#39;s office setting.

                                                Passed out for 40 secs; Chills; Cardiac issues; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 34-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced passed out for 40 secs/ loss of consciousness, chills, and cardiac issues/ cardiac disorder.  The patient&#39;s medical history included depression. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) since 2014.  The patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 039K20A) on 12 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 028L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10 Feb 2021, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine the patient, had experienced cardiac issues.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient started experiencing chills and passed out for 40 seconds (secs). The patient had visited the emergency room (ER) and EKG (electrocardiogram) showed slight abnormality. She was given heart monitor for 14 days. She was scheduled for Stress test and Echo. She was on antipsychotic medications for seven years. She was curious whether the antipsychotic drugs caused the cardiac abnormalities in response to Covid-19 vaccine. Treatment information was not provided. The adverse event of passed out for 40 secs was assessed as medically significant.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events chills and cardiac issues was unknown. Outcome of the event passed out for 40 secs was recovered on 11 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The adverse effect happened when I was taking a shower 45 hours after my second vaccine. I was starting to feel better at this point. I started to feel like I was going to pass out. I quickly turned off my shower and sat down. I would have passed out had I not focused to not. I felt nauseous, lost my hearing and started to lose my sight. After I was ok, my lips were blue/Gray. I don&#39;t pass out. I&#39;ve passed out twice in my life when I was much younger. That&#39;s how I knew what was happening. I&#39;m scared this will happen again and I don&#39;t know what this means.

                                                1: the day after my first covid shot, in the evening, my heart rate jumped from around 70 to around 130 instantly when walking up the stairs in my house. This happened twice that evening and has never happened before. My pulse was pounding in my head and it took about 1-2 minutes of slow breathing to calm my heart rate again. I wore my heart rate monitor the rest of the evening and overnight, with no other adverse effects. Stairs had no impact on me the next day. I had also exercised that morning, and while my heart rate was higher than normal with that type of workout, I didn?t think anything of it at the time and didn?t have the pounding head issue.  Due to this issue, I?m a bit nervous about the second shot in the series.   2: I started my period the morning I got the shot; day 4 and 5 of my period were significantly heavier flow than normal. Day 4 also included cramps and nausea throughout the entire day, which is not normal for me.

                                                On Feb 22,  2021 I had my annual physical with my Primary Care Dr (PCP), and she noticed my CBC panel reflected low platelet count of 67, so she referred me to a specialist and I made an appointment with a hematologist for March 23, 2021. My PCP told me that if I noticed bleeding symptoms that I should go to the ER. I had no previous CBC panels with low numbers.  On March 14, at 1:30am I noticed petechiae on my face, lower abdomen, and back of lower legs and I had been feeling fatigued the previous 2 days. I went to the Hospital ER and they took a total panel and the CBC panel came back with low platelet count of 24. They admitted me to the hospital for treatment and monitoring.   The hospital administered treatment of dexamethasone for 3 days intravenously as well as intravenous immunoglobulin for 2 days. My body and platelet count responded well to the treatment and I was released from the hospital on March 16 around noon.  During the following days from the hospital I experienced severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, and night sweats until March 20. I still experience extreme fatigue and night sweats.   I had a follow up blood panel on March 19, which showed stabilized numbers. And I had a follow up appointment with Dr to discuss possible causes (one being the covid vaccine due to the temporal relationship) and planning for treatment (follow up blood panel in 2 months and then every 4 months after that to monitor platelet levels).

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

                                                About 20 minutes after receiving vaccine, started to get a rash on chest and neck and began to have itchy feelings. After about 25 minutes, chest started to feel tight and breathing difficulty. Used Xopenex (Albuterol rescue inhaler, two puffs). 30 minutes after vaccine told nurse at vaccination clinic that I was getting itchier and asked for Benadryl. Received 50mg benadryl intramuscular shot in left arm approx 35 minutes after vaccine. Just a few minutes later throat started to feel tight and kept on coughing. They administered epi in left arm intramuscular. I believe they said it was 0.5 (maybe 5?). A few minutes after that the tightness started to improve and they had called EMS. While in ambulance, it started to get more itchy again, neck and chest and down arms. In ambulance they gave through IV some type of steroid and pepcid. No more medication was given at hospital, monitored for heart and breathing  for approx 2 hours. Discharged home with 5 days of prednisone and benadryl as needed.

When I sat down, my blood pressure dropped and the room started spinning and I could feel that I was going to lose consciousness. My husband came to help and watched as I passed out cold on the toilet for over a minute. 15 hours after receiving the shot, I passed out again on the toilet with the same symptoms before losing consciousness. I was unable to get up without passing out for over 16 hours after receiving the shot. I had continued dizziness and muscle weakness for over 24 hours, along with flu-like symptoms as expected.

I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

                                                After receiving FIRST dose, I noticed severe bruising on legs, arms, hands and feet about a week after vaccine. I called PCP and they requested lab tests. Tests confirmed low platelet count of 3.  I was instructed to go to ER that night for low platelet count. I was admitted from ER to Hematology dept. that same day to receive platelet transfusion and doses of IVIG. I was hospitalized from 4/7/21- 4/10/21. When I left hospital, the platelet count was up to 14,000. On 4/12/21 I experienced severe migraine and it got worse over night. I couldn&#39;t take anything other than Tylenol, which didn&#39;t seem to help. Lab on 4/12/21 indicated levels were up to 30,000. On 4/14/21 I saw PCP and he ordered emergency CAT Scan of the brain, which came back clear. My platelet count went  back down to less than 10. I am now on a steroid to bring up my platelet count.

                                                Within five minutes of my vaccination  I started to feel very dizzy and my eyesight became blurry. I told my husband who had also been vaccinated that I thought something was wrong and within a seconds I then passed out and he caught me. I vomited twice in the span of the next ten minutes and I was not alert for any of that time-no recollection of being able to see or hear. My husband stated my eyes were open and pupils very  dilated. He was able to get me to the ground with the help of the pharmacist who had administered the vaccine. 911 was called and by the time they arrived I became coherent enough to talk and interact. I declined a hospital visit because I had no interest in a ambulance ride but did follow up with my primary. No history of ever fainting or medical anxiety.

Went to ER on 04/26 at approx 12pm, rash suggested to be eczema  allergy with cellulitis.  Given topical steroid cream, keflex. Rash got worse and went to doctor for rash. I suggested then that it could be the covid shot because this was the only new thing. PA I saw said possibly but suggested allergy. Gave me oral steroids, pepcid, and Claritin.  Rash still grew, achy joints..severe itch. At this point I developed open blisters on my toes. Pain &amp; itchy. Went to ER again and was told it could be from my covid shot but they couldn?t confirm. Took blood, tested for lymes..full body rash that resembled measles..took me off of keflex and Claritin, gave me doxycycline and benedryl. Lymes negative. Again covid shot mentioned. No confirmation..just a lot of ?well it?s possible...? really sleepy, elevated BP. Rash fading, but still very visible as of 5/06. Not as itchy, but still full body

Muscle aches, fatigue, just felt off.  Then arm was very sore.  Sunday night my arm pit really started hurting.  Hurst over my shoulder, clavicle, and down into the lateral side of my breast.  Bothered enough in the night that I didn&#39;t sleep well.  This morning 1-5-21 I have a red rash over the injection site, arm is swollen over deltoid and hot.  Arm pit and down into breast is still hurting significantly.  I took Ibuprofen yesterday and helped some with pain in arm pit.  Off an on SOB and chest feels tight.  No cough

                                                I received the moderna covid vaccine at approx 0930 and waited in waiting room of facility per policy after injection.  I felt ok once wait time was up so I left.  I was driving approx 15 min later and (which was approx 30) after administration and pulled over to side of road due to getting chills and shaking and feeling faint.  Also, the left side of my face went numb and tingling.   I called for an ambulance and once they arrived I had started feeling normal again.  Facial tingling still persists at this time hours later.  I also had another sync opal episode once I got a ride home that resolved.  Left side of face feels like after being numb from a dentist.

Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

Chest tightness and heart beat flutters continued and I saw Nurse Practitioner on 1/04/21 and EKG showed frequent premature ventriculations (pvcs). Then referred to cardiologist for follow-up and possible treatment. Currently on a heart monitor as of 1/06/21 and waiting to get into see cardiologist for treatment for continuing pvcs and chest pressure and sometimes pain as of 1/08/21. outcome is yet to be determined as of 1/08/21.

                                                Roughly 4-5 minutes following my vaccination I felt a rush of lightheadedness, tension in my neck, difficulty obtaining a deep breath, flushed and sweating. My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

I&#39;ve been having this pain/ache in my ribs and upper torso of it is crushing inward. My ribs feel like they are being squeezed too hard like a person hugging so tight that you are having difficultly breathing. And the upper torso under my ribs feels like when you have not ate anything in days of hunger pain (but I am not at all hungry) and it start to hurt soo bad that you can only hunch over and hope it goes away.   These issues have been on and off yesterday and today with the dull feel that has not gone away of a 3 or 4 to in a moments notice 8. Currently it is a 3 with a dull squeeze to ribs and barrable hunger pain (I am not hungry).

                                                Approximately 5 minutes, but no more than 7 minutes after I received the vaccine I felt odd, like something was about to happen. I felt a bit detached from my body and my surroundings.  I then felt a flush of heat and my throat suddenly closed up. I felt frozen, as if I couldn?t have drawn in a breath if I had wanted to. I quickly removed my mask and sat up in my chair and leaned forward. After approximately 8-10 seconds my throat opened up and I could breathe.  At this time I felt my heart was racing; I could feel my pulse in my neck without putting my hand to my throat. I started to take my pulse at this time and I could feel that my heart rate was beating fast, but was slowing down back to a normal rate. It took approximately 2 minutes for my heart rate to normalize.  I could now breathe, but my throat still felt a little tight, but I wasn?t completely sure. My throat felt as though I had a lump in it and it felt a little difficult to swallow. I wasn?t completely sure it was the vaccination or that I may have been thirsty. I sat for 15 minutes and I felt fine, no other issues. I had to go to a doctor?s appointment where they took my blood pressure (approximately 1 hour after the vaccination) and said that my bp was normal.   I left the appointment at 4:00 pm and noticed that it was no longer difficult to swallow. I noticed that my throat felt different. The feeling of the ?lump? was gone and I could swallow much more easily. It was at this time that I realized my throat had still been swollen. It had taken almost 2 hours from the time of injection for my throat to feel normal again.  I am healthy, have had several vaccinations in the past and have no known allergies. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I contacted my PCP the next day once they were open to describe my symptoms. She said that I should proceed with the second dose next month, but should take some precautions first.   I didn?t alert anyone immediately after the vaccination as I?ve never had this sort of reaction and wasn?t entirely sure of what it was. I was also in route to a doctor?s appointment and figured if necessary, could receive treatment there. My PCP advised me to take 2 Benadryl and a Zyrtec one hour before the next vaccination. She also advised that I wait for 30 minutes in the observation area following the next dose.   It is Monday evening and as of now I have had no other adverse effects. I have had minimal arm pain and no other effects at all.

                                                approximately 45- an hour after the injection I had some rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

I went to bed that night as usual. I was tossing and turning and woke my self up because i could feel my heart racing. I then proceeded to check my pulse and time myself. I had gotten 120 heart rate. Which i thought it couldnt be but the i have the oxygen sat that check oxygen and heart rate. I checked and my heart rate went up to 125. My head was pounding, i had a fever, the left side of my body ached, and i felt a lot of tension and my hands as if they were swollen. I took some Tylenol throughout the day and i still felt completely exhausted and horrible. This lasted at least 2 days. I contacted the ER nurse hotline they proceeded to tell me that all the signs and symptoms I had were reactions to the vaccine and if my heart rate went over 135 to go to the ER.

                                                This is what I felt during the vaccination: within the minute i felt pain in my chest and back (left side) as we drove from the vaccine station to the medic tent for the 15 min observation. then My throat and tongue started itching and drainage from my nose that makes it hard to swallow bc so much was coming down at once  my neck got a red rash, and then my head started feeling heavy.  my heartrate was up when they first measured it but probably because i started panicking. Within the first minute I could also taste the vaccine (kind of like how when saline is flushed in an IV it can be tasted) and that lasted a few hours. Ten mins after taking the vaccine I took a Zyrtec and ten minutes later the rash got better and I started feeling better. The nose and throat got better abt 1.5 hrs after reaction. I felt extremely tired and beat up until the next day In the following days I was better. I still had drainage from my nose and my throat was bothering (itchy) , but not like the first day.

On my drive home, between 2100-2110 started feeling tingly and numb around mouth and it spread to entire face. Tongue and inside of cheeks also felt tingly/numb.  No visual swelling of face and breathing was ok. I didn&#39;t feel any airway obstruction.  Heart rate also increased. I continued driving to the nearest store to get Benadryl (about an additional 20-25 minutes).  Took 50mg at approximately 2145 and my symptoms slowly got better. As of today (02/16/2021) my face does not still feel 100% back to normal, very minimal numbness/tingly but more so on the left side which was also the same side as injection. I have had no facial drooping.

                                                The morning after receiving the vaccine I woke up feeling achy and had a head ache. I vomited. Later that day I was in a doctors office and my heart rate was 150s at rest. I was sent to the ED for assessment, EKG normal. I received fluids and my heart rate came down to 100-115. I went to my PCP for f/u the next week and they checked my thyroid which was elevated and I was sent to an endocrinologist. My symptoms of tachycardia had started to subside so thyroiditis r/t vaccine and/or post partum are leading on my differential.

Chills, muscle aches, headache and fatigue began about 14 hrs after injection and continued for about 24 hrs. Headache  and fatigue continued on for 48hrs. Diarrhea probably started about 18 hrs after injection and was very mild throughout the next day. Enlarged lymph node didn&#39;t start until around 38 hrs later and although it has reduced significantly it is still a bit enlarged.

I noticed all over body rash, macular papular rash redish whitish throughout body, it became very itchy in my arms and legs, I noticed numbness in right and left arm and legs numbness, shooting pain in left side as well, I experienced neurological symptoms and went to ER. They did a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, they said it was probably a immune response and was told to take antihistamines at home. symptoms started to subside after a couple of days, I then developed intermittent chest pains in the left side and the pain became more consistent and then a week later it was consistent with every breath and I went to the ER again, they did an EKG, Troponin, all cadiac workup and chest xray said it was not cardiac but possibly a chest wall issue, I was referred to cardiology, cardiologist thought I may have pericarditis, I started taking 800mg of ibuprofen for management. My pain has began to subside and now I only have a couple of minutes every other day that I still have pain but stopped taking medication the third week in February. Because of the intensity of my immune response they recommended I not take the 2nd dose. If symptoms subside I will let my dr know

                                                I started having minor body aches about six hours post vaccine. I woke up that night nauseous and dizzy. I passed out on the way to the kitchen to get water. My husband somehow heard me and helped me back to the bedroom where I passed out again. I was eventually able to get back in bed without passing out, though I couldn&#39;t get warm and had severe body aches for most of the night. It was like having a very high fever, only there was no fever. I was clammy, but no fever. Around 4:30 a.m. the &#39;non-fever&#39; broke and the chills and body aches stopped. I was extremely fatigued for the next two days and felt myself again by the third. The arm in which I received the shot hurt pretty bad Friday too but that was the least of my concerns.   I did not seek medical treatment for these symptoms.

                                                Around 3:40am on Friday 02/19/21; I was awaken by extreme pain in my diaphragm, chest, and back.  I was unable to lay down, sit, walk, or stand without being in extreme pain. I had difficulty breathing and was gasping for air. My asthma pump was not effective. Drinking water made it feel worst. Using the bathroom had no benefit. I called 911.  The Fire Department arrived first and administered oxygen, which was ineffective and the pain was increasing.  I was taken via ambulance to Hospital. When I arrived to the hospital; I submitted to a urine sample. I was given Saline in an IV in my right arm.  I was given 3 Tylenol tablets of 975mg. I did a series of blood work, Covid-19 testing, had an X-Ray of my chest, Ultrasound of my abdomen; CT scan of my chest, abdomen, and pelvis w/contrast, and an EKG was performed.  The outcome was a 3mm right middle lobe subpleural pulmonary nodule and negative for Covid-19.  The hospital gave me a pamphlet for shortness of breath and told me to follow up with my primary doctor.

As I was driving home at 3:50 pm I suddenly started to feel tingling in my lips and my throat felt swollen and my chest tight. I was halfway home and panicked so I went home and stayed put. My throat started to relax but my chest felt tight and I was dizzy and light headed till about 9pm. My lips ended up getting a little swollen and I?m still having a burning sensation in my cheeks and chin and my lips are still itchy.  I am a nurse and my husband is a physician and we had an epi pen on hand so I didn?t feel the need to go to the hospital as I was in good care but it was terrifying.

And the chest pain started as a severe shooting pain in my chest. The pain was constant,  After two days of chest pain I visited the Emergency room on 01/11/2021. I got IV fluids. EKG was not normal.  Discharged from hospital and referred to a cardiologist for follow up.  No Health Insurance so no follow up yet.  Chest pain still present but not constant. I never had chest pain before the vaccine. No second dose of vaccine yet.

Pt was planning on waiting 30 minutes d/t prior reactions to medications. Writer assessed pt and pt was talking to writer without any struggling or difficulty. Writer asked pt if this feeling was r/t anxiety or if this feeling was r/t the vaccine administration. Pt stated that for sure anxiety. Pt also mentioned then that tongue felt scratchy and throat felt scratchy.  Pt has benadryl  and epi-pen in purse at all times d/t history of anaphylaxis. Pt did not appear to be concerned at all about scratchiness and asked if a bendadryl could be administered. Writer administered 25 mg diphenhydramine with positive effect beginning. Pt felt as if she were able to leave without issue. Pt denied the need for ambulance transfer or visit to the ER by another form of transportation (friend, family). Pt has a Dr. appt next week and will discuss the second dose at that time. Pt ended up leaving  following 50 minutes after vaccine was administered.

GI issues persisted for the next 3 weeks and on Thursday evening, 2/25/2021 at about 6:30 pm. I was sitting on floor with children and almost passed out. I felt very faint, dizzy, and instantly started chilling. I had a fever of 102.8 and could not get warm. My husband was going to call paramedics, but I encouraged him not to. Discovered my right breast was red and inflamed/ swollen as well as all of my lymph nodes in my right arm pit. I could not reach my right arm forward. I noticed around 12:06 AM after not being able to get warm or break fever. I messaged my primary care clinic when I noticed the breast swelling, redness, pain, and lymph node swelling. I continually felt like I was going to faint/pass out and was very dizzy all night long. I was also extremely fatigued. The did a telemedicine appointment the next morning and diagnosed me with mastitis and prescribed me antibiotics. I am a breastfeeding mother and all of these symptoms came on suddenly and severely on the same side that I got the vaccine shot. I have been breastfeeding for over 7 months and my supply has been dwindling to nothing so I have no problems with engorgement or blocked milk ducts. Before this baby I had just got done breastfeeding a baby for 11 months with no issues of the like.

On day 9 I started to get dizzy at the grocery. Driving home I started to sweat and feel light headed. I was able to get to a friends and became very dizzy and nauseous. After an hour my throat started to swell and my chest tightened. I was taken to urgent care where I received epinephrine and solumedrol. My injection site is no longer read and I?m on oral steroids now.

Sunday morning when I woke up I felt full on vertigo (forward and back) and a disoriented feeling due to feeling a really strong pulse consistently in my head and whole body. This dizziness and vertigo caused naseua. I treated it with meclizine and ondansetron but it only mildly helped symptoms. I went to urgent care and got a steroid shot. They also measured that my blood pressure was high. The steroid shot also did not do much to change the dizziness. Today is Wednesday, a full week after my first shot, and I am still feeling dizzy, with pulsing pressure in my head and full body causing vertigo. I went to an ent today and was started on a z pack. I&#39;m not sure what else to try or how long to expect this or if this is considered an allergic reaction and I should skip my second dose?

Upon observation she was sweating and slightly tachycardic. Administered 25mg oral Benadryl and skin reaction went down as well as sweating ceased. Did not check heart rate again due to other improvements. She returned to work and will take more Benadryl if needed.

It took about 36 hours for my symptoms to be gone after they started. I was also on my period when I received the vaccine. My period seemed to slow down almost completely while my symptoms were happening, and then my period resumed with abnormal cramping and clotting after my symptoms were gone.

Fever always maintained predominantly above 102, dropped to 101 before it broke and went down.

I made an appointment with my primary care physician who recommended i follow up with a neurologist. I scheduled a neurologist appointment for a month later but went to the ER three times with symptoms worsening feeling weak and like I was going to pass out. I was initially told by my primary care physician and ER physician that this was not a side effect of the vaccine so i received my second dose. My heartrates have not been able to be controlled since going up to the 190&#39;s when i stand.

                                                Effects of vaccine were all normal during the first few days and through the first week.  Had a bit of heart palpitations and fever after dose #2 - but it subsided by day 2 and i was back to normal mostly, no real issues.  A week later i experienced an episode of almost-syncope in which i start falling forward in my seat and almost hit the wall in front of me and couldn&#39;t hold my head up.  This has NEVER happened to me before.  I did have a panic attack AFTER this because of how scared i had become of that feeling, but i recognize that and know the difference.  After that i continued to experience bouts of dizziness and disequilibrium.  I have almost fallen reaching for things, opening my car door, walking, etc.  Several weeks later i experienced another flare up of the syncope feeling while at work where i almost fainted again and was able to regain composure and the disequilibrium sensation lasted for several days to which i sought medical help.  I have been visiting a chiropractor and a physical therapist for over a month now with minor improvement.  I still experience unexplained episodes that prevent me from being able to work properly or leave my home as it would be unsafe to drive or be out in case i need medical assistance.  I have never experienced ANYTHING like this until i was vaccinated and three months later it is still affecting my quality of life.

I wasn&#39;t worried because this is well known for side effects from the vaccine but I wasn&#39;t prepared for the heart palpitations and tachycardia I had for about 4 hours the night of 1/5/21. I had COVID in May 2020 and per my cardiologist probably had myocarditis that I am still taking a beta blocker for as a result of the COVID infection. There may or may not be a link between the immune response to the vaccine and my previous COVID complications. The morning of 1/6/21, I am pretty much back to normal.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

The rest of the symptoms just described continue this evening which i attribute to the covid vaccine.

I sat to wait and within five minutes was lightheaded, overheated but having chills and having intense abdominal cramps. My pulse ox and bpm were fine but my blood pressure was low for me; normal is 110/70 and emt&#39;s confirmed that I was 90/60 and then 98/62 after 40 minutes post vaccine.  I waited longer and then not feeling worse left. Advil fixed the cramps. So far it&#39;s only been pain at the injection site.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins sitting after infection. I left and was driving and started feeling disoriented, dizzy, shaking and throbbing headache. I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

                                                MODERATE PAIN (6/10) AT INJECTION SITE began within 30 minutes of vaccine administration. Ibuprofen provided no pain relief, taken once 4 hours post-vaccine administration, and again 8 hours after. 24 hours after initial injection given, at work (I am a medical student rotating in neurology at the clinical site where the vaccine was administered), I felt severe pain at injection site (10/10), radiating toward my left shoulder blade. The pain was so severe, I could not continue my work. I applied an ice pack to my arm and took Ibuprofen, sat on the floor in the dark to wait for relief. I felt my heart racing, hyperventilating (likely due to pain), became diaphoretic, and experienced photophobia as well as tremulous shaking. After approximately 30 minutes, a supervisor found me and alerted emergency med techs on staff, who measured vitals and rushed me to the Emergency Department of our hospital. The pain began to subside to 5/10 after an hour in the ED, where I was treated with intravenous fluid (NS), diphenhydramine PO, and metoclopramide PO. I was stabilized, pain under control (3/10), and released approximately 3 hours after admission, at 3:15 PM.

                                                The morning after the vaccination, I woke up and felt slightly nauseous. When I got out of bed, and went to the bathroom, everything went white and I fell. I was able to get up on my own but had to lay back down. I thought I would be unable to go to work but after resting for about 15 minutes, I was able to get up, finish getting ready for work but continued to get lightheaded if I stood in one spot for too long. I was very tired and out of it the rest of the day, and having chills throughout the day. All of this in addition to my arm being very sore and my back hurt from my fall. I also had a very bad headache, and later in the day, around 430pm, my temp was 100.2.  I took tylenol and went to bed around 630.

                                                Full anaphylactic shock; Hives; Low blood pressure; Dizziness; Stuffy nose; Bad headache; Nausea; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare facility staff member who was a 36-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine, and who developed full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose.  The patient&#39;s medical history included a latex allergy and pregnancy.  Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06-Jan-2021, approximately 30 minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT 01122019) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient received her Moderna vaccine on 06 Jan 2021 at noon.  She reported that approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she went into full anaphylactic shock.  She stated that the reaction began with nausea.  She then developed hives, got low blood pressure, and was dizzy.  She was taken to the hospital.  There, she received two rounds of epinephrine along with diphenhydramine and famotidine.  She was released that same day from the hospital once she stabilized.   On 07-Jan-2021, a full 24 hours after receiving her vaccine, she experienced another anaphylactic reaction.  She stated that the reaction happened exactly like it did on 06 Jan 2021 and presented with all the same symptoms.  Patient injected herself with the epinephrine pen that she had at home as soon as the symptoms started.     In addition to the anaphylactic reactions she experienced, patient reported that she had a bad headache since receiving the vaccine as well as a stuffy nose that comes and goes and coincides with hives.  As of 10 Jan 2021, she stated that the flare ups had finally subsided, however, she continued taking diphenhydramine and famotidine as prophylaxis for anaphylactic reaction.   Treatment for the event included epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and famotidine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events, full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose, was not provided.   The events, full anaphylactic shock and low blood pressure were considered resolved on 07 Jan 2021. The events, nausea, hives, and dizziness were considered recovered/resolved on 10 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the events, bad headache and stuffy nose, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 36-year-old female patient with medical history of latex allergy, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 01122019), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock, the non-serious listed events of Headache and Nausea, and the non-serious unlisted events of Urticaria, Hypotension, Dizziness, and Nasal congestion.  Based on the current available information and temporal associon between the use of the product and the onset of events starting on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

I took Benadryl and it slowly started to help. Also it is hard to move the left side of my upper body. I?ve been using Tylenol Advil and heat.

The above symptoms subsided some approximately 24 hours post vaccine and were resolved by approximately 40 hours post vaccine. However, 1 p.m. on 1/22, noticed injection site was itchy, red, swollen, and sore. Took Benadryl that evening and swelling subsided some by next morning and completely resolved by 1/25.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

Pt had taken Benadryl 25 and prednisone prior to making room attendant RN aware. Upon auscultation, no wheezing noted. Pt blood pressure was 158/100, HR 128, o2 sat was 98%. Pt verbalized that her baseline HR was around 118 and that she had anxiety. Pt was diaphoretic upon exam and asked for a bottle of water. Pt&#39;s request was honored. Pt walked around the room to relieve her anxiety and said she felt better.   Her HR went down to 90 after walking around the room. Pt was offered IM diphenhydramine and refused. Pt also refused Ambulance to transfer her to ER. At 4:30 pm patient took another Benadryl PO without medical advice. Pt is a registered nurse and wanted to be transferred to ER, where she works, by another RN.  Pt left facility against medical advice and declined EMS at 4:40 pm. BP was 190/140 and HR 104 when she left facility to go to ER, transported in private vehicle by coworker who is an RN. Called ER to check on pt and physician said she had recovered and that she did not require any further medical attention, the event was believed to have been anxiety related.

                                                On 2/4/21,  after receiving the vaccine I was starting to feel a slight headache but more like pressure. I was also feeling a bit nauseous but I thought it was stress but I did took an ibuprofen.  Later I starter to feel very tired do I went to sleep like about 7pm and I took a Tylenol before doing so.   I kept on waking up in the middle of the night still feeling pressure pain in my head and like a tightness sensation with a slight pain on my chest.   I woke up at 5am to get ready to work and I was still not feeling well. I got out of the house and stoped at a gas station and when I got out of the car, I started to feel extremely dizzy while walking. Got to my work place and took my temperature and it was 99.1. After a while dizziness and pressure on chest kept on getting worst.   I had someone at work take my vitals and my temperature was 101.0,  BP was 144/95, BPM was 120,  SpO2 was 98%. My boss send me home. And now I?m having mid and back lower pain with a bit of chills

                                                6 minutes after receiving vaccine patient reported that her tongue was starting to swell and that her heart was racing.  Staff called 911 immediately.  Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the 2nd shot of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine around 9:25 am on 2/5/2021, after about 10 minutes I became hot and lightheaded.  Immediately after that I started getting tingling and numbness bilaterally in my hands and fingers with a heavy sensation.  My heart also started racing.  The nurses put me in a wheelchair and escorted me upstairs to the ER.  In transit my face and throat/neck started getting tingling as well.  By the time we reached the ER waiting room (9:42 am) I got the shakes/chills and was very cold.  I continued having the shakes for several minutes.  By the time I was brought back into the triage area (9:50 am) my legs from the shin to feet bilaterally started going numb/tingly as well.  I started having a cyclical reaction.  I would shake/have the chills for about 5 minutes (without any tingling/numbness in extremities), after that I would get a full body flushing sensation with feeling of lightheadedness and nausea, followed by numbness/tingling in both hands and feet. Then the cycle would repeat itself for several hours.  I continued to have a heavy sensation of my hands and feet until about 10:15 am.  After that the heaviness sensation did not accompany the tingling/numbness that persisted.  I was hooked up to IV fluids and IV benadryl at 10:45 am.  By 12:30 I finally stopped getting the chills/shaking sensation but I had a consistent body flushing followed by tingling/numbness in my hands and feet (mostly hands/arms) about every 5 minutes.  Around 1 pm I all symptoms had stopped.  The doctor said all my tests and blood work looked good.   I was discharged from the hospital around 2:45 pm with instrustions to followup with primary doc or return to the ER if symptoms got worse.   At 5:30 pm that evening all my symptoms came back, started with chills and then full body flushing sensation followed by tingling/numbness in both arms/hands bilaterally. I also had a hot sensation up the entire side of my left arm (injection site arm) up to my ear.     I took 2 500 mg tablets of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl at 6:20.  By 6:40 I was starting to feel a little better with less shaking and less body flushing/tingling.  Symptoms seemed gone by 7 pm.  I went to bed at 9 pm and woke up around 10:30 pm to my body flushing and my hands going tingling/numb.  I tried to sleep, but could not.  Around 11:30 pm I took 1 500 mg tablet of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl.  I woke up the next morning (2/6/2021) with no numbness/tingling shaking or body flushing.  I felt extremely exhausted and sore.  That day my symptoms did not return.   I woke up on Sunday 2/7/2021 with no symptoms, but around 8:30 am I had a lightheaded episode and hot sensation with a feeling of nausea.  I then started to get tingling in my face, mouth and lips.  It persisted for 2.5 hours until I decided to take Benadryl (2 25 mg tablets).  about 30 minutes after taking medication the tingling stopped.  It did not return.

I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, used a heating pad on 2/9 and 2/10, but pain progressed.  Mid-day on 2/10 the pain was so severe, I went to urgent care. They said it was gastritis and released me. I went back 2 hours later and saw a different doctor. He diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and pleural effusion. I was sent by ambulance to the hospital and admitted. I was treated for pain and started on Eliquis. I was discharged the evening of 2/12. The morning of 2/13, I woke up with 100.6 F Temp and 85% O2 at. I went to urgent care again, they thought I had pneumonia and referred me to the hospital.

                                                Less than 6 hours later had a fever of 101, body aches and chills. Headache started around 12 hours after shot. Experienced fatigue, fever and nausea for 48 hours after shot. I was experiencing rapid HR for 48 hours. Contacted doctor they thought I had an allergic reaction to second dose so I did take a benadryl and it did seem to help with my heart rate. I am still experiencing headaches that come and go after a week of getting my second dose. I have been extremely fatigued more than usual as well.

My heart rate was monitored.  Resting, my heart rate was 130 beats per minute for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes my heart rate began to return to normal.  The next day, while teaching, my heart rate became elevated again.  I had to set down.  After a few minutes, my heart rate began to slow.  For 8 days following the vaccine, I experienced episodes of my heart racing, increased PVCs, and chest discomfort.  I did not seek medical treatment at an ER because symptoms started to subside after 10 minutes.  I also experienced extreme fatigue.

I, became aware at about 1:15 there was some concern.  I spoke with patient she was having some trouble answering questions and appeared in moderate distress.  She reported to me having some SOB after her first dose.  Dr. had been contacted already.  At 1:19PM the patient appeared to have trouble catching her breath and reported SOB was worse than with first dose.  At this point I decided to administer 0.3mg of epinephrine as a precaution due to significant SOB.  Dr. came on the scene shortly after, the patient was monitored a bit longer, HR increased then decreased with oxygen.  The decision was made to contact EMS.

Took OTC Tylenol (2) po and had no signs of relief. Pain , swelling, and skin redness lasted for 3 days. On February 10th, 2021 I had a positive pregnancy test (confirmed by bloodwork and urine) which indicated I was 6-7 weeks pregnant and had a miscarriage on March 2021, after giving live births 3 prior times. The cause of the miscarriage is unknown.  I also developed a blood clot on the arm that was inserted for an IV. I have no family history or personal history of needing blood thinners.

Back left under ribs back pain...then chest pain left / same spot on the front left...then I saw the large rash on my arm which felt like it was on fire and I collapsed in the shower. With help, I took my medicine and went to sleep and felt ok for a little this morning and now the pain is back - this time with heartburn. I?ve been sick to my stomach on and off since the vaccine, weird taste and feeling in the back of my throat, place where they gave me the shot swelled up half the size of a baseball within an hour of the vax - it?s still a bit bigger than my other side. Could it be allergic reaction to this?

At 11:00 a.m. this morning she received her 1st dose of the COVID vaccine and began to feel her throat closing.  Immediately she received 1 dose of IM epinephrine.  Approximately 15 minutes after that she received a 2nd dose of epinephrine by IM.  EMS was activated and she was brought to the emergency room.  She was stable and received 50 mg of Benadryl by IV during transport.  She denies shortness of breath or nausea.  was rather concerning that her chest pressure began after the administration of the epinephrine.  She denies shortness of breath, nausea, or other concerning findings for anaphylaxis minus the throat swelling.  It is unclear whether this was truly anaphylaxis or other.  Upon arrival to the emergency room she was rather stable and a thorough workup was initiated.  With her reports of the chest pressure I felt that a cardiac workup was indicated with concerns that the epinephrine may have caused her a cardiac event.  Initial troponin was negative, and a 2 hour troponin was warranted as her symptoms were less than an hour prior to arrival to the emergency room.  The 2 hour troponin did show a delta of 16 and changing.  At this time I informed the patient of the results and recommended a 6 hour troponin.  She was understandable and willing to comply.  She did have a low potassium at 2.9 and received to 40 mEq doses of oral potassium replacement.  Her magnesium is 1.6, and a corrected magnesium was calculated at 1.78 with her albumin at 4.4.  The patient was stable and comfortable throughout the evaluation in the emergency room.  She did not exhibit hypotension, nausea, vomiting or other concerning findings for anaphylaxis.  She did receive Solu-Medrol, and Pepcid while in the emergency room.  I did consider administering Benadryl, but she did receive 50 mg of IV Benadryl in the ambulance on the way to the emergency room.  The 6 hour troponin was reassuring and unchanging.  The patient was then discharged home with follow-up precautions and instructions follow-up with a primary care provider.

In the three days that have followed since then, I have continued to have chest pressure that comes every 2-3 hours and lasts about an hour. The pain is less than the original episode.

                                                On 3/1/2021, received second dose at 3:15pm and at 3:45pm driving home from work I developed chest pains and went to urgent care. I got there by 5:30pm and they ran an EKG; results were normal. On 3/2/2021, I left work at 2:30pm feeling ill and when I got home by 3:30pm I had flu symptoms. Symptoms were body aches, headache, fever, chills, nausea. This lasted for 24 hours. When I woke up on 3/4/2021, I was just tired with chest pains. I went to work and on my way home at 3:45pm shortness of breath started with increased chest pains. I went to urgent care and they told me to head to the ER. I got to the ER by 6pm. They ran blood work, EKG and Chest X-ray; results all normal. I followed up with PCP. I was out of work from 3/5/2021 to 3/12/2021. PCP thought I might have COVID. Took PCP test on 3/9 and results were negative. I was able to return to work on 3/15/2020 but still had shortness of breath and chest pains as well as feeling exhausted all the time. Due to no change, PCP provided me with script for Echocardiogram, Exercise Stress Test, inhaler as needed and to see Pulmologist.  Waiting on insurance company to approve echocardiogram and pulmologist appointment is 3/29/2021. It has been challenging to complete daily living activities like washing dishes, showering, climbing 20 stairs to my apartment, laundry, walking to the postal mailbox, etc. I get easily tired and winded. Prior to 3/1, I was healthy and exercising 3x&#39;s a week, walking 4 miles and hiked with no issues for the past year ranging 3.5-7 miles with incline.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

On 2/5/21 I miscarried the baby and ended up hemmoraging thus requiring a blood transfusion. The fetus was sent to pathology and I was informed that at 12 weeks when I miscarried that the baby had termed at 9 weeks which was the time of my first vaccine injection.

                                                Initially I had arm soreness at the area of the shot.  Saturday evening following the vaccine I had pain in my left side of the neck.  Sunday the pain went from the left side of my neck down to the base of my ribs and then progressed to include the back and chest almost constantly instead of just on inhalation.  I went to the ER on Sunday evening, assuming very bad costochondritis; however, was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms in the left lung, areas of possible infarction, and pleurisy.  I had a CT scan at a Medical Center prior to receiving the Moderna vaccine for a suspected PE and it was negative.

                                                Right arm became very tender, then by the morning I had muscle/joint pain in my upper body. I felt very tired, but my blood pressure was 97/46  about three hours after the injection and this could have been related more to my iron anemia which gets treated with transfusions. The pain in my upper body lasted about 24 hours.

                                                The vaccine was received at 1:12 PM, and I felt fairly fine, aside from injection site pain and some tingling in my left arm  until I had sudden significant elevation of heart rate, with shortness of breath, and throat swelling/tightening at approximately 1:26PM.  I cold compress was applied to my forehead and I was put in a reclining position &amp; then received Epinephrine at 1:28PM. EMS (present onsite) arrived for transport at 1:31PM. 4L of oxygen was applied after O2 sat of 89% noted by EMS. Blood pressure was elevated to &gt;200/100 initially by EMS. Symptoms improved quickly following epinephrine, with some residual feelings of very mild throat fullness, and I developed chills which improved over time.  I was transported to emergency department where I was evaluated (symptoms mostly resolved at that time, but ED physician noted a little swelling remaining in my uvula), then IV Benadryl and Decadron were given. Later acetaminophen was also given for headache that developed during my ED stay.  My vitals were monitored throughout and observation occurred until I was discharged at approximately 5:00PM, as symptoms had not recurred.

The person took me to the ER in a wheelchair, since it was across the hall.  They did an EKG on me, and evaluated me for an hour, and I was released once my pulse slowed down to 99 and I felt better.  It has been 7 days and I have continued to have tachycardia while sitting, with my pulse going from the 70s to to 130s for no reason.  It will come in episodes. I went and saw my primary care doctor today and my pulse was 105-115 sitting.  I have cut out coffee since the incident on 12/29/2020.

                                                At minute 12 after injection (8:31am on 1/5/20), the pruritis started on my scalp and my back. I informed the volunteer at the end of the drive line. She offered to have EMS evaluate me, however I declined as I thought the reaction was mild. Over the next 10 minutes, after being released from the driveline, I was so itchy I wanted to literally rip all of my skin off. The back of my throat started to itch, but never felt tight or swollen. No SOB or chest tightness. I checked my temp at 8:45 and I was at 101.0 and HR was 110bpm. I am a PA working in dermatology and got to work and took 50mg of diphenhydramine PO but was not improving. One of the doctors I work with and I decided it was best for me to get checked out in urgent care. I had my MA drive me there and was seen immediately. I had a blotchy rash over my entire body, but not raised or hived. Temp was 100.6, HR 86 and BP 127/78, respirations 16/min O2 sat 98% and the itchiness was still severe but I could tell the diphenhydramine was kicking in. I was then given 40mg of famotidine PO and 10mg Dexamethasone IM in the right buttocks while in urgent care. After about 15 minutes, my symptoms were improving, but not resolved. I was released and went home to rest. Throughout the day yesterday (1/5/20) my heart rate would spike as high as 130bmp (my normal is 60-70bpm). Then it would come down within a few seconds to about 100bpm and steadily stay between 90-100bpm all day. Last night I was woken up at 3:30am (1/6/20) with a HR of 132bpm and O2 at 97%. I took a few deep breaths, and it slowly started to drop to 100bpm. Since 6:00am, I am steady at 70-80bpm with occasional spikes of 96-100bpm and I can feel when my heart is starting to race. I have my pulse ox on for the day and will continue to monitor my symptoms. I still have occasional pruritis, but it&#39;s tolerable. I was discharged from urgent care with PO Prednisone tapered dose, however, I am very shaky already and do not want to make it worse, so have not started it yet. Not sure if I should? And I would like to know if I should receive the second dose? If so, should I pre-medicate? Please let me know if you have any further questions about my event. Thanks.

                                                About 10-20 seconds after receiving vaccine I felt faint and the darkness started to close in and I almost passed out.  The back of my tongue became very dry.   I felt better after 10 minutes and never passed out.  They took my vital signs and everything was normal.  I have never been bothered by needles before at all so it was strange.  However I do have a long history of anxiety so it?s possible it was just that.

Day 3---no side effects Day 4 to Day 5---At about 8 pm, I noticed slight swelling underneath my left eye, that looked like a bag.  My face was also red.  The sides of my face, jaw line,  &amp; both sides of my neck were itchy.  I went to bed since I was supposed to work the next morning at 6 AM (OB Nurse).  I work up at 4:15 AM &amp; my face was quite swollen, specifically my left side, my face &amp; neck was warm to the touch &amp;  itchy.  I immediately took 50mg of Benadryl &amp; called my internal medicine doctor. Day 5---I was to be seen in the clinic at 7:00 AM.  The Benadryl helped some.  I was not having any breathing difficulty.  I was prescribed 5 days of Prednisone.  By about 1:00 PM,  the swelling was worsening &amp; my lips were tingling.  I called the doctor again &amp; they told me to go to the ER.  I never had issues with my airway.   The swelling was always worse on my left side of my face.  I received IV fluids &amp; Solumedrol &amp; was discharged with an epi pen, &amp; told to continue the Benadryl, Prednisone, &amp; Pepcid bid.  CoVid test done in ER was negative. Day 6---The facial swelling/redness/itching remained but was improved.  I was very tired. Day 7---Same as Day 6, but less swelling. Day 8---Facial swelling/redness/itching gone, but tiredness remained.  Started to notice a chest heaviness/feeling of constant excitement in the center of my chest, even when at rest. Day 9-10---Tiredness remained.  Intermittent Chest heaviness/feeling of excitement in the center of my chest remained. Day 11---Feeling more normal.

I did not immediately notify anyone as I was not aware a fast heartbeat was considered an allergic reaction.  The fast heartbeat resolved, but my heartbeat continued to be elevated about 10-20bpm from my usual baselines for 2 days post vaccine.  I also developed the following side effects; headache, fatigue, muscle/joint pain, chills, swelling of lymph nodes on right arm, pain on right arm/joints, and mild tingling/numbness of right arm; all side effects resolved by day 3 post vaccine.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

The soreness, swelling, and redness started approximately 6 hours after the injection and continued for approximately 5 days. Beginning on the second day and continuing for about 48 hours I had a fluttering heart/increased heart rate. I then had 1-2 days with no symptoms, but now my arm is swollen, red, warm, and itchy around the injection site. It has been this way for 2-3 days.

                                                Two hours after the injection I experienced increasing soreness in my left shoulder up through the left side of my neck and down through the forearm. I became slightly nauseous through that evening. The pain and tightness got to the point I could not perform regular functions with the left arm. It felt as if my muscles were tearing and prevented me from sleeping. I took ibuprofen in addition to alternating ice and heat to no avail. It hurt to lift my arm, grip to pull or push even a blanket. This continued for 48 hours before there was slight relief. Full range of motion returned four days after the injection. For brief periods throughout the days following, I also experienced occasional slight heart palpitations.

Went ER at 12:55 pm and they did an EKG - not a regular heartbeat; blood work and x-ray. My BP was high - 143/122; I had low potassium; white blood cells higher than normal -10.9 (in mid Nov - only 7.5); They gave me potassium to take. December 30, when I got home at 6:30 - nausea started and I was throwing up two-three  days in a row more than 5 or 6 times a day; weird metallic taste; fever at night; arm pain and swollen under my armpits. (Stayed off work three days.) Went to dr on Jan. 7 - did a follow up appt. and did all the blood work again and everything was back to normal.

The pain extended all the way from my shoulder through my right wrist. Most symptoms, except for fatigue and pain limited to the injection site, resolved after 24 hours.

At 15 minutes I started to get hot, cough persisted, and a feeling of fatigue (I didn?t want to talk...very unusual). At 30 minutes the scratch in the throat turned to a lump, the cough was worse, and itching began on neck &amp; face. The doctor on site gave an oral Benadryl tablet but in two minutes symptoms were worsening and vomiting started. My chest was tight and sweat began. The doctor administered 50 mg benadryl shot &amp; a steroid. The lump was growing bigger, so they administered an epinephrine. Then I was sent to the ER. Upon arrival I received 25 mg of benadryl due to the whole body itching, but throat had relaxed. Also received IV fluids.

Injection site swelled approx 20 cm x 15cm red hot swollen and itchy for 10 days. In those 10 days I had multiple unexplained ringing of the ears with same funny feeling and checked my BP which was low 105/56. Those episodes carried on for the length of 14 days after vaccine #1 and only lasted for 2-3 min at a time.

                                                Patient had first dose of Moderna COVID vaccination on 1/5/21 and experienced a syncopal episode approximately 10 minutes post administration. She was found to have a low blood sugar (approx. 70) at the time of the syncope. She had her second dose of Moderna COVID vaccination on 2/2/21. Her starting blood sugar displayed on her pump (type 1 diabetic with insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor) was 172 after approximately 20 minutes her blood sugar had dropped to 92, she ate approximately 100 grams of carbs starting at 10 minutes after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Her blood sugar stabilized and remained in the mid nineties after 45 minutes. Her vital signs were stable and she left stating she didn&#39;t feel any signs of low blood glucose. Her pump also indicated that her blood sugar was no longer dropping.

I was taken to the ED and given Benadryl, IV fluids and had continued nausea, lightheadedness and developed a headache. After Benadryl the symptom resolved except for lightheadedness and headache. Today I have symptoms very similar to flu headache, lightheadedness, nausea, muscle aches, joint aches and overall fatigue.

                                                I got the vaccine on 30th of Dec. Had a sore arm, runny nose, woke up the next day to puffy eyes and bruises under my eyes (still hasn&#39;t gone away) Since then I have had GI issues. Constipation. It aggravated my face. I had nausea. I had a rash on my arm and on my chest the following Tuesday. My face were tingling and very flush. I had a lot of allergy and sinus issues. Sinus pressure. This all unfolded the first few weeks after receiving the vaccine. I do have fibromyalgia. I had allergy testing done. I am allergic to bee stings. Was having a lot of vaginal issues. Watery eyes and have hot flashes followed by chills. Hives on chest. Difficulty swallowing. Rapid heart rate. I have seen three doctors that have told me my hear rate was fast. Glands have been swollen for two weeks. The night after I got the shot it was really rough with body aches.

                                                5 min post injection, shoulder pain. 23 hours post injection Fatigue, dizziness, lightheaded, shortness of breath, low blood pressure (85/53). Symptoms lasted 6 days post injection diminishing on day 5 to include only moderate fatigue. On day 7 post injection, the first phyical activity (skiing) immediatly resulted in heart pain (angina) and inability to take a deep breath. Assessment at the ER for a heart attack showed higher than normal range of troponin (.031)but a clear x-ray and EKG. Tests were repeated 4 hours after initial tests and troponin was within normal limits (.020). I was discharged with a 2/100 risk of heart attack in the next 30 days and a follow up stress test. I believe this was a direct result of the Covid-19 Maderna shot. I believe is reduced my hearts ability to work at a normal capacity and respond to physical activity.

                                                I was diagnosed with post-partum hypothyroidism 4/6/20 (labs below) and put on medication (levothyroxine).  Based on lab trends over the next 9 months, medication was weaned down and after labs on 12/28/20 (below), I was taken off medication as my physician felt that this condition was resolved .  I received my first COVID vaccination on 12/31/20.  Over the next month, I felt progressively more tired.  On 1/25/21 @noon I started having symptoms of hypotension unrelated to dehydration. These symptoms were intermittently persistent for the next  2 weeks.  On 1/27/21 @0400 I started having profuse uterine bleeding (menorrhagia) which resulted in a call to the MD later that day who recommended high dose ibuprofen and rest.  I omitted AM ibuprofen dose on 1/29/21 and received the second COVID vaccine on 1/29/21.  Repeat thyroid labs were drawn on 2/8/21 (below) and were  completely unexpected given previous lab trends.  My physician placed me back on medication and I will get my labs drawn again in a month.  Acknowledge that there isn&#39;t data with the COVID vaccine and autoimmune conditions; however, I am wondering if the vaccine induced the TPO antibodies  along with the COVID antibodies.  This may be something to look more into for other autoimmune disorders as well as more patients are vaccinated.

I have had vasovagal events in the past and this was exactly like them, only normally they are triggered by an event, and there was no event so I assume it was the vaccine. After sleeping it off under multiple blankets for a couple hours I seem to be recovered and just have a headache.

Pt subsequently received her first COVID Vaccine shot on 22JAN21 and reported to medical on 3FEB21 with mild chest pain and an EKG with changes demonstrating pericarditis and a US demonstrating trace effusion. Pt was minimally symptomatic but given her previous episodes was sent to the Role 3 for further evaluation. Her work up on 10FEB21 demonstrated resolution of EKG changes and effusion with normal cardiopulmonary work up. Given her history it has been recommended that she does not receive the second dose of the vaccination.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included monk fruit allergy and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications reported included hydrochlorothiazide.  On an unknown date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273.   On 28 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28 Jan 2021, following vaccination, the patient experienced an elevated heart rate of 105-112 beats per minute (bpm). The patient stated that 80 bpm was normal for her. At 7:30 pm, she began wheezing and her lips turned blue, both of which resolved within 2 hours. The patient took ibuprofen, naproxen, and diphenhydramine and sat in a warm tub for an hour and felt better after she covered up in bed.  On 29 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102 degrees Fahrenheit (F) at midnight and 99 degrees F at 5:00 am.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The events, wheezing and lips turned blue, were considered resolved on 28 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, heart rate was elevated to 105-112 bpm and temperature was 102, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 37-year-old, female patient, with medical history of high blood pressure and allergies to monk fruit, who experienced serious unexpected event of cyanosis, non-serious unexpected event of wheezing, heart rate increased, and non-serious expected event of pyrexia.

She was pretty much herself on morning of 2/13/2021 - got up, had shower.  caregivers noted her extremities were cool and face was red.  temp was 97.4.  She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.  CPR was continued until family could be reached and decision was made to stop resuscitation.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine I started to have an increased heart rate and blood pressure.  I was watched for close to an hour, and let go.  I experienced muscle and joint pain, which was to be expected.  Approximately 2 days afterwards, I started to experience dizziness, low blood pressure, and pressure in the middle of the back of my head.  The pressure became worse and worse, while continuing to experience the above side effects.  Since that time, I have been to the emergency room for pain all over, pressure in the back of the head, memory issues, blood in the stool, and extremely cold hands and feet without explanation.

By the third day I began feeling short of breath while talking.  The shortness of breath (SOB) lasted 3 days and was present for about half a day each. Then it all went away. On tuesday, Feb 16th, I began to feel SOB again but this time under my L breast I had pain. I tried to see if it was muscle (I am a PT) but could not tell. The next day the pain moved near where my sternum meets my ribs and then I worked on that and it has been there ever since. It feel heavy and I get chest discomfort on inhalation. I have seen primary care, they said to wait a few weeks and let them know if it is still there. I decided to report my symptoms now because I thought it would go away but it still has not and it does not seem normal to me. I did notice if I take an aleve it feels better but today that has not helped either. I hear that this vaccine can cause inflammation and so I am just wondering is this normal for what I am feeling?

                                                A few minutes after inoculation, the patient felt chest tightness.  She rested for a few minutes.  Her chest tightness did not ease.  She used her asthma inhaler to try to relieve the symptoms.  Immediately (but not necessarily because of the inhaler) her symptoms worsened.  I called over the attending EMTs, who put the patient on 02.  Soon after, a pulse oximeter showed the patient&#39;s 02 sat at 100, pulse at 110.The feeling of tightness continue but the oxygen immediately relieved the patient&#39;s distress.  After a few more minutes, the patient took another hit of albuterol.  That brought immediate relief.  Her pulse gradually slowed to the mid-70s.  She said she felt tired, as often she does after an asthma attack, but soon felt well enough to leave.  She planned to take an cab or equivalent to home, and said she had taken the day off.  She said her doctor warned her that because she has a history of reactions (details unknown) to vaccines, she might react badly to Moderna, but the doctor and patient agreed that it was worth the risk. She said her reaction to NSAIDs has been anaphylaxis.

I proceeded to the bathroom where I appeared pale. I took my pulse which was extremely slow (20-40bpm). I realized I may die or pass out. I reached for the door and I don&#39;t remember anything until waking up on the bathroom floor. I was able to get up on my own. I was able to compose myself and walk to my car. I got a ride home. I remained dizzy and having heart palpitations for about 1 hour. I did not seek medical care. I continued to having hot flashing and tingling feelings throughout the evening. Today, 3/5, I have joint pain and fatigue and occasional dizziness.

Afterwards I had some chest pain.  the feeling of Heaviness on my chest . Took tums helped a little then the feeling came back. Went for a 2 mile walk helped a little then came back. Watched tv,,  chest pressure was still there .   By one week post vaccine I felt completely normal, no chest pain, no dizziness, no heart palpitations. I did not seek care with a primary care or other providers because I assumed this was a strong immune response elicited by the second dose of the Covid vaccine.

Recently had a cardiology workup prior to the vaccine and all was normal. Had the second shot on Feb 26 and had elevated resting heart rate for 2-3 days. On days 5 and 6, tried to exercise and had heart rate spikes in the 170s. Felt very tired and short of breath. Went to urgent care for EKG, which was normal. Rested for a few days. Day 10, tried to exercise, again had heart rate spikes ? 168, 172, 183.

                                                Here is my story. Part 1: I had my second Moderna vaccine on 2/16. 36 hours later I was laying In bed when I all of a sudden felt very strange- sort of faint - like I was going to pass out. Then I started feeling like my Body was going numb. We called 911. I was taken to the ER. What followed was about 15-20 ?neurological? episodes (every ten minutes or so) where my entire body from head to toe became paralyzed- I couldn?t move any of my limbs. I also had no sight. I was not blacked out Bc I could hear everything that was happening. It was also accompanied by extreme chest pain, numbness, contratcing of muscles in chest cavity that felt almost like a heart attack. Each individual episode lasted about 3-5 minutes and then slowly the paralysis would undo and I?d regain feeling. And then the full episodes would start over a few minutes later. This went on for a few hours repeatedly while in the ER.  I was admitted for testing  and monitoring for two days (EEG, EKG, MRI, Catscan) all clear. Once discharged I had lingering neurological symptoms but not the full paralysis episodes. Lingering symptoms included severe chest pain, numbness/weaknesses predominant on the left side as well as other random areas. I was very weak and tired. I started to improve very slowly - by day 10 post hospitalization I was starting to feel like things were turning the corner and maybe I was on my way to recovery. Part 2: I started to finally feel more improved from the lingering neurological issues and then all of a sudden around 5:30PM I was in the kitchen making dinner for my kids on 3/2 and the episodes started again. Called 911. Again, every ten minutes or so they came on (maybe 15-18 episodes) of complete paralysis- this time accompanied by seizure like rapid eye movement from side to side and fluttering of the eyes. I was readmitted to the hospital where the episodes repeated to happen again, maybe 15-20 times. I was admitted. They did a 24 hour video EEG which ?caught? the episodes on video and sound but did not appear negatively on the EEG in terms of abnormal brain activity. I?ve been released as they say there is nothing to do. I have lingering muscle weakness in my eyes- I can?t focus my eyeballs or ?track? on an eye exam and continued muscular chest pain. I also have a lot of PTSD from the trauma of the events.

                                                About 12 hours exactly after getting the 2nd dose I got extreme POTS flare up and a mild occular migraine.  I had a fever that kept going from the mid 99s to the 101s for 36 hrs.  Was freezing and burning and had lots of joint and body pain.  Most people I know had all of that, but the reason I?m reporting is the tachycardia.  My tachy has been fairly well controlled with meds and after my second dose it was so bad any time I sat up, I couldn?t breath, my tachy got so bad, my heart rate would jump from up to 70bpms, just sitting up.  My resting heart rate on meds has been 60-80, and for those 36 hours was 80-110.  Anytime I did anything my heart rate would jump to 130-150 and I could NOT BREATH.  My SpO2 was fine, so I know that the issue was my POTS flaring up and that it was the tachy.  I just want to report that it could cause issues with people with dysautonomia, so they don?t freak out if it happens.  My heart rate is still elevated, but is slowly going back down.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

I woke at at 4/5 am Sunday morning, and it hurt to open my eyes, head ache, my whole body hurt every where, breathing made my sides hurt. I had a mild fever on and off. I felt better by Monday late afternoon.   Monday, my arm where I have the injection started to flare up, it was hot, red, was so itchy that I scabbed up from scratching it. This lasted for two days. The days following that it didn&#39;t itch as much, but on occasion the itching would flare up where I felt the need to scratch it intensely. I would say the itching subsided at around 5 days after the shot.

                                                Hit me a little faster - arm was sore and tired when I got home (within an hour); within two hours I had chills but felt hot to touch and a headache. I got under the covers. It hit 99.9 (fever). I slept hard for most of weekend. Arm was really itchy - I had swelling again. I didn&#39;t see a doctor. A couple of days after I got my shot - stomach issues, diarrhea, flu, body aches - those lasted a couple of days by Tuesday. Except the stomach pain lasted about a week. High blood pressure and migraines was having these too. Have struggled with heart palpitations and insomnia at night because blood oxygen level at night is in the low 90&#39;s. Doctor has said to wait a little longer to see if goes away. Metropole - or Toprol was added either right before the second dose or right after second dose of vaccine. Migraines and sleep issues are still an issue - as well as the low blood oxygen level. The symptoms that are typical vaccine related side affects have resolved.

                                                A medical provider and myself already reported an allergic reaction that started about 24-30 hours post vaccination (rash on chest, high blood pressure, feeling unwell, chest tightness). On 3/23 in the afternoon, my right knee started suddenly swelling and became painful. I went to the ER to rule out a blood clot- which was not indicated. It was determined the lymph node in the back of my knee (same side as my shot arm) was swelling due to moderna. I was given naproxen to treat it for one week.

I got my second dose on Friday, March 12 at 1pm and woke up at 2am Saturday  with debilitating headache and severe nausea . I took tylenol and fell back asleep. I woke up again around 6am with the same severe headache and excruciating  pain in my left arm at the injection site and tried to get up to get some ibuprofen. I felt extremely dizzy and could barely walk which ended up in me fainting in the kitchen. I somehow got back to bed, took ibuprofen and went back to sleep. I started feeling better after that, severe headache went away but I had low grade fever, chills, slight nausea and painful arm the whole Saturday up until Sunday morning. I had dizziness on Sunday, was very tired on Monday and still felt weak on Tuesday but after that I recovered and experienced no more symptoms.

                                                Minutes after receiving the shot on Monday, 3/22/2021 at approximately 11:15am, I (F/37yo) felt a very small, but acute tightness/pressure in my upper right chest area. I didn&#39;t initially report it as it was not one of the listed reactions I had read about in the information given to me -- I assumed I was very anxious, maybe breathing nervously, and that it would go away. The next day I felt very fatigued, light-headed, had extreme muscle and joint pain throughout my body, slight nausea, and the injection site (my left arm) was very sore. I took Tylenol and slept.  I felt weak and &#34;off&#34; the whole day. The acute chest pain I felt after the shot had now become less &#34;acute&#34; and turned into a wider and duller general pressure. The next day, Tuesday, I also began feeling intermittent flashes of hot or cold-like patches in my head, which I also consider a part of a general inflammation my body might be having. It is now Thursday, 3/25/2021 and the chest pressure has increased even more, having now spread from the upper right side to include the center of my chest. My headache is still lingering, I still don&#39;t feel like my normal self and feel &#34;off&#34; somehow, and the chest pressure is worrying me because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on internally. I reported the chest pain to my doctor and was told that my exact reactions don&#39;t make any sense in relation to the known adverse reactions to the Moderna COVID vaccine. I was advised to report this here and to also go to an urgent care clinic or emergency room if my symptoms worsen.

At 7:30am (about 19 hours post-injection), I experienced slight numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. I used the restroom and lost consciousness before I could stand up. My husband witnessed my loss of consciousness and reports that I was unconscious for 1-2 minutes. I returned to bed, rested, took a nap, and when I awoke about 1pm (almost 24 hours post-injection), all of my symptoms except fatigue had ceased.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID) and TOPIRAMATE (TOPAMAX) for an unknown indication.   On 04-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, the patient experienced TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird). On 03-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma) and ASTHENIA (Could not get up). On 04-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg) and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine). On 01-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low). At the time of the report, DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg), TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia), DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma), CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg), ASTHENIA (Could not get up), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine), HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Haemoglobin: low gram per litre (Low) LOW. In March 2021, Red blood cell count: low cells per microlitre (Low) LOW.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment informations reported were Levalbuterol tartrate  and Rivaroxaba 20 mg   This case was linked to MOD-2021-059897 (Patient Link).

Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

Progressively, left arm became red, warm to touch, hard, swollen, itchy and painful through the course of the day. It spread rapidly and pain was radiating under left breast, where the lymph nodes are located, behind back/shoulder. The following  day it has spread even further,  down to elbow; numbing/tingling sensation radiating to left pinkie and left ring fingers.   Vital signs: higher than normal systolic BP 130-150s (normal for me:100-110s); tachycardic with HR in 130-140s on the first day of the adverse event, O2 sats normal high 90s to 100% on RA. No fever, highest temp 99.2F.

                                                Employee Recollection: Wednesday and Thursday  felt kind of weak and more tired than normal, but thought nothing of it.  In the early afternoon on Friday the symptoms got worse.   Tired and confused.  I slept through my alarm and woke up to my mom, who was watching my daughter for me, trying to wake me up.  I was very confused, dizzy and weak.  My mom said I was really out of it, and that I had a really hard time focusing on what she was trying to say to me.    When I checked in for work my O2 stats were in the upper 80&#39;s lower 90&#39;s.  My temp was also in the lower 90&#39;s.  That was after numerous attempts at taking my o2 stats and temps.  Co-worker said I was very confused, tired, dizzy and weak.  She said there were times when I was walking that I would reaching for walls and railings to regain my balance.  I left work at 6am Saturday morning.  I went home and went straight to bed.  Slept all day long until a few hours before my shift started at 9:30 P.M.   since then I&#39;ve been feeling better, but my temp and 02 stats are still low.  But I&#39;m continuing to monitor symptoms.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if anything changes.

When I shared this with the pharmasist, she did not offer to take vitals nor seemed concerned.  She suggested that I was experiencing anxiety, and that it was not a typical reaction to the vaccine.  However, each day since vaccine I have continued to have episodes of shortness of breath.  Today, 3 days after the vaccine, I had more shortness of breath than I had since first contracting Covid-19(which was on 10th of Dec).  I also was having to stop walking several times every 5 mins or so in order to catch my breath, feeling weakness and fatigue.  My sense or taste/smell is gone as well. I was so short of breath today, work was worried anough about me they urged me to go home and call my doctor.  I now have a tele-visit set up with my doctor today.

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

                                                On 12/28/2020 at 1930 I had a throbbing HA, nausea, chills, no appetite, body aches, extreme fatigue and low grade fever. Temp was 99.4-100.3. 1 gram of Tylenol was taken that evening, to relieve HA pain. Zofran 4 mg ODT was also taken for nausea. The following morning,  I felt extremely fatigued and had a persistent headache that was not consistently responsive to OTC meds. I developed a fever on 12/29/2020 in the evening. Low grade and ranging 99.3-100.6. Along with fever, my s/s were extreme fatigue, no appetite, headache, body aches, chills. On 12/30/2020, I spiked a Tmax of 101.0 around 11 am. Again, the same s/s were there. I went home from work early.  Same s/s and low grade fever persisted past 7 days, so I called my PCP as well as the Pharmacy where I received the vaccine. On the 10th day after vaccination, I notified my Infectious Disease Dr. He advised me to wait 6 months to 1 year to receive the second injection. He stated that my s/s were likely vaccine related and would go away with time. Fever persists through every day for the month of January 2021, with exact same symptoms. Started to notice Shortness of breath with activity, occasional sharp pain in chest. Presented to ER on 01/09/2021 with chest pain and shortness of breath. Labs revealed Acute Kidney Injury and Transaminitis. Cardiac work-up was performed, all tests negative. I was hypotensive. MD recommended I either get transferred to hospital, or stay in ER for min 23 hours observation for monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure. I received 2 L of Normal Saline. BP eventually began to rise with SBP above 90 and DBP above 40. (Normal BP range for me is 120/60-70&#39;s. Baseline Creatinine is 0.9. Discharged from ER per patient request, after second Creatinine level came down to 1.5. MD advised patient to not return to work for the next 2 business days. Spoke with PCP on 1/11/2021 in AM, and informed him of the events over the weekend. Also informed him that I am still febrile with same symptoms as reported previously. Was told I could not return to work until I was fever free. Was fever free for about 12 hours, until evening of 1/12/2021. MD not allow patient to RTW.

                                                Injection site became red and itchy at 10:30 am the following day, then proceeded to become a raised welt, 2mm high and roughly 2.5 inches in diameter after 24 hours and remained this way for 72 hours.  It was warm to the touch, painful, and itchy.  After 72 hours, welt went down and a small brown bruise remained.  On Thursday, January 14, my heart was racing on and off all day - I was off work and sitting in a calm and relaxed position with no reason for an increased heart rate - my resting heart rate was approx. 112 bpm and remained this way for 4 hours beginning around 1pm.  When changing for bed, I noticed that the welt at the injection site had returned but was doubled in size.   I applied ice to the area and hydrocortisone cream and went to bed.  The welt was still there the following morning (Friday,  January 15) and was slowly decreasing in redness and size.  At 7:30pm on Friday, January 15 I went to express care at the advice of my PCP and was evaluated.  I was told to take Zyrtec and continue to ice the area, apply hydrocortisone cream if I found it helpful, and to report symptoms here.

                                                Begining 2 days after I had the shot, I began having heart palpitations. On 1/19/21 my arm was swollen, red, and warm at the injection site. I am scheduled to see a cardiologist for the heart palpitations on 1/21/21 and I have been prescribed antibiotics to treat cellulitis at the injection site.

                                                38 year old female - healthy with no significant past medical history. Morning of 1/15/21, pt woke up with difficulty speaking  (would be talking and then unable to articulate words which were replaced by grunting sounds) and tingling to her face. No changes to breathing, no numbness/tingling to extremities, equal facial symmetry. Slow onset of symptoms. Pt went to the ED, where she received a CT, MRI (inconclusive reading), lab work reported as normal per pt, EKG and chest x-ray. Symptoms self resolved while in the ED, however MD staff wanted to admit patient for 24 hours of observation and to complete an echocardiogram. Pt left AMA the evening of 1/15/21 due to resolution of symptoms and wanting to follow up with her cardiologist for the echocardiogram. Pt told by MD staff symptoms were likely caused by either TIA, possible reaction to vaccine or migraine presentation (no report of headaches/auras). Plan was to have patient on blood thinners x 30 days then baby Aspirin thereafter. Pt still needing to follow up with PCP and cardiologist for further work up.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

I was released, and went to work the next morning feeling OK. That evening on day eight I got a fever, tachycardia in the 150s, chills. The area on my arm was on fire, red with an area 12 x 9 cm area where the injection was given. My employer made me go back to the ER to have it seen. They prescribed me Benadryl, Pepcid. Fever had stopped.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

Spent a couple hours on a gurney being monitored. My blood pressure (normally low/normal) went up to 170/101. And my heart rate was in the 140s. My oxygen saturation at one point was 82% but I was not having any trouble breathing and was breathing normally. I had a terrible headache and was shaking uncontrollably for about 20 min. Eventually I felt well enough to go to work. About five hours after my shot, I passed out again. I was taken to emergency room. My blood pressure was high and my heart rate was still elevated. They ruled out anything being wrong and eventually sent me home. I had a migraine and fatigue for two days. I felt tired for two weeks. And everything that usually  hurts, hurt extra bad.

                                                About 5-6 days after vaccine injection on 1/15/21, I developed a rash, itching, and pain on the same arm as my injection. It is also warm to the touch. I went to Urgent Care and they think it is cellulitis from the vaccine. I am on Bactrim DS to see if it will help. My blood pressure was low as well, not sure if it&#39;s related but usually by pressure is fine. I had cupping done at the chiropractor on 1/22 on my neck and back, symptoms started later that evening. Not sure if is is a coincidence or not.

                                                Received second COVID vaccine Moderna on Wednesday evening at 6pm.  Later that night, I was a little light-headed and achey, but went to bed. On thursday, my legs and arms were extremely achy. I took Tylenol and Motrin in the morning. It seemed to help some, but continued to feel very achy in my legs. I left work early (I am a pediatrician) on Thursday and went home and just sat and rested.  I felt terrible, but had talked to other colleagues who felt very bad that first day after the shot. Friday morning, I woke up still achy but feeling better overall. I took motrin and Tylenol again on Friday morning. I worked the whole day seeing patients. Was tired, but got thru the workday. At around 6pm, I noticed petechiae rash on my lower legs. The rash started spreading thru the night- up my legs and to my arms. I went to ER. They did order CBC, CMP. Platelets were undetectable- 1 platelet was seen under microscope. CMP was normal.  I was told to go to bigger hospital. I went, My platelets read as 4. I was admitted for two nights. Two doses of IVIG were given and I was put on Decadron 40mg PO daily for 4 days. I had tylenol, benadryl, zofran before the IVIG and after.  I will see Hematology next week for follow up. Platelets yesterday at discharge were 60.  Will be checked frequently for the next few months. ITP= diagnosis. COVID shot was trigger.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart started racing and I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

                                                Since 3am today I?ve had horrible pains in my left arm radiating into my chest and down my left leg.  So bad that it hurts to breathe.  Muscle aches all over, chills, face and body warm to the touch.  All over exhaustion.  I?ve never felt so horrible in my entire life.

                                                Moderna shot #2: About 6-8 hours in, I got the expected serious joint aches, chills, headache, and fever (101F). This lasted for about 2 days, managed well by alternating Motrin and Tylenol. A mild rash occurred a few days after shot #2.   Thought I was done since most of my colleagues bounced back after 2-3 days. Then 48 hours in, I developed a racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools. No position or relaxation method would resolve these symptoms. All I could do was lie down perfectly still with an ice pack on my forehead and hope this was short-lived and would pass. I could not sleep. I had no appetite. Over the 8 days this has been occurring, I lost 3 pounds.  I could not find any literature of anyone else having any cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. It scared me. I have no prior cardiac history and no history of anxiety. I went to the ER. Labwork showed an elevated D-dimer (luckily the CT scan showed NO blood clots), elevated WBC/neutrophils, and low potassium. Thyroid labs (which I had tested a few days later) were normal. The ER assumed the abnormal labs were due to the immune response to the vaccine and referred me to a cardiologist.   I did a virtual visit with the cardiologist the next day. He suggested a heart monitor and scheduling an echo. The heart monitor was mailed to me. I started wearing it on 2/4/21 (3 days ago). I am supposed to wear it for 7 days and then mail it back. My echo is scheduled for 3/4/21. Again, I have had no previous cardiac history. I am an active, healthy 38 y/o F.   These symptoms (racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools) have continued to last for another 8 days and are debilitating. I have not been able to work.   On day 7 of these symptoms, I called my PCP?s emergency line. They suggested calling the cardiologist to see if they would consider prescribing a beta blocker for symptomatic relief. I called the cardiologist last night. They prescribed Metoprolol. I haven?t taken it yet. It?s officially day 8. I thought I was in the clear and had not had symptoms since last night, but then just now another episode of these cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms have occurred but less intense than previously.   At this point, I have had had 10 days of symptoms post Moderna vaccine #2 but 8 of those days are specifally the cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. Although a little better, these symptoms have NOT resolved and continue.  I realize I am probably an outlier in terms of how I have reacted to this vaccine. I would love a call back to know if other people have had a similar experience, so I can understand if this is ?normal.? I understand 7% of patients in the Moderna vaccine trial had ?symptoms? lasting longer than 7 days. Were they symptoms similar to mine? Will this go away completely? Any help is appreciated.   Of note, I did develop a nice rash below my injection site on Moderna shot #1. Does that mean I?m more ?reactogenic? and would potentially have a harder time with shot #2? Does size matter in how you will react? Moderna is 100 mcg (instead of Pfizer?s 30 mcg) I am petite (5?2? and am now 106 lbs since I?ve lost weight).

I started getting really cold and began shivering and had GI discomfort. At the 20&#43; minute mark I went to get the nurse. She returned with BP cuff and pulse ox, BP was elevated as was pulse. I continued to have waves of feeling weak, shaky and sick but nurse said I should go home an lie down at the hour mark. Once home my throat felt really dry and strange, I had a BM, laid in bed about 20 more minutes and decide decided I wanted to get check out. Went to ER and was seen ~3 hours after vaccine. BP and heart rate were still both up. I still felt nauseated, dizzy and cold. I was given Meclizine and Zofran. BP retuned closer to normal after about 40 mins and I was released, feeling better but fatigued.

                                                8 mins after the shot my throat started burning, heart pounding, shaking uncontrollably, throat felt like it was sticking together, dizzy, lost all my color, hives, tunnel vision, kept almost passing out. Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

The second day, I also had  body aches.  It&#39;s been about 3  weeks and I have some pain on my back and chest. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s related. l seemed to have it after the vaccine.  I also feel out of breath often.  I am now fearful of getting the second vaccine,  since the first one was so bad for me.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

                                                Patient received a COVID vaccination for her second dose on 3/3/21 at 1538.  She had informed the staff of the clinic that she did have a local reaction following her first dose (9days later) that she saw her PCP for. This was just treated with Zyrtec and no further intervention.  At 25 minutes following her second dose PA noticed that the patient appeared flushed.  He checked with the patient and she said she was ok.  A few minutes later noticed the patient was even more flushed.  At that time went and evaluated the patient - her BP was elevated 150/94 HR of 112 ad Pulse ox of 96%.  The patient reported feeling different than how she felt after her previous injection.  Clinic team offered for patient to be transferred to ER for further evaluation if she would like which the patient accepted.  She was transferred to ER via wheelchair in less than 5 minutes in stable condition with mild nausea.  She was cared for in ER by Dr.  Patient reported feeling tired and &#39;heavy&#39; in the ER.  Dr evaluation found a generally healthy patient with a non-toxic appearance  Lungs were clear and no obvious signs of swelling or other signs of an immediate allergic reaction.  Patient was given oral diphenhydramine and observed until she felt comfortable going home.  Discharged from ER at 1733

                                                Felt migrating heat/burning sensations off an on to the left arm after first vaccination which would come and go. After the first vaccine my heart rate elevated for about a minute with pounding, which I was evaluated for and then it subsided.  Two weeks after vaccination, a burning sensation returned to my left arm (where I had been vaccinated) and the sensation would come and go for the following two weeks. After my menses, I noticed that I started to feel hot sensations to both of my upper arms, which I then noticed to my upper back and neck. I questioned whether I should get the second vaccine and was not sure where the symptoms were coming from. I have never experienced anything like this before. I questioned if it was an anxiety symptom. I had the second vaccine and my right index finger and thumb briefly went numb, my heart rate elevated for a couple of minutes and then subsided.  The burning sensations  then became worse and the burning became so intense that it kept me up at night. Sensations have since also been felt to my low back, sides of hips and down the legs. I had an acupuncture treatment and was started on herbs which helped significantly so I could sleep. I also established a visit with an MD to explain my symptoms and was told to come back in a few days to have labs drawn.  The symptoms have not gone away. These sensations affect my work as I am a healthcare provider and need the use of my hands.  It has now been over two weeks and my symptoms have not gone away. Now I have migrating sensations that move all over my body which elicit a feeling of burning.  It seems that the sensations become worse as the day goes on and that they are not as prominent in the morning.

                                                Mar 5-2:30pm: arm began to feel sore. Mar6-12:00am  I can barely lift my left arm above chest level. The soreness has traveled from the injection site down to my wrist and fingers. The injection site is slightly pink, not really noticeable, and warm to the touch. I start to feel a little nauseous and also starting to get body aches and chills. From 12:00am-4:00am i constantly wake up because of arm soreness and body aches. At 4:00am, I woke up  to use the restroom and realized even the bottom of my feet hurt with every step I took. Took my temperature and it was at 101.5.  I went back to bed and fell asleep even though I kept waking. At 7:00am, the migraine started. I was trying to avoid taking meds just to be able to get a clear picture of how my body responds to the vaccine, But by 9:30am (22hrs post vaccine) I ended up taking Tylenol for severe migraine. It feels like someone is stabbing my temples with a very sharp object. Turning or even slightly moving my head strengthens the migraine. My arm is still so sore that I can barely move it!  Tylenol brings temperature down to 100.7°. 10:30am I began with extreme fatigue. By 12:30pm I went back to bed because I couldn?t stand my body aches and migraine. I slept until 4:00pm woke up feeling a little better. Migraine was still there but not as bad. At 8:00pm I began to feel pressure on my chest. That pressure slowly turned into pain. By 9:20pm I was in excruciating pain, I was in tears and I literally thought I was going to die. It hurt to breath. I checked into the ER by 9:30pm the pain was sharp and it would come, last a few minutes, then slowly ease off a bit. On a scale of 1-10 if was definitely a TEN!!!! The ER said it wasn?t cardiac so they sent me home. The DR did say that the chest pain could have possibly been caused by the vaccine, as many have seen different symptoms and everyone has reacted differently. I was home by 1:15am. The pains continued until 3:00am. By 8:30am on Sunday Mar 7, the only thing I was suffering from was soreness in the arm and my chest was sore from the pain. The pain in my chest was a 1 or 2 compared to the 10 that it was when I went to the ER, And that pain/discomfort has lingered all day.  I?m currently 22weeks 4days pregnant with a boy and expected to deliver July 7th. I?ve been pregnant 19 times have 4 living children and suffered 14miscarriages.

While I was there, I was given Tramodal of pain observed for several hours then told that my impending facial paralysis was just a allergic reaction to the shot, to take Tylenol and Motrin for pain. For 2 more days my face continued to swell and I suffered in pain , I went back to the urgent care , where I was provided something for the ?supposed allergic reaction? pain and to help with the swelling, well a few days  the new meds t last Thursday my mouth gushed with this fluid of Blood and puss mixed , very thick. I went back to the urgent care and they could not tell if this was coming from my jaw or my gum( also I have braces only on my top teeth and I went to the orthodontist the same day I received the shot, I go every for weeks) I was given more meds to take with the ones that I was already prescribed and told to contact my orthodontist because even though my face has gone down I have a hard knot in it that possibly holds infection.

                                                I received the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 01:49 pm. Approximately 4.5 hours later on January 6, 2021, I went outside in the cold temperatures. Upon returning inside to warmer air, the bilateral fingertips of both hands were pale white, numb, and painful. The time was 06:30 pm on January 6, 2021. At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.  January 6, 2021 at 06:32 pm was the first time I have ever had my hands respond in this manner to cold temperatures. I have felt one fingertip go numb and turn white for a split second, only one time in my life but it was not a repeat occurrence, and it only lasted for about a second when it occurred. This experience and reaction I currently have lasts from 15-30 minutes of bilateral fingertip numbness and discoloration with pain. The bilateral fingertips of both hands now respond in this manner every time they are exposed to cold temperatures. I signed up for V-Safe and did state that I was having this symptom through the Vaccine reporting system on V-Safe under ?other&#39;&#39; multiple times. Treatment I received from a health provider are as follows; I had a telemedicine visit on January 14, 2021 at 12:51 pm to address my concern of ?reaction to Covid vaccine, fingertips were numb, lasting 30 mins?. On 1/14/2021, I received a primary diagnosis of Raynaud&#39;s Syndrome by my Primary Care Provider.  On 1/28/2021, I was seen in person by my Primary Care Provider for a Well Visit to complete a physical with my primary care provider. I was provided with a referral to a Rheumatologist for further advice about receiving the additional second Covid vaccination in the series. I also was ordered to do lab work. On 2/2/2021, I was seen by a Rheumatologist for new diagnosis of Raynaud?s Syndrome, and advised that risk outweighed the benefits in regards to receiving the second vaccination in the Moderna Covid-19 series.

                                                The day after the vaccine all day I had a weird scary feeling in my chest which was the same feeling I got right when a nurse in 2017 pushed Ancef into my IV and then seconds later I had an anaphylactic reaction.  That day after the vaccine I was very lethargic, lightheaded and nauseous that whole day, but then felt fine the following day.  13 days after my 2nd dose of the vaccine I woke up with urticaria all over my body.  Every day since then I have urticaria that gets worse at night and early morning.  Last night I developed angioedema of my upper lip along with severe urticaria covering my whole body.  I took 50 mg of Benadryl and a Zyrtec and when woke up this morning, the urticaria was mostly gone, but I still have the angioedema, which has lasted all day today.  I have no other symptoms currently.

I am on a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) which reads my bloodsugars every 5 minutes. That device prevented me from going into diabetic ketoacidosis, however I was unable to get my bloodsugars below 300 for almost a 24 hour period after receiving the vaccine. Insulin boluses and increased basal amounts of 95% increases were ineffective.

Another 15 minutes or so later it had become hard to swallow, I was given another 25mg dose of Benadryl. After the second dose  it became hard to breathe, started coughing and chest started to hurt. I didn?t realize but had broke out in sweat. Nurse checked my eyes. Called paramedics and had epi pen ready. I thought a third dose of Benadryl had been administered but that I am not certain of. Blood pressure was higher than my usual but still considered normal (113/82 I think?) pulse was 120 something, at rest I am usually at 70. I became lightheaded. Paramedics did an ekg, it was normal. They monitored me while I stabilized. Was released when pulse was in the 80?s range. Residual chest pain after. 8 days after vaccination I broke out in sweat and became nauseous. Vomited. I then noticed below the vaccination injection (still bruised) and around where last dose of Benadryl was injected there was a large red welp, hot to the touch. The heat eventually went away but the welp remained a few days. 11 days after vaccination is when the cluster headache appeared. Shortness of breath was noticeable on day 12. Day 14 fever and nasal congestion with slight irritation in throat, occasional cough. Day 15 sore throat, coughing progressed (non productive) in to fits that led to vomiting. It is day 18 and shortness of breath is present at rest, chest pain, rash near injection site and bruise is still present. Temp has been low grade fever, hadn?t gone above 100. Normal is 96.9/97.1 for me. Oddly day 13 (the day before fever became present) my temp was lower than usual 95.6/95.7 yet I wasn?t cold.

I had a syncopal event and my partner found me unconscious on the bathroom floor.  When I fainted I hit my forehead causing a large hematoma.  I also got a laceration on my chin about 2 inches across.   I hit my right cheek as well but no skin was broken just a big bruise.  The chin laceration required stitches.  I have never fainted in my life.  All the medications I am currently taking I have been on for years.

                                                got her first Moderna COVID19 vaccination on Wednesday 03/10/2021. She had no immediate problems with the shot such as arm pain or any other concerns, but by the next day 03/11/2021 she woke feeling very exhausted. They were having tests, and she is one of the main people in charge of this, so she just wrote it off as a reaction to stress. However as the day went on she was feeling worse including low-grade chronic headache, nausea, intermittent palpitations and waves of dizziness. She even had a little anxiety attack, thus she went home Thursday afternoon. She forced herself to go back to school the next day, knowing that if she could get through that day, she&#39;d have a whole week off for spring break. Unfortunately, despite decreased stress, she continued to feel poorly. She has a feeling of profound fatigue, constant headache at the base of the skull that Tylenol really doesn&#39;t touch, nausea, stomach rumbling, intermittent dizziness, and intermittent palpitations.  Not surprisingly, her anxiety has increased, so she started sertraline 25 mg one half tab on Tuesday 03/16/2021, and on Saturday 03/20/2021 she increased it to a full tab. Now taking PharmaGABA at night to keep the anxiety and heart racing down.

I caught her and had her lay down for 5 minutes. Afterwards, she felt better to sit down, and then we checked her BP. Her BP reading was 75/46 mmHg. She stated she was feeling waves of faintness. We called ambulance about 10 minutes after her BP reading. Patient was still laying with her head resting at her side. After taking another BP reading, it came out to be about 98/70 mmHg. Patient stated she was feeling slightly better. Ambulance arrived about 10 minutes later and advised her to go with them to confirm she was doing okay.

I went to urgent care and the PA was unable to diagnose what caused the lump or what the lump was.  On 12-31-20 and 1-04-21 had nose bleeds. Nose bleeds are not a normal occurrence for me and I emailed my NP for further treatment options.  No response yet.

Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath. Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

                                                I developed a sore throat, cough and chest congestion a day after. On 1/17/21, my left arm developed red lumpy spotting around the injection site that is hot to touch. I feel tingling sensation shooting down my left arm and some loss of feeling in my left pinky. I&#39;ve been taking benadryl that that has helped decrease the red lumpiness and swelling.

Within 20 minutes I was experiencing further shortness of breath, shakiness, and lip numbness and swelling. I received the vaccine through my workplace.  I called the employee health line who recommended that I stay with someone else until the symptoms resolved and for not less than an hour.  It took 2 hours for symptoms to resolve.  I also followed up with my primary care regarding my reaction.

As I was leaving after 15 minutes I mentioned it to the person checking me out. At this time we noticed redness and hives starting at the injection site. I was told to sit for another 15 minutes but as soon as I sat down again the hives spread rapidly and I began to have dizziness and confusion. At this point I was taken to the ER and on the way I started having nausea and my throat started burning and felt tight. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and solumedrol and IM epinephrine. Since discharge I had one instance of hive and facial swelling and continued to take Benadryl for two days. I am now having episodes of shortness of breath and tachycardia.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine last Thursday (1/14/21) at clinic and had a pretty severe reaction within a few minutes of the receiving the vaccine. I didn?t alert anyone because I wasn?t sure if it was related to the vaccine or not. I felt hot suddenly, then very dizzy/faint, then experienced very bad tinnitus and couldn?t hear any of the words being spoken around me, just muffled sounds. I felt slightly nauseous, was seeing spots, and felt very close to fainting. My pulse was racing. I did deep breathing  until it subsided (which was about 10 minutes later). For the next 5 days after the vaccine, I experience extreme soreness and weakness in the left arm where the injection was given. I also had redness and itching and it was hot to the touch and slightly swollen. I had extreme fatigue and a headache and a loss of appetite. After 5 days, those subsided. 1 week after the vaccine (01/21/21),  I experienced intense itching at the injection site and redness and it was hot to the touch. I also experienced intense itching on my chin and skin numbness in that area of my chin. The chin area resolved after about 4 hours. The arm itching did not resolved. i woke up on 01/22/21 with the entire left shoulder area swollen, red, hot to the touch, and extremely itchy. it lasted all day. I woke up on 01/23/21 and the swelling had gone down, but the redness spread to a larger area on the upper left arm and the itching persisted all day. I woke up on 01/24/21 and the redness and swelling was almost gone but the itching was still there and the area that had swollen up felt very bruised, but no visible bruising. Today (01/25/21) there is no more itching or redness but the bruised sensation continues.

No shortness of breath (apart from discomfort due to the tightness). I did not have any other symptoms at that time (e.g. fevers, cough, muscle/body aches). Over the next 5-6 days, the tightness moved progressively upwards into my upper chest, then my lower esophagus, then into my neck before spontaneously resolving.

Upon returning to work in the pharmacy, she sat down at her desk and noted her HR to be 159 via her Apple watch. She felt slightly lightheaded, so returned to  Auditorium for monitoring. On arrival, she complained only of high HR, no other symptoms. We checked her VS: BP 140/78, HR 132, RR 20, SaO2 94. She denied chest pain or SOB. We monitored her for about 15 minutes, and her HR decreased to 103-110. We monitored her for another 15 minutes or so, at which time her HR spiked again to 132, and she felt heavy in her chest and tight in her throat. At that point, we moved her to a gurney and called a Rapid Response. We administered 50mg of Benadryl IM per protocol, foregoing the Epinephrine, due to her tachycardic state. The Rapid Response team arrived and she was transported to the ED for evaluation. She maintained consciousness and was A&amp;Ox3 the entire time.

I called the cardiologist and she was not surprised and said I could take double the dose of my meds for 1-2 days and to do the same on the second dose. I felt much better the next day.   Appx 8 days after the injection I developed a 2 in halo of inflamed skin, redness, and itchiness. I took Benadryl and it improved but returned today (day 9). It is mild and I will continue to watch this. It is similar to my flu shot reaction though delayed one week rather than immediate.

Transferred pt to stretcher. Pt endorses that she did have breakfast this morning. Felt slightly nervous about getting the vaccine but not overly anxious.    Vitals taken: BP 95/59, HR 75, O2 99%. Rapid response called. Rapid response nurse arrived at bedside.    Repeat vitals, taken approximately 5 minutes apart:  BP 109/63, HR 96, O2 99% BP 109/63, HR 97, O2 99% BP 114/77, HR 108, O2 99% BP 101/70, HR 99, O2 100% BP 106/62, HR 97, O2 100%   Pt given juice with some improvement in symptoms.

ED MD notes: &#34;MDM, ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Overall well-appearing 39 year female experiencing lightheadedness after vaccination.  She has no other signs or symptoms to suggest an acute allergic reaction.  This may be vasovagal.  Plan for urine pregnancy test and EKG, consider IV fluids.  Patient prefers not to undergo testing unless completely necessary.  We decided to obtained orthostatic vital signs and if patient is symptomatic and/or showing significant changes in blood pressure or pulse with positional change, then will proceed with limited workup for near syncope.   DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES O2 sat interpretation: normal on RA Equivocal orthostats - HR incr w/ standing but so did BP. Pt states she&#39;s feeling better, tolerating po. Again denies poss pregnancy. Prefers to go home. OK to dc, close return precautions.     IMPRESSION: Dizziness. Adverse medication (vaccination) reaction, not allergy.&#34;

My lips were getting numb. I was confused and unable to participate in a work phone call I answered.  12:45 I began driving as I felt a little better. Drove 2 miles and pulled over to park and wait it out. Heart still racing, hives still present, chest pains still there and could not inhale deeply.  12:50 I drove the rest of the way home. I took a double dose of liquid Benadryl and laid down waiting for symptoms to pass. They slowly resolved over the next 6 hours.  It is now 1/30/21 and I still feel like crap, but not allergy wise. More like the flu.

Overnight, I was awoken by continued shooting  pains all over my body, and also fine shaking.  Around 2AM a headache started and progressed to be the worst headache of my life.  It was received in the morning by tylenol.  In the morning, I experienced extreme exhaustion and dizziness after climbing stairs I almost passed out, had to rest on the floor.  Later in the day I experienced hours of chills, a temp to 103, which came down with tylenol. By the evening I was feeling well but tired.  Today, 2 days after vaccination, I have neck soreness and am a little tired but well.

Got light headed. Blood Pressure - sky high; Started throwing up immediately. I had chills; fever 102.3 - all in a matter of twenty minutes from taking shot. They took me to the ER and was there all day Saturday and Sunday morning for observation (wasn&#39;t admitted officially) and I was able to go home. I had had COVID in the past  - April 19, 2020 and so they thought that&#39;s why I had a reaction to the shot. After three days, I felt fine. My arm was still hurting but I was fine. I missed work for those three days. I had developed a cough (within  a couple hours of the vaccine) and it went to a dry cough three or four hours after the shot. ; fever; chills -felt like I had when I had COVID. They told that since the vaccine had potassium in it - that my body went into shock because my body was so low in potassium.

                                                The patient was received their 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid -19 vaccine at 1:28pm and the patient was instructed to stay in the pharmacy waiting area for 30 minutes due to history of asthma and egg allergy. After sitting for 10 minutes, the patient approached the pharmacy saying they were dizzy and experiencing pressure on their chest. The chest pressure escalated in severity and it became painful for the patient to breathe. Paramedics were called and after evaluating the patient, they decided the patient needed to be seen for further evaluation and the patient was transported to a health facility

EMT alerted.  Heart rate was at 150 bpm with high blood pressure. Hives/rash were visible on chest and face. Ambulance was called. Given IV of Benadryl on ambulance. Taken to ER where given more Benadryl, steroids and anti nausea meds. Symptoms came back mildly 6 hours later. Self administered Benadryl at that point.

                                                I had previous anaphylaxis events that were treated and did not require hospitalization. I brought epinephrine pen and premedicated with Xyzal 5mg 9 hours before and Benadryl 25mg 1.5 hours before vaccine. 20 minutes after vaccine I felt flushing, nausea, low blood pressure. They had released me from the drive through vaccination site and I was driving and felt panicky, so I pulled over. I waited 10 minutes because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anaphylaxis or not. I felt OK after 10 minutes, so I drove to nearest ER and waited in parking lot several hours then drove home. I probably should have administered epinephrine and called 911 when I had that reaction. Continued with 25mg Benadryl every 4 hours and nightly Xyzal 5mg. The next morning (24 hours later)  I woke up scratching my face. I had a diffuse sandpaper rash all over my head and neck and was very itchy. Doubled my dose of Benadryl to 50mg every 4 hours. Also took 400mg of quercetin. The itching resolved and the rash was gone the next day, which was 48 hours after vaccine. I was fatigued for several days but fatigue is my baseline as a narcoleptic plus I was taking benadryl. I continued the Benadryl for a total of 4 days. I normally do not develop rashes unless I rub against hay and I did not have any contact with hay.

I was in the middle of treating a PT. Scratchy throat; mild cough; persistent moderate headache; runny nose; diarrhea; very pale. Never had a fever. I had weird neurological side affects (didn&#39;t lose taste or smell  ) issues with facial recognition - didn&#39;t recognize my own face and finding words for every day objects and making sentences was difficult . I was easily winded and had tightness in my lungs. I called Public Health office - and asked them what to do. She told me to go home. Dr  (telehealth visit) told me to take a test in the parking lot that day for COVID January 6. Treatment  - none. All o f my symptoms lasted until Friday January 8 except being winded and fatigued. Those last two symptoms lasted until January 19.  Verbal issues also lasted until the 19th of January. Facial recognition came back around January 12.  On January 27 I had second dose.

After 5 minutes she felt warm and her heart was racing.  After 3 more minutes her muscles started contracting and she was nonresponsive and was trying to throw herself out of her chair.  I gave her an epipen injection in her left leg.  After 30- 60 seconds she was calming down and was becoming responsive again.  911 was called and she left with emergency personnel.

Awoke dehydrated, extreme muscle weakness unable to walk or stand, light headed, nauseous, dizzy, unable to grip or exert force. Felt like head was detached from body due to extreme pressure on neck. Rapid resting heart rate in 90s (usual testing HR in 50s).   Constant rolling waves of abdominal cramps brought dizziness with each cramp, acid reflux, bloating and gas.  These symptoms lasted through the evening of the 3rd into the 4th. Considered going to ER for help, as extreme dizziness and muscle weakness prevented walking. Fell asleep.  6am March 4th developed fever of 101. Continued extreme dizziness, pressure on neck, muscle weakness and feeling faint and extreme lethargy throughout day.  Fever subsided to 99 by evening of 4th.  Ate plain rice evening of 4th, 1st time eating in over 48hrs. Immediately passed out.  Match 5th still feeling weak, hard to stand, limited walking. Diarrhea has subsided, less pressure on neck and less dizziness. Feeling exhausted overall. Fall asleep easily and randomly.

About 6 I started to feel tired with a headache. About 8 pm my throat started to feel itchy. Next day I woke up with my chest feeling tight with a cough and phlegm. I thought it was just a side affect of vaccine and took my inhaler. On Saturday I woke up with a bad migraine and my chest still hurting. I knew something was wrong. I went to urgent care. I had ekg and X-ray and Covid test done. The ekg numbers came back low so dr requested a CT. My results came back as me having Covid in my left lung. Covid testing came back positive the next day. Prior to vaccine I did not feel sick or have any symptoms of being sick.

Around 5PM I started having chills, cold sweats, muscle soreness, nausea, and vomiting. My arm was so sore i could not lift it al all. At some point around 9PM I passed out on my bathroom floor. My 6 year old found me and thought I had died and called her father crying hysterically. I think I was passed out for a few hours before I came too, as my child had the phone on speaker and her and my husband were both yelling at me to wake up. I crawled back to bed and went to sleep.  The next morning 2/4/21, I could hardly move to get my daughter ready for school, I had to call out of work. I was still having  chills, cold sweats, muscle soreness, nausea, and vomiting, headache, and I could hardly move my left arm.  on 2/5/21 I was still very tired, still had nausea, and a headache. 2/6/21 - 2/7/21 I still had a slight headache.  on 2/8/21 I felt better and went to work.

                                                Immediately following the administration of the vaccine on Thursday, I tasted a metallic taste.  Within 5 mins I began to having a racing heart and flushed skin.  On my drive home approximately 15-20 minutes following the administration of the vaccine, I began feeling very flushed, continued racing heart, and had a lot of difficulty swallowing.  I tried to push water even though it was difficult to swallow.  Upon getting home I continued to feel these symptoms along with fatigue.  I laid down to rest after feeling extremely fatigued.  30 minutes later I woke up (this is approximately 1 hour - 1.5 hours after the vaccine administration) with a rash all over my chest, my neck and face.  Additionally, the left side of my neck was extremely swollen.  The lymph node on the left side was sticking out about the size of a golf ball.  I continued to have all these symptoms along with then extreme nausea, hot/cold flashes, and flu-like symptoms.   I took three Advil at this time.  These symptoms continued onto the morning (Friday).  In the morning, I still had the rash and swollen neck, so being worried, I took Benedryl and contacted my doctor and sent him pictures of my allergic reaction.  By Sunday, the swelling in my neck and other symptoms subsided.  The doctor returned my message on Monday and instructed me to report this via this form and advised me not to get the second shot, as it looks like  I had a severe allergic reaction to the first vaccine.  He advised me at that time that if I was still having symptoms I should go to the ER.  I no longer was having those symptoms, so I did not go to the ER immediately.

I felt like crap afterwards and stayed the full 30 minutes too. I had thought maybe it was anxiety, but I&#39;ve broken out all over in hives and I can barely talk now due to how hoarse my throat is. I felt off very quickly post vax and like I was drunk or something after my injection. I have had a high pulse, palpitations, bad headache, jitters, lightheaded/ dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling like I have to constantly swallow (and do), and other post vax issues. I have felt very out of it and overall very cruddy.    I hope you&#39;ll respond to this email so that I know it gets reported.  I have taken a lot benadryl and have an EpiPen handy if I ended up needing it. My mouth has been fine, but not my throat.. but it isn&#39;t closing up so I think it&#39;s okay for it to just be swollen. I have had so much going on post vax that I&#39;ve literally just been laying in bed hoping I&#39;ll feel better.   03/12/2021 The hives have come back and the itching hasn&#39;t ever stopped, my tongue is still super swollen and sore from me constantly accidentally biting it, my throat is still red, swollen, and sore, and I generally feel like crap. I&#39;m taking a ton of antihistamines to combat this and they&#39;re not touching it. I am probably going to need more steroids and a visit to urgent care tomorrow.  :(  03/13/2021  The email is too large with the new pics and it got kicked back...trying again minus the body hive pics.   The hives just keep spreading  :( . I know you can&#39;t see them all because the lighting isn&#39;t great, but you can make out the outlines of the welts like on my forehead. I have hives all over my face, throat, neck, chest, arms, and more every day. My whole body is very itchy even in areas without hives.    I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist&#39;s office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I&#39;ve never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I&#39;m going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can&#39;t take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that&#39;s if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I&#39;m already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t update.  I&#39;m still dealing with hives, but they&#39;re getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called (like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a PAC, PVT, but I do know I&#39;ve had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I&#39;m so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I&#39;ve been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she&#39;s having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I&#39;m passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the &#34;moderna arm.&#34;  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it&#39;s coming back in full force! I&#39;m still taking allergy meds too! This is just crazy!

                                                Patient began experiencing pain and difficulty walking on Tuesday, March 23. Later that afternoon she was taken to an Urgent care, who sent her to the ER for evaluation. She was diagnosed with a very large blood clot in her leg, spanning from just above the knee to her groin area. They admitted her and began treating her with blood thinners.  While undergoing that treatment, her heart stopped 3 times and she had to be resuscitated. They discovered a pulmonary embolism.  While removing a large clot from her lungs, the doctor found that her lungs were riddled with hundreds of tiny blood clots. They also said that she was bleeding internally, very heavily, from an unknown location. In all, they gave her 20 units of blood, and none of it stayed in her veins. The doctor said it seemed to just disintegrate.  At that point, her brain and organs had begun shutting down and family made the decision to remove her from life support. She passed away Thursday evening, March 25, 2021.
