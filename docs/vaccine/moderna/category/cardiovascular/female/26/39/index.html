                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

                                                It was noted during injection a tremendous amount of pain/stinging/burning that lasted a few minutes. About 20 minutes post injection, numbness/tingling noted in pinky/5th finger radiating down palm to wrist on same arm as injection as well as dizziness. Notified observation RNs and moved to a separate room. Mildly elevated BP but normal HR noted. No rash/hives/difficulty breathing. Numbness and tingling would migrate - most often to thumb but sometimes up entire arm. Released 1 hour after injection after no life threatening signs noted.  Visited PCP the next day (1/6) at 10:15. Professional opinion that it is due to swelling from injection - now noticeable area of swelling around injection site. Recommended ice and NSAIDs.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Dec 2020 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: OU520A/011520A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.     On 23 Dec 2020, within minutes of receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction and was rushed to the emergency room (ER). When transported to the ER she began to experience throat swelling, redness of arms and chest, trouble breathing with lower chest pain shooting into lungs, and numbness with tingling in her right arm. Treatment for the event included epinephrine, steroids, and diphenhydramine.  She was released from the ER on 23 Dec 2020.  On 24 Dec 2020 patient awoke with a headache, fatigue, and generalized itchiness. Treatment for the event included ibuprofen and diphenhydramine.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, anaphylactic reaction, right arm numbness and tingling, were reported as resolved on 23 December 2020. The events of headache, fatigue, and generalized itchiness were considered resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 26-year-old female patient who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot OU520A/011520A), and who experienced the unlisted events of anaphylactic reaction, right arm numbness and tingling, and generalized itchiness, and the listed events of headache and fatigue.  The events were considered to be possibly related to the vaccine due to the temporal relationship with onset on the day of vaccination.

                                                Saturday- felt fine for a Couple of hours after vaccine. Felt fatigued around 4 PM, laid down, lost ability to move arm, extreme pain in neck.  Sunday- more of the same throughout the day. At night when I took a shower the pain moved over the course of a few minutes in the shower from my arm to my lower back. Arm was fine, Lower back pain bad enough that I was limping.  Monday- woke up &amp; pain was evenly dispersed between lower back and head. Slight soreness in arm and neck. Took extra strength ibuprofen because I had to work. Totally fine for the rest of the day time. At night my arm and neck started to become very sore again. After I ate dinner I developed a very intense fever, chills/ shakes, my arm felt like it had a heartbeat and my heart was racing. Laid in bed all night. Felt scared and disturbed that this was happening days after the vaccine. Considered going to the hospital but I couldn?t move. Slept for 10 hours.  Tuesday (today)- feeling almost all better aside from slight pain in neck.

Then on day 4 a dull chest discomfort started again which I have had every since (now on day 8 post vaccine).  When i woke up on day 8 post vaccine I noticed left deltoid swelling and tenderness in the arm that I received the vaccine a week ago. I only had arm swelling for 1-2 days post vaccine and then another onset on day 8 (1/20/21). Also have some left armpit tenderness 3 days ago.

Later that morning I was light headed, fatigued, sore throat, nausea. The fever continued to increase. By 2200 that day my fever was 104.7 and that was with Tylenol on board. I also iced my groins and axillary areas to help cool my body. Today is the second day out from the vaccine and I have recovered from the fevers. My fever early this morning was still 102.5 but has since passed and I am normothermic. I am very fatigued with some chest pains.

                                                I am not sure if the event that happened Sunday was directly related to the vaccine at all since it happened two days later, or if it was just a coincidence, or if the vaccine was just a physical stimulus trigger. I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

At approximately 1:00 AM, I started experiencing a fever (101.3 F), chills, aches, and some heart palpitations. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen, which helped to reduce the fever and chills.  When I woke up, I was nauseous, had a serious headache, fatigue, minor chills, a fever (101.3 F) and more noticeable heart palpitations (when measured with my smartwatch, it reported bpm of 118-124). I had a virtual consult with a physician who advised me to be seen by urgent care immediately.

                                                Experienced an increase in heart rate from 10 p.m. on 1/26/2021 for approximately 24 hours. According to the data on my fitness band, my heart rate averaged at 130 bpm during sleep and rest, and was approximately 170 bpm when standing despite taking metoprolol succinate. I usually take 12.5mg of the metoprolol, and took another 12.5 mg the morning of 01/27/2021, which seemed to help with the increase in heart rate. Despite normally experiencing an increase in heart rate due to my diagnosis of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia, my heart rate usually drops into the 60&#39;s at night and during the day if I am moving, is about 120-130 bpm. Additionally on 01/28/2021, I had difficulty standing due to feeling faint and dizzy upon standing. All symptoms appeared to resolve by 01/29/2021. Besides taking extra medication, I spent the day resting and hydrating with water.

                                                Roughly 10 hours after receiving the 2nd Moderna covid vaccine my hand turned red and swollen bilaterally and from the 2nd knuckle down to the end of the fingers they were completely pale and the nails began turning blue. The change in color was a very defined straight line border. It was not painful and there was no numbness or tingling. I had not been outside or done anything involving a change of temperature. Along with my second dose I also experienced severe chills/shivering , nausea, sweating, fatigue, and body aches. These also happened with the first dose. The change in color to my hands lasted about 2 hours. There does not seem to be any lingering issues since then.

Both symptoms seemed to have faded before I left the monitoring area. Proceeded to drive home (20 minute drive) and nausea returned, as well as increasing pressure and pain in chest. I decided to turn around and go back to the urgent care clinic. Arrived back at clinic by 0900am. Pressure in chest had receded but there was still some aching/occasional sharp chest pains and nausea. Clinic referred me to the ED for further workup. Most symptoms had stopped by 1000am when I went to the ED.

As soon as I felt queezy I passed out. I woke up they said within about 30 seconds and had full body sweats. Stomach ache, dizzy and head was tingly like I would pass out again. My calfs hurt like they had previously had muscle cramps. I went to ER, blood and urine tests were fine, heart and blood pressure was fine. Dr said he did not believe it was an allergic reaction, and that it was a stress response. I am not sure if it is because I had COVID in December.

At 2:00 pm, I tried to sit up in my bed - I proceeded to throw up and faint. I contacted doctor to see if I should take anything. I took an ibuprofen and drank fluid - but didn&#39;t drink as much as normal because of nausea. I was nauseated all day. It stayed about 102 until about 8:00 pm. At about 10:00 pm that night, I started feeling a bit better. The next day fever was 99.7 and with more ibuprofen it normalized to 98.6. If I didn&#39;t take ibuprofen for awhile it went back up to 99. something so I had to keep taking ibuprofen for the rest of that third day. Fourth day - mild fatigue and muscle aches. Everything was normal other than that. Fatigue and muscle aches were gone about Friday morning.

                                                Around 6 pm I got a severe headache, very bad body aches, trouble breathing, and a very fast heart rate. I felt faint and had cold sweats so I went to ER after work. The ER doctor gave me fluids, a vial of tylenol through IV, and just observed me to make sure my heart rate and blood pressure came down. They said it sounded like a normal reaction. Fever of 101. I am getting a MRI of my brain on Tuesday 3/9/21 for continued severe headaches.

D/c on steroid dose pack, beta blockers, cough suppressant. Follow up with cardio and pulm. Now seeing immunologist as well who started me on corticosteroid inhaler, monteleukast. Running more blood work soon. PCP gave albuterol inhaler, did round of antibiotics, orders to use incentive spirometer for breathing capacity. Waiting on pulmonology follow up and 30 day holter monitor, stress ecg, and other cardiac tests.

About 10 minutes after that, I became light headed and dizzy again along with chest tightness, palpitations and an itchy throat. My heart rate was in the 110s. My symptoms would be on and off. I received more Benadryl in the ED with no resolution. I then was given an epi pen and prednisone. After this the itchy throat and light headedness resolved. I was observed in the ED for a total of 4 hours. I was discharged with 4 days of prednisone and 2 days of Benadryl.

I was not able to sit or stand on my own, and I could not walk more than a few steps without needing to sit down and rest. Severe upper back, neck and head pain for 3 days. Some intermittent irregular heartbeat, chest tightness as well. I lost 8 pounds (123lbs to 115lbs) in two days.

                                                I received the second dose of my Moderna covid vaccine at 10 am on Wednesday February 3rd. Around 8:30 pm I experienced extreme chills and had a 100-101 F fever all night. I woke in the morning still feeling weak because I spent the whole night uncomfortable from the fever and flushed  face I had. I walked towards another part of my house and fell down and fainted. I was unconscious for a few seconds before a family member was able to shake me and wake me up. I take no medications and am a generally healthy individual with no prior medical history or underlying Heath conditions. I also do not have a history of falls or issues from taking any past vaccines. I also am not allergic to anything or have experienced any allergic reactions in my life. It?s the second day now and I am still experiencing a 100 Degree fever and face flushing. I am currently self medicating at home with Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not gone to see a health care professional yet.

The morning following her vaccine she developed fever, chills, generalized malaise, myalgias, and fatigue lasting about 48 hours. The following morning, she was awoken from sleep by a crushing substernal chest pain with associated typical anginal symptoms. Her initial troponin-I was elevated at 7.47 ng/mL and peaked at 19.19 ng/mL. An ECG demonstrated minimal ST elevations followed by an echocardiogram demonstrated preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of 60-65%. Due to her elevation in cardiac enzymes and persistent angina, coronary angiography was performed revealing no obstructive coronary artery disease. She was diagnosed with suspected myocarditis and treated successfully with anti-inflammatory medication. In follow-up, she had an uncomplicated treatment course with complete resolution of anginal systems and improvement in troponin and inflammatory markers.

These symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes and then they resolved. I did not have any of these symptoms since it initially happened on 1.8.21 at 230am. I did not seek medical care at the time since my symptoms resolved. I did contact my doctor on 2.1.2021 about this and he stated the symptoms I described aligned with symptoms of a panic attack, but if I felt it was related to the vaccine that I can report it.

                                                Received my first vaccine 1/6/2021. I was very nervous about the vaccine, so I brought 4 epi-pens with me. My PCP and allergist advised me to sit x30 minutes after the shot. 25 minutes after receiving the shot, I felt very warm.  I looked at my hands and they were fire-cracker red in color. I began doffing my sweatshirt and my arms/neck/stomach and back were had a spotty rash. There was no hives/areas of elevation.  Nurses took my BP.  40 minutes without medication, rash and warmth resolved. A few hours later, I had a terrible headache and then around 8pm, I started with bad aches, chills, fever of 101. I took tylenol and did not resolved. The next AM, symptoms continued. I took advil and this had a better effect with sx resolving. My second dose, I received on 2/5/2021. I had a similar response about 10 minutes after the shot but warmth/reddness did not last as long, ~5-10 minutes. Had my BP taken, which was elevated (probably from my own anxiety). a few hours after the shot, I began with the headache, chills and fever--- though all mild. fever was 99 degrees the next day. 2/8/2021, I felt very fatigued and weird for a few hours. this seem to pass and I have felt normal since; just very tired. *** additionally, I did have COVID-19, testing positive 11/11/2020. my sx were mild compared to others.

I drank water and took Tylenol to try and alleviate symptoms. After that, I no longer vomited or lost consciousness but I continued to feel feverish, had a severe headache, fatigue, chills off and on, nausea, and muscle and joint pain until around 4PM on 2/24/21.

                                                A patient presenting to hospital OB department received Moderna doses on 1/20/21 and 2/18/21.  She received them from health department at a clinic.  She self-quarantined from 3/15 to 3/31 due to approaching her delivery date.  She was in contact with 2 friends on 3/10 which both tested positive on the 22nd and 26th respectively.   She presented to OB initially on 4/1 for labor &amp; delivery.  She was found to be COVID positive at this time after being COVID tested - she had no prior symptons of COVID.   She had to have an unscheduled c-section after 24 hours in labor.  While laboring she did go into a critical blood pressure range.  She was treated appropriately with medication.  Patient did well postpartum and postop.  Lungs were clear and patient afebrile.  Patient discharged 4/4.    Patient returned to hospital on 4/6 for elevated blood pressure (was advised on previous discharge to monitor blood pressures at home and to report if elevated).  Her inpatient stay involved being treated for elevated blood pressure with magnesium sulfate, nifedipine, and labetalol.  She had swelling in lower extremities and has had a Doppler study which showed no DVT.  She was on a blood thinner enoxaparin though because of postop status and also COVID.  She went home on 4/10 advised to follow up with provider if any more issues were to arise.  She went home on enoxaparin 40mg subcutaneous for 10 days, nifedipine ER 60mg daily, and labetalol 400mg three times daily.  Blood pressure elevation probably related to course of L&amp;D case but reporting due to the fact that patient had received both doses of the COVID vaccine and had tested positive during the course of the L&amp;D.

Heart rate was checked by medical professional in household and was found to be 120 and irregular. This lasted approximately 2 minutes. At this time also felt shortness of breath which lasted 30 minutes. Once the tachycardia and shortness of breath ended, I was getting chills and continued to have nausea and extreme fatigue. Since the vaccination my arm has continued to be very sore. When I woke up on 1/8/2021 I am still very fatigued and still have a sore arm.

                                                I was speaking on the phone while getting the vaccine. Within 30 seconds of administration, my hands and feet immediately went cold and numb and dropped my phone on the floor. I blacked out for 2 seconds. (I was told I also flailed my arms and legs as it happened, this I do not remember). Following this, my heart rate was fast and blood pressure were elevated. I felt extremely dizzy for about 90 minutes following. It took approximately an hour for me to get taken to the emergency department.

Starting at 10am the next morning I noticed I was feeling fatigued and my heart rate was starting to increase. By 11am, I was experiencing diffuse myalgia, fatigue, and malaise. By the time I went home at 11:30am, I had a fever to at least 101F, chills, body aches, and headache. I rested in bed the whole rest of the day and the night. I felt better taking Tylenol but it only relieved my fevers somewhat. I had no GI symptoms, rash, or difficulty breathing. By the next morning my fever had abated and my energy level much improved.

She was taken by EMS to the  Emergency Department and evaluated, here it was discovered that she has a history of nonepileptic seizure episodes and the Physician Assistant providing care did not think this episode was &#34;measureable allergic reaction to her vaccination however perhaps the stress and worry of having this shot just prior to her symptoms&#34;.  Followed up with the employee today and she is having expected side effects from vaccine administration (body aches, fever up to 102-103, and headache), no further seizure like activity.

                                                my toes began tingling, getting numb, and then turning white and purple several times a day since I received the first dose of the vaccine. I have worn socks and slippers, I maintain an active lifestyle, and I am not sedentary during the work day. There were no changes in my lifestyle after receiving the vaccine. I have never gotten Covid-19, as far as I know. I contacted my doctor over the phone about my toe numbness and color changes, due to concerns about circulation, and she informed me that my most recent comprehensive bloodwork taken in January of this year showed me in excellent health. No concerns noted for anything such as lupus, hypo or hyperglycermia, or poor circulation. I am concerned about this ongoing.

I have had a steroid shot on 2/18/2021 and was started on a Medrol dose pack, no relief and the rash got worse. I contacted my doctor/dermatologist over the weekend and was prescribed Prenisone 60 mg. I have been taking Prednisone 60 mg daily since Sunday 2/21/2021, with Zyrtec tid, Pepcid tid and Benadryl twice daily. I have been using my bronchodilator (Albuterol) about 3-4 times daily with my daily Brillinta (diskus inhaler) to prevent airway issues. I have had no relief. My rash and hives are not fully suppressed and I they move over my body. They burn, and get hot. Ice helps but doesn&#39;t seem to make them go away.

All of the day on 02/28/2021 I experienced skin and back pain, headache, fatigue, and brain fog (difficulty focusing and making decisions) as well as swollen and tender lymph nodes in my left armpit and under the left side of my jaw. On 03/01/2021 I woke up and felt better in the morning, I went for a walk around 3 pm and around 4 pm when I got back and sat down I started to experience headache, severe nausea which turned into chest pain and chest tightness and I still have swollen lymph nodes.

                                                I had patient report that she had localized swelling and lymphadenopathy.  I confirmed this on physical exam.  She had localized increased warmth over the left upper outer arm where the vaccine was given at the deltoid.  There was a raised area of skin in a serpiginous pattern circumferentially 3.5 across and 4.5cm in length.  It was blanching and not firm. She had 1 soft lymph node palpable at the left axilla, tender and 1.5cm in size.  She has had no other symptoms other than pain at the injection site for 2 immediately days after the injection was given.  I advised that she fill out the information for v-safe and asked that she report any further program to both v-safe and our office.

RN spoke to patient on site and she had no other complaints.  Patient monitored for a total of 30 minutes without further complaint.  Patient advised to call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room for any additional issues if needed.  Also advised to sign up for v-safe.  Patient left site stating she was feeling better (also saw other vaccine recipient return to car quickly and she said that helped).

                                                This is my second pregnancy and at the time of my vaccination, I was 32 weeks 6 days gestation with an estimated delivery date of 2/15/21.  I tolerated the vaccine well initially with only a very minor sore arm the day after the vaccine. On 12/31/2020 (4 days after vaccination), I felt muscle fatigue around my hips and buttocks as well as significant fatigue. It seemed to improve over the course of the day and was not very noticeable for the next few days. On 1/4/21 (8 days after vaccination), my muscle fatigue in my hips, buttocks, thighs, and hamstrings bilaterally became very significant, preventing me from doing some activities that I had planned. I also had generalized fatigue. On 1/5/21, I had similar symptoms, but the muscle fatigue also began to include my shoulders bilaterally. 1/6/21, the muscle fatigue also included my neck and I was physically exhausted. 1/7/21 I started to note some improvement, and I also saw my OB who did bloodwork but also did suspect a possibly delayed reaction to my vaccine. Today (1/9/21) I am still experiencing muscle fatigue, but it does seem to be improved from several days ago.

She started to feel better and left. Started to feel bad in the car on the way back to work. Her boss is a dentist and advised her to take Benadryl, which she did.  Traveling to Hospital now.  She has not yet been seen by a physician. Current symptoms are throat constriction, hard time swallowing, and having a hard time concentrating.  She is pale and feels unwell.   Wed Jan 13, 2021 16:09  Followed up with patient.  Patient is currently in the Emergency Room at Hospital. She has so far received steroids and benadryl.   Thurs Jan 14, 2021 08:56 Followed up with the patient again.  She returned home from the first ER visit at 17:30 last night.  About 4 hours after that her heart rate became elevated again (130-140 bpm while lying down) and she was confused, lethargic, and had a HA and backache. She went back to ER last night around 21:30. They gave her more benadryl in IV and toradol for the HA. She is now on PO benadryl every 4 hours for 4 days. Symptoms today include: runny nose, feels like a mild case of flu, HA and backache. Upon awaking this morning, prior to the morning dose of benadryl, her heart rate was a little elevated. She was also told she could alternate Tylenol or ibuprofen prn and use OTC cold remedies but hasn&#39;t needed any. The doctor said she is not a candidate for the next the second vaccine dose.

                                                Rash similar to Sulfa rash, started about 24-30 hours after first shot (taken in my left arm). I noticed an eczema style patch on my right hand then shortly after my arms started resending and looking splotchy. I had a sulfa rash reaction to a steroid in 2009 that also showed up after a day or two so I recognized it and started taking Benadryl.  It seems to be helping but not completely clearing the rash. My blood pressure was also high this morning, which is abnormal for me.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

The next morning I woke up at 05:45am with a sore arm, which I was told was one of the side effect. However I was sore and aching all over my body. As my day continued, I became tired and feeling flushed within the face. I felt my heart rate beating faster than normal. I began having cold chills and the aching within my body progressed through out the day (12 hr shift). When I clocked out at 07:08 pm and got home from work, I was unable to hardly move with out hurting and I felt like I had a fever. My husband checked my temperature and I had a low grade temp of 99.4 with an increase work of breathing and had ,a difficult time catching a breath. My husband took me to the hospital ER and before arriving to the ER I was having a stridor episode and when the nurse checked my temperature it read 102.3. I could not complete a full sentence and began vomiting. I was given epinephrine nebulized, solumedrol, benadryl, zofran, lidocaine nebulized. I had a CT with contrast of my neck and a chest xray. All images came back normal, I had been treated for an allergic reaction from the COVID vaccine and discharged home once the symptoms and stridor subsided.

                                                I received Moderna COVID vaccine at 1200pm on 12/24/2020 At about 0300 on 12/25/20, I awoke from sleeping with palpitations and a heart rate of about 140. Increased heart rate of 120-150 continued for a couple of hours with minimal dizziness. About 5am, I had a bought of sudden explosive, watery stool. This continued 3 more times in the am, at times having incontinence. (This has never occurred before.) By 10 am, those symptoms had stopped. Only residual side effects were a headache and sore arm. On 12/31, it was noticed that I had hives on my abdomen and back. They were not itchy and I am unsure how long they had been there for; referred to allergy

Dizziness and severe nausea started and blood pressure decreased. Trouble concentrating and tingling in hands and feet. I was taken to the Emergency Room and hooked up to an IV and Heart Monitoring. I was given IV Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, and Zofran. I was going to get an injection of Epinephrine but my heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly after the first batch of IV meds and they were concerned that the Epinephrine may have made things worse. I was monitored for 4 hours and then discharged with instructions to take Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for 5 days, Prednisone 60mg every day for 5 days, Pepcid 40mg twice a day for 5 days and given a prescription for an Epi-Pen. I remained very nauseous and dizzy foe the next 48 hours. My injection site became swollen, red, and tender 48 hours after my injection and then re-flared up 11 days after my injection on 01/17/21.

                                                Nausea, feverishness and chills started on Sunday morning, January 24th at around 2:30 AM. I was very pale and felt clammy, and the muscles in my upper arm, shoulder and neck were hurting more than just the normal ache from the shot. I had a hard time falling back asleep until I took more ibuprofen until the fever was gone. When the ibuprofen started to wear off I started to feel nauseous and fevered again, until I was able to take my next dose. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen every six hours for 24 hours to make the fever down to 99 degrees F. (My average body temperature is about 97.6 degrees F) At the time of this form I am still experiencing muscle pain, but it is more of a sore pain than the stabbing pain is had been on Sunday the 24th.

She remained alert and oriented but voiced concern that she felt like she was going to pass out. She developed blotchy skin to the chest and neck area within minutes of injection. Her vital signs included blood pressure of 140/98 and a pulse of 123. She was given water to drink which she tolerated well. She continued with symptoms of nausea, blotchy skin, heart racing and weakness.  Dizziness was also reported. She was taken to the Emergency Room.  Treatment for the event included epinephrine, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, diphenhydramine and lorazepam.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.

This writer instructed her to sit down.  This writer then requested assistance from RN.  As RN approached where patient was sitting, patient stated &#34;yeah I&#39;m going to faint&#34; she then fell forward from her chair onto the floor, with the top of her head hitting the floor first.  RN instructed staff to call the Rapid Response Team who was unavailable.  This writer gathered the anaphylaxis/reaction supplies that were on hand.  Patient&#39;s body postured and at that time RN rolled her onto her side.  Patient quickly regained consciousness.  Vitals were taken and stable.

Symptoms include severe myalgia, arthralgia, and constant chills but no fever. Moderate headache and tachycardia (100-130, most likely due to pain level).

Symptoms resolved about 24 hours after onset.

This was also present after the first dose of the vaccine, but much milder. I also experienced, chills, headache, and body aches. I took Tylenol for these symptoms and took 2 zyrtec for the shortness of breath. All symptoms lasted only about 24 hours. They seem much better on 2 days after the vaccine.

                                                32 weeks pregnant and second dose of Covid vaccine received on 1/21 at 11:00. Flu like symptoms (fever, chills, headache) began 0100 on 1/22 and lasted until about 1300 on 1/23. I had to call out sick from work on 1/22. Worked a 7L shift on 1/24 and at about 2000 noticed a petechial rash on bilateral lower extremities that spread up to lower abdomen. Called on-call L&amp;D Doctor and she advised for me to be assessed at L&amp;D triage. I was then admitted for 4 hours due to my rash and further workup concerning for DIC, thrombocytopenia and/or other possibilities. My petechial rash was very concerning for coagulation disorders and prompted many lab draws to be obtained. My labs showed elevated AST &amp; ALT that were previously normal, low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), protein in urine, elevated alk phos. I was discharged around 0100 for further workup the following day.  On 1/25 I went to clinic to have more labs done per Doctor. 1/26 at about 0830 I was called by my OB Docotor to immediately go back to Labor &amp; Delivery triage to be admitted for what she thought was preeclampsia based on my labs from 1/25 and 1/24. I was again admitted for about 4 hours for monitoring of baby, and myself for preeclampsia. My labs were still elevated and out of range mirroring preeclampsia, but my blood pressure was stable, so I was discharged around 1300. I followed up with labs at clinic on 1/28 and again on 2/2 as well as with home blood pressure monitoring.  My labs on 2/2 showed everything back to normal, causing the doctors involved in my care to believe this was an adverse event due to the moderna covid vaccine.  As a result I missed one day of work, was admitted to the hospital twice, and had 4 days of lab draws which will result in an excess of medical bills.

                                                Around 5:30 PM I began experiencing normal symptoms like headache and muscle ache. At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

I went into the ER after 4th day of pain.   ER did a CT scan and found a couple blood clots in my right lung (pulmonary embolisms) along with tissue  on lung. An ultrasound of my heart and legs were done to find the source of these blood clots and neither tests found blood clots or indicators that this is where they originated.   I am currently in blood thinners in order to reduce the clots.

The pain extended through all of it - from my elbow through both my little finger and ring finger, and I could barely move my arm without it making it hurt more. The intense pain slowly went away within the next 3 hours.  - About an hour later I was really exhausted.  -Around 4pm, I was extremely tired, had a really fast heartbeat, and I was having difficulty breathing (similar to when I have asthma). The fast heart rate and the breathing difficulties went away around 6/6:30pm. The fatigue went away the next day.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Lactose intolerance (Mild), ADHD (Stable) and Depression (Stable, medication Wellbutrin discontinued due to pregnancy.). Concomitant products included METHYLPHENIDATE from 01-Feb-2018 to an unknown date for ADHD, MINERALS NOS, VITAMINS NOS (PRENATAL VITAMINS [MINERALS NOS;VITAMINS NOS]) from 01-Jan-2019 to an unknown date for Nutritional support.   On 31-Dec-2020, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 27-Jan-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was on 14-Apr-2020 and the estimated date of delivery was 18-Feb-2021. On 31-Dec-2020, the patient experienced EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Exposure during pregnancy). On 27-Jan-2021, the patient experienced BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASED (Elevated blood pressure) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 28-Jan-2021, the patient experienced HEADACHE (Headache), CHILLS (Chills) and FATIGUE (Fatigue). On 29-Jan-2021 at 5:30 PM, the patient experienced INDUCED LABOUR (Induction via balloon catheter due to elevated blood pressure) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 30-Jan-2021, the patient experienced PREMATURE DELIVERY (Premature delivery) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged). On 30-Jan-2021 at 6:00 AM, the patient experienced UMBILICAL CORD PROLAPSE (Cord prolapse / Hand presentation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged). The patient was hospitalized on 29-Jan-2021 due to INDUCED LABOUR. The patient received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) beginning around the  forty-first week of the pregnancy. The cesarean delivery occurred on 30-Jan-2021, which was reported as Premature. For neonate 1, with an APGAR score of 8 and 9 at (1, 5 minutes). The outcome was reported as Pre-Term Birth NOS. The baby, female, was delivered at 37.2 weeks and therefore it is considered pre-term. Cord prolapse/hand presentation was discovered at cervical check post-induction by balloon catheter, therefore an immediate C-section delivery was performed. No abnormalities/complications for the infant, currently breastfeeding. On 27-Jan-2021, EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Exposure during pregnancy) outcome was unknown. On 29-Jan-2021, HEADACHE (Headache), CHILLS (Chills) and FATIGUE (Fatigue) had resolved. On 30-Jan-2021, UMBILICAL CORD PROLAPSE (Cord prolapse / Hand presentation), INDUCED LABOUR (Induction via balloon catheter due to elevated blood pressure) and PREMATURE DELIVERY (Premature delivery) had resolved. At the time of the report, BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASED (Elevated blood pressure) outcome was unknown.

On 10-Aug-2020, Ultrasound abdomen: normal (normal) normal. On 02-Oct-2020, Ultrasound abdomen: normal (normal) normal. On 30-Nov-2020, Glucose tolerance test: normal (normal) Normal. On 27-Jan-2021, Blood pressure measurement: 142/94 (High) abnormal. On 29-Jan-2021, Blood pressure measurement: 142/98 (High) abnormal, sent for induction..     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient reports she had an unwanted/unplanned induction 2 days after her second Moderna vaccine dose. Her blood pressure was found to be elevated on 27-Jan-2021 at her 36 weeks prenatal visit and she was informed she will be admitted for induction if the blood pressure does not return to normal. Between 28-29 of January, 2021 she experienced mild side effects, which she managed with ibuprofen and rest. On 29-Jan-2021 her blood pressure was re-checked and confirmed to be elevated so she was admitted for induction at 5:30pm via balloon catheter. Approximately at 6:00am on 30-Jan-2021, the patient was found to have a cord prolapse/hand presentation and was immediately scheduled for C-section delivery. She delivered at 6:10AM. No family history of congenital abnormalities/genetic diseases. Besides the mild lactose intolerance, no allergies reported.  Treatment medications were not reported.  This is a case of drug exposure during pregnancy with associated AEs (elevated blood pressure, umbilical cord prolapse, induced labor, premature delivery) for this 29-year-old female. Patient delivered a female child at 37 wks. 2 days. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events (headache, chills, fatigue), a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                A few Moments after receiving the vaccine, I was sitting down reading a book when I became hot head to toe and my heart began beating fast, hard without variance. My watch alerted me that my heart rate was 168.  I walked over to the pharmacist at this time. I lid down and they check my Blood pressure which was 116/63.  After the excitement in my heart subsided I had nausea extreme nausea with dry heaves.

                                                A week after receiving the COVD19 vaccine, red patches of skin started appearing around the injection site.  Patches were not itchy.  Armpit area (lymph nodes) was painful, as well as general pain in left arm.  The next day the rash had gotten larger and left arm started tingling.  Arm pain persisted.  On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

                                                The onset of symptoms started around 9:15am. I experienced numbness and tingling to bilateral feet and lower legs. I experienced dizziness. I also experienced an increased heart rate (160s-170s BPM). I was hyperventilating and had difficulty with breathing. I was pale and cold.  I had uncontrollable shakes. My BP was a bit higher than my normal but not hypertensive.  I was given candy and juice after onset of symptoms. ( I did have an English muffin prior to receiving the vaccine). My symptoms subsided for some time but then came back about 15 minutes later. These symptoms continued to occur about every 15 minutes for a period of close to 2 hours. I was given Benadryl 50mg PO after the first hour of symptoms. I continued to experience the symptoms for up to about 45 minutes after being given Benadryl. My symptoms began to subside and eventually stopped after the 2 hour mark.

She was scared to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Then she said she did feel SOB and throat feels tight. I grabbed the EPI pen and injected 0.3mg into lateral right thigh. Brought patient to our emergency room, administered Benadryl 25mg (2 caps) po. Started IV NaCl 1000 mL in RAC. Administered famotidine 20mg/2ml IPV over 2 minutes. Currently on slow IV drip, 2nd bag. Patient is doing well. She was initially shaky after the EPI pen but throat did not feel tight less than 10 minutes after injection. Currently is relaxed as I monitor her. Vitals have been stable.

I felt asleep around 0100 the next morning- missed work this day. Went for COVID test (negative) and about 30 minutes post test began feeling weak and faint. Went to Emergency Dept, receive a liter of normal saline.   By vital signs I remained orthostatic( hypoxia and tachycardia upon standing) symptoms remained the rest of the day.  1/5- fatigued but other symptoms resolved  1/6-  symptoms resolved 100%

She called me (PCP) 01/05/2020 to discuss this reaction.

                                                I received my vaccination at my place of work. Local pharmacy came in to administer them.  In less then a minute of recieving the vaccination I experienced a tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  I told my symptoms to the  pharmacist that was there.  I had to take my mask off due to the difficulty breathing.  I sat down and was trying to catch my breath.  Roughly 10 -15 minutes passes then my throat began to swell.  My extremities were feeling tingly and I was very dizzy.  I sat with my neck extended to maintain my airway until they could locate some benedryl.  My voice was wheezy when attempting to answer questions the pharmacist was asking.  The pharmacist wanted to administer the EpiPen but I would not allow her to because then they would have to call 911.  It took about 45 minutes in total to locate benedryl.  I took 50 mg.  Roughly 15 -20 minutes after taking the benedryl I was able to breath with ease.  I waited about another 15 minutes at the facility to ensure I was ok.  I was told I would not be recieving the second dose due to my anaphylactic reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I spoke with the nurses regarding previous vaccine reactions, and we all agreed that I would take Benadryl first, and then get the vaccine. However, about 5-10 minutes after I got the vaccine, I began feeling very itchy, which is usually a precursor to when I develop hives. The nurses kept a close eye on me and got my vitals. They said my pulse was a little high, but that I was ok to go, since I had stayed my 30 minutes afterward and my vitals were ok. Throughout the day, I became even more itchy, and that night, I had hives everywhere, a low grade fever, and a migraine like headache. Because I did not have an itchy throat, and I have developed these symptoms before with the flu vaccine (and other allergies), I did not go to the doctor. The side effects took about a day to a day and a half to go away.

                                                20 minutes after receiving the vaccine 1/11/21 I had a skin reaction on the left side of my face also felt a little dizzy. I took Benadryl for my skin and was fine after about a hour. Exactly a week later the injection site was red/hot and itchy. The next day which is 1/19/21 same thing the injection site was hot red and itchy. I also felt chest tightness, headache, nausea and dizziness. I spoke with my doctor over the phone and she prescribed me Albuterol which helped with the chest tightness. I also took Benadryl for my arm which helped. The very next night 1/20/21 the same thing happened to my arm again. It got red and itchy and I felt nauseous.

Around 10 minutes after receiving the second dose, the patient experienced some syncope which subsided about 10 minutes later and did not leave the vaccination site until she was feeling better. The other side effect that the patient experienced was redness/swelling/irritation at the injection site for about 24 hours after the injection.

I fell back asleep until 3:30 AM. I woke up with a racing heartbeat, chills and shortness of breath. My oxygen saturation which is usually normal was in the high 80?s. I took another dose of Motrin 800 mg and was able to break my fever and this reduced my heart rate. My oxygen saturation was still low. I fell back sleep around 4:10 AM and was able to sleep until 7:00 AM. I took another dose of Motrin around 8:00. I had a persistent headache and general malaise the day following vaccination. 2 days after vaccination I still felt very tired and weak and had a persistent headache. Day 3 was symptom free.

                                                About 10pm I developed chill but was already taking tylenol and motrin because I had a headache.  About 1am I developed a fever of 101.5 which had went to 102.1 and for 24 hrs I could not get it down below 101.   On Tues I woke up at 2am soaked in sweat but the fever had broke for about 12 hrs. I developed another fever of 100.5 but it went away with no medication.  I felt better the next day but the fever returned later along with SOB and because the fever returned it prompted me to go to the urgent care where a chest xray was done.  The xray showed my lungs were inflamed.  On 1/19 I developed the same SOB, chest tighness and another fever of 101.  I reached out to my doctor and had an office visit where another xray was done but normal and was started on the Flovent enhaler to help with the SOB and breathing.

The next day, on 12/29/20, she developed a fever &gt;100, fatigue, chills, sore throat, new anosmia/dysgeusia, chest tightness, headache, GI symptoms, and nasal congestion.  When the symptoms did not resolve, she contacted her doctor on 1/2/21.  They referred her to get a COVID test and that test from 1/2/21 returned positive.  Follow-up on 1/4 showed symptoms stable.  No hospitalization required.  Treated with albuterol inhaler and pseudoephedrine.  Not believed to be related to vaccine, however reporting since my understanding is that VAERs is interested in reports of positive COVID cases following vaccination.

I finally took Tylenol at 2pm and it worked wonders. I was still sick but was able to relax and sleep. Felt like mild flu after Tylenol. Next day (2 days after vaccine) felt much much better. Still have slight weakness like after being sick and some light headedness but feel like I should be back to 100% tmw.

I also had a sore left arm, a headache, body aches, and some fatigue (general grogginess). I went to work that day and woke up the next day feeling fine again.

I experienced headache and fatigue yesterday afternoon and developed back aches at 2030At 2330, I developed fever (100.5) with chills, nausea, diarrhea and faint feeling. I started blacking out while walking to get water and had to kneel down to the floor to prevent myself from passing out. I had tingling in my hands and feet for an hour after. I took ibuprofen at 0145, and fell asleep around 0230. As of now, I feel back to normal, other than sore arm and lingering fatigue. My fever is gone and temp back down to 98.3. I had COVID back in early December, so I expected this type of immune response with the first vaccine dose.

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

This got better. On day 7 after getting the vaccine I developed a firm, raised, HOT and extremely itchy area at the site of injection. This is measuring at 5cm by 5 cm on my Left deltoid.  This continues to get larger and larger.  I have also had daily headaches since the vaccine was given. I seen a doctor who recommended calling the CDC who then advised me to complete a VAERS report.

My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

                                                At about 0130 on 01/13/21, I woke up not feeling well (I had also not been sleeping well prior due to arm pain and minor aches). I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

This lasted for approximately 10-15 minutes. For the next several hours the patient was light headed/ dizzy. The patient also felt short of breath, more so with activity.  At around 9PM, the patient took diphenhydramine 50mg x 1 and acetaminophen 1000mg x1. The patient then laid down for the evening and awoke around 10 AM feeling much better.

                                                Just over 24 hours after I received the COVID-19 vaccine I had a syncope episode while standing talking to others at work. I began feeling hot, started feeling like I was sweating, started seeing black and white lines, and then fainted. The symptoms came on very quickly. I did not remember falling and we believe I hit my head on the corner of a table when I fell, and I had to get 3 staples in my head. I have no other medical concerns at this time, and all of the test run at the ER showed no concerns. At the ER they ran labs, took a CT scan, and did an EKG. I was released from the ER after about 4 hours. I have had a 3 other episode previously when I felt like I was going to pass out, most recent March 2020, but they were linked to the flu and strep. This event has not been linked to either of those conditions at this time, and my doctor encouraged me to report it.

This happened during the observation period and then I was sent to the ED.  About a week later, on the left arm, looked like I had hives, it was swollen and warm to the touch, pain went down into my wrist. I went to Urgent Care.

                                                Painful arm until Sunday, then throat felt tight, thought it was acid reflux so I took some tums. The heart palpitations started shortly after. Worse when lying down and almost felt short of breath. The heart palpitations continued until Monday night and Tuesday I woke up and palpitations resolved. I have only ever had this reaction one other time when had the Mirena. Symptoms resolved after having it removed but wasn?t sure what ingredients caused it. Now I believe there may be a common ingredient.

Then rapid heart rate and chest tightness by 2.5hrs post vaccine. I went to urgent Care and they thought it was an allergic reaction (BP 182/90, HR 82) and gave me 125mg solumedrol and Benadryl intramuscularly which caused worsened dizziness and a racing heart which caused me to collapse and they gave me a epi pen and called 911. I was transferred to ER and they completed EKG which was normal and monitored vitals for a few hours and I was released. I continue to remain extremely dizzy and nauseated 2days after the vaccine.

My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

                                                12 hours after injection (1/8/2021) I began running a low grade fever (99.8), experiencing a debilitating headache, had injection site tenderness as well as swelling the size of a baseball. I iced the injection site and put compression on, in case it was a hematoma from the injection. From 1/8/2021 -1/10/2021 I continued to run a low grade fever, never reaching above 100 degrees. I had full body aches and was exhausted as if a bus ran me over. The injection site swelling slowly reduced with continued ice and compression. From 1/10/2021 - 1/13/2021 I did not have a fever, however I continued to experience intermittent headaches that were as painful as several days prior. I felt chronically exhausted as well. On 1/14/2021 I began to run a low grade fever again (99.8). At this point the injection side swelling was a 6.5cm x 5cm ring of what I believe to be induration. Headache and exhaustion persisted. Friday 1/15/2021 I did not have a fever, but I began to notice that simple tasks such as walking to the kitchen were increasingly difficult. When checked, my oxygen saturation was 98 percent, but my heart rate was 115 while sitting. Saturday 1/16/2021 I began running a fever again, this time reaching 100 degrees. I developed a full body rash, red spots never raised. Again, I continued to have extreme exhaustion and headaches and tachycardia. I took some benadryl to help with the rash. Sunday 1/17/2021 the rash and fever returned, headaches and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia continued. Monday 1/18/2021 I began having a sore throat, fever and rash developed again. Headache and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia as well. Tuesday 1/19/2021 my fever elevated to 100.5, headache, exhaustion, sore throat, tachycardia. However, by Tuesday there was no longer red visible spots. My entire body still itched and felt as if there was a burning sensation, however I could not find any visible red spots to correlate with the itching and burning. Today Wednesday 01/20/2021 I have never felt worse. My entire body feels like it has been repeatedly ran over by a semi truck. My throat hurts. My head hurts. My body burns as if it&#39;s on fire. I am so incredibly tired I feel like it&#39;s an extreme sport just to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom. My fever today 01/20/2021 reached a new 101.4, I&#39;m still tachycardic. Oxygen saturation is within normal limits. However, the induration around the injection site seems to have almost completely resolve.

                                                The vaccine itself was well tolerated with just some injection site pain and minor body aches the next day. Then, last night I took miralax and had an allergic reaction to it. I have taken miralax in the past and I have tolerated it well. This is my first time taking miralax since the Covid vaccine and I suspect it is related since there is polyethylene glycol in the vaccine. About 10 minutes after taking the miralax (in water) I had chest and throat tightness, rash on my chest and face, severe facial flushing, and itching. After that began to resolve I had chills, rigors, and aches in every joint. I had not eaten or consumed anything else and had no exposure to any other potential allergens.

                                                Was fine immediately post vaccine. Drove home and proceeded with a normal rest of the day at home. Went to sleep around 10 pm. Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

Her blood pressure was taken multiple times ranging from 145/80 to 155/95.  After approximately 40 minutes after the vaccine, the patient stood up and fainted. We kept the patient on the floor as she was light headeed and not very responsive. At that time, 911 was called.  She was taken tp the ER and discardged the same evening.

                                                Woke up feeling very nauseated. Took a Zofran. While standing to get medication from cabinet my vision went completely black and face cold and clammy. I slowly laid down with feet above heart until it subsided and slowly went back to bed. My galaxy watch says pulse dropped to 40. Normally 60&#39;s. Later in the morning at 7am chills started and migraine with light aura (kind of like the pixels on an old tv). Took asa, tylenol, and drank water to help. Feeling hazy all day.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

                                                Beginning Saturday morning, I began to experience hives, coming and going throughout the day. There were 2 significant episodes on Saturday, one Sunday morning, two throughout the day on Monday. Beginning Tuesday morning, I experienced hives that continued throughout the day. Starting around 1:00 pm, they moved from a more localized area on my upper trunk to covering my entire body, head to toe. I became hypotensive (lowest was 90/60), tachycardic (pulse rate ranging from 100-125), low grade temperature (100.4), noticed a tingling feeling in my lips, a new onset sore throat, and ringing in my ears. My pulse ox remained stable, no oxygen required. I took a claritin chewable approximately 10 minutes after onset of worsening symptoms, then 50 mg of benadryl 3 hours later.  I have continued to take 25 mg of benadryl BID since Tuesday and have remained without any new onset of hives. No medical admissions were required, although I do work in a medical clinic and close observation was available for me.  Only symptom remaining is fatigue, unsure if this is related to benadryl usage or remaining vaccine reaction.

At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

My pulse and blood pressure went up. I got dizzy and lightheaded. Maybe 5-7 minutes after the onset, it started to get better on its own. No medicine was given. The paramedic did an ekg which was normal. My blood pressure and pulse also went back to normal.  My oxygen level was normal. Later that evening and the following day, the only noticeable difference was extreme fatigue and a headache. I was dizzy and lightheaded for a few hours after.

Patient primary complaint is headache on bilateral temples. All other symptoms resolved, and no dizziness if not looking at phone.  Patient has history of headaches, similar in quality, but this is more intense (6/10 intensity, less than her scoliosis pains, but more than usual headache pain), but otherwise the same, pounding sensation, and she can feel throbbing. Headache is about the same currently. Started simultaneously as dizziness, immediately, unchanged. No changes in vision. Peak intensity of headache around 30 min after onset, peak at 4:30 or so.  Patient notified the vaccine clinic staff and was instructed to be observed in another area, and did not improve. Patient remembered that her initial blood pressure was low and it fluctuated. Patient was then sent to the ED.  Upon initial assessment in the Emergency Department 2 hours after her initial injection, the assessment is likely vasovagal near syncope with tension headache, rather than true allergic reaction. Given metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, normal saline, and obtained labs.

                                                About a minute or 2 after receiving the vaccine my heart rate increased. I advised the nurse and they hooked me up to a monitor for my heart rate and O2 levels. My O2 was fine, however my heart increased to about 192 bpm at resting. After a couple minutes it slowed down to a resting rate of 130 This continued for 20 minutes until I took my beta blocker atenolol. After that it would only increase to 150 bpm during an episode and resting rate was 100-115bpm. I had a headache and was a little light headed.

                                                Initially after vaccine within an hour I felt fatigue(drained within 1 hour of receiving vaccine). Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine I was having fever, chills, body aches, nausea, and vomiting, and diarrhea and dizziness and weakness and heart palpitations(probably related to dehydration). Symptoms remained for 3 days. Unable to hold down anything. Felt like I had covid all over again just without the respiratory issues and loss of taste and smell. Arm was very sore almost like a deep bone bruise. Brain fog developed again like after initially recovering from covid as did the fatigue. Still having lingering fatigue and now carpal tunnel like symptoms in both hands, slight weakness and numbness at times in right upper arm where vaccine was given. Reported event to Pharmacist to administered the vaccine and the CDC.

Patient is a nurse.  She received her 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19 the day prior to arriving in the emergency department.  This morning she did feel some mild body aches but otherwise was feeling fine.  Starting later today after her shift at work she developed severe body aches bilateral upper shoulders and down her spine, she also reports some shortness of breath, dizziness.  She felt unsafe to drive home feeling like this.  She had taken some Advil earlier in the day around 10:00.  She denies any fever, nausea or vomiting.  No history of severe vaccine reaction or anaphylaxis.  She has had anaphylactic reaction to Enbrel prior.  She denies any throat swelling, muffled voice, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain.    patient is mildly tachycardic and hypertensive.  Likely due to pain.  Patient is experiencing adverse reaction to the 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  I discussed with her she is having an immune response to the vaccine.  She does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis which could contribute to the elevated immune response as well.  The patient is given 30 mg of IM Toradol for body aches here in the emergency department.  She is instructed to call PCP for close follow-up, rest, drink plenty of fluids.  She has no signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis at this point.

On Friday I started my period a week early and it was unusually heavy (this hasn?t happened much since I was a teenager) on Saturday I was bleeding so heavily and had lightheadedness, near syncope, headache, nausea, weakness, fatigue and brain fog. Usually menstrual cycle is not as heavy and doesn?t come early and I don?t experience these types of symptoms (usually just bad cramps and back pain with less heavy bleeding).

Checked my heart rate with a pulse ox and it was in the 150?s. I realized had not taken my clonidine pill yet for the evening so I  took it and waited about an hour to hour an a half and my heart rate was still not coming down below 125. I ended up going to the emergency room and getting there by 3am. They immediately started running tests. My heart rate was in the 138 and my blood pressure was 148/100

These symptoms persisted, so I continued Benadryl every 4 hours for 2 days.  On Saturday 01/30/2021, when symptoms continued.  She advised switching from Benadryl to  a once daily dose of Claritin and Pepcid AC. Switched to Claritin and Pepcid, symptoms persisted but started to diminish in severity. Planned appointment with Primary Care Physician is scheduled for 02/19/2021.

Approx a week and a half later I noticed broken blood vessels over my body, went to my PCP had a blood draw and was informed I had a platelet count of 1. I was sent to the ER then to hematology. I received an very large  infusion and was put on 40 mg of Dexamethasone for 4 days. The next step is to get more blood work and see if I need another infusion. After the infusion I was really sick and passing out .

It began as swelling, and redness at the injection site. She stated she had hives that were itchy and raised on her left arm around the site, and on 30 January 2021 the hives spread down her arm. She also noted that the lymph node in her left axilla was swollen.  On 6-7 Feb 2021 patient stated that the rash has mostly resolved, but that she started having neck pain, on the sides of her neck, near her collar bone. This pain leads to a headache, which she has been taking Ibuprofen for. The Ibuprofen only helps with the headache pain, not the neck muscle pain. She also stated that since the 6 and 7 of Feb in the evening her chest begins to feel &#34;heavy, like something is sitting on it&#34;. Patient stated that she went to see her primary care provider at the end of January and was sent to an allergist, who did not believe it was an allergic reaction. She was not prescribed any medication.

Patient was given cold water to drink and I put a fan on her to help cool her off. Once her mouth became tingly, we agreed to call EMS to come check her out. Once EMS arrived, patient was feeling better. EMS checked her vitals and released her. We called her Aunt to come pick her up.

                                                Arm soreness and fatigue the first evening post-vaccine. Around approximately 2300, I had chills, hot flashes, and a low fever (101) along with tachycardia, which lasted several hours. My heart rate was up to 150bpm at its highest while at rest. I took 800mg ibuprofen which seemed to help.  The next day I was very fatigued and nauseated. I started to have some gum soreness as well. The next day (2/21) I felt much better, but my lips felt very chapped along with some gum pain. As the days went on, the inside of my lips against my gums and teeth felt very raw and painful, and my lips became extremely chapped, while the corners of my mouth were cracked and painful as well.  On or around 2/24, I began to have some very sore spots on my soft palate, inner lips, and inside of my cheeks. They mostly became small white sores, except for my lips, which became very red with tiny blood spots just under the skin.  As of today (2/27), I still have sore gums, small sores on the inside of my mouth, several under my tongue, and the red sore spots on the inside of my lips.  It isn&#39;t life-threatening, but it is very uncomfortable, and makes eating and drinking painful. I don&#39;t feel the need to go to an ED or urgent care at this time, but will try to make an appointment with a GP as soon as I can.

                                                I am writing to you in regards my Moderna adverse reaction. I got your information from a small Facebook group that?s going through the same issues as me. On 1/31/21, I received my first shot of Moderna. I was told to stay 30min because I have a Sulfa allergy. I also received a flu shot 3 weeks prior. After 15 min I started to feel tingling in my face and throat tightness. As time passed, I started to feel like I couldn?t breathe at one point. As I continued to have issues breathing and started getting nauseous and lightheaded, they informed a nurse to look over me. The nurse had a student nurse do my vitals manually. She gives out standard numbers 60 heart rate and 120/80 blood pressure. My normal blood pressure is elevated in 130-140/80-90. I had to be picked up due to feeling unwell. I went home took Tylenol and slept.  The next few weeks I kept feeling zaps of sharp pain in my chest area. On the 12th day after the vaccine, I had a panic attack. The panic attack started with a sharp pain in my neck and when I inhaled it hurt. I got heart palpitations and again felt like I couldn?t breathe. I never suffered from a panic attack, so we called 911. The EMTs came my blood pressure was 200s/100s and elevated heart rate (sorry don?t remember exact numbers). It was suggested I go to the ER since my numbers were high. In the ER I told the doctor about my vaccine incident. They got blood work done and she decided to do a CT scan and X-ray since something was elevated ( I don?t remember what was elevated. I am working on getting that info). My EKG, CT scan and X-ray all came out fine. I was then diagnosed with panic disorder. I was sent home and after a few hours I started to feel an internal tremor.  I describe the tremor as having a cell phone on vibrate its usually is in my lower abdomen to pelvic area. My blood pressure kept spiking up into 180-190/80-100. I kept reaching out for help by going to ER once more, 3 urgent care visits and my primary. No one could help me, and I kept getting labeled as having panic/anxiety disordered. My primary doctor said I could be having adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I just have to wait it out. The internal tremor I feel constantly and sometimes it?s in my chest. I have muscle twitching, tingling in my lower limbs, muscle pain, and blood pressure spikes. I do feel like my symptoms cause anxiety because ill have these spells where I feel adrenaline running through me which will cause anxiousness. My blood pressure is getting better, but I still have spikes and have had another panic attack.  I have been on Lexapro 5mg and gabapentin 300mg 3x a day for 5 weeks. During that time, my symptoms have not improved. I will be getting off the medication soon. I never had any of these issues prior. I don?t drink, smoke or do any drugs besides the medication prescribed.   On 3/30/21, I reached out to my psychiatrist again and went into more detail about everything and she said she believes me about the vaccine side effects.  She recommended I go back to my primary care doctor and ask to be referred to UCSD covid long haulers study to see if they can help me. I wanted to share my information to see if it might be help to your research.  Thank you for your time

I had no anxiety surrounding the receiving of the vaccine nor anxiety about potential side effects. I was standing still and upright at the time of the attack and it lasted appx 30-40 min, subsiding to feelings of heightened anxiety through the remainder of the night. While anxiety and panic attacks have occurred in the past, it is not on a regular basis, nor has either occurred in over 6 months.

Plan to continue with 180mg fexofenadine a day until all itchiness goes away.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

These symptoms resolved after a day, but I have had a poorly delineated area of erythema, warmth, edema and pruritus at the injection site that began on day two post-vaccine and has been increasing in size until today (day 5 post-vaccination). Started as a small (2 cmx2cm) wheal, now  appears as painful/itching and warm blanching urticaria that takes up the entire width of my upper arm and half the length of the upper arm.

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

                                                I woke up lightheaded. I had dizzy spells throughout the entire day, starting at 6AM. I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

                                                Few days after vaccine noted significant night sweats--soaking the bed. 13 days after vaccine (1/10) I noted supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (L sided). 14 days later (1/11) I had onset of exertional tachycardia. Heart rate would increase to 120-130 with simple activities like cooking dinner or taking a shower. This was sometimes prolonged with standing and associated with shortness of breath.  The night sweats continued for the next 6 weeks until time of submission. The lymphadenopathy was also noted L axilla and R supraclavicular and has also persisted. 2nd covid moderna vaccine received 1/30/21 with only mild headache.

                                                At 1:17 PM, I received the vaccine. Around 1:30 PM I started itching and breaking out in hives. I did not say anything because I thought it was my eczema reacting to my nerves. I went home and felt fine for a while. Around 5:30 PM I told my husband my stomach hurt and I had a slight headache, and I was going to lie down. Around 8:30 PM I woke up. Around 11 PM I was feeling kind of light-headed but did not say anything to my husband because I just thought it was my thoughts. I went to bed. Around 3:45 AM I woke up feeling sick, went to bathroom in master bedroom and dry heaved. I returned to the bed from our bathroom, and told my husband I thought I was going to pass out. I have no recollection of the following events, this is information my husband (Brian) shared with me. He said I then stayed standing on the floor, laid my head over on my pillow, and started breathing heavily, and it became progressively heavier to where he stated I sounded like a &#34;wart hog.&#34; He said he jokingly said to me, &#34;Are you mutating,&#34; then I collapsed onto our bedroom floor. He said he got up immediately, was saying my name as he was walking to me, and I was not responding. He then got on the floor by me, and was rubbing me and trying to wake me, and it took about a minute before I came to. When I came to I was laying on our floor, keep in mind I feel approximately 5 feet as our bed sits 4 to 4.5 feet in the air, and I am 5&#39;8&#34;. I hit my hit on our floor, and when I came to I could barely hear him calling my name as there was a loud rushing noise like water in my head. It took about 2-3 minutes before the ringing was completely gone. I then had cold chills off and on for the next 24 hours with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. On Tuesday following the initial encounter, I went to the ER due to nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe headache on right side of head. The ER doctor diagnosed me after a CT with a closed head injury that occurred at initial encounter, so Thursday around 4 AM.

                                                I was vaccinated on the 14th of January. Initially I just had a sore arm and fatigue on the 15th. The night of the 17th I was working out and had a vasovagal type episode (never had this before). By the morning of the 18th I was fatigued and had a cough that can be described as a bronchial spasm type cough, I assumed that it had to do with the work out and the episode the night before. I woke up on the 19th very sick. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea. Because I am a healthcare provider I was able to go strait to the hospital and get an expedited COVID Test. By that afternoon I had my test back with positive results. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed. I had extreme headache, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath if I moved around at all, cough, loss of taste and smell, nausea, abdominal px, diarrhea, lac of apatite, extrema &#34;brain fog&#34;. These symptoms continued for about a week. Most of the symptoms subsided after that time except for the fatigue off and on and a continuous cough that as of 2/11/2021 has still not gone away.

However, about 7 hours after the shot I developed a fever (101), body aches, weakness, reduced O2 saturation (95-95), tightness in my chest,  fatigue, nausea, and headache. These symptoms were severe and persistent from 8pm 2/19 through overnight on 2/21. I treated it with Extra Strength Tylenol 1,000mg every 6 hours like clockwork, hydration and rest. I slept about 18-20 hours each day (Saturday and Sunday).   I awoke on 2/22 with only fatigue, sporadic tightness in my chest and O2 at 95 remaining. As of today 2/22 at 2:40pm the tightness in my chest has gone and my fatigue is gone. I do not know my O2 saturation right now as I left my reader at home.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post injection, I felt a burning sensation move from my left deltoid, up my shoulder, and across my chest. I experienced burning in my chest for about 10 mins, and then it subsided. About 8 mins after that, I experienced moderate to severe cramping in my lower back and thigh muscles; which completely subsided after 10-15 mins. Two days after the initial injection, the injection site began burning/aching again, with movement up to my shoulder joint. It was to a point where I was tearful and unable to sleep. The following morning it had subsided, and just remains slightly sore.

I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

                                                The following day, 12/23/20, I kept feeling like I was having brief waves of anxiety, with nothing to be anxious about. The anxious feeling kept occuring, but it wasn&#39;t until a week later than I realized that each time I felt that anxiety, my heart was actually palpitating.  I had a 12 lead EKG done via local EMT to confirm that it was actually happening, then made an appt with a local cardiologist.  Stress test, cardio sonogram, and 24 hour heart monitor tests were completed on 1/13/21.  My follow up is on 2/3/21.  Fortunately, I have not felt a palpitation since 1/10/21.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I began feeling an increase in heart rate about 5-8 minutes after injection. I reported symptoms and site began to monitor my pulse, which was 160. I then drank 32oz of water and took 400mg ibuprofen. I then began to feel dizziness. Blood pressure was normal. My chair was reclined and I was given about 2oz of orange juice. I was then moved to a stretcher and my legs were elevated on a chair. I took a restroom break. I began by walking, but started to see spots in my vision and sat in a wheelchair. I was able to use the restroom and return to stretcher and elevation of my legs. I was then taken to the ER. I used the restroom once more independently. Blood sample was taken. Heart rate was  160, blood pressure was normal. EKG was abnormal and I was given dosage of adenosine. First dose did not show necessary improvement and I was given a second dose, which dropped my heart rate to the 90s. I used the restroom independently and was given an additional EKG, which was normal. During this time my Physician contacted a Cardiologist, for consultation. I was then discharged with recommendation to follow up with cardiologist in 2-4 days.

While driving home the left side of my face became numb and stayed that way for an hr still with chest tightness and dizziness went away. My gums started to hurt and right breast. I was very exhausted and very natious so went to bed. The feeling of tightness and numbness went away and woke up the next day still very exhausted unable to eat due to nasea. Still was dizzy and hade a migraine, and had extreme muscle pain and multiple sores in my mouth. I slept the entire day again and until 2 on the following day. Dizziness has not gone away I still have it  and a weird feeling in my neck/ center of my head. Have a low appetite and still have muscle soreness.  I now have 2 cold sores and multiple sores in my mouth including my tongue. My right eye vision has decreased as well.

I was brought outside and asked to lay flat on the ground and I felt much better. The doctor came out to check on me and said that I looked pale, and that my blood pressure had dropped and asked if this has happened before and if I exercise regularly. After laying down for a little bit, I was guided to sit up slowly as I felt ready. Later that evening within 3 hours or so from the injection, I felt joint pain, and nerve &#34;pinches&#34; throughout my body. This continued through the night and into the next day 2/3/2021. These nerve pinches were mostly on my hands, left wrist, feet, legs, and jumped around a bit throughout my body-shoulder, back etc. I&#39;ve experiences sciatica and other nerve pain before so know what nerve pain &#34;pinches&#34; feel like,

I had my doctor order a CBC on 2/17 and platelets came back at 89.  I did have a past history of thrombocytopenia throughout my pregnancy from 07/2019-01/2020.  Thrombocytopenia went away after delivering my baby and I haven?t had an issue since. Last CBC was 10/16/20 and at that time platelets were 156. Last abnormal platelet level was on 1/9/20 and level was 132.  As of now Dr. is monitoring me and will have me repeat CBC in 2 weeks.

I stayed in an observation room for about 3 hours. Next day, I couldn&#39;t feel my right arm. I started getting fever, chills. I had all symptoms of the coronavirus. Saturday at 03:00 am - I woke up and I couldn&#39;t feel my arm or my fingers on my right side. I called the Emergency number. I stayed home and took Tylenol. Couldn&#39;t feel my arm at all that Saturday - dead. Sunday - same thing. Monday morning, I woke up, I could feel a little bit of my fingers but I noticed that I had blisters full of blood between your index finger and your thumb. I didn&#39;t go to work that day. The doctor wrote me out of work for the rest of the week. I didn&#39;t have any sensation on my pinkie or ring finger. I had a little bit of sensation on the rest of my fingers. I stayed at home and I didn&#39;t do anything with my arm and it slowly started getting better. That whole week I was having symptoms that were just like coronavirus. They came and went. the following Saturday, I started being able to move my arm around and doing more stuff and slowly it came back but I&#39;m not 100%. I can&#39;t lay on the right hand side too long - it starts feeling like my arm is asleep. I got the second dose February 12th.  I spoke to an allergy doctor and an anesthesiology doctor (video and telephone visits) - they told me I was having common side affects that people were having from the vaccine but they didn&#39;t know why.

Squeezing sensation self-resolved after call. Paramedics arrived about 1 hr post-vaccination. BP 89/66. (Note my normal BP runs 90-110s/50s-70s.) HR 70s-90s. Pulse Ox high 90s. Paramedics not concerned that reaction was allergic, no rescue meds advised. I felt well enough to drive home despite persisting facial tingling and tight breathing. Allegra and albuterol taken upon arrival home, resolved breathing but not facial tingling. Facial tingling better but not resolved after about 24 hrs.

I woke up around 6 AM the following day and felt extremely fatigued. Around 6:30 AM I became nauseous and very lightheaded. I had to brace myself against a counter so I would not fall down and faint. I rested all day then around 1 PM I got up and fainted. I woke up a moment later and had an intense ringing in my ears for several minutes. I felt fatigued the rest of the day.

                                                Symptoms of weakness, tired, mild fever and headache starting the day after COVID vaccine.  The following day woke up at 6am with chest pain, described as mild to moderate in severity with no radiation.  Patient experienced a loss in family member within last 3 months and was under significant stress.  Cardiology consult suggested stress may have caused elevated levels of adrenalin and COVID vaccine may have increased catecholamine levels which caused increase in troponins.

The patient&#39;s medical history included depression. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) since 2014.  The patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 039K20A) on 12 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 028L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10 Feb 2021, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine the patient, had experienced cardiac issues.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient started experiencing chills and passed out for 40 seconds (secs). The patient had visited the emergency room (ER) and EKG (electrocardiogram) showed slight abnormality. She was given heart monitor for 14 days. She was scheduled for Stress test and Echo. She was on antipsychotic medications for seven years. She was curious whether the antipsychotic drugs caused the cardiac abnormalities in response to Covid-19 vaccine. Treatment information was not provided. The adverse event of passed out for 40 secs was assessed as medically significant.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events chills and cardiac issues was unknown. Outcome of the event passed out for 40 secs was recovered on 11 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                On Feb 22,  2021 I had my annual physical with my Primary Care Dr (PCP), and she noticed my CBC panel reflected low platelet count of 67, so she referred me to a specialist and I made an appointment with a hematologist for March 23, 2021. My PCP told me that if I noticed bleeding symptoms that I should go to the ER. I had no previous CBC panels with low numbers.  On March 14, at 1:30am I noticed petechiae on my face, lower abdomen, and back of lower legs and I had been feeling fatigued the previous 2 days. I went to the Hospital ER and they took a total panel and the CBC panel came back with low platelet count of 24. They admitted me to the hospital for treatment and monitoring.   The hospital administered treatment of dexamethasone for 3 days intravenously as well as intravenous immunoglobulin for 2 days. My body and platelet count responded well to the treatment and I was released from the hospital on March 16 around noon.  During the following days from the hospital I experienced severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, and night sweats until March 20. I still experience extreme fatigue and night sweats.   I had a follow up blood panel on March 19, which showed stabilized numbers. And I had a follow up appointment with Dr to discuss possible causes (one being the covid vaccine due to the temporal relationship) and planning for treatment (follow up blood panel in 2 months and then every 4 months after that to monitor platelet levels).

I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

I called PCP and they requested lab tests. Tests confirmed low platelet count of 3.  I was instructed to go to ER that night for low platelet count. I was admitted from ER to Hematology dept. that same day to receive platelet transfusion and doses of IVIG. I was hospitalized from 4/7/21- 4/10/21. When I left hospital, the platelet count was up to 14,000. On 4/12/21 I experienced severe migraine and it got worse over night. I couldn&#39;t take anything other than Tylenol, which didn&#39;t seem to help. Lab on 4/12/21 indicated levels were up to 30,000. On 4/14/21 I saw PCP and he ordered emergency CAT Scan of the brain, which came back clear. My platelet count went  back down to less than 10. I am now on a steroid to bring up my platelet count.

                                                Shortness of breath started on Wednesday afternoon.  Right deltoid slightly swollen, no rash present at that time.  Short of breath with no activity.  Muscle aches, fatigue, just felt off.  Then arm was very sore.  Sunday night my arm pit really started hurting.  Hurst over my shoulder, clavicle, and down into the lateral side of my breast.  Bothered enough in the night that I didn&#39;t sleep well.  This morning 1-5-21 I have a red rash over the injection site, arm is swollen over deltoid and hot.  Arm pit and down into breast is still hurting significantly.  I took Ibuprofen yesterday and helped some with pain in arm pit.  Off an on SOB and chest feels tight.  No cough

                                                I received the moderna covid vaccine at approx 0930 and waited in waiting room of facility per policy after injection.  I felt ok once wait time was up so I left.  I was driving approx 15 min later and (which was approx 30) after administration and pulled over to side of road due to getting chills and shaking and feeling faint.  Also, the left side of my face went numb and tingling.   I called for an ambulance and once they arrived I had started feeling normal again.  Facial tingling still persists at this time hours later.  I also had another sync opal episode once I got a ride home that resolved.  Left side of face feels like after being numb from a dentist.

                                                Within 5-10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I began to have tachycardia and tightness in my chest and throat- airway remained clear but resembled tightness with asthma exacerbation. Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

Chest tightness and heart beat flutters continued and I saw Nurse Practitioner on 1/04/21 and EKG showed frequent premature ventriculations (pvcs). Then referred to cardiologist for follow-up and possible treatment. Currently on a heart monitor as of 1/06/21 and waiting to get into see cardiologist for treatment for continuing pvcs and chest pressure and sometimes pain as of 1/08/21. outcome is yet to be determined as of 1/08/21.

                                                Roughly 4-5 minutes following my vaccination I felt a rush of lightheadedness, tension in my neck, difficulty obtaining a deep breath, flushed and sweating. My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

Lasted approximately 3 days then resolved. 1/1/2021-In the morning noted hives/rash/itching/obvious line of demarcation to the injection site in my left shoulder.  Through the morning noted the hives spread up my neck and angioedema noted to both sides of my neck, lymph nodes swelling on both sides and the injection site became more swollen and turned very hard to the touch.  No difficulty breathing at baseline, but it becamer difficult to take a full breath and chest tightness with exertion.  Benadryl 50 mg was taken 4-6 times a day for 3 days.  PA consulted, who stated to stay with Benadryl regimen, steroids not currently recommended, call 911 if symptom worsen.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   I received the vaccine yesterday 1/11/21 at 1135.  About 2 hours later I started feeling symptoms :   Headache dull still.  I&#39;ve been having this pain/ache in my ribs and upper torso of it is crushing inward. My ribs feel like they are being squeezed too hard like a person hugging so tight that you are having difficultly breathing. And the upper torso under my ribs feels like when you have not ate anything in days of hunger pain (but I am not at all hungry) and it start to hurt soo bad that you can only hunch over and hope it goes away.   These issues have been on and off yesterday and today with the dull feel that has not gone away of a 3 or 4 to in a moments notice 8. Currently it is a 3 with a dull squeeze to ribs and barrable hunger pain (I am not hungry).

                                                Approximately 5 minutes, but no more than 7 minutes after I received the vaccine I felt odd, like something was about to happen. I felt a bit detached from my body and my surroundings.  I then felt a flush of heat and my throat suddenly closed up. I felt frozen, as if I couldn?t have drawn in a breath if I had wanted to. I quickly removed my mask and sat up in my chair and leaned forward. After approximately 8-10 seconds my throat opened up and I could breathe.  At this time I felt my heart was racing; I could feel my pulse in my neck without putting my hand to my throat. I started to take my pulse at this time and I could feel that my heart rate was beating fast, but was slowing down back to a normal rate. It took approximately 2 minutes for my heart rate to normalize.  I could now breathe, but my throat still felt a little tight, but I wasn?t completely sure. My throat felt as though I had a lump in it and it felt a little difficult to swallow. I wasn?t completely sure it was the vaccination or that I may have been thirsty. I sat for 15 minutes and I felt fine, no other issues. I had to go to a doctor?s appointment where they took my blood pressure (approximately 1 hour after the vaccination) and said that my bp was normal.   I left the appointment at 4:00 pm and noticed that it was no longer difficult to swallow. I noticed that my throat felt different. The feeling of the ?lump? was gone and I could swallow much more easily. It was at this time that I realized my throat had still been swollen. It had taken almost 2 hours from the time of injection for my throat to feel normal again.  I am healthy, have had several vaccinations in the past and have no known allergies. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I contacted my PCP the next day once they were open to describe my symptoms. She said that I should proceed with the second dose next month, but should take some precautions first.   I didn?t alert anyone immediately after the vaccination as I?ve never had this sort of reaction and wasn?t entirely sure of what it was. I was also in route to a doctor?s appointment and figured if necessary, could receive treatment there. My PCP advised me to take 2 Benadryl and a Zyrtec one hour before the next vaccination. She also advised that I wait for 30 minutes in the observation area following the next dose.   It is Monday evening and as of now I have had no other adverse effects. I have had minimal arm pain and no other effects at all.

                                                approximately 45- an hour after the injection I had some rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

                                                After receiving the 1st Moderna vaccine @ around 12:30pm on January 6th. That afternoon I felt fatigue and felt sleepy. I went to bed that night as usual. I was tossing and turning and woke my self up because i could feel my heart racing. I then proceeded to check my pulse and time myself. I had gotten 120 heart rate. Which i thought it couldnt be but the i have the oxygen sat that check oxygen and heart rate. I checked and my heart rate went up to 125. My head was pounding, i had a fever, the left side of my body ached, and i felt a lot of tension and my hands as if they were swollen. I took some Tylenol throughout the day and i still felt completely exhausted and horrible. This lasted at least 2 days. I contacted the ER nurse hotline they proceeded to tell me that all the signs and symptoms I had were reactions to the vaccine and if my heart rate went over 135 to go to the ER.

On my drive home, between 2100-2110 started feeling tingly and numb around mouth and it spread to entire face. Tongue and inside of cheeks also felt tingly/numb.  No visual swelling of face and breathing was ok. I didn&#39;t feel any airway obstruction.  Heart rate also increased. I continued driving to the nearest store to get Benadryl (about an additional 20-25 minutes).  Took 50mg at approximately 2145 and my symptoms slowly got better. As of today (02/16/2021) my face does not still feel 100% back to normal, very minimal numbness/tingly but more so on the left side which was also the same side as injection. I have had no facial drooping.

Enlarged lymph node didn&#39;t start until around 38 hrs later and although it has reduced significantly it is still a bit enlarged.

I noticed all over body rash, macular papular rash redish whitish throughout body, it became very itchy in my arms and legs, I noticed numbness in right and left arm and legs numbness, shooting pain in left side as well, I experienced neurological symptoms and went to ER. They did a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, they said it was probably a immune response and was told to take antihistamines at home. symptoms started to subside after a couple of days, I then developed intermittent chest pains in the left side and the pain became more consistent and then a week later it was consistent with every breath and I went to the ER again, they did an EKG, Troponin, all cadiac workup and chest xray said it was not cardiac but possibly a chest wall issue, I was referred to cardiology, cardiologist thought I may have pericarditis, I started taking 800mg of ibuprofen for management. My pain has began to subside and now I only have a couple of minutes every other day that I still have pain but stopped taking medication the third week in February. Because of the intensity of my immune response they recommended I not take the 2nd dose. If symptoms subside I will let my dr know

                                                I started having minor body aches about six hours post vaccine. I woke up that night nauseous and dizzy. I passed out on the way to the kitchen to get water. My husband somehow heard me and helped me back to the bedroom where I passed out again. I was eventually able to get back in bed without passing out, though I couldn&#39;t get warm and had severe body aches for most of the night. It was like having a very high fever, only there was no fever. I was clammy, but no fever. Around 4:30 a.m. the &#39;non-fever&#39; broke and the chills and body aches stopped. I was extremely fatigued for the next two days and felt myself again by the third. The arm in which I received the shot hurt pretty bad Friday too but that was the least of my concerns.   I did not seek medical treatment for these symptoms.

                                                Around 3:40am on Friday 02/19/21; I was awaken by extreme pain in my diaphragm, chest, and back.  I was unable to lay down, sit, walk, or stand without being in extreme pain. I had difficulty breathing and was gasping for air. My asthma pump was not effective. Drinking water made it feel worst. Using the bathroom had no benefit. I called 911.  The Fire Department arrived first and administered oxygen, which was ineffective and the pain was increasing.  I was taken via ambulance to Hospital. When I arrived to the hospital; I submitted to a urine sample. I was given Saline in an IV in my right arm.  I was given 3 Tylenol tablets of 975mg. I did a series of blood work, Covid-19 testing, had an X-Ray of my chest, Ultrasound of my abdomen; CT scan of my chest, abdomen, and pelvis w/contrast, and an EKG was performed.  The outcome was a 3mm right middle lobe subpleural pulmonary nodule and negative for Covid-19.  The hospital gave me a pamphlet for shortness of breath and told me to follow up with my primary doctor.

And the chest pain started as a severe shooting pain in my chest. The pain was constant,  After two days of chest pain I visited the Emergency room on 01/11/2021. I got IV fluids. EKG was not normal.  Discharged from hospital and referred to a cardiologist for follow up.  No Health Insurance so no follow up yet.  Chest pain still present but not constant. I never had chest pain before the vaccine. No second dose of vaccine yet.

As I was driving home at 3:50 pm I suddenly started to feel tingling in my lips and my throat felt swollen and my chest tight. I was halfway home and panicked so I went home and stayed put. My throat started to relax but my chest felt tight and I was dizzy and light headed till about 9pm. My lips ended up getting a little swollen and I?m still having a burning sensation in my cheeks and chin and my lips are still itchy.  I am a nurse and my husband is a physician and we had an epi pen on hand so I didn?t feel the need to go to the hospital as I was in good care but it was terrifying.

I felt like my heart rate has been rapid all day and my rate of breathing has been slightly increased. The pain in my left arm, where I was given the injection is very sore to the point where it is difficult to lift or to touch. I was too weak to attempt to go to follow up with medical professionals today and opted to wait to see if symptoms resolved.

I wasn&#39;t worried because this is well known for side effects from the vaccine but I wasn&#39;t prepared for the heart palpitations and tachycardia I had for about 4 hours the night of 1/5/21. I had COVID in May 2020 and per my cardiologist probably had myocarditis that I am still taking a beta blocker for as a result of the COVID infection. There may or may not be a link between the immune response to the vaccine and my previous COVID complications. The morning of 1/6/21, I am pretty much back to normal.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

It lasted for about 30 minutes. The symptoms subsided while sitting back in a chair and drinking 2.5 bottles of water. I was able to walk out and proceed with grocery shopping slowly. Have taken it easy the rest of the day but able to be upright. Now just fatigue, muscle aches, feeling cold, abnormal teeth and tongue sensation x 2 hrs). The rest of the symptoms just described continue this evening which i attribute to the covid vaccine.

I sat to wait and within five minutes was lightheaded, overheated but having chills and having intense abdominal cramps. My pulse ox and bpm were fine but my blood pressure was low for me; normal is 110/70 and emt&#39;s confirmed that I was 90/60 and then 98/62 after 40 minutes post vaccine.  I waited longer and then not feeling worse left. Advil fixed the cramps. So far it&#39;s only been pain at the injection site.

I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

                                                MODERATE PAIN (6/10) AT INJECTION SITE began within 30 minutes of vaccine administration. Ibuprofen provided no pain relief, taken once 4 hours post-vaccine administration, and again 8 hours after. 24 hours after initial injection given, at work (I am a medical student rotating in neurology at the clinical site where the vaccine was administered), I felt severe pain at injection site (10/10), radiating toward my left shoulder blade. The pain was so severe, I could not continue my work. I applied an ice pack to my arm and took Ibuprofen, sat on the floor in the dark to wait for relief. I felt my heart racing, hyperventilating (likely due to pain), became diaphoretic, and experienced photophobia as well as tremulous shaking. After approximately 30 minutes, a supervisor found me and alerted emergency med techs on staff, who measured vitals and rushed me to the Emergency Department of our hospital. The pain began to subside to 5/10 after an hour in the ED, where I was treated with intravenous fluid (NS), diphenhydramine PO, and metoclopramide PO. I was stabilized, pain under control (3/10), and released approximately 3 hours after admission, at 3:15 PM.

I thought I would be unable to go to work but after resting for about 15 minutes, I was able to get up, finish getting ready for work but continued to get lightheaded if I stood in one spot for too long. I was very tired and out of it the rest of the day, and having chills throughout the day. All of this in addition to my arm being very sore and my back hurt from my fall. I also had a very bad headache, and later in the day, around 430pm, my temp was 100.2.  I took tylenol and went to bed around 630.

                                                Full anaphylactic shock; Hives; Low blood pressure; Dizziness; Stuffy nose; Bad headache; Nausea; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare facility staff member who was a 36-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine, and who developed full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose.  The patient&#39;s medical history included a latex allergy and pregnancy.  Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06-Jan-2021, approximately 30 minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT 01122019) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient received her Moderna vaccine on 06 Jan 2021 at noon.  She reported that approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she went into full anaphylactic shock.  She stated that the reaction began with nausea.  She then developed hives, got low blood pressure, and was dizzy.  She was taken to the hospital.  There, she received two rounds of epinephrine along with diphenhydramine and famotidine.  She was released that same day from the hospital once she stabilized.   On 07-Jan-2021, a full 24 hours after receiving her vaccine, she experienced another anaphylactic reaction.  She stated that the reaction happened exactly like it did on 06 Jan 2021 and presented with all the same symptoms.  Patient injected herself with the epinephrine pen that she had at home as soon as the symptoms started.     In addition to the anaphylactic reactions she experienced, patient reported that she had a bad headache since receiving the vaccine as well as a stuffy nose that comes and goes and coincides with hives.  As of 10 Jan 2021, she stated that the flare ups had finally subsided, however, she continued taking diphenhydramine and famotidine as prophylaxis for anaphylactic reaction.   Treatment for the event included epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and famotidine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events, full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose, was not provided.   The events, full anaphylactic shock and low blood pressure were considered resolved on 07 Jan 2021. The events, nausea, hives, and dizziness were considered recovered/resolved on 10 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the events, bad headache and stuffy nose, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 36-year-old female patient with medical history of latex allergy, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 01122019), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock, the non-serious listed events of Headache and Nausea, and the non-serious unlisted events of Urticaria, Hypotension, Dizziness, and Nasal congestion.  Based on the current available information and temporal associon between the use of the product and the onset of events starting on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

I felt tachycardic, then as if my heart was pounding out of my chest. Asked to have vitals checked, BP 179/99, pulse 130-140s, oxygen sat 97-100%. Started feeling chest burning from left to right chest and also palpitations. Was given Zyrtec by on site RPh, then eventually transferred to the  ED at approx 9am. I was given IV Pepcid  20mg and PO Benadryl 50mg, potassium repletion for incidentally low level of 3.1. Had  BMP /CBC/ Complement total and triptase levels drawn. Kept for observation until pulse and Bp were within normal range. Discharged around 11:45am

I took Benadryl and it slowly started to help. Also it is hard to move the left side of my upper body. I?ve been using Tylenol Advil and heat.

The above symptoms subsided some approximately 24 hours post vaccine and were resolved by approximately 40 hours post vaccine. However, 1 p.m. on 1/22, noticed injection site was itchy, red, swollen, and sore. Took Benadryl that evening and swelling subsided some by next morning and completely resolved by 1/25.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

                                                6 minutes after receiving vaccine patient reported that her tongue was starting to swell and that her heart was racing.  Staff called 911 immediately.  Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

                                                On 2/4/21,  after receiving the vaccine I was starting to feel a slight headache but more like pressure. I was also feeling a bit nauseous but I thought it was stress but I did took an ibuprofen.  Later I starter to feel very tired do I went to sleep like about 7pm and I took a Tylenol before doing so.   I kept on waking up in the middle of the night still feeling pressure pain in my head and like a tightness sensation with a slight pain on my chest.   I woke up at 5am to get ready to work and I was still not feeling well. I got out of the house and stoped at a gas station and when I got out of the car, I started to feel extremely dizzy while walking. Got to my work place and took my temperature and it was 99.1. After a while dizziness and pressure on chest kept on getting worst.   I had someone at work take my vitals and my temperature was 101.0,  BP was 144/95, BPM was 120,  SpO2 was 98%. My boss send me home. And now I?m having mid and back lower pain with a bit of chills

                                                I got my 2nd shot around 10am.  My arm started to feel sore within 1-2 hours.  At 7pm I started to feel pain in upper left back area with breathing. At 9pm I was in bed and started to have chest tightness and pain with breathing. Both arms and hands started to go numb and tingling. I got to ER around midnight and all testing was negative.  I was hooked up to IV fluids which seemed to calm the chest pain and numbness. I got home around 3am and went to sleep.  By 7am I was having sore muscles and body aches. I was fatigued and having chills.  I was also running a low grade fever.   I continue on like this for 24 hours.  The next 24 hours I was fatigued.  By day 3 I felt like I was getting back to normal.

On 2/9 those symptoms subsided, but I started to get right-sided flank pain with pain on inhalation. I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, used a heating pad on 2/9 and 2/10, but pain progressed.  Mid-day on 2/10 the pain was so severe, I went to urgent care. They said it was gastritis and released me. I went back 2 hours later and saw a different doctor. He diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and pleural effusion. I was sent by ambulance to the hospital and admitted. I was treated for pain and started on Eliquis. I was discharged the evening of 2/12. The morning of 2/13, I woke up with 100.6 F Temp and 85% O2 at. I went to urgent care again, they thought I had pneumonia and referred me to the hospital. I was admitted to a different hospital on 2/12 and continue to antibiotic s and a heparin drip

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the Moderna vaccine, my heart rate was elevated.  I spoke to EMS personnel who were working the clinic.  My heart rate was monitored.  Resting, my heart rate was 130 beats per minute for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes my heart rate began to return to normal.  The next day, while teaching, my heart rate became elevated again.  I had to set down.  After a few minutes, my heart rate began to slow.  For 8 days following the vaccine, I experienced episodes of my heart racing, increased PVCs, and chest discomfort.  I did not seek medical treatment at an ER because symptoms started to subside after 10 minutes.  I also experienced extreme fatigue.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

On 2/5/21 I miscarried the baby and ended up hemmoraging thus requiring a blood transfusion. The fetus was sent to pathology and I was informed that at 12 weeks when I miscarried that the baby had termed at 9 weeks which was the time of my first vaccine injection.

Sunday the pain went from the left side of my neck down to the base of my ribs and then progressed to include the back and chest almost constantly instead of just on inhalation.  I went to the ER on Sunday evening, assuming very bad costochondritis; however, was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms in the left lung, areas of possible infarction, and pleurisy.  I had a CT scan at a Medical Center prior to receiving the Moderna vaccine for a suspected PE and it was negative.

I felt very tired, but my blood pressure was 97/46  about three hours after the injection and this could have been related more to my iron anemia which gets treated with transfusions. The pain in my upper body lasted about 24 hours.

                                                The vaccine was received at 1:12 PM, and I felt fairly fine, aside from injection site pain and some tingling in my left arm  until I had sudden significant elevation of heart rate, with shortness of breath, and throat swelling/tightening at approximately 1:26PM.  I cold compress was applied to my forehead and I was put in a reclining position &amp; then received Epinephrine at 1:28PM. EMS (present onsite) arrived for transport at 1:31PM. 4L of oxygen was applied after O2 sat of 89% noted by EMS. Blood pressure was elevated to &gt;200/100 initially by EMS. Symptoms improved quickly following epinephrine, with some residual feelings of very mild throat fullness, and I developed chills which improved over time.  I was transported to emergency department where I was evaluated (symptoms mostly resolved at that time, but ED physician noted a little swelling remaining in my uvula), then IV Benadryl and Decadron were given. Later acetaminophen was also given for headache that developed during my ED stay.  My vitals were monitored throughout and observation occurred until I was discharged at approximately 5:00PM, as symptoms had not recurred.

The person took me to the ER in a wheelchair, since it was across the hall.  They did an EKG on me, and evaluated me for an hour, and I was released once my pulse slowed down to 99 and I felt better.  It has been 7 days and I have continued to have tachycardia while sitting, with my pulse going from the 70s to to 130s for no reason.  It will come in episodes. I went and saw my primary care doctor today and my pulse was 105-115 sitting.  I have cut out coffee since the incident on 12/29/2020.

                                                At minute 12 after injection (8:31am on 1/5/20), the pruritis started on my scalp and my back. I informed the volunteer at the end of the drive line. She offered to have EMS evaluate me, however I declined as I thought the reaction was mild. Over the next 10 minutes, after being released from the driveline, I was so itchy I wanted to literally rip all of my skin off. The back of my throat started to itch, but never felt tight or swollen. No SOB or chest tightness. I checked my temp at 8:45 and I was at 101.0 and HR was 110bpm. I am a PA working in dermatology and got to work and took 50mg of diphenhydramine PO but was not improving. One of the doctors I work with and I decided it was best for me to get checked out in urgent care. I had my MA drive me there and was seen immediately. I had a blotchy rash over my entire body, but not raised or hived. Temp was 100.6, HR 86 and BP 127/78, respirations 16/min O2 sat 98% and the itchiness was still severe but I could tell the diphenhydramine was kicking in. I was then given 40mg of famotidine PO and 10mg Dexamethasone IM in the right buttocks while in urgent care. After about 15 minutes, my symptoms were improving, but not resolved. I was released and went home to rest. Throughout the day yesterday (1/5/20) my heart rate would spike as high as 130bmp (my normal is 60-70bpm). Then it would come down within a few seconds to about 100bpm and steadily stay between 90-100bpm all day. Last night I was woken up at 3:30am (1/6/20) with a HR of 132bpm and O2 at 97%. I took a few deep breaths, and it slowly started to drop to 100bpm. Since 6:00am, I am steady at 70-80bpm with occasional spikes of 96-100bpm and I can feel when my heart is starting to race. I have my pulse ox on for the day and will continue to monitor my symptoms. I still have occasional pruritis, but it&#39;s tolerable. I was discharged from urgent care with PO Prednisone tapered dose, however, I am very shaky already and do not want to make it worse, so have not started it yet. Not sure if I should? And I would like to know if I should receive the second dose? If so, should I pre-medicate? Please let me know if you have any further questions about my event. Thanks.

No treatment needed other than resting, maintaining hydration and taking naproxen.

All symptoms resolved in about 15 minutes with the exception of  numbness/tingling to tongue and lips which lasted 3 hours. Symptoms resolved on their own without treatment/medication other than lying flat with feet up and drinking a bottle of water. I was assessed by medical professionals at the vaccine clinic which was located inside of the hospital. I consulted with an ED physician but did not require any additional treatment.

The back of my tongue became very dry.   I felt better after 10 minutes and never passed out.  They took my vital signs and everything was normal.  I have never been bothered by needles before at all so it was strange.  However I do have a long history of anxiety so it?s possible it was just that.

                                                Day 1 to 2---Left arm tenderness at the site for 2 days, no redness/rash/lump. Day 3---no side effects Day 4 to Day 5---At about 8 pm, I noticed slight swelling underneath my left eye, that looked like a bag.  My face was also red.  The sides of my face, jaw line,  &amp; both sides of my neck were itchy.  I went to bed since I was supposed to work the next morning at 6 AM (OB Nurse).  I work up at 4:15 AM &amp; my face was quite swollen, specifically my left side, my face &amp; neck was warm to the touch &amp;  itchy.  I immediately took 50mg of Benadryl &amp; called my internal medicine doctor. Day 5---I was to be seen in the clinic at 7:00 AM.  The Benadryl helped some.  I was not having any breathing difficulty.  I was prescribed 5 days of Prednisone.  By about 1:00 PM,  the swelling was worsening &amp; my lips were tingling.  I called the doctor again &amp; they told me to go to the ER.  I never had issues with my airway.   The swelling was always worse on my left side of my face.  I received IV fluids &amp; Solumedrol &amp; was discharged with an epi pen, &amp; told to continue the Benadryl, Prednisone, &amp; Pepcid bid.  CoVid test done in ER was negative. Day 6---The facial swelling/redness/itching remained but was improved.  I was very tired. Day 7---Same as Day 6, but less swelling. Day 8---Facial swelling/redness/itching gone, but tiredness remained.  Started to notice a chest heaviness/feeling of constant excitement in the center of my chest, even when at rest. Day 9-10---Tiredness remained.  Intermittent Chest heaviness/feeling of excitement in the center of my chest remained. Day 11---Feeling more normal.

I did not immediately notify anyone as I was not aware a fast heartbeat was considered an allergic reaction.  The fast heartbeat resolved, but my heartbeat continued to be elevated about 10-20bpm from my usual baselines for 2 days post vaccine.  I also developed the following side effects; headache, fatigue, muscle/joint pain, chills, swelling of lymph nodes on right arm, pain on right arm/joints, and mild tingling/numbness of right arm; all side effects resolved by day 3 post vaccine.

The soreness, swelling, and redness started approximately 6 hours after the injection and continued for approximately 5 days. Beginning on the second day and continuing for about 48 hours I had a fluttering heart/increased heart rate. I then had 1-2 days with no symptoms, but now my arm is swollen, red, warm, and itchy around the injection site. It has been this way for 2-3 days.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

                                                Two hours after the injection I experienced increasing soreness in my left shoulder up through the left side of my neck and down through the forearm. I became slightly nauseous through that evening. The pain and tightness got to the point I could not perform regular functions with the left arm. It felt as if my muscles were tearing and prevented me from sleeping. I took ibuprofen in addition to alternating ice and heat to no avail. It hurt to lift my arm, grip to pull or push even a blanket. This continued for 48 hours before there was slight relief. Full range of motion returned four days after the injection. For brief periods throughout the days following, I also experienced occasional slight heart palpitations.

Went ER at 12:55 pm and they did an EKG - not a regular heartbeat; blood work and x-ray. My BP was high - 143/122; I had low potassium; white blood cells higher than normal -10.9 (in mid Nov - only 7.5); They gave me potassium to take. December 30, when I got home at 6:30 - nausea started and I was throwing up two-three  days in a row more than 5 or 6 times a day; weird metallic taste; fever at night; arm pain and swollen under my armpits. (Stayed off work three days.) Went to dr on Jan. 7 - did a follow up appt. and did all the blood work again and everything was back to normal.

I concurrently experienced a low-grade fever and tachycardia. In addition, I had severe pain at the injection in my right deltoid that significantly limited my ability to lift my arm. The pain extended all the way from my shoulder through my right wrist. Most symptoms, except for fatigue and pain limited to the injection site, resolved after 24 hours.

At 15 minutes I started to get hot, cough persisted, and a feeling of fatigue (I didn?t want to talk...very unusual). At 30 minutes the scratch in the throat turned to a lump, the cough was worse, and itching began on neck &amp; face. The doctor on site gave an oral Benadryl tablet but in two minutes symptoms were worsening and vomiting started. My chest was tight and sweat began. The doctor administered 50 mg benadryl shot &amp; a steroid. The lump was growing bigger, so they administered an epinephrine. Then I was sent to the ER. Upon arrival I received 25 mg of benadryl due to the whole body itching, but throat had relaxed. Also received IV fluids.

She was found to have a low blood sugar (approx. 70) at the time of the syncope. She had her second dose of Moderna COVID vaccination on 2/2/21. Her starting blood sugar displayed on her pump (type 1 diabetic with insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor) was 172 after approximately 20 minutes her blood sugar had dropped to 92, she ate approximately 100 grams of carbs starting at 10 minutes after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Her blood sugar stabilized and remained in the mid nineties after 45 minutes. Her vital signs were stable and she left stating she didn&#39;t feel any signs of low blood glucose. Her pump also indicated that her blood sugar was no longer dropping.

I was taken to the ED and given Benadryl, IV fluids and had continued nausea, lightheadedness and developed a headache. After Benadryl the symptom resolved except for lightheadedness and headache. Today I have symptoms very similar to flu headache, lightheadedness, nausea, muscle aches, joint aches and overall fatigue.

                                                I got the vaccine on 30th of Dec. Had a sore arm, runny nose, woke up the next day to puffy eyes and bruises under my eyes (still hasn&#39;t gone away) Since then I have had GI issues. Constipation. It aggravated my face. I had nausea. I had a rash on my arm and on my chest the following Tuesday. My face were tingling and very flush. I had a lot of allergy and sinus issues. Sinus pressure. This all unfolded the first few weeks after receiving the vaccine. I do have fibromyalgia. I had allergy testing done. I am allergic to bee stings. Was having a lot of vaginal issues. Watery eyes and have hot flashes followed by chills. Hives on chest. Difficulty swallowing. Rapid heart rate. I have seen three doctors that have told me my hear rate was fast. Glands have been swollen for two weeks. The night after I got the shot it was really rough with body aches.

                                                I was diagnosed with post-partum hypothyroidism 4/6/20 (labs below) and put on medication (levothyroxine).  Based on lab trends over the next 9 months, medication was weaned down and after labs on 12/28/20 (below), I was taken off medication as my physician felt that this condition was resolved .  I received my first COVID vaccination on 12/31/20.  Over the next month, I felt progressively more tired.  On 1/25/21 @noon I started having symptoms of hypotension unrelated to dehydration. These symptoms were intermittently persistent for the next  2 weeks.  On 1/27/21 @0400 I started having profuse uterine bleeding (menorrhagia) which resulted in a call to the MD later that day who recommended high dose ibuprofen and rest.  I omitted AM ibuprofen dose on 1/29/21 and received the second COVID vaccine on 1/29/21.  Repeat thyroid labs were drawn on 2/8/21 (below) and were  completely unexpected given previous lab trends.  My physician placed me back on medication and I will get my labs drawn again in a month.  Acknowledge that there isn&#39;t data with the COVID vaccine and autoimmune conditions; however, I am wondering if the vaccine induced the TPO antibodies  along with the COVID antibodies.  This may be something to look more into for other autoimmune disorders as well as more patients are vaccinated.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included monk fruit allergy and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications reported included hydrochlorothiazide.  On an unknown date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273.   On 28 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28 Jan 2021, following vaccination, the patient experienced an elevated heart rate of 105-112 beats per minute (bpm). The patient stated that 80 bpm was normal for her. At 7:30 pm, she began wheezing and her lips turned blue, both of which resolved within 2 hours. The patient took ibuprofen, naproxen, and diphenhydramine and sat in a warm tub for an hour and felt better after she covered up in bed.  On 29 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102 degrees Fahrenheit (F) at midnight and 99 degrees F at 5:00 am.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The events, wheezing and lips turned blue, were considered resolved on 28 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, heart rate was elevated to 105-112 bpm and temperature was 102, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 37-year-old, female patient, with medical history of high blood pressure and allergies to monk fruit, who experienced serious unexpected event of cyanosis, non-serious unexpected event of wheezing, heart rate increased, and non-serious expected event of pyrexia. The event of cyanosis, wheezing, heart rate increased occurred 1 day (same day) and fever occurred 2 days after mRNA-1273 (Lot# 030L20A). Treatment included Ibuprofen, Benadryl and Naprosyn. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information has been requested.

She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine I started to have an increased heart rate and blood pressure.  I was watched for close to an hour, and let go.  I experienced muscle and joint pain, which was to be expected.  Approximately 2 days afterwards, I started to experience dizziness, low blood pressure, and pressure in the middle of the back of my head.  The pressure became worse and worse, while continuing to experience the above side effects.  Since that time, I have been to the emergency room for pain all over, pressure in the back of the head, memory issues, blood in the stool, and extremely cold hands and feet without explanation.

By the third day I began feeling short of breath while talking.  The shortness of breath (SOB) lasted 3 days and was present for about half a day each. Then it all went away. On tuesday, Feb 16th, I began to feel SOB again but this time under my L breast I had pain. I tried to see if it was muscle (I am a PT) but could not tell. The next day the pain moved near where my sternum meets my ribs and then I worked on that and it has been there ever since. It feel heavy and I get chest discomfort on inhalation. I have seen primary care, they said to wait a few weeks and let them know if it is still there. I decided to report my symptoms now because I thought it would go away but it still has not and it does not seem normal to me. I did notice if I take an aleve it feels better but today that has not helped either. I hear that this vaccine can cause inflammation and so I am just wondering is this normal for what I am feeling?

                                                A few minutes after inoculation, the patient felt chest tightness.  She rested for a few minutes.  Her chest tightness did not ease.  She used her asthma inhaler to try to relieve the symptoms.  Immediately (but not necessarily because of the inhaler) her symptoms worsened.  I called over the attending EMTs, who put the patient on 02.  Soon after, a pulse oximeter showed the patient&#39;s 02 sat at 100, pulse at 110.The feeling of tightness continue but the oxygen immediately relieved the patient&#39;s distress.  After a few more minutes, the patient took another hit of albuterol.  That brought immediate relief.  Her pulse gradually slowed to the mid-70s.  She said she felt tired, as often she does after an asthma attack, but soon felt well enough to leave.  She planned to take an cab or equivalent to home, and said she had taken the day off.  She said her doctor warned her that because she has a history of reactions (details unknown) to vaccines, she might react badly to Moderna, but the doctor and patient agreed that it was worth the risk. She said her reaction to NSAIDs has been anaphylaxis.

                                                I was eating lunch with friends around 1pm when I suddenly began having a tingling feeling all over my body. I became hot, flush, sweaty, and dizzy. I proceeded to the bathroom where I appeared pale. I took my pulse which was extremely slow (20-40bpm). I realized I may die or pass out. I reached for the door and I don&#39;t remember anything until waking up on the bathroom floor. I was able to get up on my own. I was able to compose myself and walk to my car. I got a ride home. I remained dizzy and having heart palpitations for about 1 hour. I did not seek medical care. I continued to having hot flashing and tingling feelings throughout the evening. Today, 3/5, I have joint pain and fatigue and occasional dizziness.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID) and TOPIRAMATE (TOPAMAX) for an unknown indication.   On 04-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, the patient experienced TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird). On 03-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma) and ASTHENIA (Could not get up). On 04-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg) and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine). On 01-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low). At the time of the report, DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg), TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia), DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma), CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg), ASTHENIA (Could not get up), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine), HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Haemoglobin: low gram per litre (Low) LOW. In March 2021, Red blood cell count: low cells per microlitre (Low) LOW.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment informations reported were Levalbuterol tartrate  and Rivaroxaba 20 mg   This case was linked to MOD-2021-059897 (Patient Link).

Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

Progressively, left arm became red, warm to touch, hard, swollen, itchy and painful through the course of the day. It spread rapidly and pain was radiating under left breast, where the lymph nodes are located, behind back/shoulder. The following  day it has spread even further,  down to elbow; numbing/tingling sensation radiating to left pinkie and left ring fingers.   Vital signs: higher than normal systolic BP 130-150s (normal for me:100-110s); tachycardic with HR in 130-140s on the first day of the adverse event, O2 sats normal high 90s to 100% on RA. No fever, highest temp 99.2F.

In the early afternoon on Friday the symptoms got worse.   Tired and confused.  I slept through my alarm and woke up to my mom, who was watching my daughter for me, trying to wake me up.  I was very confused, dizzy and weak.  My mom said I was really out of it, and that I had a really hard time focusing on what she was trying to say to me.    When I checked in for work my O2 stats were in the upper 80&#39;s lower 90&#39;s.  My temp was also in the lower 90&#39;s.  That was after numerous attempts at taking my o2 stats and temps.  Co-worker said I was very confused, tired, dizzy and weak.  She said there were times when I was walking that I would reaching for walls and railings to regain my balance.  I left work at 6am Saturday morning.  I went home and went straight to bed.  Slept all day long until a few hours before my shift started at 9:30 P.M.   since then I&#39;ve been feeling better, but my temp and 02 stats are still low.  But I&#39;m continuing to monitor symptoms.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if anything changes.

                                                Just about 15 mins after recieving vaccination, I  experienced increased shortness of breath, feeling weak, slight headache, and my heart seemed to race.  When I shared this with the pharmasist, she did not offer to take vitals nor seemed concerned.  She suggested that I was experiencing anxiety, and that it was not a typical reaction to the vaccine.  However, each day since vaccine I have continued to have episodes of shortness of breath.  Today, 3 days after the vaccine, I had more shortness of breath than I had since first contracting Covid-19(which was on 10th of Dec).  I also was having to stop walking several times every 5 mins or so in order to catch my breath, feeling weakness and fatigue.  My sense or taste/smell is gone as well. I was so short of breath today, work was worried anough about me they urged me to go home and call my doctor.  I now have a tele-visit set up with my doctor today.

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

                                                The next morning (12/29/20) - I had typical symptoms -- &gt; minimal body aches/fatigue and a sore Left arm  At 6pm (12/29/20) -- &gt; I just finished dinner and all of sudden I felt like I zoned out/passed out for a minute.  When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

                                                On 12/28/2020 at 1930 I had a throbbing HA, nausea, chills, no appetite, body aches, extreme fatigue and low grade fever. Temp was 99.4-100.3. 1 gram of Tylenol was taken that evening, to relieve HA pain. Zofran 4 mg ODT was also taken for nausea. The following morning,  I felt extremely fatigued and had a persistent headache that was not consistently responsive to OTC meds. I developed a fever on 12/29/2020 in the evening. Low grade and ranging 99.3-100.6. Along with fever, my s/s were extreme fatigue, no appetite, headache, body aches, chills. On 12/30/2020, I spiked a Tmax of 101.0 around 11 am. Again, the same s/s were there. I went home from work early.  Same s/s and low grade fever persisted past 7 days, so I called my PCP as well as the Pharmacy where I received the vaccine. On the 10th day after vaccination, I notified my Infectious Disease Dr. He advised me to wait 6 months to 1 year to receive the second injection. He stated that my s/s were likely vaccine related and would go away with time. Fever persists through every day for the month of January 2021, with exact same symptoms. Started to notice Shortness of breath with activity, occasional sharp pain in chest. Presented to ER on 01/09/2021 with chest pain and shortness of breath. Labs revealed Acute Kidney Injury and Transaminitis. Cardiac work-up was performed, all tests negative. I was hypotensive. MD recommended I either get transferred to hospital, or stay in ER for min 23 hours observation for monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure. I received 2 L of Normal Saline. BP eventually began to rise with SBP above 90 and DBP above 40. (Normal BP range for me is 120/60-70&#39;s. Baseline Creatinine is 0.9. Discharged from ER per patient request, after second Creatinine level came down to 1.5. MD advised patient to not return to work for the next 2 business days. Spoke with PCP on 1/11/2021 in AM, and informed him of the events over the weekend. Also informed him that I am still febrile with same symptoms as reported previously. Was told I could not return to work until I was fever free. Was fever free for about 12 hours, until evening of 1/12/2021. MD not allow patient to RTW.

It was warm to the touch, painful, and itchy.  After 72 hours, welt went down and a small brown bruise remained.  On Thursday, January 14, my heart was racing on and off all day - I was off work and sitting in a calm and relaxed position with no reason for an increased heart rate - my resting heart rate was approx. 112 bpm and remained this way for 4 hours beginning around 1pm.  When changing for bed, I noticed that the welt at the injection site had returned but was doubled in size.   I applied ice to the area and hydrocortisone cream and went to bed.  The welt was still there the following morning (Friday,  January 15) and was slowly decreasing in redness and size.  At 7:30pm on Friday, January 15 I went to express care at the advice of my PCP and was evaluated.  I was told to take Zyrtec and continue to ice the area, apply hydrocortisone cream if I found it helpful, and to report symptoms here.

I was released, and went to work the next morning feeling OK. That evening on day eight I got a fever, tachycardia in the 150s, chills. The area on my arm was on fire, red with an area 12 x 9 cm area where the injection was given. My employer made me go back to the ER to have it seen. They prescribed me Benadryl, Pepcid. Fever had stopped.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

Spent a couple hours on a gurney being monitored. My blood pressure (normally low/normal) went up to 170/101. And my heart rate was in the 140s. My oxygen saturation at one point was 82% but I was not having any trouble breathing and was breathing normally. I had a terrible headache and was shaking uncontrollably for about 20 min. Eventually I felt well enough to go to work. About five hours after my shot, I passed out again. I was taken to emergency room. My blood pressure was high and my heart rate was still elevated. They ruled out anything being wrong and eventually sent me home. I had a migraine and fatigue for two days. I felt tired for two weeks. And everything that usually  hurts, hurt extra bad.

I went to Urgent Care and they think it is cellulitis from the vaccine. I am on Bactrim DS to see if it will help. My blood pressure was low as well, not sure if it&#39;s related but usually by pressure is fine. I had cupping done at the chiropractor on 1/22 on my neck and back, symptoms started later that evening. Not sure if is is a coincidence or not.

                                                Received second COVID vaccine Moderna on Wednesday evening at 6pm.  Later that night, I was a little light-headed and achey, but went to bed. On thursday, my legs and arms were extremely achy. I took Tylenol and Motrin in the morning. It seemed to help some, but continued to feel very achy in my legs. I left work early (I am a pediatrician) on Thursday and went home and just sat and rested.  I felt terrible, but had talked to other colleagues who felt very bad that first day after the shot. Friday morning, I woke up still achy but feeling better overall. I took motrin and Tylenol again on Friday morning. I worked the whole day seeing patients. Was tired, but got thru the workday. At around 6pm, I noticed petechiae rash on my lower legs. The rash started spreading thru the night- up my legs and to my arms. I went to ER. They did order CBC, CMP. Platelets were undetectable- 1 platelet was seen under microscope. CMP was normal.  I was told to go to bigger hospital. I went, My platelets read as 4. I was admitted for two nights. Two doses of IVIG were given and I was put on Decadron 40mg PO daily for 4 days. I had tylenol, benadryl, zofran before the IVIG and after.  I will see Hematology next week for follow up. Platelets yesterday at discharge were 60.  Will be checked frequently for the next few months. ITP= diagnosis. COVID shot was trigger.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart started racing and I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

She had informed the staff of the clinic that she did have a local reaction following her first dose (9days later) that she saw her PCP for. This was just treated with Zyrtec and no further intervention.  At 25 minutes following her second dose PA noticed that the patient appeared flushed.  He checked with the patient and she said she was ok.  A few minutes later noticed the patient was even more flushed.  At that time went and evaluated the patient - her BP was elevated 150/94 HR of 112 ad Pulse ox of 96%.  The patient reported feeling different than how she felt after her previous injection.  Clinic team offered for patient to be transferred to ER for further evaluation if she would like which the patient accepted.  She was transferred to ER via wheelchair in less than 5 minutes in stable condition with mild nausea.  She was cared for in ER by Dr.  Patient reported feeling tired and &#39;heavy&#39; in the ER.  Dr evaluation found a generally healthy patient with a non-toxic appearance  Lungs were clear and no obvious signs of swelling or other signs of an immediate allergic reaction.

                                                Mar 5-2:30pm: arm began to feel sore. Mar6-12:00am  I can barely lift my left arm above chest level. The soreness has traveled from the injection site down to my wrist and fingers. The injection site is slightly pink, not really noticeable, and warm to the touch. I start to feel a little nauseous and also starting to get body aches and chills. From 12:00am-4:00am i constantly wake up because of arm soreness and body aches. At 4:00am, I woke up  to use the restroom and realized even the bottom of my feet hurt with every step I took. Took my temperature and it was at 101.5.  I went back to bed and fell asleep even though I kept waking. At 7:00am, the migraine started. I was trying to avoid taking meds just to be able to get a clear picture of how my body responds to the vaccine, But by 9:30am (22hrs post vaccine) I ended up taking Tylenol for severe migraine. It feels like someone is stabbing my temples with a very sharp object. Turning or even slightly moving my head strengthens the migraine. My arm is still so sore that I can barely move it!  Tylenol brings temperature down to 100.7°. 10:30am I began with extreme fatigue. By 12:30pm I went back to bed because I couldn?t stand my body aches and migraine. I slept until 4:00pm woke up feeling a little better. Migraine was still there but not as bad. At 8:00pm I began to feel pressure on my chest. That pressure slowly turned into pain. By 9:20pm I was in excruciating pain, I was in tears and I literally thought I was going to die. It hurt to breath. I checked into the ER by 9:30pm the pain was sharp and it would come, last a few minutes, then slowly ease off a bit. On a scale of 1-10 if was definitely a TEN!!!! The ER said it wasn?t cardiac so they sent me home. The DR did say that the chest pain could have possibly been caused by the vaccine, as many have seen different symptoms and everyone has reacted differently. I was home by 1:15am. The pains continued until 3:00am. By 8:30am on Sunday Mar 7, the only thing I was suffering from was soreness in the arm and my chest was sore from the pain. The pain in my chest was a 1 or 2 compared to the 10 that it was when I went to the ER, And that pain/discomfort has lingered all day.  I?m currently 22weeks 4days pregnant with a boy and expected to deliver July 7th. I?ve been pregnant 19 times have 4 living children and suffered 14miscarriages.

                                                On 1-03-21, I noticed a large lump on the left side of my clavicle the size of a quarter and increased pain.  I went to urgent care and the PA was unable to diagnose what caused the lump or what the lump was.  On 12-31-20 and 1-04-21 had nose bleeds. Nose bleeds are not a normal occurrence for me and I emailed my NP for further treatment options.  No response yet.

Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath. Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

                                                I had burning at the injection site immediately after receiving the vaccine. As I was leaving after 15 minutes I mentioned it to the person checking me out. At this time we noticed redness and hives starting at the injection site. I was told to sit for another 15 minutes but as soon as I sat down again the hives spread rapidly and I began to have dizziness and confusion. At this point I was taken to the ER and on the way I started having nausea and my throat started burning and felt tight. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and solumedrol and IM epinephrine. Since discharge I had one instance of hive and facial swelling and continued to take Benadryl for two days. I am now having episodes of shortness of breath and tachycardia.

Within 20 minutes I was experiencing further shortness of breath, shakiness, and lip numbness and swelling. I received the vaccine through my workplace.  I called the employee health line who recommended that I stay with someone else until the symptoms resolved and for not less than an hour.  It took 2 hours for symptoms to resolve.  I also followed up with my primary care regarding my reaction.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine last Thursday (1/14/21) at clinic and had a pretty severe reaction within a few minutes of the receiving the vaccine. I didn?t alert anyone because I wasn?t sure if it was related to the vaccine or not. I felt hot suddenly, then very dizzy/faint, then experienced very bad tinnitus and couldn?t hear any of the words being spoken around me, just muffled sounds. I felt slightly nauseous, was seeing spots, and felt very close to fainting. My pulse was racing. I did deep breathing  until it subsided (which was about 10 minutes later). For the next 5 days after the vaccine, I experience extreme soreness and weakness in the left arm where the injection was given. I also had redness and itching and it was hot to the touch and slightly swollen. I had extreme fatigue and a headache and a loss of appetite. After 5 days, those subsided. 1 week after the vaccine (01/21/21),  I experienced intense itching at the injection site and redness and it was hot to the touch. I also experienced intense itching on my chin and skin numbness in that area of my chin. The chin area resolved after about 4 hours. The arm itching did not resolved. i woke up on 01/22/21 with the entire left shoulder area swollen, red, hot to the touch, and extremely itchy. it lasted all day. I woke up on 01/23/21 and the swelling had gone down, but the redness spread to a larger area on the upper left arm and the itching persisted all day. I woke up on 01/24/21 and the redness and swelling was almost gone but the itching was still there and the area that had swollen up felt very bruised, but no visible bruising. Today (01/25/21) there is no more itching or redness but the bruised sensation continues.

Upon returning to work in the pharmacy, she sat down at her desk and noted her HR to be 159 via her Apple watch. She felt slightly lightheaded, so returned to  Auditorium for monitoring. On arrival, she complained only of high HR, no other symptoms. We checked her VS: BP 140/78, HR 132, RR 20, SaO2 94. She denied chest pain or SOB. We monitored her for about 15 minutes, and her HR decreased to 103-110. We monitored her for another 15 minutes or so, at which time her HR spiked again to 132, and she felt heavy in her chest and tight in her throat. At that point, we moved her to a gurney and called a Rapid Response. We administered 50mg of Benadryl IM per protocol, foregoing the Epinephrine, due to her tachycardic state. The Rapid Response team arrived and she was transported to the ED for evaluation. She maintained consciousness and was A&amp;Ox3 the entire time.

My lips were getting numb. I was confused and unable to participate in a work phone call I answered.  12:45 I began driving as I felt a little better. Drove 2 miles and pulled over to park and wait it out. Heart still racing, hives still present, chest pains still there and could not inhale deeply.  12:50 I drove the rest of the way home. I took a double dose of liquid Benadryl and laid down waiting for symptoms to pass. They slowly resolved over the next 6 hours.  It is now 1/30/21 and I still feel like crap, but not allergy wise. More like the flu.

Overnight, I was awoken by continued shooting  pains all over my body, and also fine shaking.  Around 2AM a headache started and progressed to be the worst headache of my life.  It was received in the morning by tylenol.  In the morning, I experienced extreme exhaustion and dizziness after climbing stairs I almost passed out, had to rest on the floor.  Later in the day I experienced hours of chills, a temp to 103, which came down with tylenol. By the evening I was feeling well but tired.  Today, 2 days after vaccination, I have neck soreness and am a little tired but well.

                                                Patient received the vaccine on 1/27/21. That evening, the patient began to have an increase in heart rate. It seemed to decrease/normalize the following two days.  On Saturday (1/30/21), her heart rate became elevated again. Other symptoms the patient experienced included: feeling a sense of burning inside, nausea, shaking and sometimes short of breath. Patient went to the ER on Saturday and treated for an allergic reaction. On 2/1/21, the patient started developing a rash and became itchy. Patient followed-up with PCP and again prescribed medications for an allergic reaction. It was also recommended for patient not to receive the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.

Fever peaked at 12 hours post vax at 102.9. Fever down to 101.5 the next morning upon rising, and down to 100.5 by 08:30 that morning (about 24 hours post vax). At 24 hours post vax, still somewhat weak, with head/neck/back pain, but improving, down to 5/10 on pain scale. Did NOT treat with medications, treated with lots of fluids, rest.

                                                I had previous anaphylaxis events that were treated and did not require hospitalization. I brought epinephrine pen and premedicated with Xyzal 5mg 9 hours before and Benadryl 25mg 1.5 hours before vaccine. 20 minutes after vaccine I felt flushing, nausea, low blood pressure. They had released me from the drive through vaccination site and I was driving and felt panicky, so I pulled over. I waited 10 minutes because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anaphylaxis or not. I felt OK after 10 minutes, so I drove to nearest ER and waited in parking lot several hours then drove home. I probably should have administered epinephrine and called 911 when I had that reaction. Continued with 25mg Benadryl every 4 hours and nightly Xyzal 5mg. The next morning (24 hours later)  I woke up scratching my face. I had a diffuse sandpaper rash all over my head and neck and was very itchy. Doubled my dose of Benadryl to 50mg every 4 hours. Also took 400mg of quercetin. The itching resolved and the rash was gone the next day, which was 48 hours after vaccine. I was fatigued for several days but fatigue is my baseline as a narcoleptic plus I was taking benadryl. I continued the Benadryl for a total of 4 days. I normally do not develop rashes unless I rub against hay and I did not have any contact with hay.

I was in the middle of treating a PT. Scratchy throat; mild cough; persistent moderate headache; runny nose; diarrhea; very pale. Never had a fever. I had weird neurological side affects (didn&#39;t lose taste or smell  ) issues with facial recognition - didn&#39;t recognize my own face and finding words for every day objects and making sentences was difficult . I was easily winded and had tightness in my lungs. I called Public Health office - and asked them what to do. She told me to go home. Dr  (telehealth visit) told me to take a test in the parking lot that day for COVID January 6. Treatment  - none. All o f my symptoms lasted until Friday January 8 except being winded and fatigued. Those last two symptoms lasted until January 19.  Verbal issues also lasted until the 19th of January. Facial recognition came back around January 12.  On January 27 I had second dose.

After 5 minutes she felt warm and her heart was racing.  After 3 more minutes her muscles started contracting and she was nonresponsive and was trying to throw herself out of her chair.  I gave her an epipen injection in her left leg.  After 30- 60 seconds she was calming down and was becoming responsive again.  911 was called and she left with emergency personnel.

                                                Patient began experiencing pain and difficulty walking on Tuesday, March 23. Later that afternoon she was taken to an Urgent care, who sent her to the ER for evaluation. She was diagnosed with a very large blood clot in her leg, spanning from just above the knee to her groin area. They admitted her and began treating her with blood thinners.  While undergoing that treatment, her heart stopped 3 times and she had to be resuscitated. They discovered a pulmonary embolism.  While removing a large clot from her lungs, the doctor found that her lungs were riddled with hundreds of tiny blood clots. They also said that she was bleeding internally, very heavily, from an unknown location. In all, they gave her 20 units of blood, and none of it stayed in her veins.
