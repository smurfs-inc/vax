                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                18 year old female came to hospital for chest tightness, choking sensation in the throat as well as skin rash after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.  Initially patient presented to emergency room but subsequently discharged on steroid and Benadryl.  Patient had continued episode of choking as well as chest tightness and skin rash for that patient came back to emergency room.  Patient had received total 5 doses of epi pen because of that.  Patient was admitted to medical floor initially.  Patient was given steroid, Benadryl and famotidine.  Patient had 2 episodes on medical floor where she started feeling choking and chest tightness.  Patient remained stable hemodynamically except for tachycardia.  Patient was transferred to intensive care unit for close monitoring.  D-dimer was negative, urine tox screen was negative, COVID-19 PCR was negative, EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  CT scan of neck was negative.  We had discussed that patient has remained stable hemodynamically in the intensive care unit and discharge planning was discussed and patient was getting ready to be discharged when she had another episode where after drinking soda patient started having that choking sensation, patient remained stable hemodynamically during this episode as well.  Her symptoms had improved.  She looked visibly anxious.  Patient was monitored in the ICU for few more hours and patient remained stable.  I checked back on her and she was able to eat her lunch.  She probably had a allergic reaction to more than a vaccine but subsequent episodes are thought to be secondary to anxiety attack given situation.

When RN and I reached patient she was very weak, she was sitting in a chair. I instructed her colleauges to call 911 immediately. Patient was having a little trouble breathing. I think she was scared. I gave her 10 mlL of benedryl and RN administered a 0.5 mL dose of epinephine in her left arm. Patient was helped to the  floor and her feet were elevated.  RN put on a blood pressure cuff. Before she could get a reading, the paramedics were there and took over. Patient was transported to Hospital.

I became pale, had fatigue, headache, stomach ache, and the arm i recieved the vaccine in was sore to the point I couldn&#39;t hardly move it. These side effects lasted until 12/25/2020. I had no fever and after the 25th I felt fine.

Dr. was updated  and we had orders for close monitoring, the next day when she got up, her leg appeared better, and she had passed a small BM, but by lunch she had developed significant pain and edema in her left leg, and the color of her leg was reddened again.  She was sent to the emergency room with  her symptoms.   She was admitted back to our facility  yesterday, her diagnoses included Acute provoked left external illiac, femoral, popliteal, and peroneal DVT.  Elevated Factor II levels, Elevated APC resistant, May-Thurner Syndrome, history of developmental disabilities, fecal impaction and urinary retention - suspected related to her fecal impaction.  Vascular surgery was consulted,  and pt. was  started on a heparin drip, and mechanical thrombectomy was needed for both legs due to multiple clots.  She was started on Eliquis and Plavix, and thigh high compression stockings were ordered, ace wraps being used until these are supplied.  Her Fecal impaction was addressed also and the urinary retention resolved.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

                                                Patient complained about chest tightness 15 minutes after vaccination, with no breathing problems. Asked patient to sit by me so that I could observe her. Checked blood pressure and was elevated. Administered Benadryl 50 mg one time by mouth to patient. Checked patient blood pressure a 2nd time and was 138/88 mmHg and patient was starting to feel a little wheezy. Decided that since patient seemed to be having an asthmatic episode that we would call EMS to pick her up and they arrived.

Followed up with my cardiologist; have to get an echocardiogram done and then an electrophysiology test/heart cath done in the near future.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

When she got to work and found me about 9:30 am to ask if that was normal I encouraged her to call her PCP and take a Benadryl. At that time she was having no difficulty breathing. She chose to call her PCP and not take a Benadryl as it makes her sleepy.  After she called her PCP she ended up leaving work. I found out later that her breathing had become labored and her neck/throat was starting to swell. Per her report, her PCP gave her epi and steroids, and R/X her an epi pen. She took her medicine and Benadryl around the clock and returned to work on 1-8-2021. When I spoke to her on that day she stated all of her symptoms had resolved, but her lymph nodes in her neck were still a little swollen.

                                                I got up to use the bathroom at 4:30 this morning. I was extremely shaky but made it. I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 2/10/21 and had a large, red, inflamed area on her arm at the injection site for a few days, but otherwise tolerated vaccine well. She received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/10/21 and the next day (3/11/21) developed fatigue and lightheadedness while exercising, which continued for the next few days. She developed acute onset, sharp chest pain on 3/13/21 AM which did not resolve so she presented to an ED. Vitals were normal but labs notable for troponin I which peaked at 4.36, CK 758, d-dimer 640. CBC/CMP and EKG were unremarkable and initial TTE with EF ~45%. Repeat TTE obtained a few days later with normal LV and RV size/function without any wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac MRI obtained with normal LV function (EF 64%) but late gadolinium enhancement in a subepicardial distribution within the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle at the base most compatible with myocarditis. ESR and CRP were normal. Further workup to determine etiology of myocarditis was negative (ANA, ANCA, RF, hepatitis panel, HIV, full respiratory viral panel, COVID-19 PCR). She was placed on metoprolol succinate 12.5mg XL daily and will follow up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. Family concerned that COVID-19 vaccine was the trigger/underlying etiology of her myocarditis.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

No difficulty breathy per paramedics but when they arrived she passed out a second time and paramedics opted to take patient to hospital for observation.

                                                Less than 24 hours after receiving the vaccine (Jan 7), I started experiencing bad stomach pain, which a family friend had also experienced after she received the vaccine (also ~24 hours later). It did not subside with time, and became feeling like a shooting pain that was coming and going in waves, and I could not sleep that night. I was nauseous at one point, and threw up. I drank water throughout the night, which seemed to help a little bit and was taking an NSAID. The following day (Jan 8), the shooting pain continued, and I was in bed all day. I became nauseous at one point during the day, when attempting to move a piece of furniture, but did not throw up. I continued taking NSAIDs, which did not help. I was able to sleep through the night after taking melatonin, but was in discomfort. The following day (Jan 9), I woke up, and the shooting stomach pain had radiated to my chest, and had not subsided. I called my PCP, who I was unable to see due to timing/distance from the office, and she recommended I go to an ED if I did not feel better. As the pain was in my chest, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it had radiated there or was cardiac related, I had a friend drive me to the ED. My results came back normal at the ED, and the PA was only able to tell me that it was GI related, due to the pain in my stomach/esophagus. She was unsure if it&#39;s GERD, gas trapped, or some other GI issue. I am still experiencing this pain (Jan 11), but have somewhat managed it by taking Tums and eating alkaline foods.

My chest felt heavy and I was having labored breathing, My heart was racing at 160bpm and my blood pressure was 180/90, both of which are very high and abnormal for me.  I had severe joint and muscle pain. I had the chills and could not stop shaking.  I was very weak and could not even move out of bed, Leading to me calling 911 for an ambulance at 10:21pm. They kept me in the Emergency department until 5:30am because they could not get my heart rate to stay down. Stony Brook nurse told me it was okay to get vaccine even though I was infected with COVID-19 ON 12/15/2020.

Repeated ER visit two days later with a similar problem. PCP and ER physician deduced COVID vaccine interference. My body is burning through my food faster than I can normally replace it. Recommended frequent meals and rest until symptoms cease. Conducted blood work, urine samples, and EKG to rule out other factors during both ER visits.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

                                                Severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction; Passed out on the ground; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 22-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and passed out on the ground and had a severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.     On an unknown date, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    About 10 minutes after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, the patient passed out on the ground having a severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction.  Treatment for the event included two doses of epinephrine IM in addition to diphenhydramine, ondansetron, and steroids to prevent a rebound reaction. 911 was called and after epinephrine and diphenhydramine were administered, the patient was immediately transported to the hospital where she stayed for 6 more hours for observation, fluids, and further medications.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The events, passed out on the ground and severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction, were considered resolved; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Anaphylactic reaction is a listed event in CCDS.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:30am. About a half hour after receiving the vaccine, I felt dizziness and very slight chest tightness. I took benadryl, and was relieved of these symptoms. Then, around 9pm that night, I developed a fever. The highest temperature I recorded was 101.9. I took Ibuprofen around 11pm, and was afebrile by 3am. I have not had any fevers since, and I did have to call off work New Year&#39;s day. I have had an intermittent, mild headache since receiving the vaccine as well,  but overall I feel fine.

Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, January 5th at 9:00 AM. I felt fine immediately following the vaccine but quickly felt worse throughout the day. I developed a fever of 101.4F with medicine, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and general malaise. I know these are all common symptoms, so I didn&#39;t worry too much. However, my fever has persisted. I stayed home from work Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday due to not feeling well and still having a fever. Thursday, I also developed pain in my armpit with movement and palpation. I am guessing that pain in related to swollen lymph nodes. Friday, the pain in my armpit seemed to spread into my arm. Most of my armpit and the upper inside of my bicep is extremely tender to movement and touch. Today, I still have some tenderness in my arm and my fever is still present. Throughout this week, my fever has remained around 100F, even with Tylenol and ibuprofen.   I contacted my PCP yesterday about my concern for my persistent fever and arm pain. They believe that because I tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020, that I am reacting to the first dose of the vaccine as if I am receiving the second dose of the vaccine. They advised me to continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. I am worried that if I receive the second dose of the vaccine, I will be sick for longer.

Almost 1 hour post vaccine I started to feel a lump in my throat, as the minutes passed my throat started to feel tighter and fight and flight mode kicked in.  It was hard to swallow, my tongue was swelling and I called EMS at 2:40 pm 1/13/2021.  EMS noticed hives on my chest and left arm where I got the first dose of Moderna.  I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

                                                awoke at 2 am  with nausea, chills, generalized pain. Immediately felt myself start to pass out or have a seizure- I am not sure which. Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

No history of anaphylaxis. She received vaccine at 5:42. Felt lightheaded and dizzy about 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine. She noted chest tightness and tachycardia symptoms. We transported her via gurney to our observation area. She looked sleepy and had trouble arousing her. Blood pressure is 140/80, heart rate was in the 90s to 100s. Breath sound decreased bilaterally. No lip swelling. No rash. She noted throat felt uncomfortable.  Suspect anaphalxis reaction given rapid decline in status while talking with her. epic pen at bedside immediately and then due to increasing heart rate and complaints of chest discomfort gave her epipen times one. Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

                                                Pt c/o itching and tingling at site of injection.  Upon inspection RN observed redness, swelling, and irritation where pt had been scratching the site.  Offered to give pt benadryl on site, but pt refused because it &#34;knocks her out&#34; for 13 hours.  Advised to take a non-drowsy antihistamine when able, use cold compress, and stop scratching the site.  Pt was asked if she was having any other issues at that time, which she denied.  Telephone call made to patient at 4:18pm to follow up.  Pt stated she started to have an itchy throat and throat swelling and went to the hospital.  There she was offered Benadryl but declined.  She was given a steroid injection because she was having &#34;difficulty breathing&#34;.  Pt states ER doctor recommended a non-drowsy OTC antihistamine, and was unable to tell her if the difficulty breathing was an allergic reaction or due to anxiety.  Recommended following up with 2nd dose in 4 weeks but to see her PCP before that time to discuss.  Pt does not have PCP, so I recommended that she establish care and have an appt prior to her 2nd dose

                                                On 1/4/21 at around 1:30 pm, I was getting ready for work when all of a sudden I started to feel really terrible. My heart was racing, body and face was sweating, externally nauseous, dizzy, blurred/fuzzy vision, body shaking, the room was spinning,  and I was unable to stand up. This would happen every time I got out of bed and stood up. Lasted about 2 hours.

                                                Patient complained of shortness of breath/tightness in chest.  3 RNs present to assess and evaluate with epilepsy-pen on hand to administer as necessary.  Patient has not had any reactions to any previous vaccinations.  Upon assessment, the patient was alert &amp; oriented and was responding to questions.  Patient was not tachycardia nor did she have any tachypnea with heart rate @ 86, RR @ 18, SPO2 @ 99%.  Breath sounds were reported to be CTA bilaterally (conducted by RN &amp; director of clinical operations).  Patient&#39;s legs were evaluated, cold compress applied to back of neck, &amp; she was instructed to take slow, deep breaths (in through nose, out through mouth to prevent hyperventilation).  Patient remained conscious, alert, and responsive entire time.  EMSA/emergency response arrived at 1200 to evaluate.  Care relinquished at that time.

She took a photo of this and showed it to me today and well. The swelling around the eyes seemed minimal. Her lips were swollen. She also notes that she felt tired and had a mild shortness of breath where she felt more comfortable sitting up. She states these symptoms have somewhat improved, though she has been experiencing increasing nausea since yesterday and continues to feel that way. She states that she does not believe she is pregnant, she has an IUD. She also noticed some body aches yesterday, continuing this morning, but they seem to be improving. They do improve greatly with ibuprofen at home.

Post vaccination she was seated in the passenger seat in vaccine pod observation lot and felt like she &#34;was going to pass out&#34;.

EMS was call and she was shortly thereafter taken to a local ED via non emergent transport. Her husband had driven her to the pod site and did not receive a vaccination.  She was discharged home yesterday.

                                                I received my vaccine around 12:45pm. They had me go to waiting room and wait for 10 mins. I sat down and was waiting for a few minutes when I started to get dizzy. I looked up and told the lady checking people in ?hey I?m getting really dizzy can I lay down? she said yes come in the room. When I stood up my heart started beating really fast. I sat on the table and my chest started feeling tight and heavy. There were 2 ladies in the room at this point so I asked one of them if they had an epipen on hand just in case. My throat wasn?t swelling but it was getting harder to breath from the tightness in my chest. She said they didn?t have an epipen and would have to call emergency services if I needed one. I told her I didn?t know what was going on, that I didn?t need one yet but she should probably call emergency services if they can?t do anything to help me. (ER is right across the street) my symptoms went away shortly after they called. But came on a couple more times but much milder over the next 30 minutes or so. The EMT gave me Benadryl and the ER ran some tests.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

The lymph node in the armpit of the arm that received the vaccination was also swollen, painful, and palpable. I also felt more fatigue than I normally do. Symptoms resolved within 2 days.

For at least about 1-2 hours.   Additionally at about 9:00pm to the next morning 1/20/21 I began to get pain in my armpit I examined using my fingers and felt it sesintive to touch and consulted with a physician who said my lymph nodes must be swollen as a response.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

                                                The day after the vaccine I started spotting  and my back started getting numbness down my legs. I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

Started off being disoriented and light headed which led to me losing consciousness. Would go in and out of consciousness until sternum checked multiple times. Got picked up by the ambulance and taken to the hospital as blood pressure was low and was fevering per first responder. Had an ekg with tachycardia, once delivered to the hospital. Still in and out of consciousness. Stayed there roughly 6-7 hours and received fluids and magnesium before being discharged,
