                                                Vasovagal Syncope; unauthorized age patient, 17 years of age; This spontaneous case was reported by a nurse and describes the occurrence of SYNCOPE (Vasovagal Syncope) in a 17-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 012A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Congenital heart disease NOS since 22-May-2003.    On 01-Mar-2021 at 2:30 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 01-Mar-2021 at 2:30 PM, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Vasovagal Syncope) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and PRODUCT ADMINISTERED TO PATIENT OF INAPPROPRIATE AGE (unauthorized age patient, 17 years of age). On 01-Mar-2021, SYNCOPE (Vasovagal Syncope) had resolved. On 01-Mar-2021 at 2:30 PM, PRODUCT ADMINISTERED TO PATIENT OF INAPPROPRIATE AGE (unauthorized age patient, 17 years of age) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered SYNCOPE (Vasovagal Syncope) to be unlikely related. No further causality assessment was provided for PRODUCT ADMINISTERED TO PATIENT OF INAPPROPRIATE AGE (unauthorized age patient, 17 years of age).    No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   The patient did not receive any treatment. The event, SYNCOPE (vasovagal syncope) was an acute episode and recovered quickly within minutes.  Follow-up received on 06-APR-2021 included additional reporter information, date of vaccine administration, patient&#39;s race, ethnicity and other relevant medical history, start and dates of product administered and the events, anatomical location, and reporter causality.  This report refers to a case of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered for mRNA-1273 (lot #unknown) with no associated syncope reported. The reporter considered SYNCOPE to be unlikely related.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 06-Apr-2021: additional reporter information, date of vaccine administration, patient&#39;s race, ethnicity and concurrent condition, additional event - Syncope, onset and stop dates of the event, - Product administered to patient of inappropriate age, injection site, and reporter causality.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered for mRNA-1273 (lot #unknown) with no associated syncope reported.The reporter considered SYNCOPE to be unlikely related.

A few days after that my muscles started twitching and haven&#39;t stopped. I feel like something is crawling under my skin and the vaccine is extremely affecting my nervous system. I did not have this problem before I had the vaccine. It has not gone away and it is now April 23rd I still feel weak, not the same as I used to feel before having the vaccine, and my muscles are twitching all over my body. My face is twitching and my eye and there is nothing I can do to make it stop. I am so young and I thought the vaccine was safe but I am suffering from it. Especially in my feet I feel like they are tingling and vibrating and my calves are convulsing too. Meanwhile, my heart is fluttering and I feel like it is very hard for me to focus and I feel things crawling under my skin in my brain.  The muscle convulsions are happening everywhere.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                Patient received vaccine around 430pm. As she was sitting for post-vaccine observation she told an associate to call over Rph due to side effects. After speaking with patient she stated that her arm was numb (vaccinated arm) and that it hurt more than when she got her flu shot. I assessed both arms an her vaccinated arm was slightly swollen. I described the signs of anaphylaxis to her and told her that i would like for her to stay longer for extra monitoring and to alarm me or one of my associates if any anaphylaxis symptoms occur. Patients blood pressure was taken reading - 132/96. Patient was unsure of her baseline so i explained i will check again shortly. Patient was given water and one dose of Benadryl (25mg) at 5:25pm as well as an ice pack to place on her arm. At 6:00pm patients blood pressure was retaken (124/82) and patient stated she was well enough to go home. Her grandma was with her and stated she didn&#39;t have Benadryl at home, I recommend her to get some and gave the patient another dose (25mg) before her grandma took her home.  Patient has no primary care physician.

                                                18 year old female came to hospital for chest tightness, choking sensation in the throat as well as skin rash after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.  Initially patient presented to emergency room but subsequently discharged on steroid and Benadryl.  Patient had continued episode of choking as well as chest tightness and skin rash for that patient came back to emergency room.  Patient had received total 5 doses of epi pen because of that.  Patient was admitted to medical floor initially.  Patient was given steroid, Benadryl and famotidine.  Patient had 2 episodes on medical floor where she started feeling choking and chest tightness.  Patient remained stable hemodynamically except for tachycardia.  Patient was transferred to intensive care unit for close monitoring.  D-dimer was negative, urine tox screen was negative, COVID-19 PCR was negative, EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  CT scan of neck was negative.  We had discussed that patient has remained stable hemodynamically in the intensive care unit and discharge planning was discussed and patient was getting ready to be discharged when she had another episode where after drinking soda patient started having that choking sensation, patient remained stable hemodynamically during this episode as well.  Her symptoms had improved.  She looked visibly anxious.  Patient was monitored in the ICU for few more hours and patient remained stable.  I checked back on her and she was able to eat her lunch.  She probably had a allergic reaction to more than a vaccine but subsequent episodes are thought to be secondary to anxiety attack given situation.

                                                Approximately 7-8 minutes after receiving the vaccine, started to feel light-headed, thought she was going to pass out, and her heart was racing extremely high. The health care team at the site took her blood pressure, measured heart rate, gave her water, juice and chocolate and tried to get her heart rate to drop. It was fluctuating up and down and she couldn&#39;t stand up without dizziness;  we waited 45 minutes and then drove her home as she was unable to drive her own car.  She was experiencing significant lightheadedness, and consistent heart racing even while lying down on the sofa/bed. This continued for several days and she stayed home from school and sports. We called her primary care doctor on the 10th and they suggested she wait another day to see how she was feeling. She started to feel a bit better by Friday, was still experiencing a bit of the tiredness, nauseous, light-headed and heart spikes, but was able to drive, move around.  On Sunday evening, she started to experience increased heart rate again, lymph nodes were very painful and started experiencing the light headedness all evening.  On Monday we took her to her primary care provider and they then referred her to ER for the heart racing and a EKG. The increased light headedness, feeling like she will pass out even while laying in bed, dizziness has all increased and her lymph nodes continue to be swollen and painful. It has been over a week since the vaccine and there is no clear sign of her reaction getting any better, if not worse.  The EKG results indicated a new abnormality and we are trying to get her to a cardiologist.  She is and had been a very healthy, varsity athlete that runs over 30 hours a week with track, and since receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine is unable to move very far within the house without feeling that she is going to pass out or that her heart rate is shooting up uncontrollably.

                                                I started having the symptoms in the afternoon. I was really fatigued and throwing up multiple times (nothing left in my stomach); had chest pain. My boyfriend rushed me to the hospital. While I was at the hospital (about 3:00 am) I threw up again at the hospital. They monitored me and put an IV on me. When I was able to hold down water and stop throwing up they let me go home - which was about 7. Prescribed Zofran and Pepsin.  And they put me on a clear liquid diet for a day.  They told me to Zofran, Pepsin and Benadryl before the second dose and told me to eat a meal before getting the second dose and I had no symptoms at all with second dose.

Patient was helped by the EMS provider, went to the hospital, discharged, the parent called back later saying she was doing fine now.

                                                Initially she passed out following the vaccine - within 90 seconds- she has a history of passing out with injections and blood draws. Around noon she had a seizure. She describes a feeling of darkness and dread closing in on her and she was unable to speak or move. She was on the stairs at the time. I witnessed her stiffen, then go limp and fall between the electric stair hair and the wall. She hit the hardwood floor face first then she began to shake/twitch. She was unconscious. She awoke screaming, incoherent speech, and flailing limbs. It took about 5 minutes to calm her and be able to understand her speech. She only remembers the darkness and waking up scared and feeling awful. She was put supine on the floor with feet elevated, blood pressure monitored, given juice to drink, and vitals checked routinely. After about an hour supine and conscious, she felt good enough to sit up. She sat up for 15 minutes before she was able to stand with assistance. Family physician was notified immediately and we are still waiting for a response. She has a goose egg sized knot on her forehead, a bruise on the side of her face and a black eye from hitting the floor. She has a huge bruise on her outer thigh and lower leg where she hit the stair chair and then seized and it it repeatedly on the metal. She has underarm pain from where her armpit hit the edge of the stairs when she fell and seized. She has no history of any types of seizures.

Remained in pharmacy area for about 30 minutes post-administration with no further incident.  Patient&#39;s mother notified us today that patient had a seizure several hours later that same day at approx 12 noon.

                                                I had horrible shaking/trembling in my arms, chest, and legs about six hours after the vaccine, and they continued for about four hours more, uncontrollably. I passed out briefly around 12 hours after the vaccine, and I&#39;m not sure how long I remained unconscious. Through all of this, my left arm was difficult to move or use, I felt hot suddenly and then cold, and I was tired. The next day, the most serious side effects were gone, but I remained feverish, tired, and largely unable to move my left arm. Those side effects were gone on the third day and now I&#39;m better.

Prior to leaving, and as pt was being transferred from one stretcher to the transport stretcher, pt experienced another syncopal episode.   No arrhythmia noted on monitor, BP running 70&#39;s/50&#39;s. Awake, sluggish but oriented to person and place upon leaving.  Transported via monitored stretcher to the ER.

Nurse, the immunizer, was there with her and her mother the entire time. We observed pt for over 30minutes and they left the pharmacy with no other symptoms.  I called pt the next morning and she stated that fainting was a \&#34;normal reaction...I get it everytime I get a shot\&#34;.  She is in between doctors right now and does not feel like we need to contact him.  Will talk to her new doctor next time she is seen

                                                The 12:20 pm appointment today (4/20/21) had an adverse reaction to the IMZ. Patient was done receiving the vaccine at about 12:30 pm and I stated she would have to wait until 12:45 pm. Around 12:38 pm I noticed she looked a little pale and went to her side to check on her. The patient stated she was feeling light-headed, dizzy, nauseous, and had trouble with her vision. I had the patient lay down and elevate her feet. The technician also grabbed an ice pack to place behind her neck. Asked if she would like water. The patient then stated she was having trouble breathing/short of breath and her ears were ringing. Once the patient stated issues with breathing 911 was called. A code white had been called and management was in the pharmacy. The 911 operator continued to ask questions about the patient&#39;s status and stated to not give any water or medications. I continued to assess the patient&#39;s symptoms. Her vision improved; however, she continued to feel light-headed, nauseous, and having trouble breathing. A member of EMS was in the store and came over to assess the patient. He had the patient sit up but she continued to have the same symptoms. He assessed her IMZ site. She was not feeling itchy and had not developed any hives. The ambulance arrived. EMS evaluated the patient and then took her out of the store on the stretcher.

While EMS was evaluating the patient in the pharmacy, she stated that she was beginning to have trouble breathing; but those symptoms quickly resolved without the administration of epinephrine. We received a phone call from the patient within 2 hours stating that she was being discharged from the hospital and was feeling much better.

She came back shortly saying she was feeling a little funny so she wanted to sit in our room.  She left again after several minutes then came back around 5:20 saying she felt like she was going to pass out.  I told her to sit in our waiting room.  She said she felt faint and had tightness in her chest. I called the paramedics who arrived shortly after.  They said she had anxiety.  She was anxious before and after receiving the vaccine.  She left on her own.

                                                Patient received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine today at our pharmacy and on the way to the waiting chair she came up to the pharmacy counter and started to say that she felt a little nauseous. She then fainted and I rushed up to the counter and she was already sitting up, very pale. When she was ready we helped her up to the waiting chair and gave her a bottle of water. Her mother was with her to care for her. She waited almost a half hour and felt fine so they both left. She did mention that she was afraid of needles so potentially she could&#39;ve been thinking about that when she fainted.

After ~5-10 minutes her dad told me she  wasn&#39;t feeling well. I went straight to the patient who was still sitting, looking pale and being fanned by her mother. I said let&#39;s lay her down but she lost conciousness right then so I just caught her in her chair.  A technician  called 911. An associate took over holding the patient in her chair. We raised her feet on to another chair, her mother continued to fan her face. I sent another associate to meet the responders at the front door and bring them to us. Patient was breathing throughout. She started to regain conciousness before the responders arrived. They checked her out and gave her permission to go home with her parents.

She reports she had pain in her teeth and her chest felt tight. She just didn&#39;t feel well. Closer to incident student felt dizzy, like she was &#34;going to pass out&#34;.  States she turned to someone to tell that person she was not feeling well &#34;but I couldn&#39;t talk; the words would not come out&#34;. She felt herself sway and then knew she fell to the floor. She felt like she was lying still for a bit but she could hear people around her and she heard someone say &#34;somebody start timing this&#34; (as if they knew it was a seizure).

She had mentioned that she was very anxious about the shot while I gave it to her.  After I came out to her, she was very pale and I gave her some water.  I had her call her boyfriend to come inside. One of the technicians called the squad to come check her out.  They did so, and they left shortly after.  She mentioned that they told her she could either go to the hospital and be observed or go home.  She said she wanted to go home.  She and her boyfriend went home

I monitored her closely for 20 to 30 minutes, at this time she stated she had begun to experience tingling in her arms and hands. At that time, I suggested to her aunt(legal guardian) that she be monitored in a more appropriate setting. We offered to call paramedics, the aunt on behalf of the patient declined, stating she would bring her to the ER.

                                                Pt explained on Covid-19 consent form that she has syncope when seeing a needle. She explained she has an intense fear of needles and has fainted in the past when getting vaccinations. She also explained that she has anxiety. She explained that when she faints it looks like a seizure but it is not. When pt was given shot she was responsive during the needle going in.  She was in a seated position. We talked the entire time of administration. After putting the the bandage on her right arm she explained she felt sick(about 40 seconds after injection).  She was still responsive for about two minutes then she fainted and her body shook about two times.  My coworker and I got her on the ground, she was still responsive enough to ask for a cup of water. Which we gave her, she then went unresponsive for 20 seconds and spilled the water. After this we sat with her on the ground for another 5 minutes and she said she was fine. We helped her to a seated position.  We then made her wait  another 30 minutes in our waiting area. She assured us she was fine and reiterated that this has happened before in the past anytime a needle was involved.  On 5/2/2021 she was contacted and she explained she looked a little pale throughout the day of vaccination, but feels fine now and just has a sore arm.

She went to the emergency room at Hospital at about 5 PM. They did bloodwork and her platelet count was 3 she was diagnosed with ITP idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. She was perfectly healthy before this. This condition leads to bleeding and bruising her rash was actually very small bruises. That hospital felt she needed to be seen by a hematologist and oncologist so they transferred her to their main campus. Where she was admitted around midnight to the Hospital.

                                                8 days after injection I had a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (?covid vaccine arm?), symptoms included firmness and a red patch on my upper arm near the injection site. The following morning, I woke up feeling well with the rash still on my arm (no change). 2 hours later I began feeling dizzy and fainted. I was unconscious for 5 to 10 seconds. When I woke up, the rash had vanished and the firmness was gone. No signs of the reaction were present after waking.

                                                The patient informed me before giving the second dose of Moderna that she has fainted for every single vaccine she has ever been given including the first dose of Moderna. She stated it usually happens one to two minutes after receiving the vaccine and that she comes to within 10-15 minutes. Her father has been with her for every vaccination, and she just rests her head on his stomach. I informed the other pharmacist on duty of this and had EpiPen and smelling salts on hand just in case. We were all ready to react in case of any emergency. The patient did faint after sitting for a couple of minutes. She knew it was about to happen and her father stepped in to let her rest her head. We had her feet raised on a chair. She was still breathing the entire time, so we used smelling salts to bring her to which worked. She was out for close 10 minutes, but still breathing normally. The smelling salts enabled her to respond and nod that she was okay. When she came to, she asked for water and a sticker, which we gave her, and she acted as if nothing had happened and was all smiles. We did get a member of management to come fill out a report.

Needed assistance to stand and could not hold a pencil to write. Also numbness and tingling in hands and fingers. Face slightly swollen and red.  400 mg Ibuprofen was administered at  1530. Pushed fluids as soon as fever began. Cooling measures provided, cool shower, cold compress, change of clothes to light pajamas.  We contacted our Insurance 24 hour Nurse line at approximately 2100 when symptoms peaked. The RN on staff instructed us to seek immediate medical care.  We attempted to find an open Urgent Care unsuccessfully and tried to go to an ER but they were full. Fever began to come down around 2230, so we returned home. Continued with ibuprofen every six hours and cooling measures.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

Decided that since patient seemed to be having an asthmatic episode that we would call EMS to pick her up and they arrived.

She cam back in side the room and we had a nurse assess her, her BP and heart rate were a  little elevated. We gave her some water and had her sit for some extra time while we talked to her. She has a child hood trauma regarding vaccine and had just had a major panic attack before and during her vaccination. We were all  pretty sure she had just worked her self up and was not feeling well because of that and she said as much herself. After about 15-20 more minutes her BP and heart rate were back to normal and although still feeling a little weak she was ready to go home with her mother.

Medical staff came to get the pharmacist on duty. We straightened her out and checked to make sure she was still breathing - she was still breathing. I went to call 911 and came back in the room with the phone while I was directed to do a breathing  test by the operator. Patient was moaning off and on during the time she was passed out. She was not responding  to verbal commands. She came to as the paramedics arrived. They took her to the hospital.

A few minutes after, I noticed my right arm was getting warm, but I thought I was being paranoid (placebo effect). I began to feel nauseated. About another 5 minutes after feeling warm and nauseous, my ears began to ring and my vision went white. I was cold but sweating. I have passed out a handful of times before for various reasons, so I knew what was happening. I tried to signal to a volunteer from my seat that I needed help, but I ended up laying on the ground by my chair before someone came over. Once I laid down, the attention of the volunteers and nurses was on me. Three came over to assist me. They held my legs up,  kept a hand on my wrist for a pulse, and fetched water. I talked myself through the dizziness and ringing in my ears. They put a cold rag on my forehead and had smelling salts on hand. Once I began to feel better, they helped me slowly sit up, and eventually helped me stand up and get into a chair. They kept a close eye on me for the next 30 minutes to make sure I didn?t have any other reactions.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID 19 Moderna vaccine on Tuesday morning. By Tuesday night I started to have virtually every side effect that Moderna listed including; fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea and vomiting, and extreme fever. The next morning as I woke up in attempt tp get ready for work, I was not feeling any better and began to feel light headed, and felt the need to vomit. As I had the feeling of needing to vomit, I turned to do so and fainted. From accounts by my family, I was told I woke up, and quickly passed out a second time. As I was awoken, there was probably a minute before I fainted for a third time. All three times I was told I lost consciousness. I was awoken and by that point my family had contacted emergency responders. Paramedics arrived and took all necessary vitals. I did not pass out after that third time. As I expected all side effects Moderna listed, I did not expect to feel as bad as I did and I thought it was worth reporting what happened to be the next day. It caused a panic and I was scared and nervous as I was unsure why that was happening. I&#39;ve tried to look up articles and links between passing out and the vaccine and all I can find is people fainting as they get the vaccine (which is common for any shot) but nothing for fainting that long after the vaccine was administered. I just wanted to report my incident.

                                                After receiving my second dose, I started to develop mouth ulcers covering the entire inside of my mouth. Throughout the weekend, they continued to develop. I went to the ER to receive pain medication, as the ulcers were so bad that I could not talk or eat. The following morning, I passed out going to pick up my medication at CVS, where I was taken back to the hospital in an ambulance and had a 103 degree fever. I was given IV fluids and was sent on my way. I was on strict bedrest for 4 days, until on Thursday 04/22/2021, I was readmitted to the ER due to worsening of the sores and lack of nutrition. For 3 days since then, I have been on IV fluids, pain medication, and taking a steroid solution to help the ulcers in my mouth lessen. The doctors here believe that it is an extremely strong reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine second dose.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

                                                Patient came to receive dose 2 of Covid19 Moderna vaccine. States 1 hour after the first dose (administered on  12/28/20) she was at work and her blood pressure dropped, she became dizzy and her face went white. She said her mother insisted she go to the ER to be examined. She states upon examination she was given fluids and tests were ran and the ER staff said she was fine. Explained this to physician at vaccine site and she said it was not a contraindication to receive 2nd dose and it sounds like possible vasovagal reaction or hypoglycemia. Patient states she still wanted to receive vaccine.  Was instructed to monitor patient for 30 minutes after vaccination,  assist patient in ambulation to waiting area to lower fall risk and provided patient with apple juice and trail mix in case of possible hypoglycemia.  About 5-10 minutes after vaccine, patient stated she became dizzy and was dry heaving. She was assisted to supine position; vitals were taken and blood pressure was slightly elevated. 911 was called. Before arrival of EMS, patient stated she was feeling better and vital signs stable. Patient was helped to ambulate around waiting area and upon arrival of EMS, patient states she did not need to be transported. Patient was observed for about 20-25 more minutes and she was fully recovered. Spoke with Dr who was on scene after the incident and she believes it was anxiety.

When I woke up the next morning I was short of breath and it felt like there was a lot of pressure on your chest. I called the hospital that gave me the vaccine and they recommended I go to the ER. I was discharged after 3 hours. I still felt short of breath and had the feeling of pressure on my chest for 48-56 hours. It just got better gradually. I was unable to work because I felt bad and because I also had to quarantine until my test results came back negative for Covid-19.

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

I was barely able to speak, calling out for my brothers to get my mom. I was continuing gasping for air while they called an ambulance. The paramedics arrived and checked my lungs and oxygen. By the time they arrived I was back to normal. I didn?t go to the hospital as they didn?t seem it was necessary and I was feeling okay. Later on in the day I just had some slight chest pain and some shortness of breath but it was gone by the end of the night. I?m completely fine now. I had no other symptoms or side effects.

                                                Immediate burning in arm right after receiving shot. 15 minutes after receiving shot began to feel tired and got a headache. Later on in the evening I had discomfort in my chest and had to use my inhaler. Pain in arm worsened over night; couldn&#39;t move arm at all. Pains spread into armpit and back. Got up at 3am to my body shivering, thinking I was running a fever I checked my temperature and it was normal but upon standing I had extreme dizziness to the point of almost passing&#39;s out, I had to sit down right away. Had nausea and whole body felt very sore an achey. The morning after my shot I woke with a headache, extreme pain in my arm and armpit, soreness all over my body, stomach pains, and my heart rate was high. Throughout the day my symptoms got worse I ran a fever of 102.7 which broke but then came back later on in the evening.  The following day my symptoms started to diminish, no fever and body was feeling better, arm pain and headache continued. Now I am on day 4 still experiencing pain in my arm and armpit, slight headache, but chest pains have started. It feels as if there is a brick on my chest, almost like a burning sensation with occasional pains in left breast as well as tightness in the left side of my neck.

She was breathing rapidly. She whispered that she was scared. I told her to take deep breaths to try and calm her. I asked if she felt hurt or if she has any trouble breathing. After about 3-5 minutes of lying on their ground, she became more alert and asked me if she fell from her chair. She didn&#39;t recall falling or that she said she was scared. I had her sit up and asked how she felt and if she had any symptoms of an allergic reaction--she said no. after another minute or 2, she was able to stand up on her own with no lightheadedness nor dizziness. I walked alongside her to another seat and she sat for another 25 to 30 minutes--she said she was completely fine before leaving with her sister

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

                                                Patient passed out just after getting to work. She hit her head - cheek &amp; chin - causing abrasion/contusion. This was NOT wittnessed; she does NOT recall passing out or hitting her head. A co-worker noticed something wasn&#39;t right &amp; had her sit down. They called my wife who picked her up &amp; brought home &amp; rested. Approximately 5.5 hours later, after feeling &#34;better,&#34; she got up to get something to eat. While returning to bed (to rest &amp; eat the small container of applesause) she felt as though she were going to pass out again &amp; quickly sat down on the steps. However, she did not call for me (I was in the room nextdoor) for a few minutes... seemingly having &#34;zoned out&#34; but she does not think she lost consciousness.

She felt better after 30 minutes and proceeded to go eat in her bedroom.  She was nervous and anxious prior to the vaccine and states that she thought that had something to do with it.  She then experienced a 10 second bout of muscle tension in her face and jaw which caused her to be unable to talk or speak for a few seconds.  She was brought back down to the hall for evaluation.  She felt as if she was having a stroke and that got her more worked up.  She denies lower body weakness.  She states that her head feels heavy and she complains of general fatigue.  No n/v.  No headache or blurry vision.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 2/10/21 and had a large, red, inflamed area on her arm at the injection site for a few days, but otherwise tolerated vaccine well. She received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/10/21 and the next day (3/11/21) developed fatigue and lightheadedness while exercising, which continued for the next few days. She developed acute onset, sharp chest pain on 3/13/21 AM which did not resolve so she presented to an ED. Vitals were normal but labs notable for troponin I which peaked at 4.36, CK 758, d-dimer 640. CBC/CMP and EKG were unremarkable and initial TTE with EF ~45%. Repeat TTE obtained a few days later with normal LV and RV size/function without any wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac MRI obtained with normal LV function (EF 64%) but late gadolinium enhancement in a subepicardial distribution within the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle at the base most compatible with myocarditis. ESR and CRP were normal. Further workup to determine etiology of myocarditis was negative (ANA, ANCA, RF, hepatitis panel, HIV, full respiratory viral panel, COVID-19 PCR). She was placed on metoprolol succinate 12.5mg XL daily and will follow up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. Family concerned that COVID-19 vaccine was the trigger/underlying etiology of her myocarditis.

                                                Minutes after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, patient complained of difficulty breathing.  I asked if she was wheezing and she said no.  A doctor in the clinic came over and even though it wasn&#39;t time for patient and her sister to leave (based on 15-minutes after receiving the vaccine) he initially suggested that they might be fine to go, but after patient told him of her symptoms and at my urging he decided to have her stay a little longer.   I think it was at this time that he had someone check her pulse.  I don&#39;t know what the pulse reading was.  He stepped away and shortly afterwards patient started complaining that her throat felt strange and was making it hard to breathe.  The doctor immediately came back over, found patient was having difficulty breathing and holding herself upright in the chair.  I held her by the shoulders to keep her from falling while the doctor also steadied her and asked a worker in the room for an epi-pen.  The worker didn&#39;t seem to react much to the request so he told her louder that he needed an epi-pen.  She started searching her area and the doctor started yelling across the room to others that he needed an epi-pen.  It seemed like others initially took the demand less urgently than they should, but eventually someone came with an epi-pen.  By this time I don&#39;t think patient was very conscious, if at all.  Sometime during this time the doctor also instructed someone to call 911.  The doctor tried using the epi-pen but at first he had some kind of cap on it that prevented it from working.  He removed the cap and not finding an easy way to have a sterilized injection site he injected the epi-pen through patient&#39;s jeans.  Soon afterwards a cot was brought out and workers had me step aside as they took patient and put her on the cot.  Patient seemed to gradually become more aware of her surroundings and it wasn&#39;t long before she appeared to me to be fully conscious once again.  They checked her blood pressure and pulse and maybe did other tests during this time.  Eventually the ambulance arrived and patient was very clear with everyone that she did not want to incur the expenses of riding in the ambulance and I offered to bring her wherever they suggested that she should go.  They watched and evaluated her for a while and eventually had her sign the form declining the ambulance transportation.  They suggested that she make an appointment with her doctor but did not suggest that we take patient to an emergency room.  We departed and patient did not afterward  seem to experience any symptoms from the vaccine other than some of the general feelings of being sick, soreness at the injection site, etc. that others report with the Moderna vaccine.

It is currently (3/24/21) and I have noticed sharp chest pains on the right side of my chest throughout the day, especially when exerting forces breathing (such as riding my bike or walking up stairs, or getting into and out of bed). I still have a slight fever and feel very cold, but I in fact, still have a slight fever of 100.4

At 2:45 I started getting a tight chest, tight throat, itchy mouth, itchy throat, hives, throat clearing, and throat hoarseness/ fading. I then took benadryl and a breathing treatment every 4 hours. It got worse later in the day and even worse the next day. The next day I had body aches, chills, headache, brain fog, dizziness, fever, itchy mouth, itchy throat  , hives, tight / thick throat, very tight chest, and difficulty breathing.

                                                Few hours after I got the vaccine I experienced sinus pressure in my left nostril. I went to blow my nose and a blood clot came out. I tried to blow my nose again but nothing came out. I went to sleep and the next day (the day after I got the vaccine) I still felt the same sinus pressure. I showered about mid-afternoon that day and after I got out of the shower my nose was bleeding, but it was a mild nose bleed. The rest of the day, I experienced a headache that felt like it was coming from the place I experienced the sinus pressure. The head got progressively worse as the day went on, I took Advil to get rid of the pain and went to sleep early. The next few days I experienced a headache that would be mild when I woke up in the morning, then got progressively worse as the day went on. Right now (4 days after the vaccine as I&#39;m submitting this report) the pain of the headache has somewhat subsided, but the pain is still present.

When we asked if she needed anything she stated she couldn&#39;t stand up or move her muscles. The ambulance was called and they arrived within 10 mins. She was brought to the ER and told that her blood pressure was low. She was treated with fluids and rest. I followed up with the patient this morning at 10am she stated she was feeling better.

                                                Fainting; Injection site soreness in arm; nauseous; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer  concerning a 21-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced, fainting (syncope), injection site soreness in arm (vaccination site pain), and nausea (nausea).  The patient&#39;s medical history included vasovagal condition that cause heart rate and blood pressure to drop due to stress on body and dehydration resulting in fainting. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 09 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 09 Feb 2021, the patient was fine until about 11 pm after which she experienced arm soreness on the injection site and felt nauseous.   On 10 Feb 2021, at 5 am in the morning, the patient fainted. The patient assumed that shot might have added stress to her body which most likely caused her to faint.   No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the event as patient would be receiving second dose on 09 Mar 2021.  The outcome of events, fainted (syncope), injection site soreness in arm (vaccination site pain), and nauseous (nausea), were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events of syncope, vaccination site pain, and nausea, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s prior medical history of vasovagal reactions is considered a contributing factor to syncope.

                                                I developed Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (low levels of platelets) and menorrhagia due to the vaccine according to my doctor. I believe there have been about 30 cases of this occurring so far.   In my case, I took the vaccine and felt relatively tired for two days. There were no other symptoms. About a week later, I got my period after not having it for a couple months. The blooding was light for a few days, but then got extremely heavy. After about a week of very heavy bleeding, I went to urgent care. They took blood tests, and found that I had a critically low level of platelets (6 platelets when the normal range is 150-400). I was admitted to the ER for multiple days, and they gave a platelet transfusion and IVIG  fluids, which has helped considerably. I also had to take steroids to suppress my immune system so that my platelets could increase.

                                                Vaccine given at 8:45 AM Shortly after vaccine (approximately 8 minutes) she started to complain of tingling in her vaccinated arm and she got a little diaphoretic - complained of being hot. Some heaviness in her chest  which progressed over next 10 minutes to feeling difficulty breathing - &#34;like a rock on her chest&#34; . At 09:04 AM She used her Albuterol asthma inhaler to see if it would help her breathing. No improvement in breathing, then complained at 0911 of some vision changes, felt like she was having to concentrate to breath - like breathing through a straw and at this time I started to hear her audibly wheezing - Squad was called. When they arrived around 9:18 AM she was having heaviness, closed her eyes - complaining of a little bit light headed, still having difficulty breathing.  She left with squad at 9:24 AM

                                                Less than 24 hours after receiving the vaccine (Jan 7), I started experiencing bad stomach pain, which a family friend had also experienced after she received the vaccine (also ~24 hours later). It did not subside with time, and became feeling like a shooting pain that was coming and going in waves, and I could not sleep that night. I was nauseous at one point, and threw up. I drank water throughout the night, which seemed to help a little bit and was taking an NSAID. The following day (Jan 8), the shooting pain continued, and I was in bed all day. I became nauseous at one point during the day, when attempting to move a piece of furniture, but did not throw up. I continued taking NSAIDs, which did not help. I was able to sleep through the night after taking melatonin, but was in discomfort. The following day (Jan 9), I woke up, and the shooting stomach pain had radiated to my chest, and had not subsided. I called my PCP, who I was unable to see due to timing/distance from the office, and she recommended I go to an ED if I did not feel better. As the pain was in my chest, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it had radiated there or was cardiac related, I had a friend drive me to the ED. My results came back normal at the ED, and the PA was only able to tell me that it was GI related, due to the pain in my stomach/esophagus. She was unsure if it&#39;s GERD, gas trapped, or some other GI issue. I am still experiencing this pain (Jan 11), but have somewhat managed it by taking Tums and eating alkaline foods.

My chest felt heavy and I was having labored breathing, My heart was racing at 160bpm and my blood pressure was 180/90, both of which are very high and abnormal for me.  I had severe joint and muscle pain. I had the chills and could not stop shaking.  I was very weak and could not even move out of bed, Leading to me calling 911 for an ambulance at 10:21pm. They kept me in the Emergency department until 5:30am because they could not get my heart rate to stay down. Stony Brook nurse told me it was okay to get vaccine even though I was infected with COVID-19 ON 12/15/2020.

Repeated ER visit two days later with a similar problem. PCP and ER physician deduced COVID vaccine interference. My body is burning through my food faster than I can normally replace it. Recommended frequent meals and rest until symptoms cease. Conducted blood work, urine samples, and EKG to rule out other factors during both ER visits.

This lasted a few hours.  1/15/21- 3:45am I got up to use bathroom and noticed I was very lightheaded. I thought maybe I just stood up too fast. I got back in bed and my arm was 8/10 pain so I also thought faintness could possibly due to pain.  7:15am I got up to go to work and quickly felt very warm and my vision started to go black. I laid back down for a few minutes until this resolved. I took my temperature and it was 99.0. I got up again and started to get ready but began feeling light headed again. I ended up getting ready while sitting down because I kept feeling too much like I was going to pass out. I ate breakfast and felt fine. 8:00am I left for work and after driving for about 5 minutes I felt myself getting very warm again and light-headed. I ended up pulling over and calling for someone to come pick me up.  9:00am My temperature was 99.5. My blood pressure laying down was 110/74 and HR was 74. After standing for 5 minutes my BP was 90/70 and my HR was 92. During this 5 minutes of standing I felt myself getting warm again but my vision did not start to go black and I was able to stand for the full 5 minutes.  At various times throughout the day I would feel faint if I was standing or sitting upright for too long. The last time I felt this was was probably 11:30pm on 1/15/21. 1/16/21 - No light-headedness or warmth. Did feel some slight chest pressure, but nothing crazy and it only lasted maybe half of the day.

My heart rate was elevated but that could have been related to my anxiety. I layered clothing on and finally managed to sleep. Upon waking up around 6 the next morning, I had a temperature of 102, a sore throat, throbbing headache, and was vomiting. My arm was so sore and swollen that I could hardly touch it. After rest, Tylenol, and fluids, I felt better around 8 that evening.

                                                Right after getting the shot, I felt dizzy, had a sore arm, and my heart was beating too fast, for about an hour. At 9:30 the next morning, I developed a fever of 100.5 and body aches. Around 2 pm, I got a headache which felt like it was because blood was hitting the veins in my head really hard- I think that&#39;s high blood pressure? My blood pressure was 126/85. I read not to take medicine because it would make the vaccine less effective, but I had to take an aspirin at 8 pm because I couldn&#39;t handle the headache any more, and ever since, I&#39;ve just had a sore arm and a headache when I walk too fast (it&#39;s been two days after the shot now).

Rash then spread across chest.  No itching, no pain.  No hives. She said her heart was racing when she first noticed rash but attributed this to anxiety.

A concerning side effect was that my resting HR was consistently above 105BPM from about 4:30AM-4PM the day after receiving the second dose.

Later in the day, I started feeling general malaise, chills, then during the night I felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm and ran a fever up to 101.2.  Later that night when I was going back to my room, I felt very weak and dizzy and I ended up passing out.  I don&#39;t remember anything until I woke up around 9:00 a.m. the following day.  I felt back to myself by around 4:00 p.m. January 29th, 2021.&#34;

                                                Chest tightness starting ~4 hours post-injection accompanied by increased HR and mild pain/pressure on deep inspiration.  Occurred intermittently for the rest of the evening (1/25/21) and into the next day (1/26/21).  Mostly located along the left side of the sternum and at the base of the sternum.  In the following 9 days (to today (2/3/21))  symptoms persisted, occurring about once a day and gradually becoming more mild.   On day 4 post-injection (1/29/21) enlarged and tender lymph nodes were noticed in the left axillary region and supraclavicular region.  They grew in size and increased in tenderness to mild pain until 2/1/21 and have since been steadily decreasing in size and in tenderness although still noticeable in size and uncomfortable today. Symptoms did not prevent me from doing my normal exercise or school activities.  No treatment or medications were taken.

Symptoms would come and go throughout day, but were worse in the mornings. Wednesday (2/10) - Present (2/13) - same symptoms as Tuesday (2/9). Symptoms worse in the mornings and after physical exertion (going to school, walking stairs), and at night as well. Symptoms are not severe, but I am concerned that they have lasted a full week. I have been taking Day-Quil severe every 4 hours. I was also on my period, which just ended yesterday (2/12). I believe my period started the day of the vaccine.  I plan on going to a doctor&#39;s office, but have been too tired to move from my apartment.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

                                                Severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction; Passed out on the ground; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 22-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and passed out on the ground and had a severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.     On an unknown date, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    About 10 minutes after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, the patient passed out on the ground having a severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction.  Treatment for the event included two doses of epinephrine IM in addition to diphenhydramine, ondansetron, and steroids to prevent a rebound reaction. 911 was called and after epinephrine and diphenhydramine were administered, the patient was immediately transported to the hospital where she stayed for 6 more hours for observation, fluids, and further medications.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The events, passed out on the ground and severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction, were considered resolved; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Anaphylactic reaction is a listed event in CCDS.

                                                The vaccine was administered to the patient in the consultation room. Once we left the consultation room, after about 2 minutes, the patient got my attention and complained of feeling dizzy. I went to her side, and she told me that she felt like she was going to pass out. The patient then proceeded to lose consciousness while sitting in a chair in the waiting area. She then exhibited seizure-like movements (muscles contracted, groaning sounds) for about 10 seconds, and she then regained consciousness. I administered no treatment, since this did not exhibit the signs of an anaphylactic reaction. 911 was called, and emergency medical services arrived. The patient was then taken to the hospital. The patient stated that she has had a similar reaction in the past to getting a vaccine, she thinks it is from the stress of getting injected with a needle.

                                                Patient had what appeared to be a vasovagal reaction.  She complained of feeling light-headed and nauseous about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  This continued for a short time and she also began to complain of feeling chilled and was noticeably diaphoretic.  I monitored her blood pressure, which was low on the initial reading and then eventually came up to a reading of 89/60 with a pulse of 73 at the point that her symptoms began to subside.  By approximately 45 minutes after the episode began, she reported feeling better and was able to stand and walk without symptoms.  She went home at that time with a friend.

When I came to, I was disoriented for about 2 minutes and very cold.  -For a week after I fainted I was very weak and couldn&#39;t stand up without feeling that I was going to faint.  -The second week after my shot I also felt pressure on my chest for 5 days that has since then gone away.  -Since I fainted 3 hours after my shot  I have experienced constant ringing in both ears that have not stopped for the past 30 days since I got the vaccine. I also experience blurry vision and vertigo that hasn&#39;t gone away.  -I have also developed headaches and recently I have an itchy rash on my neck.  -Since then it has been hard for me to focus and sometimes I feel like the world is in slow motion.

I took benadryl, and was relieved of these symptoms. Then, around 9pm that night, I developed a fever. The highest temperature I recorded was 101.9. I took Ibuprofen around 11pm, and was afebrile by 3am. I have not had any fevers since, and I did have to call off work New Year&#39;s day. I have had an intermittent, mild headache since receiving the vaccine as well,  but overall I feel fine.

Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

                                                I received the dose at 1:45 pm on 1/13/2021 at Medical Center. Almost 1 hour post vaccine I started to feel a lump in my throat, as the minutes passed my throat started to feel tighter and fight and flight mode kicked in.  It was hard to swallow, my tongue was swelling and I called EMS at 2:40 pm 1/13/2021.  EMS noticed hives on my chest and left arm where I got the first dose of Moderna.  I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

                                                The day of the vaccine about 4 hours later, I started experiencing chest pain. It was not tightness or a heartburn feeling type of chest pain. I have asthma, and it is the type of chest pain I start feeling right before I get bronchitis, almost like breathing in mist and the irritation that comes from having a cough, but I had not had a cough that would have caused this sensation. The next day, I was extremely fatigued, had a headache, chills, started getting a cough, and was sent home early from work. The day after, Friday, I had a fever of 102 and was essentially bedridden. I started using my nebulizer and my dr called me in some prednisone. These symptoms continued through the weekend and began lifting that Sunday. However, on Monday, my lymph node under my ear started swelling on my left side (the same side as the shot), my ear became clogged, my sinuses on my left side had shooting pain every time I inhaled, and although I could breathe through my nostrils, they felt full and had immense pressure. Additionally my headache became worse and I began experiencing intense muscle pain right at the base of my skull on the left side near my occipital lymph node that was radiating into my head and making the headache and sinus pain worse. Now, 11 days after my first dose of the vaccine, I still have the ear pain, swollen lymph node under my ear/behind my jaw, sinus pain, muscle pain at the base of my skull, a headache, and extreme pressure in my head/sinus area that has not lifted. I started on an antibiotic Friday night (the 22nd) in hopes that this is a sinus and ear infection. Ibuprofen helps the headache slightly but makes the pressure in my head feel worse and makes the joints in my hands and forearms hurt and my fingers swell for some reason which has never happened before for me when taking ibuprofen.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

The following morning I woke up and got dressed and used the restroom. I proceeded downstairs to make my coffee.  As I was doing so I became dizzy and nauseous. I sat down on the floor and then I lost my vision and hearing. I broke out in a profuse sweat and had no concept of time. My boyfriend was with me and said it took 5-10 minutes before I began to normalize. I apparently had shallow breathing and turned pale white including my lips, I slowly regained awareness although I never fully lost consciousness. 911 was called and paramedics arrived. by this time I had begun to normalize with most of my vision returning. I ended up declining to see medical attention because I normalized and told the paramedics I would seek attention if it came back.  * please note the physician listed is my PCP but I was not seen for this reaction.

At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

                                                Patient reported no to having prior history of fainting or dizziness after receiving vaccine. Vaccine was administered at approximately 9:04 am and patient&#39;s boyfriend was administered at approximately 9:08. Upon return to his seat beside her at approximately 9:10 am, he noticed she was losing color and going limp. He called for help, and I assisted. The pharmacy team sent a Code White on the radio and several members of management responded to check on the scene. We moved the patient to the floor and applied ice packs to the neck and chest and removed her face mask for better circulation. The patient was wearing a thick sweatshirt so we attempted to increase air flow around her head and neck to cool her down as she was visibly sweating. The patient never lost consciousness or breathing and her pulse was always palpable. By 9:20 am, we had moved the patient from the floor to a sitting position then to a chair and provided her with a cold bottle of water and continued one ice pack on her neck. She stayed seated until 9:40 (34 minutes after her injection). She denied the need for an ambulance transport as she had her boyfriend here who could drive her.

Prior to injection, patient reported being nervous about fainting. She reported no prior history of fainting due to vaccination or blood draws; she &#34;passed out&#34; two years prior to dehydration at a music festival.  Approximately four minutes after injection, patient stated that she was going to &#34;pass out&#34; and had an episode of syncope. She exhibited pallor, dry heaving, and arm contractures. The nurse helped her to a supine position on the floor and called for assistance. The nurse team encouraged deep breathing and provided apple juice, pretzels, ammonia inhalent, and cool washcloths. EMS was called and arrived at 1045 for further assessment. Patient reported that she had not consumed any food or drink prior to vaccination and stated that her hands were &#34;tingly&#34;. EMS took blood pressure and heart rate; both were within normal range. The patient was taken to the hospital by EMS at 1055, where providers determined that syncope was likely caused by anxiety. Patient returned home and reported feeling tired but stable when health department called to check in at 1400.

                                                I woke up at 1;00 with a rapid heart rate - it was up to 140. I got up and took my temperature - 102.8. I started with taking ibuprofen. I went back to bed. Got really nauseous; started vomiting; started having diarrhea. By 5:00 am, my fever still had not gone down and I took some Tylenol. Temperature still hadn&#39;t gotten down at all at 08:00. I went to my Urgent Care clinic - I was really dehydrated and My vital signs were not looking well 101.9. They gave me two liters of fluid with IV Zofran to help with nausea. I was there for four hours with the IV the whole time. They released me with a prescription for Zofran. I went home and slept the rest of the day. I continued to take Tylenol.  I didn&#39;t have any vomiting and nausea after that. I was completely fine on the 25th.  I was having at least one headache a day for two weeks after that which is not normal for me. I started having heart palpitations and chest pressure within a few days of being in the URGENT CARE. Once I went back to work (after a couple of days off) I started having  3 - 6 occurrences of heart palpitations and chest pressure  a day-    I saw a  2/22/2021 cardiologist - 140&#39;s that day - the heart monitor came back and everything seemed fairly normal. I have a follow up appt with cardiologist on 4/26/2021.  I am still having  heart palpitations and chest pressure but very few - not as often at all as it use to be.

Muscle stiffness - started an hour after vaccine and lasted about 48 hours, no pain medication or stretching helped, caused sleep issues due to not being able to get comfortable. Difficulty breathing - chest felt tight and felt like I wasn&#39;t getting enough oxygen in each breath so I had to pause to take deeper breaths.

This lasted for about a week, I then became short of breath and tacchychardic. I went to the ER and was admitted for 5 days where they said I had acute bronchitis that triggered reactive asthma. I?m now on steroids and a bunch of medication. This all followed my first dose of Moderna as I?ve never had breathing issues before hand. I?ve never had bronchitis or asthma in my life so this is all new. I am now experiencing nerve pain on my left side which is where I received the vaccine.

Immunizing pharmacist yelled out for Rapid Response from the ER.  Emergency room staff was on scene within 1 minute.  They measured patients pulse and BP and took her to the emergency room for monitoring.  Patient was gone from immunizing area for 30 minutes.  She came back to see us, looking much better and said that she faints all the time.  She remarked she was glad she was seated because when she faints when she stands and hits her head she has a sore head for days.  She proceeded to schedule her second vaccination utilizing the QR reader we had provided to all patients.  Although she didn&#39;t tell us beforehand, afterward she told us she faints all the time, that it isn&#39;t unusual, and that she had deliberately eaten food and drank plenty of liquids before she came so that it wouldn&#39;t be a problem.  Patient stated that she was fine and fit to drive and unconcerned about the reaction.

Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

                                                around 4AM of 01/06/21 (approximately 10 hours after receiving injection) I woke up with stomach cramps, feeling as if I needed to have a bowel movement which is extremely unusual at that hour. I went to the bathroom and ended up having extreme diarrhea. Went back to sleep, proceeded to wake up at 7am for work (I work at a hospital). Went to work, temperature upon arrival to work at 8am was 96.7. Didn&#39;t start to experience any other symptoms till around 10-11am. Developed a headache and thought, &#34;hm this is weird, I haven&#39;t had a headache since I had COVID but I hope it goes away soon.&#34; Then I went to lunch at noon and everything hit me all at the same time - freezing and sweating profusely, headache became so debilitating that it was burning/hurting my eyes, uncontrollably shaking, felt so weak (body aches all over, everything hurt). Took my temperature while I was at home for lunch and it was 101.5 and my heart rate was 160 (my heart rate is usually high because I take a stimulant but it is never that high). Went back to the hospital because I wanted to go to the ER and needed to get the rest of my belongings anyways. The ER physician and staff found the same things when doing initial vitals - high fever and heart rate. I made the ER physician aware of the fact that I had just received the vaccine the night before while also just having had COVID less than one month prior. I was instructed to go home at that point to get rest and recover. For the rest of the day on 01/6/21 and all of 01/7/21 I had to take off work because of adverse symptoms and effects. For all of 01/7/21 I was extremely fatigued and the headache never went away until 01/08/21.  On 01/08/21 I returned to work and symptoms diminished.

Patient states she received the first dose of the Maderna vaccine in her left arm around 0910 hours this morning. Patient waited 15 minutes afterwards and within 30 minutes was back working in the trauma unit. However, she suddenly began to experience nausea, chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath, throat tightness, light headed, and overall shaky.

Normally I stay up for a bit, but I felt achy and fatigued so I went to bed early. I woke up around 10am with a fever of 101.4 degrees, administered acetaminophen and went back to sleep. Woke up at 1pm and temp had dropped to 100.3, administered acetaminophen again and slept some more. My temp hovered around 100.3 until about 3pm on 01/29/21 when it dropped to 99.8. Around 6pm on 01/29/21 and about 48 hours after vaccination, my temp dropped to 98.9 and I went back to work. Along with fever I experienced headache, chills, skin sensitivity (likely due to the fever as that&#39;s a typical comorbidity for me), and body aches. I also had minor injection site side effects including redness and pain.

My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

                                                Starting around 9AM I began noticing a high heart rate while inactive. My heart rate was at 140 bpm (measured manually and with Watch). Normal for me is between 80-100 bpm. My heart rate remained high (between 120-140 bpm) for about 6 hours. I did not notice it go down to 100bpm until the next day. The high heart rate was never provoked by any physical activity. I rested in bed or in a chair all day and drank lots of water. Throughout the day I had fluctuating periods of feeling very hot and very cold. I took 1000mg of Tylenol every 4 hours throughout the day.  I also experienced expected side effects (chills, joint aches, muscle aches, nausea, headache, fever (100F w/ Tylenol)).

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                I had on-and-off insomnia starting around 10pm. I woke up every thirty minutes on the minute with a feeling like there was a fifty pound vest on my body.  At 3:30, I felt nauseous. I walked from my bedroom to downstairs to the kitchen. My knees buckled several times en route. When I ate one bite of a protein bar, my nausea increased tenfold. I ask drank water at the time.   I walked back upstairs to my room to sleep where remained awake until ~five am. I slept from ~five am until approximately 8:10am. I felt faint as I walked into the bathroom where I felt my faintness increase by the second. My knees buckled and I passed out on the bathroom floor tile for ~five - ten seconds. I payed there for a few minutes until I felt stable to stand.   This morning, 45 hours after the injection and 22 hours after blacking out, I felt a goose egg on the back of my head. It has hurt all day at a level 4/10 on the pain scale.

I already have issues with that but the vaccine made it worse. It went away on Monday, but I still had irregular heartbeat until around Wednesday. The 3 worst days were Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  The symptoms slowly went away, but yesterday seemed to be better.

My throat began to swell and became very short of breath. My chest was tight and felt as if it was being crushed. A nurse walked by me and noticed me grabbing my chest and immediately put me on a gurney. They took my mask off and discovered my lips were swelling and turned blue. My vitals were taken and was was given epinephrine in my left thigh. EMS was called and on board was given an IV Benadryl and steroids. Once at the hospital I was given Ativan, Pepsid and more Benadryl. I was discharged around 4pm and was back at the ED 3/13/21 early morning when I woke up with not being able to breathe, my throat swelling and crushing feeling in my chest. I was given more Benadryl and fluids, and was released 8am. 3/16/21 I came back to the ED as advised by a triage nurse on the phone, as I was having trouble breathing and the same crushing feeling in my chest.

                                                Patient  came to the center for a Moderna vaccine at 5pm. The patient expressed that she felt dizzy shortly after immunization (before leaving the immunization chair). Her head began to fall backwards so I quickly supported the patient&#39;s head and neck area and was able to keep her from falling out of her chair. The patient fainted but regained consciousness approximately 3 seconds later. The patient came back alert but nauseous. The patient vomited in a trashcan and then felt fine. The patient blamed the reaction on her severe anxiety and said the exact same thing happened after a nose piercing. I observed the patient for 30 minutes and sent her on her way. The patient left healthy and happy. I told the patient to warn the pharmacist prior to receiving her second dose. No drugs were administered. Written up in SCRT and VAERS. I followed up with the patient at 7 pm and she was home safe.

She was immediately assisted by a pharmacist onsite, who helped the patient to lie on the ground with her legs elevated.  The patient immediately regained consciousness and was speaking normally. The patient was monitored closely for approximately 45 minutes. At that time, the patient reported feeling no symptoms or side effects, and was allowed to leave with instructions to seek appropriate medical attention if needed for further symptoms.

                                                Patient was vaccinated around 10:55 AM. Within a couple of minutes she started feeling lightheaded, sweaty, and had blurry vision while sitting. She reported no history of blood sugar issues, but she said she only had some donut to eat today. I initially gave her three glucose tablets and a bottle of water, which she sipped. She reported feeling better within a few minutes. I checked her blood pressure at 10:59 AM. It read low at 81/44 with a pulse of 73. But, I checked again since I doubted the accuracy of the reading. The second reading was 101/56, with a pulse of 79. Patient said she was feeling better, but continued to sit. I gave her one more glucose tablet to equal a total of 16 g of carbs given. She sat for at least fifteen minutes until she felt well enough to get up and shop. She checked back after shopping and said she was fine.

I have a history of these, but they are almost never so intense.  About 25 hours after the injection, I began having intense pain in the center of my chest. It dissipated and returned a couple of times over the next 5 hours or so. The pain was so great that it was difficult to stand, and I came close to passing out. I have not experienced this severe level of pain since about 30 hours post-injection.

                                                That evening my arm swelled up and became very painful - not as much as the first vaccine. I had a hard time sleeping - nausea and headache throughout the  night. 4/3 - extremely tired; felt like I couldn&#39;t get enough air (shortness of breath) body aches and muscles aches - over all lethargic. 4/4 - I was dizzy, short of breath . Those two symptoms lasted along with fatigue - which lasted for two days. I almost passed out that day - everything went black and I had to be assisted to the couch to recover from that.  I used Tylenol for my symptoms when needed.   I still have ongoing headaches - three weeks ago (about a week after I got the vaccine) - I noticed I was having ongoing headaches and I still have these.  Pregnancy - 2nd pregnancy; 1st one was full term. Date of delivery expected - September 9, 2021.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 17-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Fainted), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)). On 18-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol). On 19-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) and FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug). On 28-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period) and PALLOR (Pale as a ghost). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (Fainted) had resolved, SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work), SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol), FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period), PALLOR (Pale as a ghost), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)) outcome was unknown and DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) had not resolved. Not Provided      The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medications were reported. Treatment medications include Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) for diarrhea for 1.5 days (unknown dose/frequency).  Patient waited out 20 minutes post-vaccination and then went to the bathroom. When she came out of bathroom she fainted, paramedics were summoned. Mother took patient to Emergency Room(ER) 20 April 2021, after taking her first to urgent care (who directed mother to take patient to the ER), ER sent her home saying it was just a little stomach bug, but no one else in the family got this &#34;bug&#34;.  Patient&#39;s last test for Covid-19 was on Monday (26-Apr-2021) and results came back negative on 28-Apr-2021. Company comment: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and nausea are consistent with the product established safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol.

My heart was racing, body and face was sweating, externally nauseous, dizzy, blurred/fuzzy vision, body shaking, the room was spinning,  and I was unable to stand up. This would happen every time I got out of bed and stood up. Lasted about 2 hours.

On Tuesday 1/5/2021 developed hives on feet and ankles. Dizziness worsened and hives had spread to hands and wrists the following day. Upon arriving to work on Thursday 1/7/2021, hives had progressively gotten worse and I was tachycardic. Called employee health where I was instructedto go to the ED. Was tachycardic 100-130 bpm and hypertensive 156/112mmHg upon arrival to the ED. Received IV Benadryl and Decadron for the reaction/hives. Viotals were normal upon discharge. Continued with Prednisone and benadryl. Taking Meclizine to help with dizziness.

                                                I received my vaccine around 12:45pm. They had me go to waiting room and wait for 10 mins. I sat down and was waiting for a few minutes when I started to get dizzy. I looked up and told the lady checking people in ?hey I?m getting really dizzy can I lay down? she said yes come in the room. When I stood up my heart started beating really fast. I sat on the table and my chest started feeling tight and heavy. There were 2 ladies in the room at this point so I asked one of them if they had an epipen on hand just in case. My throat wasn?t swelling but it was getting harder to breath from the tightness in my chest. She said they didn?t have an epipen and would have to call emergency services if I needed one. I told her I didn?t know what was going on, that I didn?t need one yet but she should probably call emergency services if they can?t do anything to help me. (ER is right across the street) my symptoms went away shortly after they called. But came on a couple more times but much milder over the next 30 minutes or so. The EMT gave me Benadryl and the ER ran some tests.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

                                                Several minutes after the vaccine she became light headed, EMT evaluated her and stated she was tachycardic (did not give a pulse) and was initially unable to find a BP.  She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

BS was checked and was low so I was given crackers and a sprite. I was severly nauseaed and HR elevated to 150 with SOB associated and was like that off and on for about 30 minutes which prompted EMS to be called to come check me out and was transported to the ED.  I was given fluids and my lab work showed I was deydrated. UA neg, Triponin-neg, EKG-tackycardia and they symptoms deminished on its on after about 4-5 hours and I was released from the ED.

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

My 9pm I felt dizzy, had a headache, and started feeling nauseous  I took some Tylenol and ibuprofen and a snack (can?t take it on an empty stomach when nauseous  Was able to fall sleep but woke up at 2am very shaky, nauseous, and with extreme joint pain. I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

I broke out in a rash on my face and neck. I was taken to the Emergency Department. My tongue started feeling like it was too big for my mouth. I was given pepsin, Benedryl, and steroids.

                                                Starting about 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt feverish (no fever), lightheaded and dizzy. The doctor on site had me wait for an hour until I felt well enough to drive home. Over the next several hours, my lightheadedness became so bad I felt as though I would faint if I stool for longer than a few minutes. On Saturday, 2-13-21, I did pass out on the stairs and again in my livingroom. On Sunday, 2-14-21, I decided to go to urgent care in which I was told to &#34;wait it out&#34;. However, my symptoms had gotten worse over the last couple days to include body aches, headaches, muscle/joint pain, congested sinuses, slight cough, and feeling feverish (no fever) along with being dizzy. Therefore, I went to the ER later that morning 2-14-21, to see if I could get better treatment for my symptoms. I received IV fluids and they preformed blood work, a urinanalysis and an ECG. I was released from the ER around 8pm. My symptoms were better for the remainder of the evening, but have gone back to what I was feeling before for the last several days. My symptoms have been unresolved now for 1 week. I am getting tested for COVID-19 on Saturday 02-20-21.

I was so light headed I thought I would pass out if I stood up. I went to ER - Dr thought it was  from my wearing personal protection equipment - mask and goggles for work after receiving the vaccine. He told me I was fine but I was so much in  pain that I was too out of it to ask for tests. I was in pain for two week. Chest was in pain.  I had to use my inhaler once a day at least - sometimes more.

She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

At the 12 hour mark from my vaccine (11:30PM), I started to have chills, a fever, and feel nauseous. Around 1 AM I started to vomit and this occurred for about 15 minutes, and then repeated again about an hour later. By the morning of the day after I was no longer vomiting or had chills but still had a fever. The most prominent symptoms on the day after my vaccine were extreme body aches and horrible joint pain. My hands and feet felt swollen and stiff. I had terrible pains and aches in my whole entire body. I was also very tired and still had a low grade fever. On the second day after the vaccine I had bad chest and neck pain and started to have a mild cough. By the third day after the vaccine, the chest pain was gone but still had bad neck pain and a headache that radiated through my skull.

                                                Pt received 2nd COVID vaccination at 1024. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have dropped her water bottle and become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, she was noted to have moderate pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. Her head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. Pt noted to have some muscular rigidity and not verbally responsive. Another provider advised to call 911 due to unresponsiveness and seizure-like activity. 911 called @1027, meanwhile pt lifted and placed into a wheelchair and moved to treatment area where vitals were obtained, patient became verbally responsive @1034, responses/speech was clear but slow, pt was oriented to self, place, time and situation. Oxygen applied via facemask @4L. Pt provided staff with phone number to call her mother who was notified of daughter&#39;s condition @1032. FD Engine arrival @1033 report given and pt also became more responsive, eyes opened and stated clearly that she was feeling better. Pt color also improved. Pt denied any allergies, PMH or hx of seizure activity. Pt only reported a syncope many years ago. Ambulance arrival @1036, report provided to emergency staff and pt taken to ambulance for further evaluation @1039. Pt returned to vaccine clinic @1052, having declined ambulance transport. When asked about events, pt stated that upon sitting down she felt a sudden onset of moderate nausea and reached for her water bottle in her bookbag, pt states she could not recall or hear anything until she was moved to wheelchair, and did not recall how she came to be in the observation area (based on this information, suspected time unconscious was approx 6-12 seconds). Pt was educated regarding the many causes of syncope and the neccesity for further evaluation in the Emergency department. Pt discouraged from driving herself from the clinic and was able to obtain ride from her roommate. Pt urged again to obtain a ride to the hospital for further evaluation, understanding verbalized and agreed with plan of care.

                                                I was Vaccinated on Friday March 26, on Sunday night March 28 I had a sudden episode of uncontrollable shortness of breath while sitting having and not strenuous activity. Immediately went to emergency room. First blood pressure on examination was 180/100, also experienced tachycardia with heart rate fluctuating between 100-120s while sitting on stretcher SPO2 remained normal at all times between 98-100%. All exams performed (Labs, Ekg, CTA, UA) showed normal results per MD. Symptoms began to subside on their own and was give small dose of Ativan to continue to help symptoms subside and was discharged with a diagnosis of &#34;anxiety&#34;. Today is March 31st nearing April 1st and I have had intermittent shortness of breath at times just sitting down and other times when performing light activity tachycardia and shortness of breath. I do not agree with the diagnosis of &#34;anxiety&#34; as today I had an episode of shortness of breath and tachycardia after conversation and laughing with my spouse without anything on my mind completely distracted the symptoms began. I am a healthy 25 year old woman with no serious past medical history the only change that occurred before my sudden symptoms was receiving the vaccine just 2 days prior and I truly believe this was the cause.

It felt like my heart was beating irregular, vision went blury, full body flush, skin was hot,  my chest was heavy and I had shortness of breath. I told the staff that I was having a reaction so they had me sit in a private room and watched me. After sitting for a few minutes the feeling went away. I have not had any side effects since.

As patient is employee, she first contacted Health multiple times in the days immediately following the vaccine and no major concern. As symptoms continued over the weekend, she was take to an urgent care on Monday and referred to neurologist, Dr.  Patient (who has emergency room scribe work experience) expressed to all 3 providers that she was concerned about stroke but was told she was too young &amp; healthy and it was likely inflammation due to a vaccine reaction.  Dr scheduled her for a brain MRI one week later, on Jan.19th (2 weeks after vaccine).  Bilateral occipital brain hemorrahges. was immediately seen on the MRI and patient was rushed to emergency and then admitted for very thorough testing and scanning over the course of 5 days, including cerebral angiogram and lumbar puncture. No abnormal vascular nor blood issues were found, nor clots. Patient discharged on 1/23 w/severe headache thought to be due to lumbar puncture, continued feeling very poorly for next 2 days at home then collapsed on 1/25 and readmitted with new, massive brain bleed and multiple clots detected.  I&#39;m running out of time so you&#39;ll have to read the reports but the conclusion now is hemorrhages due to the vaccine.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after the patient got her second moderna vaccine she became faint and dizzy. The patient was sitting at the time. A law enforcement officer witnessed her becoming faint and ran over to attend her. I was called over to assess her as well. The law enforcement officer called EMS. The patient stated that she felt faint, dizzy, she said she had a headache, blurry vision, and was nauseous. The patient appeared sweaty and she appeared to loose consciousness briefly twice. She did not show any signs of redness, rash, or swelling. After sitting for a few minutes, and before EMS arrived, the patient said she was improving. She did not lose consciousness anymore but she still had a headache, nausea, and blurry vision. When EMS arrived they recommended that she get checked out at the emergency room, but the patient refused stating that she did not want to go to the hospital and that she was feeling better. The patient called her parents and they came and picked her up.
