The patient has prior history of irregular heart beat . Her relevant concomitant medications were cholesterol medication, Crestor and medication for irregular heartbeat. No information on allergies.   On 28-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received her first of two planned doses of COVID-19 vaccine intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30-JAN-2021, 2 days after her vaccination, she developed arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, some visual problems (light bothered her for some days) and mild chills. After one week she felt like no more symptoms ongoing and felt good again. She visited her physician for arrhythmias, and he said, she should keep an eye on it, but no medication yet. She is concerned about her second shot.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was not reported.  The outcome of the events, arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, visual problems and chills were resolved at the time of report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of irregular heart beat are considered risk factors for arrhythmias.

On 8:10am Sunday, heart beat ranged from 50 to 125 bpm, blood pressure dropped to 90/64. Doctor took me off all meds except Xarelto, said stay in bed, drink lots of fluids. I did not connect the symtoms to the vaccine at the time because problems happened after the 1st few hours, and I was too sick to think clearly. It was only when I read the side effects after 1-3 days, that I realized it could be from the vaccine. I worry about being deathly sick after the second vaccine shot, so I&#39;m reporting this.

                                                TIA diagnosis at hospital; Conscious after fall; Dizzy/ lightheadedness; Head bump (temple area and ear caused by hit sink during fall); A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 90-years-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced transient ischemic attack, fall, dizzy lightheadedness, and a head bump.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included transient ischemic attack; the patient experienced 3 events in 2020.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 030L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient experienced dizzy lightheadedness and a fall, resulting in a head bump in her temple and ear caused by hitting the sink as she fell. The patient was hospitalized following the fall and diagnosed with transient ischemic attack.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient received magnetic resonance imaging and a laboratory test.  On 27 Jan 2021, the lightheadedness and head bump had resolved.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not reported.   The outcome of the events, transient ischemic attack and fall, was considered resolved on 25 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, lightheadedness and head bump, was considered resolved on 27 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 90-years-old female patient with a relevant medical history of three TIA within last year, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Dizziness and Transient ischaemic attack and non-serious unexpected events of Fall and Head injury.  The events of occurred approximately 2 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 030L20A. Treatment details were not provided.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of TIA are considered significant confounders.

                                                The patient came to the Emergency Room at approx 3:30 am on 02/03/2021 with pain in right arm (same arm the COVID vaccine had been administered in approx 12 hours earlier) and feeling generally unwell. Patient was concerned about possibility of gout flare or that something was wrong with her arm. Elevated blood pressure was noted; this was attributed to anxiety. She was evaluated, given 500 mg Tylenol, and discharged since the pain was decreasing and blood pressure was stabilized. Patient instructed to follow-up with physician.  The next day,  on 02/04/2021, the patient arrived at the Emergency Room by ambulance; cardiac arrest was the chief complaint. The patient&#39;s daughter stated the patient had been &#34;feeling generally poor and then suddenly collapsed.&#34; Daughter described &#34;gurgling respirations&#34; and being unresponsive. 911 was called, police arrived within 5 minutes and initiated CPR. Epinephrine, atropine, lidocaine and bicarb administered after arrival to Emergency Room.  Shockable rhythm never demonstrated. Patient never recovered spontaneous respiration or movement.   The death was called at 23:04. Coronary artery disease with cardiac arrest is the cause from the ER records; the coroner is putting COVID-19 vaccination in Part 1 of the death certificate.

                                                About 20 minutes after the vaccine was administered my Mother&#39;s speech became garbled and she was unable to speak understandably. I thought she was having a stroke so rushed her to the emergency room. They examined her and her speech returned to normal in about an hour. They kept her overnight for tests and after an MRI they said she had a TIA. We wanted to report it in case there were others who had a similar adverse affect. No one can say for sure if the vaccine caused it or not but we wanted to let you know what happened to her.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (left-arm), my mother began to have moderate pain in her left arm, particularly in the left shoulder area. The pain continued to increase throughout the afternoon, until it became so severe (10 on a 10-point pain scale) by 8:30 pm on 3/10/21 , that she could no longer lift her arm. She took 500 mg of Tylenol to attempt to relive the pain and went to bed early.   At 2:45 am on 3/11/21, she needed to go to the restroom, and I (daughter) had to assist her to get out of bed, as she had no use of her left arm due to severe pain in that arm. While seated on the toilet, she indicated that her arm was extremely painful and she felt that she was going to pass out and felt nauseated. Within a minute, she lost consciousness and  I called emergency services. EMT arrived within 5 minutes and stated that her blood pressure was extremely low and she needed to be placed on the floor.  They placed her on a gurney and took her to the ambulance, where they started an IV and took her to her local hospital.  I followed shortly thereafter, where she was taken to the ER. She was admitted to the hospital for observation and given Ativan (she refused any opioids) She was ultimately diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the pain in her left arm. Two days later, the pain has subsided.

                                                Osats down to 80; Pulse upwards of 130; A spontaneous report was received from a health care professional, concerning a 93-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced Osats down to 80 and pulse upwards of 130.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included hypertension and heart disease. Concomitant product use was not provided.    On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 037K20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 05 Jan 2021, around 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation was down to 80 and she had a pulse upwards of 130. The patient was given 3-4 L of oxygen, but did not respond, so, epinephrine was administered. Emergency medical services (EMS) was called. The patient&#39;s oxygen saturation was around 90 with pulse ranging from 80-120 after EMS arrived.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, Osats down to 80 and pulse upwards of 130, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 93 year-old, female patient with medical history of hypertension and heart disease, who experienced events of oxygen saturation decreased and heart rate increased. The events occurred approximately 20 minutes after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

                                                My mother fainted on the night she was vaccinated, early in the morning. She had gone to the kitchen to get a heating pad and felt faint while standing  She didn&#39;t make it to a chair, but fell and broke her hip.   While this could have been due to another health problem, my mother had never had a fall or a near-fall. it is concerning that very old adults are not warned to have someone with them after receiving the vaccine (for instance, overnight),  I realize that the vaccine has not been studied specifically in geriatric populations, but it is realistic to assume that there are substantial numbers of very old people living on their own, particularly in cities where there is no need to drive, and where food and other necessities can be delivered. There should be a warning to people that they should not be alone after receiving the vaccine.

She was found on her apt. floor unconscious. She was transferred to the Hospital by ambulance where a CT scan and other tests were done. It was determined she had a stroke and heart attack. My mother was in great health, took no medications, and lived alone in her apt. before this incident. The medical professionals determined she would not recover so she was admitted to hospice and died on Feb. 21, 2021. I believe there is a relationship between the vaccine and the CVA and MI.

                                                Hallucinating; Occasional rapid heart beat; Hadache; A spontaneous report was received from a caregiver concerning reporter&#39;s mother a 97-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced hallucinating/ hallucination, occasional rapid heartbeat/ heart rate irregular and headache.   The patient&#39;s current conditions included chronic urinary tract infection. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included antibiotics for chronic urinary tract infection.   On 26-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their unspecified dose of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) via an unknown route and site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 27-Feb-2021 the patient had headache for 2 days, was hallucinating and had occasional rapid heartbeat.  Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The Outcome of the events, hallucinating,  occasional Rapid Heartbeat, and headache was unknown.  Company Comment: The reported events, hallucinations, heart rate irregular, and headache,  were considered possibly related to mRNA-1273.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the reported event and excluding any other etiology, a causal relationship with the event cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the vaccine profile

She was totally dependent in her care needs. She received the vaccine on 1/2/2021 as part of the facility vaccination campaign. No adverse events noted initially. On 1/3/2021 at 6:06 pm, she was noted on vital sign checks (done every 4 hours for first 72 hours after vaccination) with BP 64/52 but otherwise asymptomatic. Subsequent BP improved. On 1/4/2021 at 4:45 am, pt found with respiratory rate of 30 with otherwise normal vital signs. Tachypnea persisted, so she received liquid morphine 2.5 mg without improvement. Supplemental oxygen was applied. Tachypnea persisted. She had poor oral intake after that point had persistent tachypnea and worsening hypoxemia despite clear lungs on exam. She remained under hospice care and comfort measures were continued. No blood testing or imaging tests were done. She required increasing amounts of oxygen, became hypotensive, and died peacefully on 1/8/2021 at 7:45 pm.

She did not have any neurological impairment after fall and remained at facility to be monitored.  1/26/21, resident had sudden loss of consciousness with hypotension and tachycardia.  This resolved slowly after resident was put in trendelenberg position.  She has not had similar events in the past.  She was sent to ED without a distinct underlying cause of the event identified, differential included cardiac arrhythmia, ? orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope, stroke She had a similar event occur on 1/27 after she had returned to the facility from the ED.  The family elected not to pursue further evaluation for second event and she was placed on hospice as she had been experiencing some gradual decline before these events occurred.

                                                Narrative:  Patient received dose 1 of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/11/21 from clinic. Vaccine was administered to patient without complications and patient was observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination without any adverse effects. No documentation as to any adverse effects following the 15 minutes post-vaccination. 11 days later on 3/22/21, EMS was dispatched to patient&#39;s home and patient was found lying supine, unconscious, and unresponsive to stimuli. Patient was noted to have shallow breathing per EMS staff, and was subsequently brought to the hospital. Per family, patient lives alone and was feeling well - they had spoken to her two days prior to the event. Per family patient did not have recent fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, or cough. Also no recent medication changes or trauma. PMH includes stroke approx. 8 years ago, gout, HLD, HTN, and RLS. BP upon admission was 126/93, HR 123, temp 37.1 degrees Celcius, RR 28. Patient noted to smell of urine. CT showed large completed right sided infarct consistent with MCA stroke. Per neurology the lesion was not recoverable and patient would be unlikely to regain any function. Family was notified and poor prognosis was discussed. Patient has been very clear in the past that she would prefer &#34;to go when her time came&#34;. She had a DNR And DNI as well. Daughter requested to pursue comfort measures for patient, therefore she was transferred to hospice care. Patient passed away the following day on 3/23/21. Death very unlikely due to COVID-19 vaccination since CT imaging clearly showed cerebral infarct and patient had a PMH of stroke.

                                                Patient became lethargic, extremely tired, unable to care well for self.  Patient had no appetite, refused most food and spent many hours simply sitting in her chair.  She felt that she was having a heart attack and called 911 using her emergency response button on 2/21/2021.  Doctors indicated that the patient&#39;s life was in serious danger, but because of age they were hesitant to try to remove the clot pressing on her heart.  She was only allowed to go back home because we utilized Hospice.  When asked about her life expectancy, we were told she could die any minute or might live a few more months, but that she was not expected to live much longer.  SHE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH PRIOR TO THE IMMUNIZATION!

Lay on the bathroom floor face down until assisted living facility staff found her in the morning when they were passing out medications.  Taken to ER at hospital on 2/9/2021. Was not admitted to hospital-  all CT scans and x-rays and blood work were normal. Taken back to assisted living facility where she exhibited dramatic change in behavior- uncooperative, refusing to eat or take meds, refusing to get OOB. Mentally a decline in cognition. Transferred to different facility with higher level of care on February 15th and is improving somewhat.
