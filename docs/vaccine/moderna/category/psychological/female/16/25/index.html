She received Zofran, Decadron, IVFs, and Albuterol inhaler while in the ER.  She reported improvement in her chest tightness and SOB after Albuterol.  She was discharged home with instructions to f/u with her PCP in a couple of days for recheck.

A few days after that my muscles started twitching and haven&#39;t stopped. I feel like something is crawling under my skin and the vaccine is extremely affecting my nervous system. I did not have this problem before I had the vaccine. It has not gone away and it is now April 23rd I still feel weak, not the same as I used to feel before having the vaccine, and my muscles are twitching all over my body. My face is twitching and my eye and there is nothing I can do to make it stop. I am so young and I thought the vaccine was safe but I am suffering from it. Especially in my feet I feel like they are tingling and vibrating and my calves are convulsing too. Meanwhile, my heart is fluttering and I feel like it is very hard for me to focus and I feel things crawling under my skin in my brain.  The muscle convulsions are happening everywhere.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                18 year old female came to hospital for chest tightness, choking sensation in the throat as well as skin rash after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.  Initially patient presented to emergency room but subsequently discharged on steroid and Benadryl.  Patient had continued episode of choking as well as chest tightness and skin rash for that patient came back to emergency room.  Patient had received total 5 doses of epi pen because of that.  Patient was admitted to medical floor initially.  Patient was given steroid, Benadryl and famotidine.  Patient had 2 episodes on medical floor where she started feeling choking and chest tightness.  Patient remained stable hemodynamically except for tachycardia.  Patient was transferred to intensive care unit for close monitoring.  D-dimer was negative, urine tox screen was negative, COVID-19 PCR was negative, EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  CT scan of neck was negative.  We had discussed that patient has remained stable hemodynamically in the intensive care unit and discharge planning was discussed and patient was getting ready to be discharged when she had another episode where after drinking soda patient started having that choking sensation, patient remained stable hemodynamically during this episode as well.  Her symptoms had improved.  She looked visibly anxious.  Patient was monitored in the ICU for few more hours and patient remained stable.  I checked back on her and she was able to eat her lunch.  She probably had a allergic reaction to more than a vaccine but subsequent episodes are thought to be secondary to anxiety attack given situation.

                                                Approximately 7-8 minutes after receiving the vaccine, started to feel light-headed, thought she was going to pass out, and her heart was racing extremely high. The health care team at the site took her blood pressure, measured heart rate, gave her water, juice and chocolate and tried to get her heart rate to drop. It was fluctuating up and down and she couldn&#39;t stand up without dizziness;  we waited 45 minutes and then drove her home as she was unable to drive her own car.  She was experiencing significant lightheadedness, and consistent heart racing even while lying down on the sofa/bed. This continued for several days and she stayed home from school and sports. We called her primary care doctor on the 10th and they suggested she wait another day to see how she was feeling. She started to feel a bit better by Friday, was still experiencing a bit of the tiredness, nauseous, light-headed and heart spikes, but was able to drive, move around.  On Sunday evening, she started to experience increased heart rate again, lymph nodes were very painful and started experiencing the light headedness all evening.  On Monday we took her to her primary care provider and they then referred her to ER for the heart racing and a EKG. The increased light headedness, feeling like she will pass out even while laying in bed, dizziness has all increased and her lymph nodes continue to be swollen and painful. It has been over a week since the vaccine and there is no clear sign of her reaction getting any better, if not worse.  The EKG results indicated a new abnormality and we are trying to get her to a cardiologist.  She is and had been a very healthy, varsity athlete that runs over 30 hours a week with track, and since receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine is unable to move very far within the house without feeling that she is going to pass out or that her heart rate is shooting up uncontrollably.

                                                My daughter started feeling feverish several hours after vaccine but by 6 hrs. she was running a fever. It has gone to as high as 103.1. She felt like her fingernails were even hurting her. She said her body had pins and needles feeling. She has stayed hydrated. The fatigue is just to severe for her to get out of bed and even do online school is not possible. Vaccine was given Mon. afternoon and now its Wed. afternoon. Her fever has finally broke and hopefully stays away. Her body always responds to ibroprofen with the sweats pretty fast and a reduction in temperature but this time her body has not been receptive. She wouldn&#39;t even get a sweat like usual. She was dosed at 800mg. I have not taken her to the Dr. but will tomorrow if necessary.

                                                Initially she passed out following the vaccine - within 90 seconds- she has a history of passing out with injections and blood draws. Around noon she had a seizure. She describes a feeling of darkness and dread closing in on her and she was unable to speak or move. She was on the stairs at the time. I witnessed her stiffen, then go limp and fall between the electric stair hair and the wall. She hit the hardwood floor face first then she began to shake/twitch. She was unconscious. She awoke screaming, incoherent speech, and flailing limbs. It took about 5 minutes to calm her and be able to understand her speech. She only remembers the darkness and waking up scared and feeling awful. She was put supine on the floor with feet elevated, blood pressure monitored, given juice to drink, and vitals checked routinely. After about an hour supine and conscious, she felt good enough to sit up. She sat up for 15 minutes before she was able to stand with assistance. Family physician was notified immediately and we are still waiting for a response. She has a goose egg sized knot on her forehead, a bruise on the side of her face and a black eye from hitting the floor. She has a huge bruise on her outer thigh and lower leg where she hit the stair chair and then seized and it it repeatedly on the metal. She has underarm pain from where her armpit hit the edge of the stairs when she fell and seized. She has no history of any types of seizures.

                                                Around 12 hours after receiving the vaccine,  I was hit with intense fatigue almost to the point of passing out. I went to bed and extreme chills began. For about an hour I had bad chills and difficulty falling asleep despite my fatigue. It felt almost exactly like having COVID (since I had it back in December), but condensed into a few hours. My arm also started hurting about 5 hours after receiving the vaccine but it is not noteworthy.

I took a nap before my next class and when I woke up I felt better.

She came back shortly saying she was feeling a little funny so she wanted to sit in our room.  She left again after several minutes then came back around 5:20 saying she felt like she was going to pass out.  I told her to sit in our waiting room.  She said she felt faint and had tightness in her chest. I called the paramedics who arrived shortly after.  They said she had anxiety.  She was anxious before and after receiving the vaccine.  She left on her own.

                                                Patient had felt nervous prior to getting her 2nd shot. I asked if she had every had any serious reactions from previous medicines or vaccines, she stated &#34;no&#34;. I then asked how she did after her first shot and she said ok. While waiting her 15 min in the observation area she alerted us that she was feeling extremely hot. We brought her back into the IMZ booth and had her sit in the chair and turned a fan in her direction. I sat down with her an asked her questions and kept her talking to try to calm her down. She stated that she felt as if the chair was swaying a little. We laid out a yoga mat on the floor in the booth, had her lay down and elevate her feet in a chair. She began to get upset and I asked if she had anyone with her, she was able to open her phone and gave me permission to call her family member. Family member came in the store and was able to help calm her down. We gave her some water and had her rest. I monitored her pulse and face/lip color. She became a little flushed. She was able to leave on her own accord, I did walk out with her to ensure she made it safely. I called 2 hours later to check on her and she stated she was feeling better, less dizzy, but just a little tired.

One of the technicians called the squad to come check her out.  They did so, and they left shortly after.  She mentioned that they told her she could either go to the hospital and be observed or go home.  She said she wanted to go home.  She and her boyfriend went home

Immunizer then turned around to give her brother vaccination. When he was turned around, he heard the patient&#39;s phone that she was holding dropped and that she had jerked her arm, which caused her phone to drop. When I went to the patient, she was crying and hyperventilating. I told her to put her head down and take deep breaths. I checked on pt in 15 min, was doing better but had burning sensation at injection site. Kept pt at pharmacy for 30 minutes.

She left the store at 1:01 pm and felt alot better and stated she had an appt with her PCP at 3pm to further seek medical treatment if deemed necessary

When RN and I reached patient she was very weak, she was sitting in a chair. I instructed her colleauges to call 911 immediately. Patient was having a little trouble breathing. I think she was scared. I gave her 10 mlL of benedryl and RN administered a 0.5 mL dose of epinephine in her left arm. Patient was helped to the  floor and her feet were elevated.  RN put on a blood pressure cuff. Before she could get a reading, the paramedics were there and took over. Patient was transported to Hospital.

She cam back in side the room and we had a nurse assess her, her BP and heart rate were a  little elevated. We gave her some water and had her sit for some extra time while we talked to her. She has a child hood trauma regarding vaccine and had just had a major panic attack before and during her vaccination. We were all  pretty sure she had just worked her self up and was not feeling well because of that and she said as much herself. After about 15-20 more minutes her BP and heart rate were back to normal and although still feeling a little weak she was ready to go home with her mother.

She did some breathing exercises but she started breathing faster, leaned over &amp; fell &amp; hit her head slightly. She started jerking for about a minute but she used her magnet and it started to bring her out of it. The very next day, she had 2 more seizures, within a 30 min period, &amp; similar episodes.

                                                It started with bad arm pain at the site of injection. I went to bed around 12:30 but I couldn?t fall asleep. By 3am I figured the only reason I wasn?t sleep was from the vaccine. I then started to feel extremely nauseous and had chills. At 3:30 am I took my temperature and it was 100.5. I laid in bed until 5am with no sleep still and took my temperature again and it was 103.5. I went back into my bed and fell asleep around 5:30 am. The next day I felt as though I had been hit by a truck. I felt extremely groggy and achy and my temperature when I woke up was around 100. Overall, I felt awful.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID 19 Moderna vaccine on Tuesday morning. By Tuesday night I started to have virtually every side effect that Moderna listed including; fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea and vomiting, and extreme fever. The next morning as I woke up in attempt tp get ready for work, I was not feeling any better and began to feel light headed, and felt the need to vomit. As I had the feeling of needing to vomit, I turned to do so and fainted. From accounts by my family, I was told I woke up, and quickly passed out a second time. As I was awoken, there was probably a minute before I fainted for a third time. All three times I was told I lost consciousness. I was awoken and by that point my family had contacted emergency responders. Paramedics arrived and took all necessary vitals. I did not pass out after that third time. As I expected all side effects Moderna listed, I did not expect to feel as bad as I did and I thought it was worth reporting what happened to be the next day. It caused a panic and I was scared and nervous as I was unsure why that was happening. I&#39;ve tried to look up articles and links between passing out and the vaccine and all I can find is people fainting as they get the vaccine (which is common for any shot) but nothing for fainting that long after the vaccine was administered. I just wanted to report my incident.

I was either really cold or really hot, no in between. I was fatigued for a week after the vaccine. I had shortness of breath and I got my vaccine on a Friday and was sick throughout the entire weekend until Tuesday.

Other medics arrived and took her to the hospital.

                                                A few minutes after getting the vaccine she started getting light-headed, nauseous, sweats, and blurred vision prior to getting up and informing the pharmacy staff. Pharmacist gave water. She had turned a yellow color. Mother gave liquid Benadryl - adult dose. Epi was offered - but not use.  Decided to see if Benadryl got her back to normal. After the sweat she got chilled. Waited at the pharmacy for about an hour as her color came back to normal.  Had pharmacists take her blood pressure prior to leaving. It was 106/70. Which would be close to her normal range.  Pharmacist initially had trouble getting pulse and blood pressure but was also using the same arm the vaccination was put into. Pharmacist got that blood pressure off the alternate arm. She went to lunch with Mother afterwards. Mother stayed with her until around 4:00 p.m. Shot was around 12:30 p.m. She went to sleep when she got back to her dorm and missed evening class. She has not noted any other side effects other than the tiredness, but she is a college student that&#39;s known to have low iron, was on her period, that just went through a trauma event that probably would have jumped her adrenaline, and she was giving some liquid Benadryl. I&#39;m sure any one of those could keep the fatigue.  There was a call put into the doctor but she&#39;s procrastinating on getting back to them. No rash or difficulty breathing was noticed.

                                                A couple of days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, I began experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks, much worse and much more intense than what I would typically experience with my GAD. These panic attacks and intense feelings of anxiety persisted for nearly three weeks.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

Asked if it was done without realizing vaccine was complete. Pt was sturdy upon standing and said she felt well. She made it to the chair in the designated area in front of the pharmacy. Approximately 3-5 minutes later patient raised her arm to get the attention of the staff. Said she felt funny. Vaccinating pharmacist went out to determine what was wrong. Patient said she felt faint and dizzy as well as felt nauseous. Patient spit up clear saliva inbetween dry heaving. We were able to give her paper towels and some water after her episode of spitting up. Approximately 5 to 7 minutes later she said she felt better but still had some faintness and a tingling sensation in her arms and fingers. Had patient stay for 20 minutes after she said she was feeling better. No more shaking, nausea, or faintness. She felt her normal self after the 20 minutes and her mother was with her to drive her home. Explained to patient that VAERS report would be submitted.

                                                I got my depo shot a week and a day after I got my 2nd dose of the vaccine. Shortly after I was driving home and I felt like there was an elephant sitting on my chest. I couldn?t get my air in I was freaking out. I drove home  and was so weak walking into my house I thought I was going to pass out. I told my mom I think I need to go to the hospital. I sat down. Ate some food and tried to relax. It eventually went away and I started getting ready to go to school. Just as I was getting ready to leave I got a huge migraine and started feeling really shakey. That?s when I decided to go to the doctors. They made me take some bloodwork, EKG, X-ray. They suspected from my white blood count that I might have a blood clot so they ordered an emergency cat scan. I got one done and they told me no blood clot. Then today I came in for more bloodwork and they told me that some of my waves from my EKG were slightly abnormal which meant I wasn?t getting enough oxygen into my heart. They want me to take an echo which in that they put me out and shove a scope down my throat and look at my heart. They think it was a reaction from taking my depo so soon after my covid vaccine.

                                                My daughter started to experience headaches 2 days after her first dose. On May 13th the headache had become so bad that she would cry and then suddenly became unable to speak or grab. She could not formulate actual words and was unable to smile . This lasted 15 minutes. A trip to the nearest Emergency room was inconclusive and resulted in discharge. 24 hours later , we had the same incident only this time magnified times 10. Where she remained in a catatonic like state for 7 hours only to snap out of it independently without medical treatment. After multiple test she was diagnosed with viral encephalitis. All major causes of encephalittis were ruled out and we were told it was possible a side affect of her first Moderna Covid Vaccine dose. We are still seeing doctors and testing but she seems to have improved without medication which is even more alarming .

The rash is itchy and has not gone away or gotten better a day later and it still seems to be multiplying. I felt difficulty breathing but I cannot be sure cause I was nervous I may have been scared after seeing the rash on my body.

                                                Mother alerted pharmacists before administration that their daughter experiences syncope with needles. The mother sat by her side as I administered the vaccine. The patient said that the vaccine hurt and sat their for about 5 minutes . At that time the patient said she did not feel well and laid on the ground. It is unclear if patient passed out for a few seconds. I spoke with patient to make sure she was conscious and then monitored her to look for signs of anaphylaxis. Her symptoms appeared to by related to anxiety rather that anaphylaxis. The pharmacy did call 911, but the patient and her family turned down the emergency service. I sat with patient for about 45 minutes to monitor her condition. When she improved they decided to leave that pharmacy. I did suggest they be looked at by a physician. We also called and check on patients well being and she seems to be doing fine.

                                                19 year old girl received the shot and was sitting out in front of the pharmacy.  She had told me she was very anxious about getting it.  Her mother screamed for us, so we rushed out and had a tech call ED.  When we went out there, she was hunched over forward as her mother was holding her.  She appeared to be having a seizure lasting around 10 seconds and was confused when she stopped.  Her mother told us before that happened, her head fell back and her eyes were rolled back.  Later, the patient told us she was just having a panic attack.  The paramedics arrived and checked her out.  All seemed to be fine, with the exception of a fast heartbeat as expected.  They convinced her to go to the hospital to be checked out.  I will follow-up with her mother this evening.

                                                I took my daughter to ER twice on July 7th and July 11th and she has been in the hospital ever since.  They suspect GBS.  She can?t walk, has extreme pain, and is struggling to understand what is happening to her.  She was a healthy 19 year old woman jumping on a trampoline and enjoying her life as we hiked through the park just 2 weeks ago.   Now she can not walk, has 80% paralysis and has pain that makes her cry constantly. As a reference she is a tough woman - she had her wisdom teeth removed and never used the pain medication they sent home with her.  She is in the hospital with no clear path back to a normal life and all of the doctors implied that the most logical cause is the vaccine.  She has insurance for the moment (through me)  but she can?t work and my insurance may not renew.  This will destroy her (and possibly me) financially if there is no help.

                                                I had cold sweats, a low-grade fever, a headache, body pains, and extreme exhaustion. The symptoms started a few hours after I received the vaccine and got significantly worse the next morning. I had to call out of work because I physically felt that my knees would give out when I was standing. I also could not rest my wrists on anything because it caused too much pain. The next day, I felt much better and was able to go to work.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I became extremely dizzy, nauseous, my lips went numb, shortness of breath, weakness, slow reaction times, the inability to operate at my normal speed in thought and action, and I became very lethargic.  I received the vaccine during a shift at work, and I was unable to complete the shift at my normal efficiency or concentration. To my coworkers, I described the feeling as being intoxicated, but not slurring my words. This feeling decreased enough by 9pm where I felt safe to drive home, but it was not completely gone until  approximately 11pm.

                                                1 week after recieving the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, I bumped my right arm about 2 inches below the injection site. Throughout the course of the day, my arm progressively became swollen and sore, to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it much or sleep on it. The next day it got progressively better on its own, and then I began taking an antibiotic prescribed by my doctor that helped it heal the rest of the way. I&#39;m not positive if the rest of the healing was on its own, or directly because of the antibiotic.

When I woke up the next morning I was short of breath and it felt like there was a lot of pressure on your chest. I called the hospital that gave me the vaccine and they recommended I go to the ER. I was discharged after 3 hours. I still felt short of breath and had the feeling of pressure on my chest for 48-56 hours. It just got better gradually. I was unable to work because I felt bad and because I also had to quarantine until my test results came back negative for Covid-19.

                                                Later Thursday night, I started to get headache, chills, fever and nausea. This continued all throughout the night and into Friday. The headache was so bad, anytime I moved, it seemed like someone was stabbing my head right in the front. I was hot due to the fever but I never got the temperature. The chills were dramatic, as I was laying on the floor shaking like it was -10 degrees while it was room temperature. I never threw up, but it was hard to drink anything. I couldn?t sleep that night as I was shaking so bad and the head ache hurt. Friday was the same, if Thursday night was a 10, Friday was a 9, so it got some what better. I had to drive and did so with out accidents, but it was t the smartest idea. Couldn?t eat Friday night, but I didn?t throw up. Saturday, everything is almost back to normal, headache is minor, no fever and little nausea, but the first 30 ish hours were the absolute worst in my life.

                                                Fever started at 11:30pm 4/6/2021. Fever ~100 degrees F. Had chills and couldn&#39;t get warm, then was hot and drenched in sweat. Repeated all throughout the night (Hot/cold). Took 500mg Tylenol at 12am that night. Woke up at 2am with a ~102.4 F fever. Took another Tylenol. Got out of bed around 8am 4/7 drenched in sweat. Felt nauseous and vomited almost right away and couldn&#39;t stop for a few minutes. Still had around 102 F so took 2 more Tylenols. Throughout that night and until Friday, I was achy all over my body. Also, lymph node under left arm pit was swollen and was sore along with my left arm. Throughout the day on 4/7, laid in bed trying to get rest and too nauseous to eat anything other than some cereal in the morning and plain noodles later in the day. Took another Tylenol in the afternoon because I was still staying at 102 F fever. Was slightly dizzy when standing up or moving too fast. I slept the next night and felt fine 4/8 morning (no fever), but felt worse as the day went on, aching everywhere and feeling more and more dizzy. Friday 4/9, I woke up in the morning and when I first started walking, I fell on the floor because of extreme dizziness. The whole day I was extremely dizzy and I&#39;ve never had vertigo before, but it seemed like that based on explanations of it. Also had painful headache every time I stood up, but was fine when I wasn&#39;t moving. The next day it was mild dizziness and completely gone the day after that.  Also, Thursday 4/8 around 7:30pm, I noticed I had hives on the back of my right hand. Not 100% sure if it&#39;s due to the vaccine, but I&#39;m not sure what else would have caused it and it&#39;s worth noting. It was gone the next day.

                                                Patient felt faint 10 min after receiving vaccination. She said she felt as though she had been hit by a truck and was very hot. She was sat down and feet propped up. Cold compress was placed on the back of her neck. She stated that she had not eaten anything today so we gave her something to drink in case her sugar was low. After a few minutes she stated her throat felt strange. I asked her if she felt like it was tightening  or lips or tongue swelling or issues with breathing. She stated she didn&#39;t know about the throat other than it felt strange. I gave her 25mg of Benadryl after getting permission from her just in case an allergic reaction was starting. She stated soon after that her throat was getting better. She sat for about 45 minutes in our immunization room until she felt better. She was no longer hot and feeling bad when leaving.

When she came to, she said she felt &#34;weird&#34;,  lightheaded and clammy.  We offered her a drink of water and before she could take a drink, she passed out cold. She was out for about 20 seconds and then came to again and we took her down to 1 layer on top and gave her a bag of ice while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.  She was treated/observed by the ambulance crew and after another 15 minutes, agreed she was good to go home with her 2 friends that she had ridden with to get her vaccine.

                                                Seven hours after receiving my second dose, I developed flu-like symptoms--fever of 100-101 degrees, full body aches, fatigue, and chills, in addition to a sore left arm. These symptoms continued for 18 hours. It was difficult to sleep.  I had the flu three years ago but this felt more severe. Symptoms were treated first with 200mg ibuprofen with no response and then with Tylenol, which improved symptoms.  I stayed in bed for most of those 18 hours to rest. Two days after receiving my second dose, I had a headache for the whole day.  The headache then became a migraine. Both treated with aspirin. Three days after the second dose, I felt fatigued, weak, and still had a headache. To my understanding, the first two days of ailment reflect my body&#39;s immune response and the final two are typical of my body&#39;s stress response. However, I have not experienced either in response to a vaccine.   I should also mention my first menstrual cycle after receiving the first dose of the vaccine was shorter than usual. My periods are not always regular so it may be a coincidence, not causation.

I could not sleep at night and developed the chills with a horrible headache. This was also after taking tylenol. I had the chills the following day and could not leave my bed. I slept the whole day and did not have an appetite. I was also constantly checking for a fever and did not have one, but I still had chills. My symptoms were almost gone by 9 pm of the next day. On the second day, I have neck pain on both sides of my neck. It is bearable but still there. I am otherwise healthy and have not been sick at all within the last year.

                                                After first vaccine: History: Moderna COVID vaccine on 3/11/2021. Arm soreness over the first day or two but nothing else that really struck her. A few days after she started to notice axillary pain that progressed up her right neck and down to her right hand. She saw a physician who thought she was having nerve pain brought on by the vaccine. Around the 18th she started to feel a snapping pain in her wrist. Went to ED on the 20th because she started to have arm shaking, she was given ativan, her arm shaking stopped and they discharged her home. That evening her fingers felt clenched. On the 21st she woke up in the morning, went to urinate and dropped to the floor because her legs felt like jello and felt like they kept giving out. They initially thought the ativan was just making her feel out of it. They waited until the evening but then needed to go to the ED. The concern was GBS and transverse myelitis. They ate dinner and decided to drive to ED, on the drive she was kind of falling asleep periodically. Then she suddenly couldn&#39;t lift her water bottle. She started to be completely out of it, Mom says she wasn&#39;t responding. Pt says that she felt like she knew what was going on, felt a little out of body and wasn&#39;t quite responding. Mom couldn&#39;t get her out of the car, she was carried into the ED and at that point she started to recover a little bit more. About 10 minutes later she started to feel better. She was admitted because she was still having trouble walking. In the hospital she had a normal CT head and video EEG but she didn&#39;t have any events while on the monitor. Discharged home the following day with the diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder and instructions to establish care with an adult PCP. They advised considering CBT as well.  Since discharge her legs feels tired, going up the stairs feels much harder than it should. She has not had any falls and no longer feels like she is going to fall.  She follows with a therapist, has had dissociative episodes and panic attacks in the past.   Assessment:  20 YOF with PMH of panic attack, POTS, IDA and benign heart murmur who developed weakness of b/l LE and altered consciousness approximately 10 days after her first dose of Moderna COVID vaccine. Also had an episode of unilateral arm shaking the day prior that resolved with ativan in the ED. At this point unclear if directly related to vaccination. Differential includes mild Guillain-Barre 2/2 previous infection or vaccination, stress reaction/anxiety, POTS complication, myasthenia gravis, tick bite, infection, heavy metal poisoning, B12 deficiency, seizure disorder, atypical migraine. Functional Neurologic Disorder diagnosed by neurology after overnight admission  for video EEG which captured no events. CT head  also WNL per neurology discharge summary. Neurologic exam today WNL.   After Second Vaccine: History: She had her 2nd vaccine on 4/15 (6 days ago). Had vaccine in right arm again, she did have some arm pain again. She had coffee without breakfast in the morning. Had finished her first virtual class, went to the restroom during her second class, felt strangely in the restroom, went back to her room. She then passed out. Her fall was unwitnessed. She called to her roommate when she came to but her roommate hadn&#39;t heard the fall. She thinks she was only out for a few seconds but cannot be sure. Called her Mom who advised her to eat something so she ate an orange sitting on the floor. She got up to make herself breakfast and she passed out again. Again unwitnessed but patient thinks it was very fast. She crawled over to the couch, sat on the couch for for 15 minutes then felt fine for the rest of the day. She did not feel nauseous at all. She denies palpitations, difficulty breathing and chest pain.  Today in office after orthostatics and blood draw she fainted again, only out for seconds. BP elevated immediately after the event but WNL minutes later.  These syncopal episodes reminded her of her syncopal episodes with IDA and POTS. They do not feel like the episode after the first vaccine when she lost feeling in her legs and was very out of it.  She feels like her arm pain from the first vaccine never fully resolved. After the arm pain worsened from the 2nd shot she tried a 3 day course of aleve to see if that helped things. At this point it is mostly just her right wrist that is painful. Overall feels more localized to wrist than prior. She has since stopped the aleve, last was last night. She has not noticed redness or swelling in wrist or arm.  LMP was 4/2-4/6. She went almost a year without menses so stopped her OCP, but her menses have returned recently and she has restarted OCP.  Assessment: Right arm pain persisted from the first vaccination but otherwise sx had resolved. She got 2nd vaccination on 4/15, only arm pain but yesterday had 2 brief syncopal events and one today in the office. Orthostatic BPs not completely convincing for orthostatic hypotension today.

Once I got home I sat down and started to get very anxious and my chest felt heavy and my tongue and throat started to swell. I say and tried to relax and was going to call 911 if it got worse. They swelling maintained so I took one benadryl, followed by another one 30 minutes later. When I woke up the swelling was still there but had gotten better. I took another benadryl that night. The swelling continued to go down over the next couple of days. After about 5 days I felt back to normal.

                                                The night after taking the vaccine, I had uncontrollable chills for several hours. The shivers continued even when I seemed to fall asleep, as my roommate stated. When I woke up, I had a high fever, extreme muscle aches, nausea, and was unable to move. The next day, I felt better. I did feel drowsy and almost like I could not think properly. After that, the symptoms went away.

I looked up if restlessness is a side affect of the shot but I didn?t come up with anything. It said fatigue which I had after the first shot but this one I didn?t fall asleep until 5:30 AM. I also had cramps like period cramps as if my lungs dropped to my pelvic.

                                                On 5/17/21 the Patient received the Moderna Covid Vaccine. She presented with a known allergy to PCN and Augmentin. This was not a reason for the patient not to get her vaccine today so Pharmacist proceeded to give her the shot. We asked for the patient to sit down and since she had some allergies we asked for her to wait for 30 min. Roughly ten minutes into her wait the patient started to complain of numbness of the face, so we went ahead and gave her a cold bottle of water. About two minutes later the patient began to complain of numbness in the arm along with hives on both arms and neck. At this point the patient looked very flush, disorientated, and acted as if she was going to pass out. I went and sat down with her and I could tell she was uncomfortable for which I got her some ice packs and started asking more questions about her reaction. I could tell the patient was very disorientated and she began to complain of swelling and tightness of the throat.  Once the patient began to complain of throat swelling/tightness. I had call code white and 911 due to the concern of anaphylaxis and pharmacy protocol.

I took my temperature about an hour later and my temperature was 103.3 F. I experienced a racing heart rate and heart palpitations throughout the night alongside the fever. My temperature didn&#39;t lower until another 3 hours, in which I took Tylenol, used cold rags on the skin, and soaked in a cold bath to lower my temperature. My fever went up and down all day during the 20th, wherein I felt generally unwell and feverish. Today, the 21st, my urine is extremely dark and black tea-colored because of blood in my urine, due to a preexisting kidney disorder where blood spills into my urine whenever I contract a virus.

We placed an instant cold compress on her neck and she held one to her forehead, and rested her head between her knees.  We also placed a fan in the area to circulate the air.  She said she was nervous because she had an appt at another pharmacy during her lunch hour and they couldnt give her the scheduled dose so she was driving all over town to find a dose in 100 degree heat before her lunch hour was over.  She also stated she had a &#39;rough time&#39; after her first dose and was concerned about the second.  We had her call someone to pick her up and drive her home- she was feeling better by the time they arrived (approximately one hour).  She believed her reaction was primarily due to anxiety

The doctor told me everything was normal and I was just having anxiety, even though I had nothing triggering any anxiety. I went to another ER the next day and did not have another EKG. The chest pain lasted 5 total days straight. My primary care doctor sent me to get a stress test a few weeks later. That doctor told me my EKG was abnormal from a few weeks ago. He said my T Wave was off. I have no known heart conditions that would have caused an abnormal EKG or the sharp chest pains I was having.

                                                Vaccinated Tuesday  07/06/2021 at 12:00pm. At 12:15 I was having palpitations, and my throat felt tight, I attribute this to anxiety, I was nervous to get the shot but think it should still be noted. At 1:00 or 2:00 that afternoon, I noticed about an inch around where the shot was injected I had small white head like bumps, that if scratched or pressured drained white puss. At 3:00pm that afternoon, I stood up from my bed and felt pressure in my head similar to sinus pressure you can get from a cold. I had no congestion.   On Wednesday 07/07/2021 I woke up and my upper L arm was in significant pain. The area that was vaccinated had a 2-3 inch radius that was bright red in color. The area where I was injected had a 0.5-1 inch radius that was dark purple. This area was hot to the touch, firm, and swollen. The pain was constant but worse when touched.    On Thursday 07/08/2021 there was no new symptoms and the skin reaction started to go away but was still present.   Today Friday 07/09/2021 the skin reaction is still present but improved.  It is still painful to the touch. The redness is gone but the dark purple circle is still pressent. It is still slightly firm, and is no longer hot to touch. It is still slightly painful to touch but not bothersome when left alone. Today I had to leave work early due to a drop in blood pressure at 12:00pm. Around 10-11am I was standing and typing when I felt like I had come down with the flu. This happened rapidly within 2 minutes. I felt feverish, I was sweating, I felt nauseous, but I did not vommit, I felt as though I was going to faint. I had one of the nurses at my workplace check my blood pressure. It was 107/72. Within an hour it rose to 108/72 so I decided to go home.  It should be noted I do not normally eat breakfast. I stay well hydrated.  I had only had my medication, and water at the time of this event which is normal for me. I was given crackers, and juice that did not help. I am unsure if this is related to the vaccination but think it should be noted.

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

                                                At around 11 pm, I started to feel nauseous. I had had a sore arm all day which I expected, but after trying to sleep it off I woke up around 2am shivering and sweating through my shirt at the same time, and had a 98.7 temperature (normally I am 97.2 so that&#39;s high for me). My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

This was NOT wittnessed; she does NOT recall passing out or hitting her head. A co-worker noticed something wasn&#39;t right &amp; had her sit down. They called my wife who picked her up &amp; brought home &amp; rested. Approximately 5.5 hours later, after feeling &#34;better,&#34; she got up to get something to eat. While returning to bed (to rest &amp; eat the small container of applesause) she felt as though she were going to pass out again &amp; quickly sat down on the steps. However, she did not call for me (I was in the room nextdoor) for a few minutes... seemingly having &#34;zoned out&#34; but she does not think she lost consciousness.

I slept with my mom in fear of having episode again. Around 2:45 am, my mom woke to me shaking like I was having a seizure. it lasted about 30 secs. she called 911 and i was checked out by paramedics, who said my vitals were fine and I should flollow up with medical care. My mom and I agreed that perhaps I needed stress dosing of Cortef. I took stress dosage and have been taking stress dosage all day and so far no more episodes.  Now waiting for Doctor to call me back and advise.

Then around 2 am I woke up and vomited. About 20 minutes later I vomited again. The next day I woke up and was fatigued, weak, and nauseous the rest of the day. I fell asleep multiple times and napped by accident. By 10pm,  almost exactly 24 hours later, I felt fine again.

                                                The syringe was larger and looked full. It took a long time for medication to go into the arm due to the amount of liquid injected into the muscle.  Right away the full left arm and breast were painful.  The arm pain continued to get worse and felt like she hit her funny bone but more extreme and this pain lasted all night into the next day.  She was unable to sleep due to the full arm pain.  The significant pain in the breast area lasted all day into the next day too. Also, felt chills and body aches starting that evening into the next day and night. We did not know the dose was only supposed to be 0.5 ml at the time of injection. We suspect she received at least 5 ml instead of the recommended 0.5ml.The name of the nurse that administered the vaccine is written on the vaccine card but not sure of spelling. RN?

                                                I received an allergy immunotherapy shot the day before my first dose of the vaccine and instantly felt nauseous and extremely tired after receiving the vaccine, which continued for two days after receiving tut. Three days later, I woke up struggling to breathe (but not anaphylactic), covered in hives, itchy all over, shaking, disoriented, and chilled but not truly feverish.  I reported this to my allergist, who prescribed prednisone and suggested the vaccine combined with immunotherapy were too much for my immune system for one week. The hives, itchiness, and difficulty breathing lasted about four days. I struggled with fatigue and nausea for over two weeks, stopping all school and work in the meantime. After my second dose, I feel just a bit tired and sore, so I think this truly was a bad reaction to the two injections combined rather than to the vaccine itself. Still, it was a debilitating experience,  and I would recommend considering putting out guidance that other immunotherapy patients space out their allergy injections and vaccines farther than I did.

                                                Patient reported a history of nervousness around needles and had passed out after an immunization in the past. I walked her through the immunization process and after administering her vaccine, I asked her if she was feeling ok before allowing her to leave the clinical room. She stated she was feeling ok so I instructed her to have a seat in the post-vaccination waiting area just outside the pharmacy for 30 minutes so we could observe her as a safety precaution. Shortly after sitting down, the patient fell off her chair. I ran out to check on her and found her unconscious and lying face down on the floor. As soon as I touched her shoulders she began to wake up and tried to get up. I asked her to remain laying down and offered to help her roll over onto her back. I asked her if she could tell me her name - she responded correctly. I asked if she knew  where she was and she correctly stated she was at store. I had her take some deep breaths until her color came back and when she asked if she could please sit up, I assisted her into her chair and asked a technician to get a bottle of water for her. She felt a little shaky so I continued to hold onto her shoulders until she felt completely stable. She was able to take a few sips of water which helped her feel more steady. EMS arrived and checked her blood pressure and blood glucose levels. She was cleared by EMS and chose not to go to the hospital for further care. I had her call a friend to drive her home and stay with her for a while to make sure she was ok.

I was nauseous, had body aches, severe arm pain, and a head ache all night and did not sleep well. Then I woke up at 1pm the next day with less arm pain, no nausea, less body aches, and a slight headache. This continued through the day, and then at 7:00pm I started to get a severe headache and arm pain again.

She then instantly slumped over in her seat and blacked out. She was unconscious for a very short period of time (Only long enough for the immunizer to call the RPh for assistance). 911 was called when Madison regained consciousness she asked what had happened, explained her anxiety and then vomited twice . The paramedics arrived and evaluated her and a ride was called so she would not have to drive. She waiting in the pharmacy for around 40-45mins after the vaccination before leaving with her parents.

When she got it a vessel must have been nicked, because she experienced a bit of blood streaming down her arm which surprised us. The nurse wasn&#39;t concerned and stopped it quickly and cleaned up her arm.  Got her a new bandaid and she was sent to the chairs in the waiting area to wait her 15 minutes following the vax.    I had to pick up my regular prescription so I got in line while she was sitting there surfing on her phone.  As I got to the front of the line, the patient called me and said she was feeling lightheaded. I immediately left the line, and was there (I was maybe 15 feet away) and was asking how she felt. She said she felt sweaty and like she might pass out.  Right then, her eyes rolled a bit and closed and she went limp. I was able to hold on to her and a customer that was behind me in line and I were able to alert the nurse that gave the vax and the pharmacist. Both immediately came to our aid.  We got the patient on the floor and on her side.  The nurse wanted us to have an epi pen in case, but we all didn&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction. We checked her blood pressure and it was low.  Another employee was already calling an ambulance and another was getting her some juice. She was beginning to regain consciousness. She was only out for about 2 to 3 minutes at the most.  Her blood pressure was low, but started to come back to normal pretty quickly.  We had her lay there a few minutes and then sit up. Eventually we moved her to the chair a few minutes later.  Within another few minutes the emts arrived. She had already had answered questions for us like her name, birthday, where she was, etc.  The emts repeated those same questions, asked us what happened and rechecked her vitals.  All were back to normal.  They gave her the option of be transported to the ER, but given that she was feeling back to normal she declined and everybody felt good about that decision.

                                                Patient was in the post-vaccination area seated after her shot.  About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she stated that she started feeling lightheaded.  She fainted and fell out of her chair.  I  immediately went to her and found her conscious, but very disoriented.  She stated that she felt nauseated.  911 had been called;  I stayed with her until they arrived.  They fitted her with a cervical counter and raised her to  a seated position and took her vitals.  She was able to stand and get on the stretcher with their assistance.  The EMTs stayed with her and monitored her  vitals until her mother arrived to take her home.  I spoke with her by phone at 6PM.   She stated that she felt fine  now (except for a bump on her head).  She stated that she was afraid of needles and that anxiety probably caused the incident.

I took allergy pills but it didn&#39;t do anything. The following day, Sunday, I had a very bad headache on the left side of my head. I had that headache for three days. That headache was over and then by that time I had lost my sense of smell for five to six days. I would get nauseous when I would eat - had a mild cough; no fever and body aches. I had  COVID test taken. They told me to take Tylenol  if I had a fever but I didn&#39;t have one; but I took: Dayquil; Nyquil and Theraflu and those things helped.

                                                When I woke up and got out of bed, I felt extremely light-headed, dizzy and nauseous. I started to get warm and felt like I was about to vomit so I washed my face with cool water. I went to sit down and my vision started to blur and my vision started to close in with darkness and I passed out. When I gained consciousness again, I was still extremely dizzy and light-headed and my vision was still not focused. I passed out two more times. When I gained consciousness the final time, I was extremely sweaty and shaky. I called 911 and they sent paramedics to my house. I drank some water and stayed in the floor until they arrived. They took me by ambulance to the hospital to run several tests and everything looked normal.

                                                I ended up having loose stools a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. I left work early because of this symptom. The next day I felt nauseous, still had loose stools and abdominal pain. This continued over a week, but I did call my GI doctor and they performed a CT scan. The CT scan showed abdominal inflammation in my colon. They gave me Zofran and put me on a liquid diet. My stool sample came back with elevated inflammation markers. My CEB rates were elevated. I did have a f/u and they said that I had been in remission with my Crohn&#39;s. The reason my doctor told me about being in remission is because he felt that my symptoms were a reaction to the vaccine. I started to feel better after a week of receiving the Zofran and being on the liquid diet.

The tightness was gone by the time I was admitted and they started running tests.

I went on oral steroids that night because of hives and some allergic reaction I was having, never did find the cause for that. The palpitations were so much worse because of the steroids. I thought it would go away after finishing the medication but they have persisted. Some days are better than others. I saw a general doctor about it on the 26th.  I went to the cardiologist the next day but the EKG didn&#39;t show the palpitations. They are most frequent at night. No other symptoms, just uncomfortable flutters causing anxiety and stress. Myocarditis?

                                                On May 28th 2021 I began to develop a photosensitive rash on my upper arms and upper thighs. 1 week later I began to experience severe joint pain in my knees and hips. Since May 28th I have been getting ulcers in my mouth as well. I have also felt extremely fatigued along with brain fog.  This is all out of the ordinary for me.

                                                The date of the second dose was 05/25/2021, which is when the side effects started. I had the normal and expected effects, such as a sore arm and fatigue. I began my period that morning, before I went in for the shot. I would like to be as detailed as possible, so I will likely include some graphic details in this description. My apologies in advance.  My period normally lasts 3-4 days and is moderate (as far as I know) regarding blood loss. After the second dose, the flow was extremely heavy and my period lasted for almost an entire week (7 days). It was miserable. I was bloated and tender in that area, and extremely tired. I was also cramping, which is unusual for me nowadays.  About two weeks after that, I felt a stabbing or ripping pain in the uterus area. It stayed for about two days, throbbing every minute or so. I could not sleep those days. It was not so unbearable that I could not perform everyday actions, but it was taking up a good portion of my thoughts that weekend. After that, it went away and I thought it was over.  About three days ago from today (today is June 22nd, or 06/22/2021), the pain returned and I knew it meant the start of my period. The timing was normal. The next day I began bleeding, but the flow is again much heavier than normal. The pain is back and much worse than before. I am going through many more pads than usual and it is, for me, a worrying amount of blood. Since this is the second period in a row I am experiencing this, I felt it was necessary to report it in. I hope this is okay and not taking resources from those with worse issues.  I would also like to note that I experienced my first panic attack in 5 years the night of my second dose (for no reason- they&#39;ve always had a concrete reason for occurring) and my anxiety was notably worse that week (I am on medication and was otherwise doing very well managing the anxiety). During the attack I experienced the usual symptoms: my throat closing up and making it harder to breathe, and uncontrollable shaking and crying.  I was not thinking of anything that would make me nervous at the time of the attack. I had just finished an online gaming session with a friend and was showering to prepare for bed, so I was fully relaxed.  Additionally, my mental health has notably dipped a bit over the last month, though there are a number of factors at play and I don&#39;t want to blame the vaccine for that. However, I was told to at least make note of it here just in case there does end up being a correlation.

By the end of May, congestion and sore throat had faded but headaches (several days each week), fatigue (most days each week), and some mental fogginess persist. Treatment of headaches included Tylenol and Advil; Claritin and Allegra were attempted in late May and early June, but symptoms persisted.

                                                The next day, I had a fever of 100, body aches, sore shoulder, and headaches after getting the vaccine. It&#39;s been two days already, and I&#39;m still down with a fever, bad headaches, dizziness, and a sore shoulder - I put ice pack, which didn&#39;t really work. Whenever I stand, I feel like I&#39;m gonna pass out. I&#39;ve been in bed for the past two days, and I can&#39;t work.

                                                Less than 24 hours after receiving the vaccine (Jan 7), I started experiencing bad stomach pain, which a family friend had also experienced after she received the vaccine (also ~24 hours later). It did not subside with time, and became feeling like a shooting pain that was coming and going in waves, and I could not sleep that night. I was nauseous at one point, and threw up. I drank water throughout the night, which seemed to help a little bit and was taking an NSAID. The following day (Jan 8), the shooting pain continued, and I was in bed all day. I became nauseous at one point during the day, when attempting to move a piece of furniture, but did not throw up. I continued taking NSAIDs, which did not help. I was able to sleep through the night after taking melatonin, but was in discomfort. The following day (Jan 9), I woke up, and the shooting stomach pain had radiated to my chest, and had not subsided. I called my PCP, who I was unable to see due to timing/distance from the office, and she recommended I go to an ED if I did not feel better. As the pain was in my chest, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it had radiated there or was cardiac related, I had a friend drive me to the ED. My results came back normal at the ED, and the PA was only able to tell me that it was GI related, due to the pain in my stomach/esophagus. She was unsure if it&#39;s GERD, gas trapped, or some other GI issue. I am still experiencing this pain (Jan 11), but have somewhat managed it by taking Tums and eating alkaline foods.

Used HCT cream TID and took zyrtec 10 mg at work yesterday. The rash looks a lot better today. Not itchy anymore.  The area is tender but not as red as it was. No discharge/pus.  No numbness or tingling.  T97.6  Pt denies any other sxs except for SOB for about 30 min intervals over the first 2-3 days after the vaccine. Pt checked pulse ox when feeling short of breath and it was 96%. She states she&#39;s not sure if it was from anxiety.

                                                I had a slight headache the day of the vaccine, and some soreness in my arm. I woke up the next morning after not being able to sleep all night with a temperature of 101.7 Fahrenheit coupled with profuse sweating and a stabbing headache. I took some Tylenol and drank a bunch of water and tried to go back to sleep ( Inhad woken up at 5:30). I was unsuccessful because I ended up having to vomit about 20 minutes later. Throughout the day, my temperature hovered between 99.5-100.4 even though I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen. The symptoms persisted all day and I only started to feel relief around 7 pm. I feel fine today, but I still have a bit of a headache and my left arm is still sore.

Rash then spread across chest.  No itching, no pain.  No hives. She said her heart was racing when she first noticed rash but attributed this to anxiety.  Checked pulse and O2 Saturation about 10 minutes after symptoms began.  Pulse 88, O2 sat 98.  She was offered benadryl but declined.

Left after sitting for 20 minutes because I thought the &#34;anxiety&#34; would resolve best at home. Arrived home at 10:25 AM. My lips started itching, and then swelled along with my tongue. My throat felt tight and I tried to take an oral Benadryl. It got stuck in my throat and I was unable to swallow the pill. It was also difficult to swallow water. I arrived at the ED by 10:40 AM, where I was treated with IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol. I remained swollen all over, especially in my fingers, for the next 4 days. I gained 12 pounds, either from the reaction or the steroids. My airway did not fully close.

                                                Severe injection site pain (aching) approximately 3 hours after injection on 2/2. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 2200 to take the edge off of the pain in order to fall asleep. Beginning at 0600 on 2/3: Temp of 100 F, chills, body aches, headache. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 1000 which lowered temp and reduced other symptoms for approximately two hours. Symptoms returned at 1200 with temp reaching 100.2 F along with chills, headache, and body aches that were more intense in the shoulder/neck area. Used a heating pad along my back, shoulders, and neck which helped with the body aches. Slept from 1500 to 1800 and woke up with an intense frontal headache with pain shooting through my eyes as well. Temp was 100.7 F. Took 400 mg ibuprofen which made the symptoms more bearable. Tried to stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. Also had two servings of soup. Symptoms seemed to lessen by 2200. The only symptoms lingering today, 2/4, are a slight headache, fatigue, and mental fog. Otherwise, condition has improved tremendously.

Took some ibuprofen and that helped a little bit, otherwise just took it easy and recovered pretty quickly (relatively).

                                                When the person had given me the shot, it was so painful and he had kept in my arm for a while. It was nothing like the first one. He had given it to me in my SUV. My arm was so sore for 2 days to where I could barley even lift it. I struggled so hard to do basic things and had to rest my arm and switch between hot and cold treatments for those 2 days. Still nothing really helped. I couldnt even lift my arm above my head without using my other arm to help support it. Even when i did that, it still was so painful.  The night of getting the second shot, I had body aches and a fever that reached 100.2.  As the days went  one i was able to move my arm more and more but i still have pain when  i move my shoulder a certain way.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

I was lightheaded and nauseous for the remainder of the day. I know pain is a typical side effect, but this was unusually intense pain and I felt I should report it. I quite literally felt delirious after coming-to on the floor.

                                                The day of the vaccine, I could barely move my arm. It was a completely different soreness. I had to move my right arm(one with vaccine) using my left arm. It was as if there was a bullet lodged in there-I could only move it a few degrees-and whenever I did, I would get a strong jolt of pain. The pain subsided, but never completely went away. Today it is March 21st and I received my vaccine on February 25th. I still cannot sleep on my right side. My doctor thinks it is bursitis and that the person who administered the vaccine did so in the wrong location-resulting in inflammation in the bursa of the shoulder. Additionally, we weren&#39;t seated to receive our vaccine. We received it standing up, and in my opinion, I think it is very hard to relax your arm doing that. It was an extremely quick shot-spot was cleaned, vaccine was administered, and line moved up. Pain sometimes lessens quite a bit, but if I put any pressure unknowingly in my sleep on the location, pain goes right back up. At the moment, pain is maybe 2/10. I can finally move my arm in all directions, but pain has not gone away. While I do not know for sure, I am very scared that this may be permanent.

                                                At about 06:15 PM after receiving the Moderna vaccine, patient left hand (the same arm the shot was given) began to turn blue-grey. The nurses there kept her in a room for about an hour, and monitored her vital signs. Everything seemed to be normal except for the discoloration in the skin. She had trouble breathing and some lightheadedness, but it was ruled to be an anxiety response as everything looked normal. Over the time spent in the clinic, the color began to become less intensely blue and fade back to a normal skin color -- but not completely. At about 7:30 PM, she got up to walk and started feeling pins and needles in her arm and upper chest, but this may be due to anxiety.   The feeling disappeared not long after, and we were able to make it home and eat. Everything else that night went OK, except for the fact that her hand is, at the time of this report, still blue-ish in color.

                                                - 22 year-old female  - Tested positive for COVID-19 on January 31, 2021. My symptoms lasted 21 days and started with major gastrointestinal issues, headache, and cough.  - Had a negative COVID-19 PCR test on February 25, 2021  - this negative PCR was needed to travel back. - Landed on February 28, 2021 and completed my quarantine at my parents house.  - I returned to work on the 15th of March, 2021.  - Over the weekend I traveled and flew back on April 5, 2021. Because I had flown, I was doing a courtesy and went to the local store to get a rapid antigen test.  APRIL 8, 2021 - left work at 12:30 and went to the store to get the rapid antigen test which came back positive. I was told by the nurses that it only came back positive because it has been less than 90 days since I initially tested positive. I was told I did not need to self-isolate and could go about as normal. I had my second dose of the Moderna vaccine on this day at 2:00 p.m. I went to get my second jab. Just to be safe, after my jab I went to the local urgent care where they took a nasal swab for a PCR test. The results of the PCR test came back Saturday, April 10 about 7:30 that evening and the result was &#34;NOT DETECTED&#34;.  SYMPTOMS: Thursday, April 8th  about 8:00 pm I started to have difficulty breathing and taking a deep breath was difficult. I put it down to anxiety about the initial positive test. Saturday, the difficulty breathing continued, along with new pressure in my chest. I was unable to sleep Saturday night - as soon as I was nearly sleep, I would wake up gasping for a breath. Sunday, the pressure in my chest continued and so did the difficulty breathing. I went to the Emergency Room on Sunday, April 11 about 4:15 pm - they took a chest x-ray, ran blood tests, and did an EKG which all came back completely normal - no pneumonia, heart attack, or blood clots. The doctor gave me a 1 mg dose of an anti-anxiety medicine because he could tell I was very stressed. He later prescribed me Prednisone (3 tablets a day for 4 days). As of today, I am still having a very hard time taking a full, deep breath and continue to have pressure in my chest.

When I came to, I was disoriented for about 2 minutes and very cold.  -For a week after I fainted I was very weak and couldn&#39;t stand up without feeling that I was going to faint.  -The second week after my shot I also felt pressure on my chest for 5 days that has since then gone away.  -Since I fainted 3 hours after my shot  I have experienced constant ringing in both ears that have not stopped for the past 30 days since I got the vaccine. I also experience blurry vision and vertigo that hasn&#39;t gone away.  -I have also developed headaches and recently I have an itchy rash on my neck.  -Since then it has been hard for me to focus and sometimes I feel like the world is in slow motion.

After the shot, calf muscles twitched/spasm on the sides of legs. Cankersore felt more sensitive and susceptible to pain. Later in the evening, there was and still is whistling noise when exhaling. That same evening prior to bed, feet were red (to where you can see blue veins in feet easily). Red feet were not present in the morning. Felt somewhat light headed after shower which also resolved. Symptoms after shot: Felt very anxious, emotional, and hunger.

                                                Patient appeared anxious prior to vaccine administration.  When asked if she felt like she was going to pass out, patient advised she did not pass out from needles/shots before, but has fainted because of extreme anxiety; but did not feel like she would pass out at this time.  After shot was administered, pt. was more relaxed, and advised she was feeling ok.  Patient was ambulatory, with no complaints of light-headedness or adverse feelings, and walked to the observation area.  Approximately five minutes following vaccination, patient told companion that she did not feel good, and laid down on the floor.  She then experienced a syncopal episode.  Patient did not hit head, or have any injury as a result of the syncopal episode.  Patient was breathing normally, but was unresponsive for approximately 15-20 seconds.  Following episode, patient regained consciousness (COAx3), and was upset from incident, but confirmed no injury or other illness, following episode.  Patient was evaluated by EMTs on site, and was able to sit up and transfer from the ground, to a chair, and the chair to a wheel chair without issue.  Further evaluation was conducted by EMT on site.  Blood pressure was 110/80, SPO2 was 98% room air, and pulse was 66 at approximately 13:22 hours.  Patient laid on gurney/cot on-site for approximately 20 minutes, to rest, and to be monitored for additional side-effects.  During monitoring, patient advised the only thing she had eaten today was &#34;one peanut butter cup.&#34;  Patient was provided water and a juice box during monitoring time.  Patient was released from monitoring area at 13:45 hours, after she advised she was feeling ok.  She was wheeled into the parking area as a precaution, and left with her companion.  Patient was the passenger of the vehicle.

                                                While waiting the required 15 minutes after being vaccinated the patient began to feel confused, had slowed speech, developed a globus sensation in her throat, as well as a pruritic rash on her chest and left arm.  EMS was called to bring patient to the ER; she was treated with Benadryl which immediately improved the globus sensation and significantly improved the rash. She was then dosed with solu-medrol as well. While at the hospital patient described a slight fullness of tongue and scratchiness of throat; the MD immediately treated with epinephrine and symptoms improved.  Patient was discharged in stable condition later the same night.

                                                Around 6:30, I started feeling dizziness and got a severe headache. After waking up from a nap that night around 9, I woke up to a 101.4 fever, itchy throat, dizziness, naseau, and a swollen, red circle around my injection site that was hot to the touch. I couldn&#39;t sleep due to pain and discomfort from my arm and fever. I woke up around 4:30, vomiting. I took Advil and Hydroxizine around 8 am to sleep, but it still didn&#39;t help as I woke up every 30 minutes. I had a fever of 101.3 and these same symptoms the whole day of 4/14. Before going to bed this night, my temperature was down to 100.3. I woke up the next morning (4/15) and my temperature was down to 99.4, so I went to work. I still had the symptoms of itchy throat, dizziness, and weakness. My arm was still swollen and sore too. Another symptom I thought was interesting that I had was waking up drenched in sweat this morning (4/16) and yesterday morning (4/15).  I even woke up through the night to put a fan on me at high speed and took my blankets off, yet still woke up sweating. Tonight, my temperature is back to normal, but I still have an itchy throat, some dizziness, and an itchy injection site.

                                                It started with a sorr arm and fatigue. The problem began after I was lying down in bed for 1 hr and 1/2. I laid down at 3:30am, but at 5am I was still awake and my left arm felt like it had fallen asleep. The problem was, I could not seem to wake it up. When I turned on my flashlight, I found that nearly all of the veins in my left hand were invisible, actually everything past the elbow on that side. I tried for about 10 mins while lying down to get blood flow back, but nothing was working. My face.felt very warm and the rest of my body felt very cold. When I finally got up to turn on my bedroom light, I found that all of my veins from my chest down were almost entirely invisible as well. I normally have very visible and easy to get blood from veins (except sometimes in my right arm), so this was very worrying to me. I got up and paced a little around my room to try and get blood flowing again, and I felt pretty shaky while doing this. My hands and feet would shake when I held them up. After about 5 minutes, I sat down on my bed because I did not feel well standing anymore, and I waited. Maybe 10 minutes later and things seem to be returning back to normal. I am still very tired but my whole body seems to have blood again. I am also currently on day 3 of my monthly cycle, but this has never happened in relation to that either.

After eating a snack and drinking water symptoms improved over about 1 hour and patient returned home. Pharmacist call to check on patient the next day, she said she was feeling better, not 100%, but Ok. Since then, she had a headache for 4 days and started having mental distress (out of body feeling, memory loss, and covid-like symptoms). She also states she has had excessive sweating since a week ago and feels very unstable on her feet. She went to a doctor who tested her for covid. It came back negative. The doctor advised if the symptoms continue to get worse, she should go to the hospital. She was at work today, we discussed all these things here. She said she couldn&#39;t even remember her name or walk straight. I told her she needed to go to the hospital ASAP and not to work the rest of her shift.

I had my mom check it and it wasn?t swollen but the day after I woke up and felt like something wasn?t quite right. I felt where my lymph nodes are near my clavicle and there were very swollen almost the size of a golf ball, my lymph node under my armpit was also quite swollen. I had a headache on the left side of my head and around my eye. My lymph node near my clavicle is still quite swollen but I?m feeling alittle better. I kept using a cold compress on my arm and lymph nodes as well as taking Tylenol. I did also have a slight fever of about 100 one night but it went away by the next day.

She lost consciousness, had mild full body tremors, and was unresponsive sliding down in her chair. She was pale and clammy. This lasted approximately 30 seconds. During this event she had urinary incontinence. She was assisted to a private area where she was given oral fluids and a snack. She was  observed for more than one hour. During this time her VS&#39;s were WNL. The provider attending her stated the patient became anxious when the subject of leaving was brought up. She reported having anxiety with shots.

I felt like I wanted to lay on the floor and fall asleep. I went home around 12:15 and slept from 1pm to 5 am. The next day I felt out of it.  The day after my shot I had a large red lump on my arm in the area where I got my vaccine and it was very sore. This lasted a few days and the pain and redness went away.  Yesterday, 4/19/21, I woke up with a large red swollen circle around the injection site. It itches very bad and burns. The skin is very hot. Today on 4/20/21 a red ring appeared around the red circle. It is still very itchy and burning. The skin in this area is very hot. Only ice has helped with the pain.

Noticed my chronic back pain (L5 fracture) was very bad, but didn?t initially connect it to the vaccine.   By 4:00 I was running a fever, fatigue, shivering, sweating, could not eat due to lack of appetite / nausea. Could not think straight.   The night of the 22nd (day I received 2nd dose of vaccine) I had difficulty sleeping, heart palpitations, and extremely strange dreams when I did sleep. The next morning (23rd)  I felt much better, even walked around for a bit, but by noon I was back to having sever symptoms. My fever spiked, my energy was drained, and my back pain was unbearable.   This progressed over the afternoon into unbearable tooth pain along with the back pain and other symptoms. Back pain did not recede with rest as it normally does. Ibuprofen did not seem to mitigate symptoms much.  Brain fog was intense and I could not focus on anything.   Managed to sleep last night and had more vivid dreams. Woke up feelings fine but symptoms seem to be slowly returning.

Felt pressure on my chest, breathing very fast, hard to catch my breath, felt my heart beating out of my chest. Lasted for a good hour. About 20 minutes in I decided to take a 20mg Paxil and 0.5mg of Ativan. After about 30 minutes meds seemed to help and I was able to go back to bed. If not for my meds I would have gone to the hospital.

These spells lasted for a couple of hours but after a few days became more chronic and was matched with fatigue, tightness of chest, headaches, and brain fog.  Impaired ability to complete every day tasks. Began presenting with capilliarities in mid April, along with easy bruising/bleeding and elevated liver enzymes (the enzymes began to stabilize over the following week).  All of these symptoms have persisted (currently May 4th).

I was driving home and had started moving my arm around some to work out the soreness.  A few minutes later I got really nauseated and started fading out of it.  I pulled over, put my  car in park, and put my hazards on. I passed out for 5-10 minutes. It was not just falling asleep but actually going unconscious. When I woke up I was covered in sweat and was very nauseated.   I had a friend come pick me up (obviously it was unsafe for me to drive). I have continued to feel a little woozy and nauseated (about three hours now after the injection). I also have cold sweats come on and off and I feel very tired.   I was well hydrated, not hungry (had eaten semi-recently), and well rested when I went to get the vaccine.

                                                Several hours after the shot, I began to feel very hot all over my face and body. I got very dry to the touch and I became extremely thirsty. I also had full body tremors. When I woke up the next morning (5/4) around 10 a.m., I had a fever, headache, and serious brain fog. My legs ached, especially my hips and knees. The intense thirst and dryness also persisted. I felt lightly nauseous on and off. I took an extra strength Tylenol and drank a lot of water before sleeping again until around 4 p.m.. Once I woke up, I was still suffering from all the aforementioned symptoms, but with less severity. I had another extra strength Tylenol and drank water and a sports drink. I ate a granola bar right after the Tylenol and started to feel a little better. Then I got really hungry, so I ate a muffin and drank an energy&#43; juice drink that had 80mg caffeine derived from green and black tea. I started to feel a lot better after that, though I was still weak and experiencing aching in my legs and hips. I took another nap from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and then ate once more before going to sleep for the night around 1:30 a.m. I have woken up today (5/5) with a slight headache but no other symptoms save the injection site soreness that has also persisted since a few hours after the shot. A note for comparison: as reported, this is my 2nd dose. My first dose had no symptoms whatsoever aside from injection site soreness.

                                                Two days after receiving the IM injection in her left arm, patient developed soreness at the injection site and painful left axillary lymphadenopathy. It was painful to lift her arm, and she felt a &#34;pulling&#34; on her chest. She was very distressed and sought evaluation by her PCP on 4/29/2021 who told her that she had lots of swollen lymph nodes. She was unable to work for four days because of the pain. The soreness in her arm has resolved, but the swelling and discomfort on moving her left arm persist, although they are improved. She did NOT have any fevers, chills or night sweats associated with the event.

I knew the fever was a possible side effect, but it got very bad very quickly. I had to call off of work because I could not stay awake and was in so much pain. My fever has lowered 2 days after vaccination, but has not fully gone down.  Also, my neck on the side that my vaccine was administered (the left arm) is very swollen and very painful. I cannot lift my arm and there is a noticeable difference between my left and my right neck in regards to swelling.

Started having extreme fatigue (really difficult to move around) and then I started having something that felt like sinus pressure/pain. Headache began from the middle of my forehead and went around the sides and back. Got really cold, then got really hot while going to bed. Continued feeling very hot (feverish) throughout the night. Felt like the flu. When I woke up I felt relatively fine other than being fatigued for the entire day.

She asked our technician for water. Pharmacist went out to check on her - she was alert but she said at one point everything was bright and she could not hear. She had moved herself to sitting on the floor. Called ambulance just to check her out. Pharmacist monitored her to make sure she was okay until ambulance arrived. We gave her ginger ale and crackers and cold rag and water. At this point patient confirmed she was nervous about vaccine prior and has passed out from giving blood before. Patient had only eaten half a sandwich by 3 PM in the day. Ambulance arrived and reviewed patient&#39;s vitals. She decided not to go with the ambulance. Called patient about 30 minutes after event to check on her, she stated she had gotten something to eat and felt much better. Total incident took place over 10 to 20 minutes. Pharmacist referred patient to her physician for follow up.

Fever/body chills lasted two days after receiving. Extreme dizziness hours after receiving and lasting about 3 days. Abnormal period began one week later (2.5 weeks early) with terrible period cramps, abnormal increase in blood loss, nausea and headache.  About a week and a half after receiving first vaccine I felt real congested, stuffy, and like I had a cold. Abnormal for a generally healthy person without history of chronic or really any sicknesses. Chronic ?cold? feeling every couple weeks since receiving (today?s date is june 26).  The tingling and numb sensation happens every day to this day in my left forearm, palm and fingers, and on the left side of my skull.  It starts gradually and lasts for about 20-40 minutes, about 2-5 times a day. No amount of movement or massage for blood flow helps. Still experiencing irregular and abnormal cycles, and extreme heavy flow almost at once that has never been normal. New direct stabbing and cramping pain has began to occur since my first cycle after the shot. It?s a sharp stabbing and cramping pain in my reproductive organs area. Worsening hormonal acne with no changes to previous routine/no new medications, etc.

                                                4/5/21: Felt first symptoms while sitting in class. Felt very faint when I had to go to the bathroom and was better after I had gone. The following weeks after the first dose and before the second dose I would still get random faintness feelings and trouble breathing that would make me miss class, events, and other activities.  4/29/21: Received the second dose of Moderna Every day after the second vaccine I felt horribly faint even when I was completely hydrated. I could barely move and felt worse when I would stand or sit. At this point, I developed horrible fatigue and tiredness and even more problems with breathing. 5/13/21: Went to ER for horrible chest pain, heart palpitations, and feeling faint. An EKG, chest XRay, and blood work was completed which all came back normal. 5/16/21: Felt the worst I have ever felt. Was bed ridden for a week because I could not stand or do anything without feeling like passing out. Trouble breathing would get worse especially at night when I was going to bed. I would stop breathing when falling asleep and wake up gasping for air. 6/2/21: Developed a racing heart beat and my body would go into physical panics multiple times a day 6/4/21: Went to ER and had 15 tests done which all came back normal or negative 6/8/21: Visited primary doctor with same symptoms. Had a heart rate there of 110 while sitting and was prescribed a heart ultrasound and holter monitor for my heart 6/11/21: Experienced horrible night where I woke up feeling like my body was failing me and had horrible breathing issues. Went and got the heart ultrasound ad holter monitor put on which came back normal 6/22/21: Went back to primary doctor and had more tests completed since I was very weak, tired, and still felt faint. Came back positive for developing mono along with my other symptoms 6/23/21: Went to cardiologist where I was cleared for a good heart 7/13/21: Visited Gastroenterologist for stool issues that I noticed changed since the vaccine. Experiencing loose stools that are orange since the vaccine in April and now have a nerve triggered my body to make me feel faint whenever I go to bathroom. A colonoscopy is scheduled to make sure nothing else is going on. Overall, I have developed many adverse events that have left me incapable of doing anything. I cannot get a job because I feel awful still and would not be able to withstand a workday. It has also given me horrible anxiety that I NEVER had before that coincidentally appeared when I got the shot and hasn?t left. I still feel these symptoms mentioned above.

I took benadryl, and was relieved of these symptoms. Then, around 9pm that night, I developed a fever. The highest temperature I recorded was 101.9. I took Ibuprofen around 11pm, and was afebrile by 3am. I have not had any fevers since, and I did have to call off work New Year&#39;s day. I have had an intermittent, mild headache since receiving the vaccine as well,  but overall I feel fine.

                                                From 8am till about 10am I felt shaky after the injection. I dint feel like chills, had no temperature. I could not stop shaking, felt like a deep muscle shake.  I felt shaky and jittery from 8am till 11am. I had a cup of tea where I was able to fall asleep.  I had a telemedicine call and I spoke to a NP and she recommended to go to an ER but I did not go. I just felt very anxious.

                                                Patient reported feeling like her tongue was tingling and felt larger than normal. She did not report having any difficulty breathing.  25mg of Benadryl was given orally.  After 10 minutes she thought she was feeling a bit better, but then continued to say that she was having tingling and not &#34;feeling normal&#34;.  We decided to administer epinephrine instead of waiting for her to continue to get worse.  I administered an epi-pen (0.3mg) about 30 minutes after she took the Benadryl and a nurse from the SNF called 911.  Paramedics arrived and evaluated her.  Her breathing sounded okay via the paramedic&#39;s stethoscope.  Because she was still not reporting feeling &#34;back to normal&#34; and because she had epinephrine administered, she was transported via ambulance to the ER for continued monitoring.

Took 1 Aleve for the pain. Then on day 7 axillary pain went away and a rash started to form on arm where vaccine was given. Day 8 rash spread at was bright red. Around noon on day 8  hives popped up next to left eye. On day 8 did a virtual doctor appointment and the NP prescribed antibiotics because she said the &#34;rash&#34; is cellulitis.  At this time took zytec to help with the hives.

                                                On 1/4/2020 at roughly 07:00 PM, a dull ache started in my right arm where the vaccine was injected, it radiated from my right shoulder, to my right shoulder blade. My arm felt very heavy. There was also a small hard lump beginning to form with a little heat at the injection site. I had difficulty sleeping due to the aching pain. On 1/5/2020, I woke up at 06:30 AM, the lump had grown in size, and was much more red and hot to the touch, in an oval shape. By roughly 11:30 AM same day, it began to itch, I had checked it and the lump had raised significantly. Hot to the touch. The dull ache had begun radiating into my right armpit as well as down to my right elbow. By 06:00 PM, same day, the aching had continued,  the lump was still very raised, itchy, red, and hot. It looked like a large hive. By 06:30 AM on 1/6/2020, the dull ache had mostly subsided, my shoulder blade still felt uncomfortable. The itching continued. The redness spread in size, however the swelling of the lump had gone down slightly. By 06:30 AM on 1/7/2020, the lump had mostly gone down in size significantly, the dull ache had subsided completely, the redness had gone away. By 1/8/2020, 10:00 PM, the lump and swelling are gone, no ache, no itch, still a slight discoloration where lump was.

By the evening, left arm pain was too uncomfortable to wash dishes and lift household objects. Pain woke me up at 3am that night and I could not push the covers off of me, dress or undress, and I experienced severe pain with slight movement (7/10). Nausea and cold sweats began around 5am and lasted for 45min. I contacted the nurse via messaging system and was told to take OTC nausea medicine and Tylenol. I took the maximum dosage for Tylenol that day but could not do my normal school functions. The next day I was still limited by pain but did not require medication to cope. By day three, I had full range of motion back and minimal pain. Day four I am back to exercising normally.

                                                I received the dose at 1:45 pm on 1/13/2021 at Medical Center. Almost 1 hour post vaccine I started to feel a lump in my throat, as the minutes passed my throat started to feel tighter and fight and flight mode kicked in.  It was hard to swallow, my tongue was swelling and I called EMS at 2:40 pm 1/13/2021.  EMS noticed hives on my chest and left arm where I got the first dose of Moderna.  I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

                                                The day of the vaccine about 4 hours later, I started experiencing chest pain. It was not tightness or a heartburn feeling type of chest pain. I have asthma, and it is the type of chest pain I start feeling right before I get bronchitis, almost like breathing in mist and the irritation that comes from having a cough, but I had not had a cough that would have caused this sensation. The next day, I was extremely fatigued, had a headache, chills, started getting a cough, and was sent home early from work. The day after, Friday, I had a fever of 102 and was essentially bedridden. I started using my nebulizer and my dr called me in some prednisone. These symptoms continued through the weekend and began lifting that Sunday. However, on Monday, my lymph node under my ear started swelling on my left side (the same side as the shot), my ear became clogged, my sinuses on my left side had shooting pain every time I inhaled, and although I could breathe through my nostrils, they felt full and had immense pressure. Additionally my headache became worse and I began experiencing intense muscle pain right at the base of my skull on the left side near my occipital lymph node that was radiating into my head and making the headache and sinus pain worse. Now, 11 days after my first dose of the vaccine, I still have the ear pain, swollen lymph node under my ear/behind my jaw, sinus pain, muscle pain at the base of my skull, a headache, and extreme pressure in my head/sinus area that has not lifted. I started on an antibiotic Friday night (the 22nd) in hopes that this is a sinus and ear infection. Ibuprofen helps the headache slightly but makes the pressure in my head feel worse and makes the joints in my hands and forearms hurt and my fingers swell for some reason which has never happened before for me when taking ibuprofen.

Color returned quickly, and pt was talking, alert and oriented. Initial O2 sat- 86 but quickly increased to 98 on O2. O2 sat on room air fluctated 95-97 but increased when her mask was pulled away and deep breath taken. EMS assesed. Pt and mom declined transport and will f/u with physician.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

At 10:30pm began to feel chills and body aches. 11:00pm  got very hot and sweaty, hands began to tingle, vision became fuzzy around the edges, felt like I was going to pass out. Experienced tachycardia, tachypnea, and headache. 12:20am- vomited. Restless sleep through the night, chills, fever (100.6-99.6 on Tylenol), body aches, joint pain, stomach ache, woke at 5:00am.  1/26- spent all day vomiting. At least once every hour. Continued tachycardia, tachypnea, stomach ache,  fever, headache, body aches,  and joint pain. At 7:00pm took Zofran and I stopped vomiting. Still nauseous. Could not eat all day.  1/27- woke up with headache and slight body aches but otherwise felt okay during the day. Was hungry and able to eat. Starting at 10:00pm my stomach began to hurt again. Experienced bloating, sharp stabbing pain and nausea. Felt like I needed to vomit or pass a bowel movement but could not do either. Took Zofran at 11:00pm, did not help in relieving my GI symptoms. Still on round-the-clock extra strength Tylenol. Could not eat all night.   1/28- woke up still with headache, and mild-moderate stomach pain.  Able to eat a couple bites of food.

Severe headache, throat sore with swollen glands, could barely walk/move or get out of bed. Also experienced nausea. Took tylenol around 1:00am and again at 5:00am.  Could not move from bed on Wednesday and had to call out of work Thursday with a bad headache, weakness, and overall body pain/discomfort. It is now Friday and I am still having very bad joint and muscle pain when I walk and move and still have a headache and fatigue/weakness.

I had not felt great from the moment I got up on Sunday, and felt progressively worse throughout the day. I had really bad body aches and chills, to the point where I was shivering, even with three layers and a puffy coat on. I normally never get cold. I also had a really bad headache. By the time my shift was over at 1pm, I wasn?t even sure I could trust myself to drive home. Eventually I decided it was fine, but by the time I got home I felt so terrible that it took me at least 15 minutes to get out of the car. I took a hot shower and went to bed. I was shivering violently, even with lots of blankets, and couldn?t even sit up to drink some water. I laid in bed for hours, doing absolutely nothing and feeling miserable. I got up after 7:00 pm to eat some dinner and felt so nauseous that I was dry-heaving into the toilet.

Following day she reports &#34;the worst headache,&#34; body aches and a low grade fever.

After 2nd shot on 02/06/21, I had most symptoms listed. I got the 2nd dose at 9:03am and once I woke up from a nap at 1pm, most of the side effects had already started. I had severe pain at the injection site where I was unable to dress myself or do normal activities, severe muscle pain and soreness, severe chills, a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, a mild headache, severe dehydration that remained throughout the day and night even though I drank almost 2 gallons of water, stomach pain and bloating, and nausea and vomiting that occurred in the middle of the night at 2am, and extreme fatigue. Even though I had fatigue, I was unable to sleep due to the pain. I finally took pain medicine at 8am on 2/07/21 to help myself go to sleep as well since I was awake for over 24 hours. I slept for 6 hours and woke up still having chills, muscle soreness, a slight fever, a mild headache, and pain at the injection site where I am still unable to lift my left arm and put clothes on.

The following morning I woke up and got dressed and used the restroom. I proceeded downstairs to make my coffee.  As I was doing so I became dizzy and nauseous. I sat down on the floor and then I lost my vision and hearing. I broke out in a profuse sweat and had no concept of time. My boyfriend was with me and said it took 5-10 minutes before I began to normalize. I apparently had shallow breathing and turned pale white including my lips, I slowly regained awareness although I never fully lost consciousness. 911 was called and paramedics arrived. by this time I had begun to normalize with most of my vision returning. I ended up declining to see medical attention because I normalized and told the paramedics I would seek attention if it came back.  * please note the physician listed is my PCP but I was not seen for this reaction.

For unknown reason the patient arrived to vaccine clinic on 2/9/21 without allergy skin testing or follow up. She reportedly told them that she was &#34;&#34;cleared by Occ health&#34;&#34; after her first reaction and the administering RN said that there was no flag on her chart so she was given the vaccine.  Unfortunately, immediately after she got it, she developed throat tightening and got zyrtec. The reaction progressed very quickly (minutes) to diaphoresis, panic, grabbing at throat saying she was suffocating, nausea, and difficulty verbalizing. She was diffusely red but no hives. They couldn&#39;t get a BP and O2 sat and temp were normal but they put her on a non-rebreather and gave her Epi. Rapid response was called and she was taken to the ED.

Felt very weak and was walking out of kitchen when I felt extremely nauseous for about 10 seconds then started to stumble and dropped my water as I fell. Got back up and tried getting more water and then I fully fainted and woke up slightly confused on the floor.  Felt slightly better after and called my PCP?s on call doctor who told me I did not need to go to the ER. Woke up with body aches/mild fever still and a headache from hitting my head

                                                I have had the same symptoms with both doses of the Moderna Vaccine. The weeks following after my first shot,  my symptoms didn?t show up as strong until about 1-2 weeks post the vaccination.  I called out if work at 2:45 in the morning for that day and slept all day/night.  My 2nd shot was yesterday 2/12/21 @ 11:30 AM &amp;&amp; around 5pm yesterday afternoon I started feeling symptoms and they have just gotten worse through the night and day. Which in turn caused me to have to miss a State Final Exam I?ve had scheduled for months now and have had to reschedule due to Covid multiple times.

The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

My left arm was in a lot of pain, my neck, lower back, legs - all aching and hurt to move. This lasted until 3/23 around 6:00pm.

Some mild confusion and dizziness (though I have been experiencing cognitive issues for over a year now. I believe the fever is exasperating pre-existing symptoms). Some mild nausea and a mild headache. I am not completely back to normal yet (as of 7pm) but I do believe I will be fine as time goes on.

Prior to injection, patient reported being nervous about fainting. She reported no prior history of fainting due to vaccination or blood draws; she &#34;passed out&#34; two years prior to dehydration at a music festival.  Approximately four minutes after injection, patient stated that she was going to &#34;pass out&#34; and had an episode of syncope. She exhibited pallor, dry heaving, and arm contractures. The nurse helped her to a supine position on the floor and called for assistance. The nurse team encouraged deep breathing and provided apple juice, pretzels, ammonia inhalent, and cool washcloths. EMS was called and arrived at 1045 for further assessment. Patient reported that she had not consumed any food or drink prior to vaccination and stated that her hands were &#34;tingly&#34;. EMS took blood pressure and heart rate; both were within normal range. The patient was taken to the hospital by EMS at 1055, where providers determined that syncope was likely caused by anxiety. Patient returned home and reported feeling tired but stable when health department called to check in at 1400.

                                                I have been experiencing intense upper arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow.  I am not able to lift my arm.  My blood work shows inflammation markers and low levels of ANA and IFA markers.  I did not have any of these symptoms or markers before taking the vaccine.  I am not able to go to work.  I have seen a primary care physician and a neurologist.  When taking the steroid Prednisone, the pain does subside, but I am not allowed to take a steroid for more than one week.   I stopped taking my second dose of Prednisone 4 days ago, and now all the pain has returned and I cannot lift my arm.  This situation is frustrating and scary.  The doctors do not have a diagnosis or treatment plan.  Pain relievers do not help at all.

My left arm was very sore. My nose was very congested. I tried adjusting sleeping positions but that did not help. I had some chills.

                                                I woke up at 1;00 with a rapid heart rate - it was up to 140. I got up and took my temperature - 102.8. I started with taking ibuprofen. I went back to bed. Got really nauseous; started vomiting; started having diarrhea. By 5:00 am, my fever still had not gone down and I took some Tylenol. Temperature still hadn&#39;t gotten down at all at 08:00. I went to my Urgent Care clinic - I was really dehydrated and My vital signs were not looking well 101.9. They gave me two liters of fluid with IV Zofran to help with nausea. I was there for four hours with the IV the whole time. They released me with a prescription for Zofran. I went home and slept the rest of the day. I continued to take Tylenol.  I didn&#39;t have any vomiting and nausea after that. I was completely fine on the 25th.  I was having at least one headache a day for two weeks after that which is not normal for me. I started having heart palpitations and chest pressure within a few days of being in the URGENT CARE. Once I went back to work (after a couple of days off) I started having  3 - 6 occurrences of heart palpitations and chest pressure  a day-    I saw a  2/22/2021 cardiologist - 140&#39;s that day - the heart monitor came back and everything seemed fairly normal. I have a follow up appt with cardiologist on 4/26/2021.  I am still having  heart palpitations and chest pressure but very few - not as often at all as it use to be.

Muscle stiffness - started an hour after vaccine and lasted about 48 hours, no pain medication or stretching helped, caused sleep issues due to not being able to get comfortable. Difficulty breathing - chest felt tight and felt like I wasn&#39;t getting enough oxygen in each breath so I had to pause to take deeper breaths.

                                                Onset of pretty severe neck and upper back pain that made it difficult to sleep because I was unable to find a position that didn&#39;t cause any pain about 12 hours after injection (inj: 12:45 pm on 4/16/21; onset: 12:30 am on 4/17/21). Saturday, 4/17/21, the pain lessened and I just felt a bit of fatigue and injection site pain. Sunday night (4/18/21) going into Monday morning (4/19/21) I was woken up from my sleep with very severe upper neck pain that radiated down the R-side of my back, on the muscle. I could not fall back asleep for 2 hours because any position I was in I experienced intense pain. Today, 4/19/21, during the day, the pain is definitely less severe. I took my meloxicam this morning as I usually do but it was still pretty bad pain so I rubbed CBD cream on it. Pain still feels dull but tense, with occasional flare-ups of sharp pain. Today it is more widespread, across my shoulders and in the bilateral upper back area. When I rubbed the CBD cream on it, it hurt to touch. I also take gabapentin at night, which is my standard for my fibromyalgia, and I&#39;m not sure if that is what is exacerbating this pain, seeing as it is so much worse at night. I have never woken up from pain before like I did last night, and I deal with pain daily with fibromyalgia. It was very intense.

                                                Had my shot at noon on 4/19, and around midnight or shortly after (at 1am-ish on 4/20) I had really terrible chills and was shaking, but my forehead felt hot, I felt quite nauseous, and I had a headache. I got out of bed and took my temperature using a thermometer and it was 100.6 degrees. Continued to feel bad until falling asleep around 3am, woke back up at 6am and took my temperature again and it was still feverish at 99.8 degrees. Woke up once more briefly at 11am but did not take temperature and fell back asleep. Finally woke up for the day at 3pm and fever had broken, temp was back down to normal at 98.5. Still felt a little nauseous but that was probably more from not having eaten all day! Now as of 4/21 I am back to normal. (If it helps for further info, I have also not to my knowledge contracted Covid before, and I had no adverse effects other than a very sore arm from my first shot. The second shot my arm was less sore but of course I was distracted by being actually sick. Also possible data to note is that the second shot felt like it hurt less and I got an unusual new bandaid type the pharmacist called an inject safe barrier bandage.)

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on 4/25/2021 at 2:50pm. Patient was in observation area chair 1 and technician noticed she was pale in color and patient waved technician over to her.  Technician went to her and then alerted Pharmacist that patient was feeling light headed and was pale.  I went to patient and asked her how she was feeling and if she was having any trouble breathing. Patient was starting to slouch in her chair and I asked her if I could lower her to the ground.  At that time, she passed out and was unresponsive.  I lowered her to the floor and supported her head with my hand.  She was unresponsive for about 5-10 seconds but then her eyes popped open wide and she made a large gasping breath.  She was very disoriented and asked what happened.  As I talked to her and asked her questions, she became oriented with her surroundings and was able to verbally communicate with me how she was feeling.  Patient was reporting tingling in hands, heart racing, and was visually shaky.  I asked her if she wanted me to call EMS and she responded yes.  At this time, patient was beyond the 15 minutes post observation waiting period.   Technician called emergency number, I stayed on the ground with the patient and continued to assess her symptoms and her breathing.  The color in her face resumed to normal and she was able to use her cell phone to contact her father.  While sitting on the ground with her, she reported she was beginning to feel better, but was still feeling weird in her head.  At that time, EMS arrived and took over.

Most noticably has been the welt - uncomfortable to try and sleep. Itchy and achey. Applied cool lotion to try and sooth it, taken Ibuprofen and even tried gently holding a cool (unopened) can of soda to it when I had nothing else. Ongoings as of now (5/7/21) Been staying home a resting - wanted to do my part and fill this out.

                                                Woke up around 3AM in chills and a cold sweat. Was unable to fall back asleep until around 7:30AM--didn&#39;t check my temperature until about 8AM, and it was 103.4 degrees. My temperature peaked at 104.1 later that morning. I took Ibuprofen, stayed in bed, kept a cold cloth on my forehead, and drank a lot of water in the meantime. My fever started to come down in the afternoon, but did seem to climb if I wasn&#39;t adamant about keeping a cold cloth on my forehead--for example, it would come down to about 100, but if I took of the cloth for about 30 minutes, it started to climb back up toward 102. My fever seemed to break around 4 or 5PM, but I slept most of the day, so I don&#39;t have an exact time. After that, I had a little &#34;brain fog&#34; for the rest of the evening (Friday, April 7th), but when I woke Saturday (April 8th) I felt almost totally recovered.

                                                Central Venous Sinus Thrombosis in Superior Sagittal Sinus  I arrived home at 12:38 on Sunday, 5/9, and opened the door to see my sister with facial droop, slurred speech and a contracted right hand/fingers. She was crying and immediately knew she was having a stroke. She had been trying to clasp some jewelry while getting ready for Mother&#39;s Day. She was able to walk down to the car with me no problem (no extremity involvement other than right hand/fingers). We arrived at the hospital within 10 minutes and she was a Code Stroke. A CT scan showed the clots as well as a tiny Subarachnoid bleed and she was admitted to NeuroICU. The symptoms waxed and waned for a few hours and at one point she developed the droop again, had headache and heartburn and vomited. A CT scan was repeated after some Heparin had entered her system and it was stable/not worse; subarach bleed was not changed and Heparin was continued.   She  has now been admitted for 3 days and the Heparin is complete. She is now being transitioned to oral Xaralto. She has no deficits whatsoever and has made a full recovery so far. We are still pending the results of her coagulation studies to see if she has a hereditary condition.   The doctors believe the clot is due to her Nuvaring Estrogen, which is most likely. However, I would still like to report this event just in case.

I was told to take Ibuprofen 400mg a daily for about one week to help relieve the pain.  I also got an inhaler of albuterol that I now use intermittently if I get chest pain.

I made sure my blood pressure was stable (usually reading 128-135 systolic) and tried taking my propranolol for anxiety to stop the effect. Nothing really made it go away. This is not normal for me, but unfortunately I had to work so I worked through it. Would cause me to feel out of breath at times. It finally went away for the most part on the Monday of the next week, but it comes back occasionally.

May6th- May 8th: Started to notice mosquito- bite like bumps on both lower extremities, both legs started to swelled up. But the right leg was more swollen than the left to the point that I couldn?t sleep or walk on it.   May 9th- I went to Emergency Care around 5am to be checked out cause it was hurting me so much.  They couldn?t figure out what had happened and they discharged me a few hours later with an order of Prednisone to take once a day for 7 days and preferred me to my PCP.   May 10th - We went to go see my PCP which she advised us to stop taking the prednisone and doctors orders was to stay out of work for a week in order to be off my feet.   She advised us to cancel the second vaccine appointment until everything clears up.

I had 12 visits to the ER and 2 admissions beginning on March 3/2021 and May 17, 2021, for various reasons included; severe headaches, loss of vision, pain in ears and spine, tingling in arms and legs, memory loss, fogginess, seizures.  It felt like my whole body was on fire. I think they did a Covid test on my 4th or 5th visit to the ED and it was negative. Sever depression to where i wanted to hurt myself. That has gotten better with medications. I am working minimal hours because you are on reduced schedule due to symptoms.

                                                Immediate lightheaded effect after injection. Illness begins the night after vaccination (uncontrolled vomiting/heaving, fever, profuse sweating, headache, dizziness, fatigue) lasting 3 days. General malaise and prominent fatigue continue after cessation of initial violent symptoms and continue currently. This initial reaction was followed by 2 months of extreme depression, brain fog, decrease in memory, and general fatigue, so much that my quality of life has been affected. Appointment scheduled with Dr. in ~April to investigate my continuing symptoms. Episodes of presyncope begin in May. An ekg is preformed in May by Dr. showing tachyarrhythmia with short PR syndrome. This is the first abnormal ekg I have received and I have never had heart problems previously. Referred to Dr. who confirmed inappropriate sinus node activity resulting in short PR tachycardia via monitoring using a 2 week heart monitor.

                                                It should be known that I never experienced tics in any capacity prior to the covid vaccines. A few days after receiving the first dose, I experienced mild facial tics that persisted daily. These tics became progressively more pronounced over time. The day after I received the second dose, I experienced severe tics in my face, head, and neck. I was forced to leave work early that day as a result. I could not function at my job because of the severity of the tics and needed to take a week off from work. By March, the tics became so severe and constant that I sought out a neurologist. I had multiple blood tests done and an MRI scan, and the results indicated that there were no medical abnormalities that could cause the tics I was experiencing. The neurologist diagnosed me with adult onset tic disorder and prescribed me topiramate to decrease the tics so I could return to work. After many weeks on the medication, the tics I experienced were less severe and manageable. I stopped the medication in May and have not needed it since I am able to function and work. I am still prone to &#34;attacks&#34; where the tics become very severe and debilitating to the point where I cannot work. The last attack I had was July 19, and I had to leave work due to the severity of the tics.

No history of anaphylaxis. She received vaccine at 5:42. Felt lightheaded and dizzy about 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine. She noted chest tightness and tachycardia symptoms. We transported her via gurney to our observation area. She looked sleepy and had trouble arousing her. Blood pressure is 140/80, heart rate was in the 90s to 100s. Breath sound decreased bilaterally. No lip swelling. No rash. She noted throat felt uncomfortable.  Suspect anaphalxis reaction given rapid decline in status while talking with her. epic pen at bedside immediately and then due to increasing heart rate and complaints of chest discomfort gave her epipen times one. Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

                                                After about two hours my arm pain was so intense it felt like it was nearly broken and continued to feel worse. I had EXTREME headache and nausea which nearly led to vomiting but kept having to hold it down while alternating between Advil and Tylenol and Tums just to feel a little relief. Pain medications did not help substantially for the first 36 hours. I felt bed bound , had no energy to even move to pick up the TV control a few feet away from me. I had SEVERE chills, and still have them nearly 56 hours out with the headache and nausea still prevalent . I had such bad body aches and dizziness. Have had a hard time getting sleep because of the intensity of my symptoms. Absolutely has been the worst ever and I would NEVER get this shot again. Y?all need to do better. This is completely unacceptable for this to be side effects experienced by people even if it?s less than 10% experiencing the severity I felt. This is so messed up on so many levels. I?m going into medicine myself and although I believe in vaccines, this is not one I will be advocating for until research gets it together and provides a vaccine that is safer for people to receive. Completely anxious and worried and scared as to how my next few days and weeks will go especially with how severe my side effects have been and the news articles showing how some people seem to be dying within hours or days of the Moderna and Pfizer shots. Unacceptable. I can?t believe the amount of fear for my life I have right now.

                                                around 4AM of 01/06/21 (approximately 10 hours after receiving injection) I woke up with stomach cramps, feeling as if I needed to have a bowel movement which is extremely unusual at that hour. I went to the bathroom and ended up having extreme diarrhea. Went back to sleep, proceeded to wake up at 7am for work (I work at a hospital). Went to work, temperature upon arrival to work at 8am was 96.7. Didn&#39;t start to experience any other symptoms till around 10-11am. Developed a headache and thought, &#34;hm this is weird, I haven&#39;t had a headache since I had COVID but I hope it goes away soon.&#34; Then I went to lunch at noon and everything hit me all at the same time - freezing and sweating profusely, headache became so debilitating that it was burning/hurting my eyes, uncontrollably shaking, felt so weak (body aches all over, everything hurt). Took my temperature while I was at home for lunch and it was 101.5 and my heart rate was 160 (my heart rate is usually high because I take a stimulant but it is never that high). Went back to the hospital because I wanted to go to the ER and needed to get the rest of my belongings anyways. The ER physician and staff found the same things when doing initial vitals - high fever and heart rate. I made the ER physician aware of the fact that I had just received the vaccine the night before while also just having had COVID less than one month prior. I was instructed to go home at that point to get rest and recover. For the rest of the day on 01/6/21 and all of 01/7/21 I had to take off work because of adverse symptoms and effects. For all of 01/7/21 I was extremely fatigued and the headache never went away until 01/08/21.  On 01/08/21 I returned to work and symptoms diminished.

Throat tightness, itchiness in scalp and groin, and difficulty concentrating (all my usual symptoms of anaphylaxis) occurred. Advised by health care provider to take Benadryl immediately and to have epi-pens on hand. Loratadine was prescribed.

I couldn&#39;t; I was stuck in the state of my body shaking and unable to see anything. After the two times, I had the shakes.

I took Tylenol as a tx, but this kept me awake until about 5:00am.  From 5:00am to 10:30am I was able to fall back asleep and woke up feeling back to normal.  Around 11:30am I showered and noticed a hard lump on my supraclavicular the size of a golf ball that was never observed before. This lump is still present on 2/1 and is planned to be checked as a precautionary measure by my PCP on 2/3.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                Pain began in upper right arm and radiated down to wrist for first week. Upon slightest movement around arm, pain ensued even worse as is and did not allow sleep. Pain has  limited shoulder mobility for 2 weeks. Received Hydrocodeine-acetiminophen and Ibuprofen at ER on Monday January 25 for 3 days. Then, upon follow up with PCP, medication for pain relief was prescribed as followed: ibuprofen 800 mg and Gabapentin. Pain has subsided but remains upon slight movement of shoulder.

                                                I had on-and-off insomnia starting around 10pm. I woke up every thirty minutes on the minute with a feeling like there was a fifty pound vest on my body.  At 3:30, I felt nauseous. I walked from my bedroom to downstairs to the kitchen. My knees buckled several times en route. When I ate one bite of a protein bar, my nausea increased tenfold. I ask drank water at the time.   I walked back upstairs to my room to sleep where remained awake until ~five am. I slept from ~five am until approximately 8:10am. I felt faint as I walked into the bathroom where I felt my faintness increase by the second. My knees buckled and I passed out on the bathroom floor tile for ~five - ten seconds. I payed there for a few minutes until I felt stable to stand.   This morning, 45 hours after the injection and 22 hours after blacking out, I felt a goose egg on the back of my head. It has hurt all day at a level 4/10 on the pain scale.

I then slept for the remainder of the night and woke up with nervous system ?shock like? feelings of shivers and shaking.

                                                Around 5 pm on 2/11 (day of vaccination) I began to notice a very sore arm and dry mouth/dehydration. Drank water and continued as normal. Around 2 am of 2/12 I woke up with chills and had been sleeping very restlessly.  I had body aches in my arm, legs and back. Around 3am my temperature was 100.2. I also felt very faint when standing and thought I may pass out.  3 times when standing, I had to quickly sit down to avoid it. I do suffer from vasovagal syncope so this may be unrelated to vaccination. I took Tylenol and drank more water. Temp rose to about 100.6 before beginning to drop at around 4 am. I continued to take Tylenol every 4 hours and it helped keep temp below 100 but towards the end of the 4 hours, it would start to rise again. I ate normally and drank extra water due to feeling dehydrated still. Around 1 PM 2/12 I started to feel nauseous and had an upset stomach. I was still have a general body aches and elevated temperature around 99.5. My normal temp is usually about 98.0. Nausea led to diarrhea 1 time. Symptoms continued until approximately 8 pm when very quickly the body aches, nausea, fever and soreness in injection arm all went away. None of these symptoms have returned and it is now 2/13 at 8 pm.   I did test positive for Covid-19 on December 28, 2020 but have been fully recovered with no symptoms since 1/8/2021.

Also experienced lethargy and nausea on the day after the vaccine. I did have GI upset immediately after and for a few hours after getting injection but that subsided overnight and I experienced some neck stiffness within an hour of the vaccine but that seemed to wear off through the day.  As of writing this (10:20 pm) I am still experiencing joint pain but it has decreased as well as muscle soreness; went from a 9 at the worst and is now a 3/4 and better with analgesics

                                                I have experienced excruciating pains shooting through my arm where the vaccine was injected for the past 2 days. On the night after the vaccine, I could not sleep because in any way I would lay down the pains would cause my arm to tingle and then the pain was too much. It has been 2 days now and it still hurts to even lift a cup with that arm.

                                                I had a temp of 102 starting at 10pm and lasting until 9am. I woke up at 1am with a temp of 102.7, drenched in sweat, and shaking so badly my partner thought I was having a seizure. I did not seek treatment, because I was able to sleep after taking Tylenol and having my partner use cold washcloths and ice packs on my neck, forehead, back, and chest. I also attempted to take a shower, but I was so weak I required assistance to walk to the bathroom. I had similar side effects the next night although less intense.

                                                I had no immediate reactions to the vaccine. About an hour after my injection I developed a low grade headache. The next day, 2/26, I woke at 7am with a headache still. The headache and fatigue worsened through the day (2/26/21).  Around 3:00pm I started experiencing waves of dizziness. By 4pm I had begun experiencing temporary loss of feeling in  various body parts. Each part&#39;s loss of feeling came and went separately and lasted about 2-5 minutes each. I experienced this in my left facial cheek, both wrists and hands, and my right hip. I had a coworker drive me home and by 5pm I had a migraine with severe sinus/head pressure and a fever of 99.4. My average resting body temperature is 97.4. I slept from 6:00pm friday till 10:30am on Saturday (2/27). When I woke I still had a headache, but no longer a migraine.  I spent 2/27 dizzy, weak, and achy but no more episodes of lack of feeling in body parts or a fever.  I have not experienced soreness in the arm I got my injection in, but I noticed on Tuesday March 2nd that I my injection site is very swollen, red and itchy. The swelling and redness (to my knowledge) has not gotten worse or better since then, but the itching has gotten worse and the actual puncture wound is now visible since yesterday (3/4) whereas it was not visible anytime  before  that.

                                                Approximately after receiving the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, a 24-year old female patient experienced an episode of syncope/near-syncope. She was immediately assisted by a pharmacist onsite, who helped the patient to lie on the ground with her legs elevated.  The patient immediately regained consciousness and was speaking normally. The patient was monitored closely for approximately 45 minutes. At that time, the patient reported feeling no symptoms or side effects, and was allowed to leave with instructions to seek appropriate medical attention if needed for further symptoms.

                                                The first adverse event I noticed was a red, inflamed and itchy rash at the site of the injection. It was slightly painful and warm to the touch. I spoke with a few others who experienced similar reactions.  I took over the counter antihistamines in an attempt to treat it for several days.   One or two days after the rash appeared I started to feel sharp intense pain in my groin and around the vaginal opening to the point that it interfered with me sleeping and sitting comfortably. I have had a history of muscle spasms and vaginal pain (vaginismus, muscle contraction pain) but it was more intense and unprovoked which is why I wanted to reach out honestly? It?s a bit alarming. If other women/people with vaginas are experiencing this it would bring me some relief to know the cause and treatment.

She was nervous leading up to the vaccination, but seemed ok right after.  She regained consciousness quickly and was a bit disoriented.  She proceeded to drink some water and sit for a while.  After 15-20 minutes she looked much better and alert.  She was unable to get someone to pick her up, but waited for 30-40 min after the event before she felt confident to drive.  She stated that she had eaten breakfast and it was the first time she had every passed out before.  She said a cold feeling came over her and she just went dark.

HOURS 12-24: By 4 am I was shivering, fevered, and aching enough to officially call out of work, though there was no coughing (and honestly that made me wonder if i was being a wuss, but the next day, the difference was real). The rest of the day was mostly aching and chills, with rest when possible. I felt distinct sluggishness. Bright light or changing orientation too quickly resulted in headaches and squints. My lips were dry even though i had been downing water constantly, thank you fever. Very light eating the whole day, dry toast, pretzels, etc..  HOURS 24-36: Felt vaguely crummy throughout the rest of the evening. After sleeping the next night through i felt great, and even exercised before work.

The Sunday after my vaccination (on a Tuesday) I started a period which was normal until the next Tuesday when it got extremely heavy and I had to leave work. Days 2 and 3 of my period had always been the worst before I was on birth control and would last 6-7 days petering out at the end, and I am now on day 6 with as heavy a period as day 2. I&#39;ve also noticed a lot of blood clots in my menstrual fluid which I have never had before. I have had to take days off of work and hope this doesn&#39;t last too much longer.

                                                That evening my arm swelled up and became very painful - not as much as the first vaccine. I had a hard time sleeping - nausea and headache throughout the  night. 4/3 - extremely tired; felt like I couldn&#39;t get enough air (shortness of breath) body aches and muscles aches - over all lethargic. 4/4 - I was dizzy, short of breath . Those two symptoms lasted along with fatigue - which lasted for two days. I almost passed out that day - everything went black and I had to be assisted to the couch to recover from that.  I used Tylenol for my symptoms when needed.   I still have ongoing headaches - three weeks ago (about a week after I got the vaccine) - I noticed I was having ongoing headaches and I still have these.  Pregnancy - 2nd pregnancy; 1st one was full term. Date of delivery expected - September 9, 2021.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 17-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Fainted), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)). On 18-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol). On 19-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) and FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug). On 28-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period) and PALLOR (Pale as a ghost). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (Fainted) had resolved, SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work), SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol), FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period), PALLOR (Pale as a ghost), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)) outcome was unknown and DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) had not resolved. Not Provided      The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medications were reported. Treatment medications include Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) for diarrhea for 1.5 days (unknown dose/frequency).  Patient waited out 20 minutes post-vaccination and then went to the bathroom. When she came out of bathroom she fainted, paramedics were summoned. Mother took patient to Emergency Room(ER) 20 April 2021, after taking her first to urgent care (who directed mother to take patient to the ER), ER sent her home saying it was just a little stomach bug, but no one else in the family got this &#34;bug&#34;.  Patient&#39;s last test for Covid-19 was on Monday (26-Apr-2021) and results came back negative on 28-Apr-2021. Company comment: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and nausea are consistent with the product established safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol.

                                                Fatigue and pain in the injection arm within a few hours of the vaccine. Extreme pain all over my body began around midnight the day after vaccination, and I could not sleep because of the pain. My entire body hurt, especially my back, hips, and the injection arm. I experienced chills and hot flashes on and off. I also experienced fatigue and weakness. These symptoms persisted throughout Friday (my vaccine was Thursday).  Ibuprofen helped ease the symptoms. I felt mostly normal on Saturday, with some lingering back pain and fatigue.

She took some Benadryl and passed out for the rest of the day.  Then about a week later the injection site started getting puffier and the whelp is now the size of her fist and is red and purple.   She saw her PCP who is calling her in something stronger than Benadryl.

                                                Nothing for the day after the injection. At night, started to have some chills, could not sleep.  I took a Paracetamol 500.  I am breastfeeding my 5 month old daughter, so sleep is already  broken up but I can normally sleep soundly between each feed.   In the middle of the night, i had a mild fever and troubles walking 5m.  In the morning (05/21/21), I took a paracetamol 500, still had fever, migraine, chills, and was generally very weak.  At 2pm, I took a paracetamol 1g and at 2.30pm, my temperature under the arm was 37.8°C.  Thanks to the paracetamol the fever went down but I still a a strong migraine.  8pm, temperature at 38.4 under the armpit, took paracetamol 1g.  Fever and chills went down,  still had the migraine and nausea.  05/22/21: 2am, chills and general pain, took a paracetamol 1g.  Could sleep 8am, no fever still headache.  Migraine and nausea all day.  10pm, no symptoms anymore except for the muscular pain in the right arm when the injection was done.  05/23/21. Only subsides the muscular pain in the right arm.

                                                It started out with vomiting and fever and then really bad stomach pains. Stomach pains after anything I ate or drank. That happened for a couple of days. Then I had blood in my stool and it was like diarrhea. So I went to the ER on 02/09/2021 and they gave me a CAT scan and said there might have been some kind of colitis. Referred me to a specialist. Right after I went home and two days later I went back to the ER with even worse pain. Had blood in my vomit and was kept there for a couple of hours. They again referred me to another gastro appointment. I wasn&#39;t able to get into a gastro appointment until 02/26/2021 I believe. When I saw the specialist they said that my symptoms had to do with Colitis. Symptoms worsened and I was admitted again. Became to weak and couldn&#39;t walk. I lost like 15lbs. Sched for 03/08/2021 was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. I was point on medication and put on medical leave for three weeks. I started mesalamine treatment. That didnt work so now im on a biological treatment for every 8 weeks or until further notice.  REMICADE is what I was prescribed. My iron levels had dropped and I had to get two iron treatments through I.V. as well. Seen hematologist

                                                I received my vaccine on May 17th and exactly eight days later, May 25, I woke up with what is known as &#34;Moderna Arm.&#34; My left arm where the injection was became, red, hard, swollen and itchy. Throughout the day on May 25th I then started to develop small red bumps on my hands. On May 26th, I woke up with more bumps on my hands, torso, legs and feet. By Thursday May 27th I had them from head to toe. The palms of my hands, feet, the tops of my hands and feet, elbows and knees were by far the worst. The rest of the bumps were spread throughout the rest of my body. Friday, May 28th I had even more and they were extremely itchy and painful. I also had a headache and slept most of the days. By Saturday May 29th they began to seem to heal. It is now June 1 and my feet, knees, hands and elbows still have some but the rest of my body has healed for the most part. I took a lot of Benadryl and put anti itch cream on but nothing seemed to really help.

We had her take a seat and called the paramedics.  the mom gave both girls ibuprofen immediately after the vaccine while waiting.  The paramedics attributed this to nerves and not a true allergic reaction.

By the time RPh grabbed the epi pen and was next to the pt, within 15 seconds since pt passed out, the pt was consious.  no epi pen was administed. pt reports having stress induced seizures from time to time and believes this is what happened. pt was placed into a chair about 2 minutes after passing out. pt reports she hit the back of her head and was given a cold pack. pt arranged for family to pick her up from store. does not appear to be caused by vaccine, pt may have been stressed by getting a vaccine and needles. no further issues or concerns arose.

The technician had administered the vaccine and then had the patient meet another technician at the counseling window to schedule her second shot. As they were finishing up, she became lightheaded and fell. She hit her head on the floor and rolled over and had a seizure for a few seconds.  The pharmacist saw her fall and went out and tended to her. One technician called EMS and another got an ice pack and cold water for her. She came to fairly quick but was disoriented and didn&#39;t remember what happened. We advised she wait for EMS to check her out and she agreed. We had her wait in the room until they arrived.   She was checked out and signed a form as to not receive treatment. She told me she would follow up with her doctor and would also ask about her second shot. I informed her it might be advisable to receive in office.

My heart was racing, body and face was sweating, externally nauseous, dizzy, blurred/fuzzy vision, body shaking, the room was spinning,  and I was unable to stand up. This would happen every time I got out of bed and stood up. Lasted about 2 hours.

Later in the day I took my temperature and had a fever of 101, my fever later broke after taking Tylenol and NyQuil. The next day, Saturday, my lymph node in the left armpit was so swollen I could not wear a shirt. My nausea continued but I no longer had a fever. My lymph node continued to be swollen until Monday. On Monday I woke up with a rash on the left side of my chest, small red dots and this resolved by the end of the day.

The RN who was giving me my injection palpated the top of my shoulder and NOT my acromian process and administered the injection closer to the top of my shoulder, the vaccine did initially hurt more than a typical vaccine would when it was being administered but i thought that might have been normal. Approximately 1hr after receiving the vaccine my left shoulder joint started to have this pinching sensation in the anterior joint when I would raise my arm forward. The pain got progressively worse throughout the day with significantly decreased range of motion in that shoulder and significant pain in my shoulder joint. The pain was so bad it actually kept me from sleeping that night. I never had any muscular pain or any other symptoms beside the joint pain, which was alarming since it should have been administered into the muscle. I believe the vaccine my have been incorrectly injected into the shoulder joint or potentially a smaller muscle in the shoulder. The pain and decrease ROM is preventing me from doing most of my regular day to day activities. Today 1/9/21 has been a full 48hrs after receiving the vaccine and the joint pain has not gotten any better and my range of motion is still significantly decreased, which would prevent me from performing my tasks as an RN.

Patient&#39;s aunt called me and told me that niece (patient) is 25yo having issues with coordination about a week after 1st Moderna vaccination shot. Unsure of exact vaccination date and onset of symptoms.  really having to focus to place hands under water to wash them, walking through doors without bumping into them, turning on faucet, getting dressed; left hand is worse than right and not able to easily align things properly;  &#34;feels like her brain isn&#39;t doing what she&#39;s telling it to do&#34;.  Aunt said the symptoms are not improving. Patient had tested negative for Covid the day she got the vaccine.

She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

She was placed in a recumbent position on the exam twith legs elevated and vital signs were obtained, they were within normal limits. Pt then reported that it felt like she had something in the right side of her throat - she declined epinephrine injection. RN and LVN stayed at bedside. Pt then stated that both sides of her throat felt blocked and gave consent for epinephrine injection. RN administered 0.3 mg epinephrine and activated EMS. Vitals signs, breathing and circulation monitored closely until EMS arrival. Pt was transported by ambulance to the hospital emergency department for evaluation.

                                                About 30 min after the vaccination I felt dizzy. It felt almost like I had gotten up too quickly and felt dizzy, that kind of dizziness. Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

                                                I experienced fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches and headache after 9 hours from receiving my second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The pain was so severe I almost went to the ED and had to take off work the following day. My temperature was as high as 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. I took acetaminophen but this did not help the pain. However, this only lasted less than 24 hours and I made a complete recovery. I have not experienced any issues since.

                                                Woke up around 5AM with a severe headache and tenderness at injection site. Throat was also very dry. Was not able to go back to sleep due to pain. Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

Had shoulder soreness day 2 post vaccine and was taking Motrin and Tylenol with some relief. Pain continued to get better. On day 9 post vaccine, pain returned with intensity and was seen at urgent care on 1/9. Shoulder was swollen and red at the time, so urgent care NP diagnosed cellulitis and I was prescribed Keflex, along with instruction to continue taking Motrin, Tylenol. Called out of work on 1/11 d/t shoulder pain/decreased range of motion. Today (1/13) pain is much better but still having some pain/discomfort in the shoulder.

Started off being disoriented and light headed which led to me losing consciousness. Would go in and out of consciousness until sternum checked multiple times. Got picked up by the ambulance and taken to the hospital as blood pressure was low and was fevering per first responder. Had an ekg with tachycardia, once delivered to the hospital. Still in and out of consciousness. Stayed there roughly 6-7 hours and received fluids and magnesium before being discharged,

When I got up, I felt very weak and my head was foggy. I also kept stumbling when I walked. I drank plenty of water in case I was dehydrated and ate protein, but these symptoms lasted the entire day. The next morning I woke up with a mild headache but mostly felt normal.

                                                Arm pain - extreme. I couldn&#39;t fully move my arm which lasted 24 hours. And then it lessened so I could use it but still pain for three or four days. Redness on injection site - just a big, red spot (not rash). Red spot went away and then a big white spot - six days for white spots. Almost like my arm wasn&#39;t getting blood - just white like that for a few days. Headache - still have it - minor enough when I wake up but when I go to bed that every other day I&#39;m still taking medicine for it; nausea; fever; chills; hot flashes - lasted 5 or six days; fatigue - still have a little fatigue. It is better than it was. At first I was sleeping 15-16 hours a day. Still have to go to bed earlier than normal. Stomach pain - those are gone now; runny nose; loss of appetite; brain fog - I knew what I wanted to say or do but couldn&#39;t. Advil was taken and I tried Tylenol, too. I iced my arm. I did a humidifier.

The injection site was hot, hard and quite painful (I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body for three nights). I felt generally unwell and achy. After about three days all of my symptoms went down and most of them were gone except for I could still feel a small amount of swelling under the skin that continued to go down. On Tuesday Feb 10, almost a week out I started to experience an itching feeling that increased throughout the day to a deep itch that feels like it goes down to my bone. The injection site has become red, hot and hard again and the lymph node in my left armpit is extremely painful and swollen. I feel dizzy and nauseous.

Nurse called pt 2 days after vaccine administration. pt states was feeling completely back to normal now. states after returning home, later in the afternoon she still felt like her breathing wasn&#39;t as good as normal. Pt used her prescribed nebulizer treatment at home and experienced instant relief. no recurrence of any s/s after that.

I also had severely painful swollen axillary lymph nodes on the same side that I received my injection. I was not able to work or do any of my daily activities for almost three days. Then on day 7 after receiving my first vaccine dose, I developed a itchy, painful, red rash and hives surrounding the injection site (about a two to three inch radius around the injection site. I also got hives and red itchy painful skin on my face. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed prednisone and a week of pepside and zyrtec. After a week I stopped taking the allergy meds and then the hives came back, so I kept taking the allergy meds until my second vaccine dose.

And every few weeks, I have a few come up at the injection site and on my face, and then they go away.

I took 2 extra strength Tylenol at that time, put an ice pack on my forehead, and drank a Pedialyte.   In addition to those, at about 4 I had ringing in my left ear and then lost the hearing in it. I just went to bed. When I woke up, around 10am on Friday, I could hear, but super dizzy. I couldn?t really walk without  feeling like I?m going to fall over, especially with turns. All symptoms continued throughout all of Friday.  I continued to take the Tylenol per the instructions on the bottle with my last dose around 5pm, I also drank 3 more pedialytes throughout the day in addition to plenty of other fluids. Took a warm shower around 7PM which seemed to help some with body aches and chills, however, dizziness/vertigo remained.  Saturday I woke up several times drenched in sweat. Around 9am my fever was gone. Still feeling a little ?off? in terms of balance/vertigo but nothing compared to Friday.  Slight body aches remain. Other symptoms gone.

                                                Around 6:00 pm on the day of vaccination I started to feel very fatigued and developed body aches - this felt similar to the beginning of developing Covid-19 symptoms. (I had Covid-19 back in November of 2020)   Around 8:00 pm I had developed some head congestion and swollen lymph nodes along with some throat pain and sinus congestion - again feeling very similar to Covid-19 symptoms.   Around 10:00 pm as I was heading to bed the symptoms became  a lot worse, I had pretty intense body aches and started to experience chills as well as a slight fever (around 99.5 in F). At this time the symptoms felt similar to how I had felt during the worst of my previous Covid-19 symptoms, very weak and achy, headache was very bad, and felt very uncomfortable overall.   Around 2:00 am on March 13 I woke up with a fever of 101.8. The previous symptoms had also gotten worse, I was having a hard time getting out of bed because things were very uncomfortable, I drank a lot of water and took some ibuprofen to combat the fever, about an hour after this the fever had come down to about 99.9 and I was able to fall asleep, but before taking the medication I couldn&#39;t have fallen asleep because of the discomfort of the aches, chills, and fever.   Throughout the following day I was unable to complete many of my day to day activities without taking a daytime cold and flu medication. With the medication I still felt sick but was able to walk around and complete some simple household chores, this carried through into the evening, when the medication wore off the chills and aches and headache were much worse and I still had a fever around 99-100. That night I was able to sleep with the cold and flu medication taken right before bed.  Upon waking up the next morning (March 14) I still had some congestion, headache, and general discomfort but the worst of the aches were gone and I no longer had a fever, these symptoms continued to diminish throughout the day.   On March 15 and March 16th I have had a slight lingering congestion headache, this also feels really similar to the lingering headache I had upon recovering from Covid-19. It is not debilitating and is continuing to improve. Otherwise I am feeling healthy again and have been able to complete my usual activities and even exercise.   Overall the symptoms felt like a couple days of having Covid-19 again, but recovery was much faster, and it was definitely worth receiving that first dose of the vaccine and getting started with the process of doing my part to reduce community spread.

                                                Patient experienced syncope after Moderna Covid-19 immunization. She never lost consciousness but was lowered from her chair to lie down on the floor by administering pharmacist and technician. Store management brought her cushioned chair to be seated more comfortably. Eventually was able to walk and was driven home by roommate.

Friday I was so drained from not being able to keep anything down I had to be sent home from work. My brain wasn?t functioning because I was so nutrient deprived.    By Saturday night I was able to eat again and was feeling basically completely better.

                                                I got my period out of the blue the following morning. It was the worst period / PMS of my life. I was having full blown contractions, waves of pain and heat so much that I was throwing up. I also had diarrhea and very heavy bleeding. Once I was able to keep ibuprofen down I was absolutely fine and the symptoms dissipated. In total this pain, vomiting and diarrhea, unable to think or drink water or communicate lasted about 2 hours.

                                                I was Vaccinated on Friday March 26, on Sunday night March 28 I had a sudden episode of uncontrollable shortness of breath while sitting having and not strenuous activity. Immediately went to emergency room. First blood pressure on examination was 180/100, also experienced tachycardia with heart rate fluctuating between 100-120s while sitting on stretcher SPO2 remained normal at all times between 98-100%. All exams performed (Labs, Ekg, CTA, UA) showed normal results per MD. Symptoms began to subside on their own and was give small dose of Ativan to continue to help symptoms subside and was discharged with a diagnosis of &#34;anxiety&#34;. Today is March 31st nearing April 1st and I have had intermittent shortness of breath at times just sitting down and other times when performing light activity tachycardia and shortness of breath. I do not agree with the diagnosis of &#34;anxiety&#34; as today I had an episode of shortness of breath and tachycardia after conversation and laughing with my spouse without anything on my mind completely distracted the symptoms began. I am a healthy 25 year old woman with no serious past medical history the only change that occurred before my sudden symptoms was receiving the vaccine just 2 days prior and I truly believe this was the cause.

                                                I have had very very mild tinnitus for a few years now, where it is only noticeable in dead silence. I sleep with a sound machine and that fixes the problem completely. But after getting the vaccine, I have ringing in my left ear that is 10x louder than it ever has been before. My ears feel clogged. It is taking over my life. I can&#39;t focus. I can&#39;t sleep.

Temp almost hit 102 F, but came back down with Acetaminophen. Also had pain, some nausea, and gagged like emesis was imminent. Did fall asleep again. Temp was in range of 98-99 for most of the period 24-36 hours after injection, with and without fever reducing medication, but rose up to 100 around hour 33. Father reports similar development of symptoms from his vaccination experience, lasting 48 hours total. Is there a genetic link?

                                                Fatigue onset 4 to 6 hours after receiving the shot (vaccine received Monday 1:30pm). Low fever, dizziness, and chills set in around 24 hours later (Sunday midday), including a change in color and consistency of nasal mucous (thicker, green). At about 40 hours post-vaccine (Monday morning) most of the symptoms had dissipated aside from the fatigue and an atypical level of brain fog, which has gradually improved over the course of the week and is still present.  No treatment taken. Normal amount of sleep &amp; caffeine intake, normal daily dosage of Vyvanse 60mg since Monday.

I then got in the shower and ate a yogurt. I still felt super dizzy so I laid back down. I finally was able to nap. I napped from about 2p-7p. I woke up feeling better, but still not 100%. My head felt so heavy.

The headache felt like a migraine, but went away with the Tylenol.

Motion made the nausea worse.; 30 hours later (Day 2, afternoon): took pepto bismol for the nausea. This helped reduce the nausea, but I was still queasy; 32 hours later (Day 2, evening): headache came back. Took 2 extra strength Tylenol to treat. Still very fatigued. I did not feel like I could get out of bed.; 44 hours later(Day3, morning): woke up with a headache, fatigue, and nausea. At this point, I could keep down water, pedialyte, and saltine crackers. Took 2 extra strength Tylenol to treat the headache. Still could not think straight; (Day3, mid-day): Tired, nausea going away (Day4): Neck pain, could not think straight, tired, appetite coming back (Day5): Tired but mostly back to normal The arm pain was bad days 1-2 but got better on day 3.

The nausea and fatigue were inhibiting to daily activities.

I gave her shot and she had a little blood in her band-aid so I went back into the pharmacy to get a different band-aid and cotton ball. I was only in there for 10-20 seconds but when I looked out the door the patient was sliding out of her chair onto the ground. It was only a minute or 2 after she received the vaccine. She came to pretty much right away and was a little shaken up and complained her neck hurt a little. One of the managers that came for the code white sat with her for 30 minutes until she felt ready to get up (patient was an associate that was on the clock).

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Anxiety on 01-Jan-2010. Concomitant products included FLUOXETINE for Anxiety, PRENATAL VITAMINS [ASCORBIC ACID;BETACAROTENE;CALCIUM SULFATE;COLECALCIFEROL;CYANOCOBALAMIN;FERROUS FUMARATE;FOLIC ACID;NICOTINAMIDE;PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE;RETINOL ACETATE;RIBOFLAVIN;THIAMINE MONONITRATE;TOCOPHERYL ACETATE;ZINC OXIDE] for Pregnancy, MISOPROSTOL (CYTOTEC) for an unknown indication.   On 12-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was on an unknown date and the estimated date of delivery was 15-Nov-2021. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant). 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MALAISE (General sick and tired feeling), FEELING ABNORMAL (Did not want to get out of bed), FATIGUE (Pretty tired) and HEADACHE (Headache). On 22-Mar-2021, the patient experienced VAGINAL HAEMORRHAGE (Menstrual bleeding). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FOETAL GROWTH ABNORMALITY (Baby had not grown). On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarried) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FOETAL HEART RATE ABNORMAL (No fetal heartbeat.) and HEREDITARY DISORDER (Genetic issue). On 12-Mar-2021, EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant) had resolved. On 09-Apr-2021, ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarried), FOETAL GROWTH ABNORMALITY (Baby had not grown) and FOETAL HEART RATE ABNORMAL (No fetal heartbeat.) had resolved. At the time of the report, VAGINAL HAEMORRHAGE (Menstrual bleeding), MALAISE (General sick and tired feeling), FEELING ABNORMAL (Did not want to get out of bed), HEREDITARY DISORDER (Genetic issue), FATIGUE (Pretty tired) and HEADACHE (Headache) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, Ultrasound foetal abnormal: abnormal (abnormal) Had some bleeding and found out it was subchorionic hemorrhage. Bleeding is in another part of the uterus where is baby is not. On 01-Apr-2021, Ultrasound scan: abnormal (abnormal) Saw baby heartbeat but was informed baby had not grown.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment information provided mentioned ultrasound and cytotec.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable as patient took both doses of the vaccine. Patient reported that she does not blame Moderna, as her OB feels the miscarriage was related to a &#34;genetic issue.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-060699 (Patient Link).   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 13-Apr-2021: Patient updated AE and mentions fetal complications resulting in miscarriage. Events and outcome of case thus updated with new information.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the temporal association between the product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Arm pain, arm swelling, bruising at the site of the injection, loss of grip strength in injection arm, all within 10 minutes of vaccination. Within a few hours, tiredness set in, additional loss of grip strength in both hands, but especially in the arm that received the vaccination. 9 hours after the shot, severe fatigue set in, as well as hot and cold flashes, switching between fever and chills, headache, excessive sweating, weakness, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, body aches, skin pain, and flare-ups of old injuries. I woke with tremendous, debilitating neck pain as well, which was the site of previous whiplash injuries, in both my neck and lower back, and my knees hurt as well. Woke every hour or so throughout the night, severe symptoms. By the next morning after the shot, the fever and chills had stopped, as well as the nausea and vomiting. Fatigue remained, headache on and off, and body aches. By day 3 most symptoms had gone away except for tiredness. By day 4 I started to notice sun sensitivity, and on day 6 have developed what seems to be a heat rash? My forearms are hot, red, sensitive, and reactive as well. Every day since the shot I have gotten tired in the afternoon as well, even if earlier in the day I felt OK. Have had mild shortness of breath in addition, but nothing that has stopped me from regular activity. As a 25 year old, I experienced incredibly severe symptoms, and this was my first shot of Moderna. No known previous exposure to Covid, either. Noticed that symptoms started worsening rapidly around 6 p.m. the day of my shot after taking my borth control pill as well. Wondering if related, or possibly coincidence.

                                                I received the vaccine on February 3, on February 4 at 0100 I woke up with chills. The rest of the day I would have chills and sweats. I was nauseous and threw up twice. I had a low grade fever of around 99 degrees but at one point it did go up to 101.3. My entire body hurt including my head and Tylenol and ibuprofen did not help. On February 5 I was feeling a little better, I still had body aches but could eat a little.   On February 6 at around 0500 I woke up with chest pain. I waited a little while to see if it would go away but it had gotten more intense. I am a cardiac ICU nurse so I knew what chest pain could mean. I got out of bed and at that time my chest pain was a 10/10 and I was having shortness of breath. I woke my fiancé up and told him I needed to go to the ER.  At the ER they ran test and admitted me to the hospital. They later diagnosed with myopericarditis with a small pericardial effusion.

                                                Confusion/inability to complete tasks: within 20 minutes of getting my vaccine, I was unsafe to drive (drove on the wrong side of the road). Within 2 hours, I could no longer focus enough to work (I&#39;m an engineer). It&#39;s been 6 days since my shot and I&#39;m still confused, forgetful, unable to focus, and unsafe to drive. I forget steps during work tasks, and forget what I&#39;m doing while I&#39;m doing it. It&#39;s like a short term/prospective memory issue. Lack of coordination: 5 days after shot, could not navigate stairs without assistance. Could not remember ADL (did I get mail, did I eat, did I shower, day of week...) Fatigue: Slept/ rested all day for 2 days after the shot. It&#39;s now 6 days after the shot and I&#39;m still unusually tired, needing 2-6 extra hours of rest a day. It&#39;s tiring to walk short distances, to focus/converse, to work. Sore arm: my arm was very sore for 2 days after the shot (painful at rest, worse if touched, like a bruise). By 4 days after the shot, it was not sore even if pressed/hugged. I do not have any headache.

                                                After the 2nd dose on Day 2 I had a fever for about 3 hours before I took more medication. I took acetaminophen round the clock but still felt uncomfortably hot all day.  I had severe fatigue most of the day and slept or laid in bed. My body ached especially at the injection site and at times it felt like my hand was in pain on that arm. I had brain fog as well.   Today is Day 3 and I have so much pain at injection site it was sometimes hard to sleep. It feels almost intramuscular and my pain from the first dose went away after Day 2 and the site mostly just felt sore.  I have also experience nausea and drainage in my nose. I?m tired today but less so than Day 2. I am still a little foggy in my brain and my neck hurts quite a bit.

I was also extremely tired and that lasted for three or four days. I had the brain fog for about two weeks. Waited a bit longer for second vaccine (three months) because I had such bad reactions that I didn&#39;t want to get again. No treatment.

The brain fog also started the next morning after the vaccine again. It hasn&#39;t resolved yet. I have been out of work since May 10th. That is when I started with it being a significant problem. I lost my job due to it sort of.  I started going to Psychiatrist - and have had lab work - my primary care - Anxiety. My Psychiatrist - COVID vaccine and some of my anxiety as well. I started anew job now but it&#39;s been hard. I&#39;m pushing through . We have done around 11 medication changes with my psychiatrist to see if anything will help and nothing has helped the brain fog symptoms to improve. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve had any cognitive side affects. It is almost a disassociation that my mind and body isn&#39;t working together. It&#39;s almost like I have put on the wrong prescription glasses on. I can function. But I still feel impairment from it and it invokes a lot of anxiety because it&#39;s not a normal feeling. I am currently on treatment and  have changed all the meds. 75 mg of Wellbutrin ER. in the AM and I&#39;m doing 0.25 of Xanax ER in the morning. My vitamins are the same. Before bed 0.5 mg of Xanax extended release. As needed 0.5 immediate release of Xanax during the day. Have been seeing a chiropractor as well for treatment.
