Unable to lift arm above shoulder without significant pain at about 12 hours post injection. About 13-14 hours post vaccine, began having myalgias, chills. Took ibuprofen with some improvement of symptoms, but unable to sleep due to the combination of arm pain, chills and aches. Body aches and chills were gone by the morning but the arm pain lingered, less than the night before and improving each day, still there today, but much more tolerable.

                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

I was talking to people that were not there. I felt completely out of control. The only thing that helped was forcing myself to focus on the TV, which was extremely difficult. Symptoms started to die down around 3 AM, but did not go away. I slept for 4 hours.  1/20 8 AM- felt like and still feel like I am not in reality, I feel disassociated with my body (like its not mine), slightly out of control of my thoughts, I see subtle black and white flashing like last night but not as intense, paranoia like last night/not as intense, cant concentrate.

                                                I had slight dizziness for 20 minutes a half hour after the injection. But that&#39;s not the issue. When the lady gave me the injection, it felt like she wiggled it around in my arm. The injection itself was surprisingly painful. My arm hurt at first like I was punched in the arm on the first day (much like a flu vaccine). But then it got SIGNIFICANTLY worse the next day. I was in excruciating pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine. I had limited arm mobility and any movement caused agony. I couldn&#39;t sleep from the pain. I wasn&#39;t able to do my normal activities. The pain started to subside after 4 days, but had since started to get worse again. I&#39;m in a constant state of pain. It&#39;s now impacting my mental health. I can move my arm, but not without a lot of pain.

                                                I am not sure if the event that happened Sunday was directly related to the vaccine at all since it happened two days later, or if it was just a coincidence, or if the vaccine was just a physical stimulus trigger. I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

                                                I first started feeling very cold around 5:00 PM that day. Once I went home I went to sleep around 10:30 and work up at 2:30 AM with vomiting and 8/10 epigastric pain that radiated to my back. I went to the hospital. They gave me morphine and Zofran but within 5 minutes of the first dose of morphine, my pain returned even more intense and I still vomited 20 minutes after the Zofran. So they pushed another Morphine and Zofran. Zofran helped at this point but the Morphine did not. At this point they gave my three different oral liquids to help calm down my epigastric region, including mylanta, lidocaine and a third medication. I went home and slept the rest of the day but Wednesday night I got diarrhea and spike a fever of 102.7 around 8PM. Now it&#39;s thursday morning and I still have a 2/10 epigastric pain, physically exhausted and had a fever this morning as well.

At this time I took Tylenol. With the fever came a head ache. My injection sight is very painful. I did not sleep very well. When I woke up at 7:00AM my fever was 100 degrees. It has stayed at 100 degrees until this point (1:30 PM). My headache became painful enough that I took 2 excedrin that have relieved most of the headache. My symptoms are improving as the day progresses. My injection site is still very painful. With the normal flu vaccine I get yearly I have never had any problems.

                                                12/29/2020- Received the Moderna Vaccine - no pain or problems until 01/04/2021 01/04/2021- Before bedtime my injection site from the Moderna Vaccine became itchy.  01/05/2020- Woke up to a swollen arm (about 3 times the size of my right arm) and the start of a rash (the size of a softball) Was in significant pain and unable to lift my arm. I called the nurse hotline where I received the vaccine. I was told to go to the ER immediately. The ER doctor informed me that they had been seeing this and that their personal vaccine location swelled up as well but went away a few days later. ER doctor gave me Benadryl cream (I can not ingest Benadryl due to an opposite reaction, I become extremely anxious.) The ER doctor informed me that the Benadryl cream wouldn&#39;t cause the same reaction. I was sent home with the cream and a wrap. Upon arriving home my rash grew exponentially over the following days. The site became hot (even after icing it) It remained itchy and painful.  01/11/2021- Went to primary care doctor. The rash and swelling had decreased although you could still see the ring of the rash. At this point, my hand was becoming numb after doing daily activities including typing. My palm and thumb area started to turn purplish/blueish when I would type for less than 20 seconds. The doctor told me they would start to reach out to other providers and figure out how to best move forward. In the meantime, there wasn&#39;t much to do besides wait and see what happens.  01/13/2021- Woke up throughout the night due to continued pain at the injection site. Called the primary care doctor who wasn&#39;t in the office, waited for a call back from their nurse but due delayed call back and  increased pain and numbness went to urgent care (which is under the same practice as primary care). The urgent care doctor performed tests regarding pinched nerve shoulder (as they believed I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder) and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed tissue damage but nothing else. I was not experiencing shoulder pain, although during one of the shoulder tests I found more discomfort in my left should (injection arm) than my right arm. Therefore, the primary care doctor thought I was experiencing a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  01/14/2021 - Primary care doctor called and informed me they had spoken with the infectious disease doctor in the area who informed them that they have been seeing a similar reaction amongst other people. (7 days after inject, swelling and rash) The infectious disease doctor reported they hadn&#39;t seen numbness. The primary care doctor advised me to wait 2 weeks to see how symptoms change before performing additional tests. The primary care doctor also advised me after speaking with the infectious disease doctor to not take the second shot.  01/16/2021- still experiencing issues with daily functioning. Still experiencing numbness in hand and arm. Still experiencing redness around the injection site (although much better still flairs up at moments)   Side note: 01/03/2021 - Went cross country skiing, did fall backwards but did NOT fall on arm.  Also confusion remains if  I was supposed to report this or if the primary care doctor/ER doctor reported this, therefore, urgent care doctor told me to report this reaction.

Had a very restless sleep and woke up with severe sweating around 3 AM. Woke up at 9:30 AM with severe, pounding headache. Attempted to walk around at 10 AM, pounding headache was a 10/10 pain scale when upright. Nausea set in as soon as I was standing, ran to lay down to avoid vomiting. At 10:30 AM I sat up attempted to drink water and the vomiting began. Severe vomiting for about 30 minutes, then intermittent vomiting throughout the day until 6 PM. Headache did not let up all day, no response to medication (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, rizatriptan, magnesium). Headache subsided around 8 PM and  I was able to sleep. No symptoms today 1/22/21.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

The soreness around the injection started and never went away. Then I could not go to sleep that night, the soreness feeling got more intense. I won?t at 5 trying to get ready but the more I moved my arm the soreness got worse and it started to burn.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

                                                Very painful in the area where I got the shot. I usually have a little pain at the site of the injection but this was WAY worse which resulted in me icing the area and taking Ibuprofen. I also could not apply any pressure on the site so I had to make sure I only slept on my right side overnight. The intensity of the pain was MUCH better the next day, and today (2 days later) it is very bearable.  I also experienced lethargy the first evening after receiving the vaccine, but that went away the next day.  On the second evening since receiving the vaccine, I started to experience body chills and some minor body aches. I felt a sense of general malaise that I often experience when sick.

Arm was sore but nothing compared to joints (especially hips). Temperature was only slight at 98.7. Headache and body aches, joint pain were severe enough that I was forced to rest and unable to continue daily activities. Ache symptoms quickly dissipated after 48 hours, but a 2 inch diameter welt appeared, slightly raised and itching mildly like a mosquito bite. Welt is still present now, 5 days post-injection.

Warm to the touch and slightly itchy like sunburn.  6 PM - Area  is doubled in size (about the size /shape of a thumb), much redder, and in a well-defined elongated oval shape.  Hot to the touch, firm and painful swelling that made sleeping difficult. Took Aleve and iced it. 1/6/20 7 AM -  Red area has spread out into a less defined circle about 2in in diameter.  Less swollen and painful but still hot to the touch. 6 PM - Area has spread into tear-drop shape about the size of my palm. Drew a line around the area. Still causes some difficulty sleeping. 1/7/20 - Area is less red and not as painful but I can still feel the original area swollen under the skin and hot to the touch. Spread slowed significantly and mostly stayed in the lines.

                                                This is my second pregnancy and at the time of my vaccination, I was 32 weeks 6 days gestation with an estimated delivery date of 2/15/21.  I tolerated the vaccine well initially with only a very minor sore arm the day after the vaccine. On 12/31/2020 (4 days after vaccination), I felt muscle fatigue around my hips and buttocks as well as significant fatigue. It seemed to improve over the course of the day and was not very noticeable for the next few days. On 1/4/21 (8 days after vaccination), my muscle fatigue in my hips, buttocks, thighs, and hamstrings bilaterally became very significant, preventing me from doing some activities that I had planned. I also had generalized fatigue. On 1/5/21, I had similar symptoms, but the muscle fatigue also began to include my shoulders bilaterally. 1/6/21, the muscle fatigue also included my neck and I was physically exhausted. 1/7/21 I started to note some improvement, and I also saw my OB who did bloodwork but also did suspect a possibly delayed reaction to my vaccine. Today (1/9/21) I am still experiencing muscle fatigue, but it does seem to be improved from several days ago.

By midmorning my left upper arm was very tender and extremely painful to the touch, even my shirt touching my skin hurt. By mid afternoon I was very fatigued and had to leave work and took a three hour nap. By the end of the evening the pain was resolved.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine on 01/06/2021. Normal pain at the injection site occured with little concern. Pain in armpit began 01/08/2021. I did not think anything of it, believing the pain to be from an ingrown hair caused by shaving or just something with the vaccine. I ignored it to spend time with family. On 01/12/2021 I noticed the pain had not subsided and deepened into the armpit causing pain to radiate from the area when lifting or moving heavy items.  I palpated the area and felt a pea sized lump. It moved freely. I could not locate it again. I continued to palpate into the top of my shoulder and discovered a large lump in the clavicle area. It is painful to apply pressure. I knew these areas to be part of the lymphatic system. I also did research on side effects of the Moderna vaccine but observed most people to have lymph node symptoms for only 24-48 hours within three days of receiving the vaccine then they subside.  I made an appointment that same day, 01/12/2021, with Dr. at clinic to be examined. At first, Dr was dismissive of my symptoms. Dr did physically examine my areas of complaint and scheduled an ultrasound for 01/15/2021 at  Hospital. On 01/13/2021 I noticed the injection site began to ache again. On 01/14/2021 I awoke from a nap at 6pm. I began showering for work when I felt a burning, itchy sensation on my inner left bicep. I observed two red spots on my inner left bicep close to my armpit with a red rash below the two red spots. I palpated the red spots to find a large and slightly smaller lump under the skin corresponding with the red spots. The rash itches. As of 01/15/2021, the ultrasound had to be rescheduled by the hospital as their ultrasound technician cannot make it into work because of a blizzard. I now have two lumps in the clavicle area that alternate swelling and reducing in size. I&#39;ve been taking tylenol every four hours when I&#39;m awake to control the pain. The ones in my clavicle now cause tension in the left side of my neck. I&#39;ve also applied warm compresses on the affected sites. It helps lessen the swelling for a bit but does come back.

No rotation. It started a few hours after receiving the vaccine. By 5pm it was at it&#39;s sorest and locked in position . Not warm to touch. Just painful.  This lasted a total of 3 days until all soreness and full normal movements without discomfort could resume.

She started to feel better and left. Started to feel bad in the car on the way back to work. Her boss is a dentist and advised her to take Benadryl, which she did.  Traveling to Hospital now.  She has not yet been seen by a physician. Current symptoms are throat constriction, hard time swallowing, and having a hard time concentrating.  She is pale and feels unwell.   Wed Jan 13, 2021 16:09  Followed up with patient.  Patient is currently in the Emergency Room at Hospital. She has so far received steroids and benadryl.   Thurs Jan 14, 2021 08:56 Followed up with the patient again.  She returned home from the first ER visit at 17:30 last night.  About 4 hours after that her heart rate became elevated again (130-140 bpm while lying down) and she was confused, lethargic, and had a HA and backache. She went back to ER last night around 21:30. They gave her more benadryl in IV and toradol for the HA. She is now on PO benadryl every 4 hours for 4 days. Symptoms today include: runny nose, feels like a mild case of flu, HA and backache.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

This continued 3 more times in the am, at times having incontinence. (This has never occurred before.) By 10 am, those symptoms had stopped. Only residual side effects were a headache and sore arm.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/19/2021 at my place of employment. Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

Dizziness and severe nausea started and blood pressure decreased. Trouble concentrating and tingling in hands and feet. I was taken to the Emergency Room and hooked up to an IV and Heart Monitoring. I was given IV Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, and Zofran. I was going to get an injection of Epinephrine but my heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly after the first batch of IV meds and they were concerned that the Epinephrine may have made things worse. I was monitored for 4 hours and then discharged with instructions to take Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for 5 days, Prednisone 60mg every day for 5 days, Pepcid 40mg twice a day for 5 days and given a prescription for an Epi-Pen. I remained very nauseous and dizzy foe the next 48 hours. My injection site became swollen, red, and tender 48 hours after my injection and then re-flared up 11 days after my injection on 01/17/21.

                                                Exercised following injection. Noticed mildly sore arm within several hours. Much worse that night to the point that I was unable to lift things. Next day it was on/off pain, with very intense pain when it came on to the point that I was unable to lift or do things. On Sunday (next day), pain seemed to radiate from the shoulder up through my left neck to the cranium area. Monday (today) this evening - pain so intense that I was screaming and sobbing. Husband (also MD) had to medicate me as I was laying on bed screaming unable to move or roll over. He had to manually lift me. Significant pain in left neck (trapezius) area on inhales, near injection site. Pain has been getting worse each night.

                                                Initially after the vaccine I felt fine, after some time I began to feel very tired, drowsy and had a headache. As time past I started to get cold and began to get the chills. At this time I started taking my temperature which was running about 99-100F.  The chills became worse and I felt colder and sicker. My temperature climbed to 102.1 at which time I took some tylenol. My fever continued to climb to 103.1 within the next hour. The chills and fever lasted about 6-8 hours and then went away and I became very hot. I went to sleep that night after taking more tylenol just in case. The next morning I had severe fatigue, mild nausea  and a headache that stayed with me the rest of the day. I ended up going home from work due to the nausea and migraine type headache as well as intermittent chills that would come and go. By the next day 1/22 I was feeling much better over all. However a mildly painful red spot that was warm to touch appeared on my arm where the injection site was that stayed for the next 48 hours before disappearing.

                                                After the vaccine I got chills beginning at 10pm.  About 1am I got a fever but was already taking started tylenol and motrin because I developed a headache also.  The fever went as high as 101.2.  On Tuesday I woke at 2am soaked in sweat and the fever had broke.  Later that day the fever returned at 100.5 but broke on its on.  By Saturday I woke up again with SOB and super cold.  Fever had returned at 101 so I went to Urgent Care  because the fever just kept returning.  A chest xray was done and it showed my lungs were really inflammed.  The fever returned later but went away.  The SOB is still here.  And on  1/19 I got the same feeling with SOB, 101.1 fever and felt awful all over again. So I visited with my PCP and another chest Xray and blood work was done again.  The chest xray showed normal but was started on a Flovent enhaler to help with the breathing and SOB.

I fell asleep and woke up about 11:30pm with a 103.4 fever so I stayed awake a little and took ibuprofen and tylenol throughout the night.  When I woke the next morning the fever was 101 but went down to like 99 later that evening.  The fever finally broke about 11am the next day but returned later  that day for a little while.   I was so tired  I slept like a solid day and woke up yesterday feeling sluggish and developed another 100.3 fever last night, took motrin and I feel better today.

It hurt really bad - couldn&#39;t left it or move it. I took Tylenol once or twice that day with six hours in between. I was a little bit drowsy and headache and a little bit nauseous.  So I slept that day. I felt like my arm got hit by truck. 10th - I felt better that day. By Monday, the 11th, I was totally fine. Pregnancy: I&#39;m due May 29, 2021; I have had a miscarriage before so it&#39;s my second pregnancy. So far everything has been normal.

                                                the morning following the second dose of the vaccine I awoke with a terrible headache, felt nauseated all day (didn&#39;t vomit), and felt exhausted. I had to take the day off work and slept most of the day.  I also had terrible muscular pain at the sight of the injection (L deltoid).  Tylenol helped with the arm pain. I had absolutely no side effects with the first dose.

I continued with a persistent headache throughout the week. A presure in my head, worse with standing up, and it made me dizzy when I stood up. On the night of 2/18/21 I developed left sided ear pain. On 2/19/21 I developed a left sided otitis media. On 2/21/21 I developed sudden onset left sided facial droop. I had a negative head CT, and was diagnosed with bells palsy related to the swelling in my ear from the otitis media.   I continue to have significant ear pain, and left sided facial paralysis today.

Had I been in the office I would have had to go home ill, and I could not do much but try to rest during this time.

                                                I had hives despite having taken my daily dose of Claritin that seemed to get worse as the day continued. I reached out to my Healthcare clinic and they were unsure if there was a simple treatment and almost required me to go the emergency room for this. I conducted a telehealth consultation with a doc who was not my primary care physician and was unfamiliar with my preexisting exercise urticaria condition that occasionally results in light hives but never anaphylaxis for me without Claritin. I declined going to the emergency room since this did not seem that serious and instead took another Claritin to try to get the somewhat worsening hives with no apparent cause to stop without an unnecessarily escalated situation. My throat was slightly itchy but I never became anaphylactic likely due to taking an additional Claritin and not doing anything requiring physical effort for the day beyond telecons from home because I left the office to telework mid morning after I started getting continually slightly worse hives. By evening I was ok and the next day just had a slightly sore throat but was able to work and just started the day with 2 Claritin without any further instance of hives appearing. The day after that I returned to my standard 1 Claritin dose with no ill effects. From this event, it seems clear that a 72 hour downing period from dose 1 is insufficient and should be upped to 96 hours. Prior to this more severe event, I had, on days 2 and 3, a sore left arm at injection site that prevented me from even reasonably lifting my arm to a height sufficient to grab my cell phone off it&#39;s charger while lying in bed without serious discomfort. That level of arm discomfort prevented me from working out or would have prevented me from anything other than light office work involving my vaccine arm. My level of tiredness for the couple days following this dose also required that I take an hour long nap days 1 and 2, and no nap at all is usually the norm for me.

When I first noticed it, I had a numbness by my right ear which subsided but three weeks later, I still have a ringing in my ear which I have never had issues with my ears and I am nervous to get the second dose. There are multiple reports of this very thing on website and it is concerning.

The area around the injection site was swollen, red, and painful to touch. I fell over on my way to the toilet due to extreme dizziness. I had three hours of diarrhea, and then took pepto bismal and bennydryl. Those remedies worked and my symptoms subsided and I was able to fall back asleep by 4am. In the morning I felt normal, besides some remaining pain and redness surrounding the injection site.

                                                Presumed right arm muscle injury.  Several hours after the injection my arm was extremely sore and painful. The joint was painful as well. No redness or swelling. It was tender to touch. I was having difficulty reaching my arm up or moving it upward. Ex: it hurt to lift my hand to touch my face.  I also couldn?t let it fall. If I got my arm above my head I would have to assist it down. I couldn?t sleep that night because of the pain. I was having trouble with pushing movements in that arm. And also letting it hang dependently (like letting my arm hang when I hinged forward). I started taking Motrin 24 hours after the injection. Motrin helped, so I took it Friday and Saturday. Sunday, my arm felt 99% back to normal.  Monday and Tuesday I didn?t notice anything.   Wednesday  morning I woke up with the same pain again and difficulty moving my arm. Wednesday night, I couldn?t sleep again because of the pain/couldn?t get my arm in a comfortable position. I?m taking Motrin, with not as much relief as before. I?ve applied heat and I?ve tried to stretch it as well.   The only way i really know how to describe it? is that it feels as if my deltoid was injured. And my other muscles are fine. It?s hindering my movement in that arm. It is again, tender to touch my deltoid area. The tightness has extended in to my shoulder and neck. It has now been 8 days since my vaccination.

I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

                                                10:47a went into a room to wait for 15 minutes directly after the injection. Began to feel somewhat dizzy right afterwards. Continued back to my office. Informed my supervisor that I was feeling dizzy but informed him that I had a couple bites of oatmeal, and a few cups of coffee and was going to try and eat something and hydrate and I?m sure I would feel better. I went back to work for about an hour (I work at a desk). For about an hour I continued to feel dizzy and noticed I was cloudy and was staring off. After an hour I really became dizzy and walked to my supervisors office and informed him. It felt as though I was walking on the moon to get to his office. I also felt like I had a uti. I sat down in his office and informed him of what happened. As I was talking to him I began to pass out. I did not go out the whole way but he began speaking to me more. After feeling a little better I walked back over to my office. I felt waves of dizziness and being hot and cold. My husband came and picked me up around 1:30p from work. I felt better after getting in the car and going home. Once I was home I ate and had began to feel better. Around 6:00p I began to go through another wave and was experiencing body aches, hot and cold sweats, loss of appetite, tingling all over my body but mostly in my legs and feet. At that point I went in and laid down in bed for the rest of the night. Probably around 9:00p I began to feel better. I attempted to fall asleep around 11:00p but when I closed my eyes I felt like they were racing back and forth. So I got back up and watched something in tv until I fell asleep maybe about 30 minutes later. I woke up the next morning around 8:45a. I tossed and turned most of the night, however I felt better. It was like I had the flu for a few days and on the last day I felt better but was under the weather. At this point in the morning I was fatigued. I was able to perform some tasks around the house.  I then laid back down in bed for a few hours because I was beginning to feel dizzy and was experiencing hot and cold sweats. After a few hours I got up from bed and performed a few more tasks around the house. Then was able to sit down on the couch and watch some tv. At this point I?m still expediting tingling in my body at times. Still a little dizzy but able to focus and hot and cold sweats.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

On the 10th day, I noticed it was getting worse and some of the spots were an itchy/burning feeling (it woke me up at night). On the 11th day, I went to the doctor and was prescribed oral prednisone (60 mg x 3 days, 40 mg x 3 days. 20 mg x 3 days, 10 mg x 4 days), hydroxyzine PRN for itching, and triamcinolone ointment. The rash started improving after 2 days on prednisone and I only used the ointment and hydroxyzine for 2 days.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 10:45a, I then went next door to be monitored for 15 minutes. Within a few minutes, I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I waited out the 15 minutes and went back to my office. When I got into my office I still felt lightheaded and I informed my supervisor. I explained to him that I was going to try and eat something and drink some water and I would feel better. I went into my office and continued to work for the next hour. After that hour, I began to feel very dizzy and &#34;out of it&#34; as I almost didn&#39;t know where I was at. I went to speak to my supervisor and I sat down in his office where I almost fainted. He took me back to my office where I sat with another co-worker. Duri time, I continued to feel light headed, although it came in waves. My husband drove me home, I showered, ate something and was feeling better. Around 6:00p, I began to feel lightheaded again and began to experience body aches, hot and cold flashes that would come in waves. Saturday morning, I woke up feeling better, but around 10:00a I began to experience the same symptoms. I laid down for a few hours that would get up and attempt tasks around the house, then I would  ended up back in bed at 6:00p with the same symptoms again. I did meet virtually with a doctor and she explained to me to wait it out. On Monday, I met with my pcp and she informed me of the same, that these symptoms would eventually go away. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the only symptom that remained was the dizziness. At times, I still will feel dizzy for instance Saturday morning I woke up and felt pretty dizzy throughout the day.

Pain, swelling, redness, and toughness began to dissipate around Day 5 and was markedly improved by Day 8 when I completely returned to normal activities.  Additionally, the first day after the vaccination, I experienced muscle aches/pains and severe generalized fatigue that almost made me call out from work. This fatigue and muscle pain was very strong for ~72 hours after the vaccination. However, I was still able to go to work, though my productivity was not the same given the amount of fatigue I experienced and the inability to utilize my right arm to the same degree I would during a normal work day.

Days 2-6 I had extreme fatigue, headache all day, sore arm, body and joint aches and pains all over,  overall feeling exhausted. I was unable to work or perform tasks around the house for almost a week. Took Tylenol for headache. Symptoms lasted longer than 72 hours after vaccination. I was informed on day 4 that I had a patient who came back positive for COVID-19, I was at a low risk of exposure while taking care of her of but had been exposed within 48 hours of her positive test. Call placed to employee exposure line, I was tested via nasal swab for COVID-19 d/t symptoms lasting longer than 72 hours after receiving the vaccine. Symptoms finally resolved on 1/9/2021.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

                                                Face swelling and redness with lip tingling and tongue tingling later after eating a few bites of a home prepared meal that has been eaten several times before. Started eating around 7 pm, have picture of red and swelling face at 7:11 pm. Contents of meal were shrimp, homemade egg noodles, chicken stock, pork, and romaine.  No breathing problems and felt fine besides face warm ness and some anxiety over possibly developing a new allergy, as these symptoms were similar to my adult onset allergies to oysters in 2011. Sought remote care at 7:41, spoke to RN over phone who recommended a video visit, then after video visit was recommended to go to urgent care. Arrived at Urgent Care around 8:50 PM.   Had a steroid shot of solumedrol 125 mg to IM the left arm around 9 pm, then took some Benadryl and famotidine at urgent care. Picked up prescriptions for famotidine 7 days, prednisone 4 days, and Benadryl as needed.  Taking medications now with careful watching of potentially allergic reaction provoking foods such as shrimp, fish, nuts, and wheat.

                                                Pounding headache - increased in intensity over several hours.  Fever and chills - started about 9 hours post vaccine. It was manageable. Nausea and vomiting - nausea was on and off starting about 10 hours post vaccine. My body attempted to throw up twice but there was nothing in my body to bring up. The nausea and vomiting could have been from the intensity of the headache but I am unsure.  About 10.5 hours post vaccine I took 1000 mg Tylenol and then an hour after taking Tylenol, I tool 220 mg naproxen sodium. I was unable to fall asleep because the headache was so bad.   I woke up about 5 hours later and knew my fever had broken and the headache was mild. The headache continued on and off (most noticeable in the morning and at night) for about a week post vaccine.

By 11pm I had a horrible headache and my body was aching. At midnight I still was feeling horrible and my chest was hurting and I was having difficulty breathing. Checked my heart rate with a pulse ox and it was in the 150?s. I realized had not taken my clonidine pill yet for the evening so I  took it and waited about an hour to hour an a half and my heart rate was still not coming down below 125. I ended up going to the emergency room and getting there by 3am. They immediately started running tests. My heart rate was in the 138 and my blood pressure was 148/100

                                                At the time of administration of the first does of Moderna vaccine, I was 6 weeks pregnant.  I had confirmed pregnancy with home positive test and missed period. I had an estimated due date of 9/24/2021.  This was my 4th pregnancy. I have had two uncomplicated pregnancies to term. In September 2020 experienced a chemical pregnancy with early pregnancy loss at 5 weeks.  The first 24 hours after 1st dose of vaccine I experienced extreme arm soreness in the arm that was vaccinated,  causing  headache and unable to sleep. After 24 hours I felt &#34;normal&#34;. 2 weeks and 3 days following the first dose of Moderna, I  had a miscarriage. On the night of 2/15/21 I lost the pregnancy with vaginal bleeding, bright red  blood, passing tissue, clots/ sac. I had an uneventful pregnancy up to that point, feeling well as I had with prior pregnancies.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

                                                Around 2 AM, roughly 14 hours after receiving Covid Modena vaccine (1st dose) I woke up in a violent shaking situation.  I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

                                                On 1/15 around 6pm, I began to feel extremely fatigued (about 27 hours after my initial injection).  I began to feel severe flu-like symptoms (hot/cold chills, sensitive skin, headache, dry/scratchy throat, fever dreams) which persisted for several hours during the night. The next day (1/16), the fatigue, headache, and chills persisted (although the chills decreased). I took Dayquil before noon and that seemed to help with the symptoms, and Nyquil at night so I was able to sleep. By the following morning, I still had a mild headache and fatigue but continued to improve. I felt normal again on 1/18.   I also had stiffness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site for 3-4 days.

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

                                                I woke up lightheaded. I had dizzy spells throughout the entire day, starting at 6AM. I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

The headache and sore arm worsened and then around 9pm I started with horrible chills and body aches. My symptoms continued onto the next day, including intermittent nausea and extreme fatigue. I had to leave work early on Wednesday 1/20/21, called out of work on 1/21/21. My symptoms were gone by mid day of 1/21/21 except my fatigue and headache lingered until 1/22/21. I took extra strength Tylenol throughout the days.

                                                About 8-10 minutes after the injection, my vision got blurry. It was very brief- only a couple minutes long. If it had lasted until the end of my 15 minute post-injection observation period, I would have reported it then, but it didn&#39;t. I decided to include it here, because later in the day, I had another reaction. About 12 hours after the dose -around 7PM- I started getting chills and body aches and abnormally fatigued. The chills were intense almost as soon as they come on. The body aches were mild for the first couple hours and progressed to intense. Both symptoms lasted continuously for about 12 hours, then around 7AM they started to wane. I&#39;m not sure if I should list insomnia as a reaction, but despite how exhausted I felt, I could not sleep. It could have also been just general discomfort that kept me from being able to sleep. Through most of the following day I had mild aches and waves of chills. By the time I went to bed that night (last night at the time of writing this), the symptoms had mostly  cleared and so far have not returned.

It happened one more time in the middle of the night, jolting me out of sleep. My period has not come since I took the shot.  It?s been two weeks. This is very unusual.

My fever reduced to 99 degrees around 0730am and remained as such through the following day (1/28/21) as the chills, nausea, and cold sweats gradually faded away. I was deeply fatigued and unable to work.  Sometime mid afternoon I developed a crippling frontal headache That worsened in the light and standing. I have no history of headaches or migraines. I was still repulsed by the thought of eating. I took acetaminophen with a protein shake and it helped the headache And residual body aches enough for me to sleep. 1/29/21 I awoke still fatigued  with a minor headache.   I am a pro athlete with no underlying conditions. I have had my flu shot yearly with no side effects. I am extremely fit and eat a healthy balanced diet, maintain a healthy athletic weight, sleep 7-8 hours a night, do not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use recreational drugs. I was absolutely floored at how sick this shot made me.

During 1st 24 hours of having the 2nd dose I had chills, fever, body aches, sleeplessness. Symptoms subsided within 24-48 hours with the arm soreness taking about a week to completely go away.   A week and a half after receiving the 2nd dose I noticed a lump on my neck, lower middle near the collarbone. It is significantly pronounced. I saw my primary doctor for an already scheduled physical and she said I was fighting off an infection and it was normal. I mentioned I had the COVID vaccine and she said it isn&#39;t uncommon to see the lymph node swell after vaccination and it should go away in a couple of weeks. I wanted to report this because it can freak people out to see a lump in their neck so long after being vaccinated without any other symptoms. We need to list this as a possible side effect on the vaccine information. I feel completely fine except my neck is a little tender/sore from the swollen lymph node.

Took symbicort (I have normally well controlled asthma). Called clinic and was advised that I was fine and could continue to work and to follow up with MD if symptoms got worse. Did virtual visit with Pulmonologist at 0945 and he advised me to get COVID swabbed and prescribed prednisone taper and albuterol MDI. COVID swabbed 2/9 at 5pm. Out of work 2/10 &amp; 2/11 awaiting test results. Returned to work 2/12 after negative COVID result- passed safepass- worked, still SOB, but manageable. 2/13-2/14 had increasing SOB- albuterol MDI 6x/day. Monday 2/15 returned to work- saw doctor in person- increased prednisone from 20mg (tapered down) to 40mg (original dose) and added Spiriva. 2/17- Went to ED for status asthmaticus after using albuterol MDI 5-6x/day without any relief. Admitted 2/17 for asthma exacerbation- discharged 2/20. Discharged home with nebulized albuterol, prednisone slow taper, symbicort, Spiriva, Singulair &amp; Claritin. 2/23-2/24 Albuterol nebs 5x/day, still SOB. Pulmonary visit 2/24 - added inhaled budesonide nebs. Out of work 2/25-2/26. Returned to work 3/1- finally feeling better!

When it continued to get worse, I went to the dr about 3 weeks after my first shot and was diagnosed with labyrinthitis. My symptoms continued to worsen, and I now have severe hearing loss as well as 75% loss of vestibular function (diagnosed by ENT and audiologist) with constant vertigo. My current diagnosis is labyrinthitis, however I&#39;m also getting an MRI in 2 days to rule out other possibilities.

I DID NOT WAKE BACK UP FOR 17 HOURS.  1/1/2021, 9:00AM: WHEN I WOKE UP I HAD A LARGE RED RASH OVER MY FACE AND DOWN MY NECK- NO WHERE ELSE ON MY BODY BESIDES MY FACE. MY FACE HAD A BURNING SENSATION AS IF IT WERE ON FIRE.  1/2/2021: BY 48 HOURS MY ENTIRE FACE  (INCLUDING MY EYELIDS) HAD THE RED RASH. I TOOK BENADRYL AND THE BURNING SENSATION WENT AWAY BY THE MORNING.  1/3/2021: ON DAY #3 I USED A POISON IVY TYPE CREAM BEFORE BED, AS WELL AS BENADRYL. 1/4/2021, 05:00:  THE MORNING OF DAY#4 THE REDNESS AND RASH HAD SUBSIDED TREMENDOUSLY, HOWEVER STILL PRESENT. 1/4/2021, 1:30PM: VISITED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. I HAD A STEROID SHOT ADMINISTERED, AND WAS SENT A PRESCRIPTION FOR AN EPI PEN AND A &#34;PACK&#34; TO MY PHARMACY.  THE PHYSICIAN REACHED OUT TO OTHER COLLEGUES, ALL STATING THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF CASES ARISING WITH RED RASHES ON PEOPLES FACES, BUT NONE OF THEM HAD PERSONALLY SEEN IT YET. MY PHYSICIAN SAID I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO COME IN. I ASKED ABOUT MY DERMA- FILLERS, AND IF THEY HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RASH BUT NOTHING COULD BE CONFIRMED. MY TEMPERATURE WAS EXACTLY 98.5, HOWEVER THE DR STATED MY SKIN WAS HOT TO THE TOUCH.

                                                I received the vaccine on December 29th, 2020. The vaccinated arm didn&#39;t really hurt until the next morning when I woke up I could barely move my arm.  Around 10:00am  I started getting chills and having sweats. Over the next hour I became severely fatigued even with taking my adderall that morning. My body started tingling, I felt dissociated, had a headache, and a little light headed. Almost a little drunk feeling. I went home from work and slept most of the day.  When I woke up in the evening around 9pm I was sweaty, and my muscles and joints hurt. I took my temperature and it was  100.6.  The next morning on December 31st I no longer had a fever. My temperature was 98. something. The next several days and even now I continue to feel severely fatigued, and slightly dissociated. However, each day I seem to feel the side effects a little less.

Intense itching woke me up at 4:40am the day after receiving the vaccine.  The reaction worsened for the next 3 days and began to settle/decrease at the end of the 3rd day.   I also felt somewhat disoriented through  the allergic reaction period, and on the day after the vaccine I felt slight pain on my chest.  I did not experience shortness of breath or have trouble breathing at any point.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post injection, I felt a burning sensation move from my left deltoid, up my shoulder, and across my chest. I experienced burning in my chest for about 10 mins, and then it subsided. About 8 mins after that, I experienced moderate to severe cramping in my lower back and thigh muscles; which completely subsided after 10-15 mins. Two days after the initial injection, the injection site began burning/aching again, with movement up to my shoulder joint. It was to a point where I was tearful and unable to sleep. The following morning it had subsided, and just remains slightly sore.

                                                The following day, 12/23/20, I kept feeling like I was having brief waves of anxiety, with nothing to be anxious about. The anxious feeling kept occuring, but it wasn&#39;t until a week later than I realized that each time I felt that anxiety, my heart was actually palpitating.  I had a 12 lead EKG done via local EMT to confirm that it was actually happening, then made an appt with a local cardiologist.  Stress test, cardio sonogram, and 24 hour heart monitor tests were completed on 1/13/21.  My follow up is on 2/3/21.  Fortunately, I have not felt a palpitation since 1/10/21.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

Muscle aches, fatigue, just felt off.  Then arm was very sore.  Sunday night my arm pit really started hurting.  Hurst over my shoulder, clavicle, and down into the lateral side of my breast.  Bothered enough in the night that I didn&#39;t sleep well.  This morning 1-5-21 I have a red rash over the injection site, arm is swollen over deltoid and hot.  Arm pit and down into breast is still hurting significantly.  I took Ibuprofen yesterday and helped some with pain in arm pit.  Off an on SOB and chest feels tight.  No cough

Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

                                                Immediately following shot, I had soreness in my arm that gradually worsened throughout the day. Around 8 pm the pain radiated up my shoulder across the top of my back. Around 10 pm I was suddenly hit with a wave of fatigue where my husband was unable to wake me from the couch to go to bed.  I woke up around 8:30 am on 1/7/21 with a debilitating headache, tingling in my fingertips,  and unsteadiness while walking. I was advised to go to the ED who gave no treatment other than recommending OTC pain meds, benedryl and rest. I returned home and took all the recommendations. At 4:41 pm, there has been no change with symptoms.

My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

                                                The next morning following the vaccination, my right lower eyelid started severely twitching every 10-15 minutes for 4 days throughout the entire day, usually subsiding at bedtime. Each time it lasts from 30 seconds to 1 minute every single day. on the 5th day, the twitching stopped for approximately 15 hours but returned when I went to sleep and kept me up through the night. THis has really taken a toll on my livelihood and I am afraid of it progressing to Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never had this happen.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after first covid vaccine I was nauseous, muscle cramps in whole right arm (the side I was given the shot), migraine, dizzy, trouble lifting arm, redness swelling and pain at injection site.  Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

                                                Day of shot had pretty extreme pain in the arm a few hours later into the night. Was pretty extreme next day - couldn?t move arm above head, hard to change in and out of clothes, etc. Following day still pain but maybe 10%better. Over weekend slowly got better. This Monday and Tuesday woke up with very slight pain but nothing that I had to adjust my everyday routine for like a I had the first few days so I thought I was in the clear. Then last night extreme pain back again. Can?t move arm/shoulder without pain. Can?t engage muscle without a lot of pain.

                                                As the injection day wore on, my arm increased in soreness. By 9:00 pm on day of injection, I was unable to lift or move my arm, due to the pain. For 2 days after the injection, I was unable to perform many activities becuase I could not lift or move my arm. By 11:30 pm on Saturday 1/16, I started to be able to lift and move my arm, a tiny bit. On Sunday the 17th, I was able to lift my arm to shoulder height, but still had a great deal of pain. The pain started to lessen throughout the day on Sunday. When I woke up Monday morning, I was able to use my arm, but it felt &#34;dead&#34; (like when you sleep on a limb wrong). This feeling continued through Tuesday, and Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, into Wednesday the 20th, it feels like there is a tennis ball in my arm pit - when my arm is in normal position. When my axillary lymph nodes were felt, there is no swelling, but a greater amount of pain.

Normal treatment that works for me( rizatroban) only slightly lessened. Advil Tylenol alternated for migraine and chills. Arm much less sore this time. I would say normal injection soreness.  But stayed in bed all day due to migraine, chills and fatigue. No way I could have worked. 36hrs- woke up feeling really foggy and some dizziness.  After drinking a few glasses of water feeling somewhat normal.  No fatigue today, arm feeling almost normal.

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

                                                About 3 hours after the injection, I was hit all of a sudden with extreme fatigue and dizziness. This lasted several hours until a took a 2-3 hour nap after lunch. I felt better enough after the nap to at least get through the rest of the day. However, by around 8 pm I had uncontrollable shaking chills. Could not get warm. Eventually fell asleep, and woke up 3 hours later with fever and severe body aches. My temperature was 101.5, but consider that my normal body temp is a full degree lower than average, so for me this was extremely hot. I felt like my body was radiating heat like a furnace. I was so hot and uncomfortable that I couldn&#39;t sleep, and gave up after an hour. I got up and had a Tylenol, tea, and snack (so as to not have the Tylenol on empty stomach). A little before 4 am I finally fell asleep again. When I woke up around 7 am, I didn&#39;t feel quite so hot anymore but there were still the body aches. As the morning went on, the aches reduced to just my upper body, neck, and the sore injection arm. I had a headache through the morning and early afternoon, but by late afternoon I was feeling more normal again.

                                                Headache and dizziness started at 10:30pm on 2/15/21. I began to feel nauseated around 11:15pm. Body aches, chills and fever started around 11:45. My fever peaked at 101.2 at 2am. Pain relievers and fever reducers did not help. I had cold sweats throughout the night, not able to sleep consistently through the night due to body aches, headache and nausea. Left arm became swollen, hot and hard to the touch, this lasted through 2/17/21. The arm was itchy from 2/18-2/20/21. The fever and body aches lasted through 2/16 until about 10:15pm, around 11:00pm the headache went away. I was feeling mostly recovered with the exception of the arm by the morning of 2/17.

                                                I am a healthcare provider. I had prophylactically premedicated with Tylenol prior to receiving my covid-19 vaccine. Immediately following the vaccine I had mild / moderate pain at injection site and muscle soreness at injection site. Roughly 20-24 hours after receiving  the vaccine, I developed moderate headache, fatigue, fogginess, full body aches, nausea and upset stomach. I continued on Tylenol twice daily. After a good night?s sleep, I felt better the following morning and all symptoms had resolved within 48 hours post vaccination.

I began to feel like my mind was foggy and some fatigue, then my lower lip and tongue started to tingle. I stopped driving and waited to see if anything further developed. I then felt flush and my hands became clammy. After maybe 2 minutes these symptoms resolved, I never had any trouble breathing so I continued home and did not seek any medical attention. The whole time frame was about 5 to 10 minutes.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

                                                Approximately around 8:00 pm the same day as my injection I started to be in a fair amount of pain at the injection site (right shoulder) I took a bath still was in pain took Tylenol hoping it would take the edge off around 11:30 the pain started to increase so I put a heating pad on my arm . As the night progressed my shoulder pain intensified and then  I started to feel pain all over my by body mainly in the joints. It was very severe joint pain all over and especially in my right shoulder that I took another bath.  I couldn?t lay down or sleep I could barely walk around my bedroom but even that hurt so bad in my hips and knees. This feeling was very similar as if I were to having an lupus episode in my joints. Around 4 am on January 14th I finally took ibuprofen and eventually I was able to fall asleep. I later woke up around 9 am and thankfully pain free other than a mild shoulder pain where I got my vaccine.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins sitting after infection. I left and was driving and started feeling disoriented, dizzy, shaking and throbbing headache. I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

                                                Since receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 12/30/2020 I have been experiencing what almost feels like brain fog. I have had some trouble staying on task at work, trouble finding words, remembering common last names, etc. Oftentimes I will have this temporarily as a migraine aura, but it typically goes away once the migraine comes and goes. This seems to have come to stay since receiving the vaccine. I did have fatigue for approximately 3 days after the vaccine administration - 2-3 hour naps daily. This has improved some. I also had a dull headache that seemed to be there daily for approximately 2.5 weeks post vaccine- nothing I could not tolerate but it just did not want to go away even with my usual treatment - Excedrin Headache and ice.  The best way I can describe it is a dull pain all over the top of my head and forehead. I did have one headache that occurred approximately 5 days after the vaccine, that I would consider a &#34;bad migraine&#34; (Migraine that rendered me incapable of completing my daily routine - having to stay in bed, dizziness, etc). My face on the side with the weakness as a result of my brain tumor has also been a bit more &#34;tired&#34; than usual - facial palsy more pronounced. There have been times in my brain tumor journey where this happens for sometimes a couple of weeks at a time usually due to stress or an impending &#34;bad migraine&#34; coming on or if I have been exposed to or end up developing an illness later - but I never developed an illness an no additional stress. Facial symptoms include smile not as symmetrical (basically more assymetrical than usual - not wanting to move at all so much on the affected side) and more eye watering on the affected side. I do still feel a little lightheaded at times, but otherwise no other neurological symptoms. No upper respiratory symptoms or any other &#34;COVID-like&#34; symptoms. No nausea, vomiting, numbness, or tingling. Symptoms do seem to be improving this week.

Thought I was starting to feel myself by Sunday midday but then suddenly on Sunday afternoon almost exactly 48 hours after the shot I started to feel extreme confusion and short term memory loss. My body started shaking, I felt very hot and then very cold (back and forth) and began experiencing shortness of breath. It was all very scary and I ended up in the ER.

I was unable to tolerate sleeping on my left side that night and I had a bad headache. My arm is still sore now but I can tolerate pressure on it better. Yesterday around 1:00 pm, the day after the shot, I began having some itching along the back of my neck near my hair line. By around 7:00 that night my neck continued to itch, I was not scratching however, but also my upper posterior neck into my hair line became red, hot, swollen, and painful. It spread equally across my posterior cervical spine from the base of my head to about C7 level (pics taken). My headache worsened and pain spread all the way down my spine to my lumbosacral region. I still have these symptoms now but to a lesser degree. I feel nauseated today as well and had to stay home from work and contact my doctor because of these symptoms.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

I also work up due to fever (temp 100.1 ), chills, and myalgia. I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night and got very little rest as unable to get comfortable. The next day I still had fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, joint pain, low back pain, fatigue and headache (felt similar to prior bad flu symptoms). I was sent home from work early as symptoms continued throughout the day with a little relief from a 500mg of acetaminophen. The following day 12/31 symptoms were gone except for the left sore arm which was improving and now completely done on 1/3.

I went to bed and slept much longer than normal and woke up the next morning without chills or body aches. My arm still hurt quite a bit and I started to have elbow joint and hip pain. The following day I started to have sciatica from my hip to my foot on my injection side, the left side. My elbow joint was sore for about 3-4 days after the injection. I also had some numbness right at the injection site the night of the vaccine.

The following morning (24 hours post vaccine) I still was having numbness and tingling in my feet and my legs from knees down felt weak and jelly like. I still was able to walk fine, but it was uncomfortable, not able to work out etc.  12/31 (48 hours post) I worked for 10 hours this day and symptoms were the same, that evening I continued to have same symptoms and my knees and ankles ached intermittently. 1/1- Same symptoms as previous days. 1/2- Same symptoms and started having tingling down back of upper leg from butt to back of knee, still tingling in feet.  1/2- Went to ER waited 8 hours and left. 1/3- Went to Emory ER and they ruled out GBS and said they have not seen this particular reaction to the vaccine but due to presentation they believe it is a vaccine reaction&#34;.

                                                At minute 12 after injection (8:31am on 1/5/20), the pruritis started on my scalp and my back. I informed the volunteer at the end of the drive line. She offered to have EMS evaluate me, however I declined as I thought the reaction was mild. Over the next 10 minutes, after being released from the driveline, I was so itchy I wanted to literally rip all of my skin off. The back of my throat started to itch, but never felt tight or swollen. No SOB or chest tightness. I checked my temp at 8:45 and I was at 101.0 and HR was 110bpm. I am a PA working in dermatology and got to work and took 50mg of diphenhydramine PO but was not improving. One of the doctors I work with and I decided it was best for me to get checked out in urgent care. I had my MA drive me there and was seen immediately. I had a blotchy rash over my entire body, but not raised or hived. Temp was 100.6, HR 86 and BP 127/78, respirations 16/min O2 sat 98% and the itchiness was still severe but I could tell the diphenhydramine was kicking in. I was then given 40mg of famotidine PO and 10mg Dexamethasone IM in the right buttocks while in urgent care. After about 15 minutes, my symptoms were improving, but not resolved. I was released and went home to rest. Throughout the day yesterday (1/5/20) my heart rate would spike as high as 130bmp (my normal is 60-70bpm). Then it would come down within a few seconds to about 100bpm and steadily stay between 90-100bpm all day. Last night I was woken up at 3:30am (1/6/20) with a HR of 132bpm and O2 at 97%. I took a few deep breaths, and it slowly started to drop to 100bpm. Since 6:00am, I am steady at 70-80bpm with occasional spikes of 96-100bpm and I can feel when my heart is starting to race. I have my pulse ox on for the day and will continue to monitor my symptoms. I still have occasional pruritis, but it&#39;s tolerable. I was discharged from urgent care with PO Prednisone tapered dose, however, I am very shaky already and do not want to make it worse, so have not started it yet. Not sure if I should? And I would like to know if I should receive the second dose? If so, should I pre-medicate? Please let me know if you have any further questions about my event. Thanks.

I have also had severe chills, nausea, vomited twice, generalized weakness and shakiness.  It is currently 12:10pm on 1/8/21 and these symptoms continue.  Two of my other co-workers were at this same facility at the same time on 1/7 and have had very similar symptoms as well as severe headache which prevented them to work today.  We are all physical therapists, healthy young individuals, no co-comorbidities and were very surprised by these negative reactions and concerned.

I continued to feel exhausted and have difficulty focusing due to the headache and tiredness the entire day. I woke up feeling better the next morning.

Also noticed slight numbness of fingertips to right hand. Patient attributed this to her mask being on too tight and receiving the vaccine in right arm and was discharged from clinic without stating the above. As patient began to drive 50 minutes to home, she called her husband and stated she felt numb inside her right gum and cheek- he advised her to return to clinic.

After the 15 minutes, I went outside and tood off my mask to get some fresh air.  I went back to work and was still feeling dizzy.  I drank water, ate some food and sat for a bit.  At about 1pm, I was still feeling dizzy but also started feeling off, as if I were intoxicated or like how you feel when you just wake up from having anesthesia, sluggish.  I then went home and slept for about 5 hours and now I feel much better.  Will someone let me know if it is recommended I still get the second dose next month?

She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

                                                Moderately severe pain which made basic movements difficult and woke me up frequently throughout the night beginning evening of vaccination on 1/14/2021 and steadily worsening through the next day and night. Large oblong welt about 2 inches across at injection site. Symptoms started within a few hours of getting the injection and became steadily very significant by the next day. It took about 7 days to recover from the most significant symptoms and was still recovering from mild bruise and occasional itching but no redness. Today (1/26/2021) my arm started itching again, and I see that I have a large flat circular (about 2 inches across) red spot right where I had the welt a week ago.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

                                                Thursday morning I awakened sluggish and feeling foggy in the brain. I had chills and a tmeperature of 100.3 with tylenol. At 11:42 am my temp was 102.3. I had severe headache, fatigue, bodyaches, chills. neck stiffness and joint pain, light sensitivity, nausea/loss of appetite. Moderate swelling at injection site (left deltoid) and swollen lymph nodes. Dizziness.  I slept most of the day, awakening to use the bathroom and at that time check my temp. Today 1/29/2021 some things have improved. my temp have improved 98.5, my headache is there but not a 10. I still have not eaten today. I am still taking tylenol. The light sensitivity is gone. The neck stiffness is there, but improving.

Zaleplon insufficient duration so switched to Zolpidem PRN. She has not required more than a few doses of zolpidem but now we have uptitrated her to gabapentin 600mg nightly. She feels significant improvement in her sleep and work product, but continues to have intermittent cognitive errors and some decrease in work performance, that remain concerning to her.

I tried my inhaler and that did nothing. This persisted. On 3pm Thurs (2/18) I started feeling dizzy and by 4:30pm I could not stand. Went to the doctor on Friday (2/19) with a fever of about 100, inability to walk without assistance. I&#39;ve also been having memory problems.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

                                                1/2/2021: In the evening, I  started experiencing swelling (felt like a hard knot under the skin), itching, redness, and heat at the injection site. Earlier in the day I noticed a little pain discomfort in my right arm pit. As the day wore on, I noticed swelling in my lymph nodes and the level of discomfort increased to the point that it disturbed my sleep. 1/3/2021: The pain and swelling at the injection site and armpit continued to be the same. I took ibuprofen to try and alleviate the level of discomfort. That evening before bed also took Benadryl to see if it would help with the injection site reaction. I also started experiencing a dull shooting pain and tingling from my armpit down to my wrist on my right arm. 1/4/2021: The injection site improved, no more knot, heat, or itching. It still remained a little swollen. Lymph nodes were still swollen throughout the day, but manageable with ibuprofen. Shooting pain and tingling still occurring sporadically throughout the day. 1/5/2021: Still a little discomfort in the armpit, but seems to be improving.

In the early afternoon on Friday the symptoms got worse.   Tired and confused.  I slept through my alarm and woke up to my mom, who was watching my daughter for me, trying to wake me up.  I was very confused, dizzy and weak.  My mom said I was really out of it, and that I had a really hard time focusing on what she was trying to say to me.    When I checked in for work my O2 stats were in the upper 80&#39;s lower 90&#39;s.  My temp was also in the lower 90&#39;s.  That was after numerous attempts at taking my o2 stats and temps.  Co-worker said I was very confused, tired, dizzy and weak.  She said there were times when I was walking that I would reaching for walls and railings to regain my balance.  I left work at 6am Saturday morning.  I went home and went straight to bed.  Slept all day long until a few hours before my shift started at 9:30 P.M.   since then I&#39;ve been feeling better, but my temp and 02 stats are still low.  But I&#39;m continuing to monitor symptoms.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if anything changes.

                                                I got my 1st shot Monday evening. I was fine, arm started hurting about 9pm which was to be expected. Tuesday I woke up within 20mins I was nauseous and threw up multiple times. My body was achy and just felt &#34;blah&#34;. Was weak and dizzy when I stood up. I felt like my insides were on fire (like the worst temperature you&#39;ve ever had) but didn&#39;t have a fever. Felt like my brain was going to swell out of my head and it was the worst headache. I slept all day. Woke up long enough to call the dr and fell back asleep. Halfway through the day I ended up with a fever of 102 (it went down after a few hrs). Today I woke up still feeling weak and somewhat dizzy, spacey.

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

                                                I  got it at 2pm Friday.  About 2 hours later my arm started feeling sore but not too bad. I did some light yoga and walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.  Otherwise took it easy that day. Satu I woke up with a slight headache which isn&#39;t unusual for me.  I still had mild soreness in my arm. I did a more difficult yoga workout and then walked 5 miles outside.  Took a shower after and relaxed for a bit. Then had dinner around 5 and within the hour started having diarrhea.  This lasted a few hours during which my arm started gradually hurting more, it was pretty bad. Could barely move it and hurt to the touch even. Shivering started soon after.  I never had a fever or fatigue during all of this. Highest temp was 98.4 with forehead thermometer. I talked to a doctor to put my mind at ease and he said I was having a big immune response to the vaccine, apparently younger adults between 20 to 40 are having bigger immune responses. The second dose is stronger so most are  having these symptoms after that one, but some are having it after the first as well. He also told me I should have taken it easy these past 2 days and that I likely overdid it. He advised that I take motrin or Tylenol, get under blankets to stay warm, and rest. That&#39;s exactly what I did and a little over an hour later I was feeling much better.   I&#39;m a bit freaked out by what the second dose is going to do to me since it is supposed to be worse. Is it safe for me to get second dose?

                                                About 24 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced extreme breast tenderness in both breasts. They felt sore to the touch all over, had the sensation of being full and heavy, and had to be supported in a bra in order to be tolerable. I liken it to postpartum pain associated with breast feeding and milk engorgement. I would list the symptoms the first night as moderate to severe. It limited my ability to do certain tasks because of the pain and discomfort. The breast tenderness has decreased in severity since then but it is now 1/11/2021 and both breasts are still tender. The severity is now mild. It&#39;s uncomfortable but does not limit my daily activity. Of note, I have had a tubal ligation and ablation and am not pregnant but I cannot track the timing of my cycle to know if the vaccine affected my cycle or caused hormonal changes that could explain the breast sensitivity.   I had arm soreness at the injection site for the first 48 hours but that has gone away. No other symptoms to report.

                                                I had the vaccine Sunday night and experienced fatigue that night, and then developed arm soreness that lasted for a little over 24 hours. I also developed minor body aches and felt crummy Monday and Tuesday. I was then fine for the rest of that week. Monday, January 4th at 7:30 PM, I felt something tingly, burning, and hot on my left arm. When I looked at it, I had a large round red rash that had a knot and was hot to the touch and itchy. At 3:30 AM on Tuesday morning, I woke up in pain and crying. I went to Urgent Care to have it assessed. The doctor diagnosed it as cellulitis in relation to an infection at the injection site and gave me an antibiotic and drew around it with a surgical marker. He told me to go to my PCP if it grew outside of the line or to the ER if I developed severe symptoms. On Wednesday, it had grown and was not getting any better and had started forming blisters. I called my PCP and he told me to take 2 Loratadine every 24 hours and to come in if it was not better by Friday. It appeared to be getting better and I was fine on Thursday. Friday morning, I woke up in pain again. The rash had spread across the majority of my upper arm. It was red and painful and itching with heat. I went in to see my PCP and he diagnosed it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He gave me a steroid, which seems to be suppressing the rash and symptoms. I still have a rash and itchiness, but my physician said it could last for another week or two until it goes away.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

                                                Vaccine given at 2pm. By 9pm that same night I could not move my arm without crying from the pain.  I woke upbat 5am and the pain was still just as bad. Any little movement was excruciating. I could not change my clothes, brush my hair, wash my face. The only reason I waa still able to work is because I am a teacher and we are remote so I was able to sign on from home and sit at my desk with my arm in an imaginary swing because that was the only time it did not hurt. Later that night I could begin to move my arm a little before pain started but still needed help getting dressed, etc. The next two days I was able to move it little more before pain started.  It is now 5 days later and I can lift my arm up. I still feel pain but it ia tolerable.

                                                Around 6pm my arm starting getting sore. All night it hurt really badly and kept me awake. I took Tylenol around 3am and that helped. When I woke up the day after I had a HUGE lump on my arm at the injection site. It looked like a golf ball. It was red and hot. It stayed this way for about 3 more days and finally started to go down. The red mark at the injection spot remained though and continued hurting until about day 9 after the shot. Then it started getting itchy but remained red. I am now over 2 weeks post shot and the red mark is still slightly there but not very visible and the pain and itchiness has gone away.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

Little out of it feeling.  This was pretty much done by 1/1/21. 1/7/21 one week and a day after injection, injection site became raised, hard, inflamed looking  and was itchy. Site was visibly red and raised and had approximate 3 in diameter.  Previously mentioned symptoms began again (waves of hot flashes, nausea, aches).  This lasted at least until bedtime.  Next day, 1/8/21 felt better and injection site, though still hard and red, reduced down to size of quarter.  No further symptoms BUT injection site now as of 1/20/21 still looks like a quarter sized bruise.

                                                Left arm pain began on Thurs. 1/7/21, approximately 30 minutes after vaccine.  Severe headache and pain radiating to left side of neck began approximately 22 hours after vaccine (around 2pm on 1/8/21) and left arm pain worsened.  On 1/9/21, unable to get out of bed-felt like I had been drugged- severe HA, fatigue, and left side of neck soreness.  Felt slightly better on 1/10/21 and 1/11/21, however stil unable to get out of bed due to severe HA and fatigue.  On morning of 1/12/21, fatigue relieved and severe HA relieved around 1pm.  Since 1/12/21, Severe HA, left arm tightness and left neck soreness has continued intermittently.  This is a HA I have never experienced before.  Yesterday, on 1/21/21, I had a severe HA all day at work and when I went home, I had to lie down the rest of the day/evening d/t severe HA, fatigue and left neck tightness.  I was unable to do daily chores and help my children with their homework.  I also woke up this morning with the same severe HA and left neck soreness/tightness.  I do feel this HA is from the vaccine as I have never experienced this type of HA prior to receiving the vaccine and I am not someone who gets HA&#39;s often.    I know the vaccine was given too high, as I give vaccines often for my career, and I am wondering if that has anything to do with my neck pain.  I did bleed a lot with the injection (do not think it went into my muscle) and am wondering if that has anything to do with my adverse reaction.  I am fearful these severe HA&#39;s will continue and I am extremely hesitant to receive my second dose!

                                                The following day I had redness at the injection site about 2/12 inches long and wide with itching and minor swelling/bump. The day following also was tired achy and felt off/headache. On Thursday symptoms went away other than the arm and a slight headache. On Saturday the redness and I ring was gone, but I started having pain in my armpit and when I moved my arm in different positions. Hand was tingling with certain positions suggesting nerve pain. Lasted 2 to 3 days and got worse before better. Was mostly gone by Tuesday. Wednesday 8 days after injections the redness, itching, and swelling in my arm returned. Same size as the day after my injection. Called the doctor to see if I need to be concerned that the redness, itchyness, and swelling returned after completely going away 4 days earlier. Also feeling tired for the past 3 to 4 days but otherwise good. Some minor discomfort/pain in collar bone around and lump node in neck but is not consistent. Comes and goes. Not sure if the nerve pain in arm was related to the vaccine, but since the redness returned it may all be related.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart started racing and I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

The next morning, I woke with minor side effects body aches, chills, slight fever and arm sore from injection. As the day progressed, my symptoms got worse. By body aches were so severe that it hurt to stand, sit, bend and curl my toes. My head was so full of congestion by the end of the night. I was meeting with a small group of family for New Year&#39;s and thought that I would get checked to make sure that it was nothing. I was tested for COVID and for Influenza. I came back positive for Influenza A. I was sent home with a sample of Xofluza. I was in bed for 2 days and symptoms started subsiding. I went back to work the following week.

                                                My arm became quite sore about 8 hours after my initial vaccination.  It was sensitive to the touch to the point that I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body.  It also hurt to raise my arm any higher than shoulder height.  It went away on its own after about 36 hours.  One week later, on January 7th, my husband noticed that I had a large red patch on my arm where I had gotten the vaccination.  It was about 1.5-2&#34; across, raised, red and warm to the touch.  It was slightly itchy, but didn&#39;t hurt.  My husband noticed this in the evening, but I am not sure how long it had been that way since I had had long sleeves on all day.  By the morning, it had gone away.  I didn&#39;t treat it in any way.

After about an hour, my arm was swollen and very painful to move and touch. I put an ice pack on and took Tylenol but the pain and swelling didn?t completely subside. I went to bed with Tylenol PM to help me sleep and woke up several times from the pain. Throughout the day today (2nd day), the pain has steadily gotten worse. I can barely move my arm due to the immense pain. The swelling is still there. I have been icing it and taking Tylenol but the pain has only gotten worse. I feel achy in my neck and the pain is radiating down my arm to my forearm, wrist, and fingers.

The red areas were swollen, hot to touch, and each were a hard lump a little larger than a marble.  These two spots were about 3 inches below the injection site and an inch closer to the body midline.  These red spots worsened and joined together.  1/28/21 I was still experiencing the red raised area that had grown in size, still hot to the touch and now red and rashy around the outer edge.

Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

She looked at her arm and noticed below the injection site was a reddened area approx 2.5 inches long by 2.0 inches wide.  The &#34;bee sting sensation&#34; has gone away shortly after noticing the reddened are and now is just tender to the touch.  Encouraged patient to put Ice on the reddened area and or Tylenol or Ibuprofen if needed for pain or swelling. Patient will report back to me tomorrow.  The health department will monitor this situation over the next couple of days. Encouraged patient to follow up with her primary care physician for worsening symptoms.

                                                6 days after vaccination, I started to feel ill. Throat slightly scratching, almost like I was getting a cold. Then it went away. 7 days after vaccination, same thing, started to feel a little ill. Developed an itch at injection site. Nothing could be visually seen at the injection site. Within a few hours, half dollar sized round res spot appeared, with knot under it. Warm to the touch. Felt like a sunburn, with a knot under it. Day 8 after vaccination, woke up with double the size of circle at injection site. By end of day, pounding headache on left side, felt nauseous and unwell. Injection site itchy, warm to touch and began to grow in size. Went to urgent care. Once there, injection site was about the size of a baseball. Dr stated it was a reaction and prescribed an antibiotic and oral steroids. He noted how hard the knot was and was worried about cellulitis and infection. He told me to report this delayed reaction and advised me to not get a second dose. Since being there, about an hour ago, I feel worse. Ears are ringing loudly, increased headache, and almost a wet feeling at swollen injection site.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 EUA Received shot at hospital at 2:30 pm on Jan. 5th.  Had a mildly sore arm that evening and next day at work.  I did notice I had a hard, reddened welt area around injection site, about an inch and half in diameter.  At 8:15 pm on Jan. 6th, I became increasingly achy, and by 9 pm, I could barely stand without my entire body aching.  I took 600 mg of Ibuprofen along with my usual nightly meds of Ambien, Trazodone, and 50 mg benadryl.  It was very hard to sleep that night, as no position was comfortable, and even the weight of the blanket hurt my skin all throughout my body.  I called in sick to work Jan 7th.  I continued to take Ibuprofen and benadryl as directed on the label throughout the day.  Around 4 pm on the 7th, I finally started to feel some relief from the body aches.  My upper left arm remains slightly itchy and has an even larger reddened area now, that measures 3 inches as of today, Jan. 16th.  It remains warm to the touch, and slightly hardened under the skin.  I do have pictures of my arm from January 6th, the day after receiving the injection, but prior to becoming achy, and from today, January 16th, that I would be willing to share.

                                                Got my 1st covid vaccine around 9:30 am 1-18-21. Shot was administered with no issue, waited my 15 minutes and went home. Was feeling a little tired throughout the day and around 9 pm noticed I was starting to notice some mild flu skin, body aches and headache.  Went to bed around 10 and had slight shivering but figured it was maybe just a low grade fever and covered up with another blanket.  Within 20 minutes I had full blown rigors. My husband had me take a hot shower thinking it might help but it did not. I had uncontrollable shaking for a couple hours then finally fell asleep (I did wake myself up once from shaking). I woke up at 4 am no longer shaking but I had a terrible headache,  my whole body ached and I was wet with sweat. My muscles and joints were so sore I barely was able to walk to the bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up around 6 (had to get kids up for achool) but I couldn&#39;t so had my husband get them ready. He brought me some acetaminophen and I slept until 11am. Got up and still had body aches and headache but not as bad as in the night. Slept on and off all through the day 1-19-21 taking acetaminophen 2 more times for headache and sore body. Went to bed around 10 pm and woke up back to normal 1-20-21

                                                I received the Moderna vaccination around 10:00am. It was confirmed that it was okay to get the vaccine being that I tested positive for Covid on 12/23/20. Around 19:00 I started to get cold and by midnight I was shivering uncontrollably, I had a fever and had a massive headache. I alternated ibuprofren and Tylenol which did not work. I was only able to sleep from midnight to about 3:00am. The entire day I was shivering with a massive headache. It hurt so bad that I wanted to cry but it hurt worse when I did cry. My highest fever was 101 degrees. My fever broke around 19:00 on 01/05/2021 but the massive headache and body aches lasted the entire week. I felt like I was &#34;hit by a bus&#34; and my entire top part of my arm was in pain . I was seen by a doctor  at HS on Thursday the 7th to have my medical condition documented. My arm felt better by then. She had me take off the rest of the week and to return to work on the 11th. I finally started to feel somewhat better by the 9th

                                                Legs extremely weak and felt like muscles were not functioning well. Knees were buckling while standing. Started about 4 hours after vaccination. Resolved by morning but fatigue continued. It was the exact same sensation felt last March and led to me not being able to get off couch for three weeks. Couldn&#39;t get covid testing until weeks after symptoms started and tested negative in March.   Numbness in lips. Lower lip&gt;upper. Started 2 days later. Resolved after gradually improving after 10 days. Fyi had lip injection/filler within the last 2 years. Moderate burning in Rt leg that started the Friday after the vaccine. No redness or edema. Resolved after 10 days.   Severe brain fog and fatigue and buzzing sensation in head. Much worse than baseline. Buzzing sensation was new. Slept all weekend. Improved to baseline after 14 or so days. Had sharp stabbing pains in the back of my head 7 days after the vaccine. Resolved after 3 to 5 days. Never had these sensations before. No history of headaches.  Went to PCP regarding leg pain, worsening brain fog and fatigue from baseline and unequal pupils that had previously resolved about 2 years prior. Pupils were unequal sizes when I woke up on 1/2.  Pupils now back to frequently being different sizes. No diagnosis made with previous episodes that had resolved. Maybe it was reactivated?  Also had visual distortions in left eye that were new on 1/3 that lasted two minutes. No pain associated with this.  Resolved.   Feel close to baseline now but hesitant to get second dose for these reasons.
