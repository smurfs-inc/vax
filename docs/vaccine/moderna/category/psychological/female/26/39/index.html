                                                Injection site pain began about 5 hours after getting vaccine and progressively worsened. Unable to lift arm above shoulder without significant pain at about 12 hours post injection. About 13-14 hours post vaccine, began having myalgias, chills. Took ibuprofen with some improvement of symptoms, but unable to sleep due to the combination of arm pain, chills and aches. Body aches and chills were gone by the morning but the arm pain lingered, less than the night before and improving each day, still there today, but much more tolerable.

                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

Even with water, the fluid only came out from my rectum with some wet and loose stools, the stool coming out as if liquid and not a solid. Even woke me up early morning to go to the bathroom.

                                                On Dec 28 - three hours after vaccine - started getting pain near injection site. It ached. 8:30PM that night I started getting itching from the midback to top of head on left side. Not left arm just the back, neck and face of left side. No rashes but a little red because I scratched. Then I noticed some bumps on my left side of my face and one hive on each knee and one hive on left shoulder. Telemed visit with dr. - took Benadryl - 25 mg. - within one hour of symptoms - at 9:00 pm per dr. Woke up next morning and had intense fatigue; muscles and back were really achy. Couldn&#39;t move my muscles very well. Felt like the wind had been knocked out of me. Bouts of itchiness. Slept throughout the day. That helped. But then had headache start - felt like a circle where my temples are to the back of my head and that is where is stayed. Next day - no fever and  but my symptoms improved except still had the symptoms but they had improved. Went to work on Wednesday because it started to go away - on and off headache - felt foggy. Bouts of itchiness and felt physically weak because my muscles had gotten so so tight. Felt a physical weakness for five more days. Headache went away by Wednesday night (Dec 30th). Itchiness went away. Three days symptoms went away although the physical weakness lingered until 5th  day. Used a heating pad for my muscles to help relax them.

                                                Saturday- felt fine for a Couple of hours after vaccine. Felt fatigued around 4 PM, laid down, lost ability to move arm, extreme pain in neck.  Sunday- more of the same throughout the day. At night when I took a shower the pain moved over the course of a few minutes in the shower from my arm to my lower back. Arm was fine, Lower back pain bad enough that I was limping.  Monday- woke up &amp; pain was evenly dispersed between lower back and head. Slight soreness in arm and neck. Took extra strength ibuprofen because I had to work. Totally fine for the rest of the day time. At night my arm and neck started to become very sore again. After I ate dinner I developed a very intense fever, chills/ shakes, my arm felt like it had a heartbeat and my heart was racing. Laid in bed all night. Felt scared and disturbed that this was happening days after the vaccine. Considered going to the hospital but I couldn?t move. Slept for 10 hours.  Tuesday (today)- feeling almost all better aside from slight pain in neck.

I was talking to people that were not there. I felt completely out of control. The only thing that helped was forcing myself to focus on the TV, which was extremely difficult. Symptoms started to die down around 3 AM, but did not go away. I slept for 4 hours.  1/20 8 AM- felt like and still feel like I am not in reality, I feel disassociated with my body (like its not mine), slightly out of control of my thoughts, I see subtle black and white flashing like last night but not as intense, paranoia like last night/not as intense, cant concentrate.

                                                I had slight dizziness for 20 minutes a half hour after the injection. But that&#39;s not the issue. When the lady gave me the injection, it felt like she wiggled it around in my arm. The injection itself was surprisingly painful. My arm hurt at first like I was punched in the arm on the first day (much like a flu vaccine). But then it got SIGNIFICANTLY worse the next day. I was in excruciating pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine. I had limited arm mobility and any movement caused agony. I couldn&#39;t sleep from the pain. I wasn&#39;t able to do my normal activities. The pain started to subside after 4 days, but had since started to get worse again. I&#39;m in a constant state of pain. It&#39;s now impacting my mental health. I can move my arm, but not without a lot of pain.

                                                I am not sure if the event that happened Sunday was directly related to the vaccine at all since it happened two days later, or if it was just a coincidence, or if the vaccine was just a physical stimulus trigger. I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

It was extremely severe and woke me up from my sleep. Movement made it worse. Nothing immediately made it better. It radiated down to my right shoulder. The pain lasted for about 2 weeks. I got a massage, used a heating pad, used an at home massage device, and Tylenol and ibuprofen.

                                                About 2 to 3 minutes after receiving my injection, I began to feel a burning sensation in my nostrils. It felt like a 4/10 pain. The burning sensation worsened when breathing through my nose. When trying breathing techniques to calm down (breathing deeply through the nose, exhaling out the mouth), the burning sensation deepened towards the back of my throat - but I never felt it in my lower throat and chest - only the top of my throat and nose.  The nurse on staff took me to a corner for closer evaluation. She had me remove my mask and checked my body for hives. I had no hives and the burning sensation occurred even after my mask was removed. She asked if I had trouble breathing or itchiness, I had neither of those symptoms. My heart rate was high and I began to hyperventilate because I was having a panic attack. I had no other symptoms besides the panic attack symptoms (tight chest, tingly face and hands, rapid heart rate, and dizziness) and the burning nostrils.  The sensation lasted about 5-10 minutes, then dissipated. I then put my mask back on after it was requested. I continued to be monitored by the nurse for another 20 minutes until I gained back my normal breathing and my heart rate lowered. I was scheduled for a 2nd dose and was dismissed with no other treatment or issues. I drove myself back home and rested for the remainder of the day.  I had no other symptoms that day, other than the typical sore arm, fatigue, and mild chills, which resolved themselves in a couple days. I had no other complications.

                                                I had a sore arm and couldn&#39;t swim for 2 days. It gradually wiped me out within an hour. I felt like I was in a haze, my body felt stressed. I couldn&#39;t think clearly. I had vomitting and  had no apetite. The room was spinning.

Another 2 hours and I began to feel extremely fatigued in the muscles, like they weren&#39;t attached to my bones. Very difficult to move. Felt extremely tired and weak. This continued for 15 hours. 6 hours after injection and I also began feeling very cold. Fever at 101.6 F. These chills lasted approximately 6 hours. 8 hours after injection I began experiencing extreme lower back pain. This was nearly unbearable. It hurt close to the spine and radiated laterally. Heat seemed to help slightly. The pain made it impossible to sleep. This lasted approximately 12 hours, at which time I took a Tylenol and the pain subsided slightly. 17 hours after injection I experienced a headache behind my eyebrows that moved from side to side for 2 hours until I took a Tylenol.  A lesser version of the headache and chills returned 48 hours after injection and lasted for 3 hours at time of this report.

I can?t function.

                                                I was given Moderna vaccine first dose in right arm. Sat down in observing area, within a few minutes I had a weird feeling, felt queezy. As soon as I felt queezy I passed out. I woke up they said within about 30 seconds and had full body sweats. Stomach ache, dizzy and head was tingly like I would pass out again. My calfs hurt like they had previously had muscle cramps. I went to ER, blood and urine tests were fine, heart and blood pressure was fine. Dr said he did not believe it was an allergic reaction, and that it was a stress response. I am not sure if it is because I had COVID in December.

                                                Arm pain began in early afternoon with skin tenderness beginning in the evening, which were followed by extreme chills, body aches that hurt to be still, muscle spasms, fever (102-101.4), throbbing headache (treated with ibuprofen x2 200mg Q4hr which helped some), then around 12am became hot and sweaty with aches and spasms persisting. Was able to sleep off and on every time I turned over onto my vaccine arm I woke because of the pain. Next morning I spent the day in bed with lingering chills, muscle aches, headache, and spasms, but less than night before. High Fever persisted (101.4) and a cough with mild shortness of breath developed. The night of 2/28 I took ibuprofen (same dose as before) and Benadryl which allowed me to sleep all night. This morning (3/1) I feel better, with fatigue, lightheaded, a mild fever of  99.3, and minimal muscle aches. Cough persists.

                                                Very swollen and painful lymph nodes all over entire body (chest, shoulders, arms, stomach, calves) for 1 week. Felt nauseous, dizzy, and exhausted. No appetite. Struggled to read and process things. Could not work. Sharp pains in lymph nodes at various times throughout the day. Chest felt very tight and arm hurt to the point I thought I might be having a heart attack. Had trouble sleeping due to lymph node pain. Ibuprofen did not help. The arm pain at injection site was annoying but I barely noticed it due to my other symptoms.

At about 1:30 am the next day I noticed the arm I got the shot in had a rash all the was down to my wrist amd it went into my back. My back and face were warm to the touch. It hurt to move my arm. The day after I recieved the shot my headache was much worse.   Today which is the 2nd day after my shot my headache is terrible i am having a hard time doing every day things. And over the counter pain medication is not helping at all. The rash and sore arm is gone.

                                                Starting about 1 minute after vaccination I became extremely dizzy, blacked out/lost vision, had shortness of breath and a tight chest, lost feeling in my hand and fingers on my left side (the side I got the vaccine), was sweating but felt cold flowing through my body. These feelings lasted for about 30 minutes and my vision and feeling in my fingers and hand came back as the dizziness subsided and my body temp returned to normal.   Around 40 minutes after the vaccine I started experiencing echoing in my left ear (the side I got the vaccine on) and soreness around the vaccination site.   The echoing in my left ear lasted about 30 minutes and then subsided. The arm pain spread to the rest of my arm and I began to get a headache.  About 4 hours after the vaccine I began to experience intense back, hip, foot and hand pain making me unable to do any regular activities. The back pain feels like intensely sharp pain in my spine and hurts to the gentle touch. I previously had no back pain prior to the vaccine. The muscles surrounding my spine up to my shoulders were also painful/sore.  This pain subsided after 6 days. On about the 4th day after the vaccine I began experiencing underarm and breast pain on the side I got the vaccine.  It is now exactly 1 week since my vaccination and I am still experiencing the underarm and breast pain.  I have experienced lethargy since vaccination.

                                                Immediately after dose 2 of the Moderna vaccine I felt fatigued and slightly congested. At approximately 3 am (14 hours after vaccination due to daylight savings), I woke up with severe body aches, headache, skin tenderness, and chills indicating a fever. The following morning, these symptoms were joined by lack of appetite, weakness, and nausea upon attempting to eat. Symptoms lasted at full intensity for approximately 24 hours. At some point in the early hours of 3/15, my fever started to break and left me sweating on and off all night. By the morning of 3/15, symptoms were still present, but had greatly lessened in intensity. After approximately 36 hours, (3/15 at 3 pm) symptoms had mostly ended, though I still had a headache and felt weak. Today (3/16), feelings of weakness persist and I feel very &#39;foggy&#39;; slow to think and slow in movement. I did not take any NSAIDs or medicines of any kind to deal with symptoms, as I feared it would lessen the efficacy of the vaccine.

In the early morning hours on 03/13/2021 she became anxious and having very irrational and disjointed thinking. She got into the pool (unheated) by herself, unbeknownst to any other family members in her athletic clothes she was in and was then found across the street at a neighbors house (she did not know them), standing  on their doorstep in wet clothes at 5:45 AM on 03/13/2021. Her confusion, irrational thought, anxiety and paranoia has increased to the point of having audio/visual hallucinations and sleep disturbances. Prior to the vaccination, she did not exhibit any of these behaviors or symptoms.

                                                Patient came in for first dose of covid vaccine (moderna) and received the shot in her left arm at 03/25/21 approx 1:30pm.  She was told to sit down near pharmacy for 15 minutes after receiving shot for observation.  However, since she is an employee, she decided to sit in the break room.  For 15 minutes, she was fine and she came back to pharmacy to let staff know she was fine.  At 30 minute point, she started feeling lightheaded, heart racing, shaky, foggy, and some nausea.  She sat down, was given ice pack for back of neck, instructed to put head down between legs and rest.  After talking to patient, she had eaten some after her shot, she was well hydrated.  She has had no previous major adverse effects from shot, aside from sometimes sore arm.  She is alert, communicative, and aware of her surroundings when I spoke to her.   At 2:17pm, patient is feeling a bit better, but still has lessened but similar SE.  Also, reports she has a bit of headache now.  Another coworker has offered to drive her home and she has her grandmother at home to watch her too.  Advised her to rest at home, take tylenol if headache persists, stand up and sit down carefully, and drink chicken soup until nausea is over.

Monday, the fatigue improved but Instartes to get muscle aches and stiffness. Soreness in my joints. By Wednesday evening my chest started to hurt for a few minutes and my heart rate temporarily Increased. As the days went on the symptoms became more regular. I also got extreme anxiety, a very fast heartbeat (up to 130 BPM), insomnia, sweating palms and feet, and very difficult to breathe. I couldn?t even get up to take a shower sometimes or sit up. I was admitted to the ER on I believe Tuesday the 23rd of March. This is all in the records. All tests came back normal  aside from low iron, but anemia tests came back negative. After all doctors refused to give me medication to directly treat it, I finally went to an urgent care where they gave me prednisone. It?s currently helping me. I was finally able to go for a walk today.

Afternoon of 4/4/21 continued with low grade fever (98-99 F) and mild.  6 am on 4/5/21 had allergic reaction on the left cheek. Hot red, swollen, itchy, and hives. Left ear swollen as well. Not hives or reaction anywhere else on the body. Began Benadryl, Zyrtec, and Methylprednisolone steroid pack with doctor&#39;s guidance. Swelling resolved by day 5 (4/9). On 4/8 woke up hot, tingly, hot feeling in ears and back of throat. Some numbness in limbs later. Attributing this to a panic attack.

                                                Some dizziness. Started an hour after vaccine. Around 7:45 am, April 12th, I experienced some disorientation. Felt disconnected from reality, and as a result I felt highly anxious and paranoid. I drank water; I didn&#39;t have access to medication since I was at work. My job is auditing paperwork, and I frequently lost track of what I was doing and wasn&#39;t even sure where I was. I went to the bathroom at one point, and I kept sitting at my desk questioning whether I was even at my desk and not still in the bathroom. I became so anxious that around 8:30 am, I talked to my boss and she told me that I could go home if I felt I needed to. I finished my task and around 9:10 am, I left work and went home. I still feel strange and am scared that I won&#39;t feel any better tomorrow.

This feeling lasted about 2 hours and went away. As the initial shock to my body wore off, the soreness of my injection arm intensified. I was unable to put pressure on that arm by sleeping on that side or even touching the arm for a short time. This arm soreness lasted another 12-18 hours before disappearing completely. No medications or other treatments were administered to alleviate the soreness.

                                                I had a sore arm for roughly two days after the shot which isn?t a biggie.  But the day after I got it I experienced a high fever and vomiting which has continued and this is the 3rd after the vaccine. I?ve been incapacitated due to the nausea. It?s the worst in the morning and gets some what better throughout the day.

After 15 minutes I was told I was fine to leave, so I left and headed home. Almost halfway home my throat began to feel swollen and tighter, like a rock was in it. My lips and face continued to itch and tingle. My face also was bright red. I have experienced anaphylaxis before, and was on Bactrim for days before I had the reaction. I waited it out to see if I needed to go to the hospital, but felt I was okay. The next couple days however I still felt like there was a rock in my throat and it was still a little tight, but no longer itchy or feeling hard to swallow so I didn&#39;t take myself in.

                                                The pain at the injection site spread to my entire bicep. The pain prevents me from raising my arm due to the pain but i was able to raise my arm to shoulder height. Originally if I did not move my arm I had minimal to no pain but with movement, it was 7-8/10. I took 1000mg Tylenol at the start of the pain. while sleeping I could not lay on the arm and could not have it in certain positions without having pain. The next day (4/15/21) I began having pain even while resting but it was only 2-3/10 and with movement became 8-9/10.  I could only move my arm up around 30 degrees before it would stop moving and the pain became severe. I took 1500mg of Tylenol with minimal relief. Additionally, I took a hot shower which helped in the shower but the pain returned. That night I could not find any position that did not hurt my arm and my sleep was impacted due to the pain. Today even with no movement, I am experiencing the pain of 6/10 and with movement 9-10/10. I have less range of motion than I did previosuly. I took an Epsom salt bath which helped the pain but then returned when I got out. i can now barely move my arm without it stopping. I have taken 1000mg of Tylenol with no relief.

Patient came about with 30 seconds, moderate hyperventilating, and with clammy sweat, unaware of where abouts.  Monitored patient for 30 minutes, but she did go home after re-attempting to work once again (got a ride from family).

I called the pharmacy and they told me to see a doctor to make sure I wasn&#39;t sick. Today, 4/22, I was tested for covid-19 and flu a and b and they were both negative. I&#39;m still feeling under the weather. My symptoms have included: increased asthma like symptoms, increased allergy like symptoms such as increased sinus irritation, mucus, and sinus bleeding, fatigue, feeling feverish and achy without having an actual fever, irritation at bottom of throat that sometimes causes coughing, stiffness, slight dizziness/fogginess

                                                Within 24 hours of receiving the second does of Moderna I immediately started experiencing adverse reaction.  I work as a PA and had to go home early the day after receiving the second does with flu like symptoms; chills, aches and pains.  Later in the day I immediately started experiencing blood in my urination and ulcers within my vagina.  I do not have any form of an STD.  I went to Urology and discovered six kidney stones.  I am in tremendous health and exercise daily.  I have never had issues with my kidneys.  Lastly, I had a rash on my arm with first and second dose.

                                                I felt very floaty immediately after getting the vaccine, for about three hours after. About six hours later, I was in extreme pain that came on suddenly. My uterus had stabbing pain, and then my lower back did as well. About an hour later, I had nerve pain in my hands, legs, neck, feet, and my buttock cheeks. Everything was on fire. I honestly thought I was dying for a while there. I had a fever, and then my back started to ache like I had the flu, on top of the fire pain. I couldn&#39;t sleep much that entire night, for eight hours I laid there and it was excruciating; I thought that night would never end. I couldn&#39;t find a comfortable position all night, no matter which side of my body I slept on. The next day, it was a tiny bit better. On the first day I would say it was a 10/10 pain (10 being the highest), and this next day it was a 6/10. I still had uterus pain, and back pain, as well as a fever. I was in a brain fog, it was hard to think. I was extremely weak, I couldn&#39;t get out of bed, I had to do my college class in bed. Yesterday, it was about a 2/10 pain, it still lingered. I&#39;ve been taking Tylenol every 6 hours, so it definitely kept breaking my fever. I will still take one or two today. Today, the pain is about 1/10. It is still slightly there in my back and uterus. I am in a brain fog, it is hard to think, and I am still weak. There is no way I will get a booster of this shot next year.

Change tampons  after 2-3 hours of wearing them. Rest of cycle is light.  (After Vacation) Day:1-spotting , light cramping. Day:2- very heavy flow, needing multiple super tampons. Cramps are painful-needed a painkiller.   I had to leave work because of the bleeding and pain. Uncharacteristic of me. I haven?t had to ask to leave my job because of something like this before.  Last month was a little heavier than usual but I didn?t think much of it. This month is just really bad.

                                                The day after the vaccine I started to have high blood pressure. I was monitored by the OB Triage. I was advised not to work any more. I was having a lot of back pain two weeks later. I delivered five weeks early on 02/11/2021. I went into preterm labor three weeks after I got the second dose of the vaccine. My water broke five weeks early.  After the delivery  I was very sick because it was not evident that I had Placenta Accreta and the Placenta was improperly attached. I had unknowingly retained part of the Placenta. The baby was also born with a heart defect but I got pregnant within  a few weeks before the first dose of the vaccine. I had an infection and needed a blood transfusion. DUE DATE-03/17/2021 Pregnancy -First

                                                Since starting the vaccination series for covid, my menstrual period which is regulated by my medication Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo was irregular. It started a few days late after vaccination. I have not stopped bleeding since. It has been nearly 2 months of continuous bleeding resembling a menstrual period that just won&#39;t stop. Some days it is just spotting, others it is heavy. I have felt lethargic, low-energy, mentally foggy because of this. I have experienced menstrual cramps during this time as well.

The first 2.5 weeks following the first dose, I had a lot of fatigue, brain fog, lightheadedness could not stand or walk for longer than 4/5 minutes and even these, I was seriously fatigued and needed to sit down right away. Finally after 3 weeks, the brain fog and fatigue went away gradually. However, my lightheadedness has continued, now at 6 weeks post first dose. I had the second dose which barely had any side effects. I can stand for longer and walk about .25 mile but after that I start to feel lightheaded and not in control of walking. It is affecting my daily life.

At this time I took Tylenol. With the fever came a head ache. My injection sight is very painful. I did not sleep very well. When I woke up at 7:00AM my fever was 100 degrees. It has stayed at 100 degrees until this point (1:30 PM). My headache became painful enough that I took 2 excedrin that have relieved most of the headache. My symptoms are improving as the day progresses. My injection site is still very painful. With the normal flu vaccine I get yearly I have never had any problems.

                                                12/29/2020- Received the Moderna Vaccine - no pain or problems until 01/04/2021 01/04/2021- Before bedtime my injection site from the Moderna Vaccine became itchy.  01/05/2020- Woke up to a swollen arm (about 3 times the size of my right arm) and the start of a rash (the size of a softball) Was in significant pain and unable to lift my arm. I called the nurse hotline where I received the vaccine. I was told to go to the ER immediately. The ER doctor informed me that they had been seeing this and that their personal vaccine location swelled up as well but went away a few days later. ER doctor gave me Benadryl cream (I can not ingest Benadryl due to an opposite reaction, I become extremely anxious.) The ER doctor informed me that the Benadryl cream wouldn&#39;t cause the same reaction. I was sent home with the cream and a wrap. Upon arriving home my rash grew exponentially over the following days. The site became hot (even after icing it) It remained itchy and painful.  01/11/2021- Went to primary care doctor. The rash and swelling had decreased although you could still see the ring of the rash. At this point, my hand was becoming numb after doing daily activities including typing. My palm and thumb area started to turn purplish/blueish when I would type for less than 20 seconds. The doctor told me they would start to reach out to other providers and figure out how to best move forward. In the meantime, there wasn&#39;t much to do besides wait and see what happens.  01/13/2021- Woke up throughout the night due to continued pain at the injection site. Called the primary care doctor who wasn&#39;t in the office, waited for a call back from their nurse but due delayed call back and  increased pain and numbness went to urgent care (which is under the same practice as primary care). The urgent care doctor performed tests regarding pinched nerve shoulder (as they believed I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder) and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed tissue damage but nothing else. I was not experiencing shoulder pain, although during one of the shoulder tests I found more discomfort in my left should (injection arm) than my right arm. Therefore, the primary care doctor thought I was experiencing a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  01/14/2021 - Primary care doctor called and informed me they had spoken with the infectious disease doctor in the area who informed them that they have been seeing a similar reaction amongst other people. (7 days after inject, swelling and rash) The infectious disease doctor reported they hadn&#39;t seen numbness. The primary care doctor advised me to wait 2 weeks to see how symptoms change before performing additional tests. The primary care doctor also advised me after speaking with the infectious disease doctor to not take the second shot.  01/16/2021- still experiencing issues with daily functioning. Still experiencing numbness in hand and arm. Still experiencing redness around the injection site (although much better still flairs up at moments)   Side note: 01/03/2021 - Went cross country skiing, did fall backwards but did NOT fall on arm.  Also confusion remains if  I was supposed to report this or if the primary care doctor/ER doctor reported this, therefore, urgent care doctor told me to report this reaction.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

Attempted to walk around at 10 AM, pounding headache was a 10/10 pain scale when upright. Nausea set in as soon as I was standing, ran to lay down to avoid vomiting. At 10:30 AM I sat up attempted to drink water and the vomiting began. Severe vomiting for about 30 minutes, then intermittent vomiting throughout the day until 6 PM. Headache did not let up all day, no response to medication (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, rizatriptan, magnesium). Headache subsided around 8 PM and  I was able to sleep. No symptoms today 1/22/21.

                                                Within 1.5 hours, I started getting a bad headache.  She was not hungry, was nauseated and was becoming clammy.  She tried to eat but it did not make it better.  When she got home, she continued to feel &#34;really bad like she was getting over the flu.&#34;  She slept for over 10 hours.  When she got up, she could not move her arm and her arm was sore at the injection (it was hard, a little swelling but was not red).  Then she started feeling worse with bad pain (like she had a stroke).  This was around 12 noon to 1 PM on 1/21/21.  Around 7 PM that night, she presented to the ER.  The ER doctor said he thought she was having a migraine but she has never had one before.  Her blood pressure was high at 127/110.  Her supervisor walked into the room and said her face was pulling and it looked like a stroke to her.  She reported severe pain from her ear to her neck on the right side of her head.  She left due to having to provide care to her newborn.  She went to hospital on 1/21/21 about 2100.   Her blood pressure was still high and she had a heart rate of 120 bpm.  She did lab work and CT scan.   ER doctor believed she was experience Bell&#39;s Palsy and that she had had a mini-seizure.  She provided prednisone 60 mg X 1 dose, Valtrex tid and shot of Toradol.  She prescribed Toradol for outpatient pain relief.

                                                After receiving moderna vaccine administration, we requested pt to wait at least 30 minutes prior to leaving the pharmacy. After 30 minutes, we came back to give the pt her vaccination card and as soon as she stood up, she fell slowly onto the floor and started having seizure (pt didn&#39;t hit her head per technician on scene) around 3:50 pm and became unconscious for a few seconds. She was able to answer our questions when she woke up, but was confused of where she at. She continued to call out random names.  We called the ambulance and assisted her while she was on the floor.  She had another seizure 5 minutes after the first seizure and became unconscious again for a few more seconds. After she woke up, we placed her on her side and monitored her pulse rates and her breathing while on the phone with 911 personnel.  The paramedic came 10 mins after the call. Pt had a history of seizure (she wore epileptic tag around her neck). Pt was taken by paramedic to the nearest hospital for further observation.

                                                I received the second dose of my Moderna covid vaccine at 10 am on Wednesday February 3rd. Around 8:30 pm I experienced extreme chills and had a 100-101 F fever all night. I woke in the morning still feeling weak because I spent the whole night uncomfortable from the fever and flushed  face I had. I walked towards another part of my house and fell down and fainted. I was unconscious for a few seconds before a family member was able to shake me and wake me up. I take no medications and am a generally healthy individual with no prior medical history or underlying Heath conditions. I also do not have a history of falls or issues from taking any past vaccines. I also am not allergic to anything or have experienced any allergic reactions in my life. It?s the second day now and I am still experiencing a 100 Degree fever and face flushing. I am currently self medicating at home with Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not gone to see a health care professional yet.

Tylenol seemed to help her fussiness during the day.  I am still experiencing side effects 7 days later including muscle aches, fatigue, weakness, headache, and nausea. I was evaluated at a local ED and all lab work was normal, covid test was negative.

These symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes and then they resolved. I did not have any of these symptoms since it initially happened on 1.8.21 at 230am. I did not seek medical care at the time since my symptoms resolved. I did contact my doctor on 2.1.2021 about this and he stated the symptoms I described aligned with symptoms of a panic attack, but if I felt it was related to the vaccine that I can report it.

                                                Received around 2pm on Friday, 1/15/21. Not sure exactly when this started, but noticed redness around injection site  that evening around 8pm, mildly itchy. Also felt a little bit tachycardic and anxious about 2 hrs after (4pm Friday) for 15-30 mins, but I think that may have been lack of sleep and my own nerves! But redness persisted at injection site, and had intermittent hives around injection site (smaller area within area of redness, about silver dollar sized hive area intermittently), noticed probably 5x over the next 8 days (last had hives on 1/23 PM, 8 days after). Hives were sort of raised white weals with red border. Redness persisted and began to resolve at around 10 days s/p shot, fully resolved by about 12 days s/p shot. Also seemed to have decreased appetite over that time, but also could be totally unrelated with stress

                                                Received my first vaccine 1/6/2021. I was very nervous about the vaccine, so I brought 4 epi-pens with me. My PCP and allergist advised me to sit x30 minutes after the shot. 25 minutes after receiving the shot, I felt very warm.  I looked at my hands and they were fire-cracker red in color. I began doffing my sweatshirt and my arms/neck/stomach and back were had a spotty rash. There was no hives/areas of elevation.  Nurses took my BP.  40 minutes without medication, rash and warmth resolved. A few hours later, I had a terrible headache and then around 8pm, I started with bad aches, chills, fever of 101. I took tylenol and did not resolved. The next AM, symptoms continued. I took advil and this had a better effect with sx resolving. My second dose, I received on 2/5/2021. I had a similar response about 10 minutes after the shot but warmth/reddness did not last as long, ~5-10 minutes. Had my BP taken, which was elevated (probably from my own anxiety). a few hours after the shot, I began with the headache, chills and fever--- though all mild. fever was 99 degrees the next day. 2/8/2021, I felt very fatigued and weird for a few hours. this seem to pass and I have felt normal since; just very tired. *** additionally, I did have COVID-19, testing positive 11/11/2020. my sx were mild compared to others.

                                                Before going to bed on 2/11/21 I noticed I had a red raised bump at the injection site that was tender. On the morning of 2/12/21, I awoke feeling achy and lethargic, almost like a hang-over from drinking. As I started to move around and do tasks for my morning I started to get an intense headache, fevers avg. 103&#43;, and began napping intermittently from noon until 5 PM. I still felt achy, but didn?t take anything besides water and ate dark chocolate to help with my headache.  The redness on my arm continued to spread and ache. I went to bed at 9 PM mostly with body aches and my fevers remained consistently around 103. I woke hourly between midnight and 8 AM on 2/13 and around 3:30 AM I noticed my body aches had gone away. My fevers remained and my headache continued to intensify. When I got out of bed around 8 AM I tried to watch TV and cried when the volume turned on since the noise was too harsh for my head. I couldn?t do sounds the rest of the day and had intensifying headaches and neck pain throughout the day. I lost all color in my face and was able to move around but felt miserable. I tried eating my first meal since 2/11, chicken noodle soup and felt nauseous afterwards. I went to bed around 9 PM and slept in 3 hour increments drinking water and sips of Coke Zero each time I woke up. At 6:30 AM on 2/14 I was so fed up with feeling miserable I decided to take 3 Advil 200 mg liquid gels and slept soundly from 6:30 AM-11:30 AM. I awoke feeling refreshed and mostly better. I hadn?t been eating so I tried an orange and felt good enough to do work for a few hours until I felt neck pain and tension around my temples again around 2:30 PM. I took 2 Tylenol 500 mg gel caps and left my house for the first time since 2/11 around 5 PM. The outing went well, but around 9:30 I could Feel pain coming on again so I took 1 200 mg Advil and got ready for bed. The redness on my arm has grown rather large so I drew boarders around it to see if it continues to spread. It is still bright red and tender. I didn?t sleep very soundly but am still feeling intermittent headaches and have to keep up with my nsaid/ Tylenol pain relief to function.

                                                Began with extreme fatigue. Within a couple of hours developed shortness of breath walking up stairs (never an issue prior) and palpitations. 01/26-walked to my gyno appointment two blocks away. After 20 minutes of rest had elevated blood pressure of 148/90, never had an issue w/ blood pressure. Woke up everyday with palpitations, shortness of breath and a headache that would last 10-15 minutes (not similar to any of my previous migraines). My palpitations and shortness of breath worsened over time and I started to feel them while lying flat or even slight movements such as standing up. My fatigue was pretty unbearable. I would need to take several naps a day and even then I never felt fully rested. I received my 2nd dose 02/27 and my symptoms increased in frequency and intensity. I was having more episodes a day and even walking within my own home I was out of breath. I went to the hospital and they were not able to find a cause for immediate danger so I was sent home. Originally they thought possible autoimmune issue such as Rheumatoid arthritis or lupus (prior to my RF, C-proteins and sedimentation rate results). My symptoms worsened from that visit; I began experiencing episodes of light headedness, brain fog, almost loss of consciousness, numbness in hands, muscle weakness, joint pain in knee, ankles and wrists. I am at a point now where even talking I can get out of breath or while showering I have difficulty breathing. Recently my brain fogs have become more frequent and noticeable. I have started seeing a cardiologist and am getting echo, exercise test and had a halter monitor placed, but still waiting on the results. During that visit the cardiologist noticed a slight aortic murmur, which was not present prior to this situation  This is has been completely debilitating to the point where I am on temporary leave from medical school.

                                                I sat down and I felt hot and got a little flushing. I experienced paresthesia - tingling of my finger - I only get that as a stress reaction or when one of my nerves is pinched so I thought one of my nerves got pinched when they gave me my vaccine. Had it for about 5 minutes and I kept wiggling my fingers. It only happened on my left hand (and not both hands as normal). I was tired and had insane drowsiness. I went home and took a nap. My arm was pretty sore. I think I took  a Norco. Drowsiness was severe the next morning - couldn&#39;t get out of bed. It impaired me so much I couldn&#39;t go to work. It felt almost flu-like - my body was sore and I felt cold. I didn&#39;t have chills but I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the blankets. I didn&#39;t leave my bed until Monday and I took acetaminophen. I called my doctor and she asked me to take a COVID test - tested negative. I went to work the next day but didn&#39;t feel good. Fatigue went away in just under a week.  Cold sweats -  I started having these on Sunday, the 17th. And they still reoccur every now and then - and those never had occurred for me before the vaccine. Where I wake up drenched in sweat. I don&#39;t feel feverish but when I walk out of bed I am cold.

                                                Approximately 30-45 minutes after consuming a dessert that had coconuts, I started having an allergic reaction. While coconuts are tree nuts, I&#39;ve never had an allergic reaction to them. My face and neck were very red and dotted but weren&#39;t raised like traditional hives. They looked more like petechiae. I started coughing and my lips started to swell mildly but this reaction didn&#39;t match the speed, severity, or overall symptoms of past experience with analyphylaxis to peanuts (which required 3 shots of epinephrine at urgentcare). After I realized I was having a reaction, it took another 45 minutes to get to a  to get and take benadryl (was on vacation at the time). I was lightheaded and lost my balance and while I wasn&#39;t personally concerned my friends urged me to go to the hospital to get checked out. I was given steroids in pill form and put under observation for about 3-4 hours then released with a prescription for an epipen and 5 days of steroids. Several days after this ordeal I had an endometriosis flare up (which I expected post vaccine) as well as migraines and mental fog that lasted for about a week. I also experienced significant hair fall that week as well.

Patient did not appear to be in respiratory distress, but she was started on 2L oxygen via face mask and emergency medical services was called. Paramedics came and evaluated her. Once oxygen was stopped, their pulse oximeter read 98%. They took the patient away via ambulance.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine i began experiencing dizziness, blurry vision, and numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. At the vaccination center they monitored my vitals and made me lie down for 30-40 mins after which i felt much better. Then I took the train home.  After getting to my apartment I lay down for a while and when i tried to get up i was very disoriented. I felt extremely dizzy, numbness and tingling was in my whole arms and legs and even my back. it felt like my skin was burning from the inside. Around 4 i began calling the university health center and covid hotlines because i wasn&#39;t feeling well at all. During this time i also experienced twitching of my face, hands and feet and a period of confusion - i wasn&#39;t able to keep the conversation with my nurse and tell her what my symptoms were. I also had trouble verbalizing. I was told to take Tylenol and ibuprofen. i took them but the fever came back.  Severe Stomach pain and nausea  I had fever till 4/2 - the highest temperature was 102.4 late in the night on 4/1.  on 4/2 i ended up having to call the healthcare again, they thought i should go to the ER, Then i went to urgent who sent me to ER. At the ER i was told this was an extreme reaction due to the vaccine. They monitored me for a few hours and gave me Tylenol and anti-nausea medication and doctors note to rest till 4/5.

Around 11am on the 13th, I began to experience a fever (of 101 degrees), chills, intense body aches, headache, nausea, and fatigue. At night, I had night sweats and could barely sleep. It&#39;s now the morning of the 14th and I still have the fever, body aches, and pain in upper right arm. The rest of the symptoms seem to have subsided. For background, I had COVID-19 in March of 2020, so I am wondering if that is why I had such an adverse reaction to this first vaccine dose.

I experienced swelling and inflammation on my left arm after receiving the vaccine that subsided over the course of a week.   8 days later, when I was feeling better, I did a one hour pilates workout at home, and my vaccine site turned red after and started swelling up again with itchy blotchy spots. The next morning (today) the blotchy spots were larger and starting to connect with each other. Extremely itchy. I will avoid working out and hope the reaction goes away instead of continuing to get worse.

                                                I got my covid 19 vaccine shot (Moderna) on 4/15/2021 on my left arm around 11:30AM After the vaccine I felt a discomfort, disoriented &amp; very sleepy &amp; tired. I slept, when I woke up that same evening I felt my neck &amp; my arm, all my of left side really hurt, a lot of muscle aching from my neck down to my arm, also my left ear hurt too.  I couldn?t sleep for long on the night of 4/15/2021 because of the muscle discomfort. I woke up on the morning of 4/16/2021 &amp; my arm &amp; neck was feeling a little better. Towards the afternoon I started to feel this aching on my middle part of my neck &amp; mid way of my back then towards the evening my left arm was way better but now the pain was on my right side of my neck &amp; arm, almost like the pain transition over to the other side. I couldn?t sleep at all on the night of 4/16/2021 because the pain &amp; muscle aching was now on the right side of my neck &amp; arm.  On the morning of 4/17/2021 I am still aching a lot when moving my neck left to right &amp; right to left and moving it in anyway it hurts a lot. My muscles on my neck &amp; arm ache a lot. I had to take time off work due to the vaccine date and recovery 4/15 4/16.

I think because I was panicking at some point it was hard to breath. I laid on the floor for a while until I felt better. My pressure was taken and it was 150/90. I felt dizzy and lightheaded the rest of the day.   At night and the next day I had a joint pain and a sore throat. I got a mild fever at night the next day and on the third day I just had a sore throat.

                                                On Saturday, 11 hours (10:30pm) after the injection my arm was extremely sore. There was a sharp pain in my underarm whenever I tried to move it. On Sunday morning, 19 hours  (6:21am) after my injection I experienced severe stomach cramps they woke me up out of my sleep. These stomach pains were constant ranging from a pain of 6 to 9.  I threw up three times. Each time I vomited was preceded by stomachaches that reach up to a 9. Each time was hours apart. I was extremely hot so I needed the turn the AC on and I slept in front of a fan. Sometimes I put on a cool rag on my face. At night around 8pm. I started having diarrhea.  Whenever I had to go I would have severe stomachaches at a 9. Sometimes I would have to vomit while have an episode of diarrhea. During the day I had back, and hip pain that made me constantly toss from one side to the other to get comfortable. Day 2 (Monday), the cramps lessoned they ranged from a 2-4 on average. They were not as constant. I was still hot but not like on day one. I kept the house cold but I could sleep without the additional fan. I no longer had explosive diarrhea however I did have to wear a pad. I continued to leak. Which is something I&#39;ve never experienced before. Day 2 I still had very low energy. Day 3. I feel a lot better. I have occasional cramps and still occasional leaking. My energy is better but still lower than my usual.

                                                UTI and then diagnosed with HSV-1 after outbreak occurred around my genitals. I developed what I thought was just a UTI on Thursday and was prescribed the medication to treat that. For the next few days I was sore, had body aches, and chills. On Sunday I noticed the outbreak on my labia and went into Urgent Care to diagnose it. I haven&#39;t been aware of any HSV-1 in my system, but somehow I ended up getting HSV-1 all around my genitals. On Sunday i was prescribed Valacyclovir. I was in intense pain when using the restroom for both urinating and bowel movements. I went to my primary care doctor on Monday to have a second opinion and found the same answers. I missed work for two days due to the pain I was in and my inability to walk. I then had to work from home the rest of the week. My partner has been tested and does not have HSV-1 or 2.

Symptoms worsen with: eating, staying vertical for longer than a few minutes, exercise, not enough sleep, dehydration. Symptoms improve with: increased fluid intake (&gt;4.5L/day of Gatorade), increased salt intake &amp; rest/laying down.  Symptoms have forced me to quit working as an ICU nurse and move home with my parents.  I am now awaiting an appointment with a dysautonomia specialist out of town.

Within 10-30 minutes, I got very very dizzy and there was pain (but I can&#39;t remember where, maybe it was a headache). Soon after, I fainted for a few minutes and when I woke up, I felt VERY nauseous. I ended up vomiting 5-10 minutes after. Twice. Then I think I had a fever and chills so I proceeded to sleep it off. It was hard to sleep because my head just felt off (not sure how to describe it). The following days have been better, but still not feeling 100%. Head feels a little weird, but for the most part, feeling okay.

                                                The next night after receiving vaccination I began to feel body aches with a low grade fever. My baby who was breastfeeding spiked a low grade temp as well. The following day I continued with body aches, low grade temp, headache and I was very lightheaded almost in a &#34;fog&#34; type state to the point I did not feel comfortable to even drive. I had taken no medication until 12/24/2020. I took one dose of I believe Tylenol and the low grade temp and body aches subsided. I did continue with headaches for the next couple days that would come and go. When the pain came on it would come on quickly and then subside. A few days after holiday I tested positive for covid-19.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

                                                First dose of Moderna vaccine received on 1/11/21 Monday on my right arm. The following day 1/12/21 Tuesday I started having itchy rashes on my left ear, along with right arm soreness. The rash on my left ear gradually progressed and spread as days go by until 1/15/21 Friday. I woke up with swollen ears, hives on my face, neck, chest, and upper body. On Saturday morning 1/16/21, my symptoms worsen with more itchy red rashes. On top of the rashes, my lymph node on my left neck felt swollen and tender. Also, I had a weird sensation in my throat that was not going away like something was stuck. After a TeleVisit, I went to the ER that day and got medical treatment. I was given Benadryl, Pepcid, Dexamethasone and IV fluids. Then I was sent home with Cephalexin, Prednisone, Benadryl, and Epi Pen. Right now, I still have symptoms of rashes on my face, ears, and chest but they wax and wane. I can feel it itching beneath my skin even if they are not showing. With my ears, I can say that they are not swollen and are less red now. I have no other known exposure but the Moderna vaccine. I do not have any known allergy either but to bee stings.

Symptoms stopped Sunday 24th around 9am.  I was unable to do daily tasks, stayed in bed all day. Did not seek medical attention due to these being listed as possible symptoms to the vaccine and told they would pass in a day or two.

                                                I am a MD student who got the first dose of the moderna vaccine on 1/4/2021. I had no immediate reaction other than arm soreness. A couple weeks after my first vaccine, I had a reaction when drinking miralax. Within ~5 minutes of having a few sips of a 17g solution, I had throat tingling/tightening, sense of impending doom, cough, dyspnea, nausea, fecal urgency, and intense chills with shivering. I stopped drinking the solution and my symptoms eventually resolved on their own (the chills and nausea took the longest, about 1.5 hours) - I didn&#39;t even think to take benadryl because it wasn&#39;t clear to me at the time if I was really having an allergic reaction (no hives, no vomiting - but in retrospect I&#39;m concerned). I&#39;ve had miralax in the past without any issues. I&#39;ve never had a vaccine adverse reaction. I have no history of atopy.

That next morning I woke up and took a hot bath, which helped with the pain. I continued to have pain throughout the day, as well as fatigue. The second day after the shot the pain was gone, but I noticed I had a rash around the injection site, about 2 inches wide by 3 inches long.

I usually have a little pain at the site of the injection but this was WAY worse which resulted in me icing the area and taking Ibuprofen. I also could not apply any pressure on the site so I had to make sure I only slept on my right side overnight. The intensity of the pain was MUCH better the next day, and today (2 days later) it is very bearable.  I also experienced lethargy the first evening after receiving the vaccine, but that went away the next day.  On the second evening since receiving the vaccine, I started to experience body chills and some minor body aches. I felt a sense of general malaise that I often experience when sick.

                                                I got the vaccine approx 10:10am yesterday. About 4 hours post-vaccine, I developed severe pain in my left arm which limited flexion and adduction. I started to become nauseous, but initially thought this was due to pain. Once I returned home from work, at approximately 5 PM, I started to develop chills and a worsening headache. After taking acetaminophen, I took my temperature and found it was 101.5. This remained all night, and I had a difficult time sleeping, waking with chills, sweats and Aching in my joints. Today, I took off from work and slept all day, waking occasionally with the sweats. My fever began to go down slowly and is now approx 99.7 with use of fever reducers every 6 hours. Headache is still present. I anticipate these will dissipate in another day or two.

Approximately 5 minutes after receiving Epi, her breathing slowed down and symptoms began to fade. She was transported via ambulance per protocol.

I then noticed that I couldn&#39;t get warm and started taking my temperature every half hour. The highest it got was 101.6 at 11:30pm that night. I couldn&#39;t sleep, so after eating some soup and talking one Tylenol PM, I did finally get to sleep. The next morning, my temperature was 98.6 and I felt perfectly fine. Summary of symptoms -cough -heaviness in the chest -body chills (was still cold in a really hot shower) -fever of 101.6  -fatigue -duration: only lasted for one evening from about 6pm until I woke up the next morning feeling just fine

                                                After receiving the vaccine in right arm on 1/13 I had injection site pain and an severe upset stomach until 1/19. I was fatigued from 1/13 until 1/24. On Friday Jan 15 the pain in my injection site improved, but the pain moved to my right collar bone and right side of neck muscles. On Jan 16 the pain returned to the injection site and increasingly got worse in my collar bone and neck. The pain continued to worsen and become intolerable on 1/20. On 1/20 I was having pain in my injection site, collar bone, neck muscles, and my throat was sore and hurt to swallow. I went to the ER . After going to the ER and waiting for medications to be ready at the pharmacy the pain moved into my ear and I had a severe ear ache for two days. My symptoms improved after 2 days with ibuprofen 3x/day, muscle relaxers 3x/ day, Benadryl and lidocaine patches. The pain was localized to the right side of body and did limit the ability to complete ADLs

Around 6:00 pm, I measured my temperature and it was 95.0 degrees Fahrenheit. I could not get warm for and experienced tingling and numbness in first my feet, then arms and hands, and finally my face. This passed and I was left feeling nauseous and still extremely cold. After tossing and turning for most of the night, so of these side effects have resolved, but I have a splitting headache and muscle and joint pain throughout my body. No treatment has been undertaken. Some side effects have resolved while others continue.

The following day, 1/6/21, saw a PA for the blisters and hives due to the itchiness and hydrocortisone was not helping.  Then had a headache, body aches and flushes for at least a week.  She did have shortness of breath and by the weekend she was feeling confused like the feeling of waking up from anesthesia.  She started loosing her balance, could not go up the stairs, trip and fall.  They did lab work, told her that she was fine.  She was having confusion and forgetful and let it run it&#39;s course.  She did have the 2nd vaccine, but is still having hot flushes from it.

By the time she got home on 2/3/21 she felt nauseous, had temp of 101.8.  The whole night she pretty much swim in sweat.  She went to work and was sent home due to the fever, nonstop sweating, and fatigue feeling like she was going to pass out.  Around 12:00 PM on 2/4/21 she couldn&#39;t keep anything down, she lost 5# since this vaccine.   She took an Ibuprofen 800 which didn&#39;t do much.  She took Pepto-Bismol, Advil and could not hold anything down.   The brain pounding headache that didn&#39;t want to go away yesterday.  She is still having a headache, she feels like every step she takes she has to use the restroom due to diarrhea episodes.  She has been at home trying to sleep through the symptoms and has not seen a doctor as when she called with her first vaccine reactions they did not have any information to tell her since the side effects are so new.  She only gets up today only when she has to use the restroom.  She has been in the bed since she went home on 2/3/21.

                                                Felt fine other than a sore arm until around 2200 the day of the vaccine. I then started to have extreme chills, body aches, a headache, nausea, fatigue, weakness, and dizziness/brain fog. I also had a fever of up to 102 F. When I started to feel bad I did take some ibuprofen and tylenol to try to relieve some of the symptoms. They started to get better around 0600, but I still felt achy, tired, and had chills until the following morning (48 hours after the vaccine). In addition, my arm became sore to the point that it has kept me awake at night, has woken me up multiple times per night, and makes my arm almost useless. I physically can&#39;t move it certain ways without severe excruciating pain. It&#39;s not normal IM injection soreness, it feels like pain in the bone/nerves of my arm. I do not have any redness or warmth but my arm was slightly swollen for about 3 days. It has been over a week now since my injection and I am still having pain, although as of today it is beginning to improve. I called my local hospital and they said they couldn&#39;t help me and I didn&#39;t need to come in for evaluation unless I had redness/warmth (signs of infection)

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received my first COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna) on January 31st, 2021. About 2 hours later, I had moderate-extreme pain in my left arm (couldn&#39;t raise my arm). About 4-6 hours later, I had side effects such as a red, raised rash near the shot (about, 3-4 inches in diameter), fever (99 degrees), swollen painful lymph nodes under arm pit (left arm) and fatigue. On February 1st, 2021, I continued to have pain in my arm, rash and swollen lymph nodes for about 48 hours. After that, my rash was then no longer visible. No medication was taken for symptoms.  On February 7th, I noticed in the morning that my rash near the shot came back (same location) with no other signs or symptoms. The rash was now red and flat (not raised).  On February 8th, around the 4:00PM my head felt heavy (sort of like a head cold), fatigue, loss of appetite, stuffy nose, fever (100-101 degrees). I took an Advil that night at about 10:00PM (first time taking medication to treat symptoms).  On February 9th, in the morning my symptoms (fever, fatigue, stuffy nose) were gone. My rash mostly went away in the morning (still slightly visible). My appetite in the morning seemed to return but I felt slightly nauseous after eating breakfast. Around noon, my nausea dissipated, I felt fatigued and had a fever of 101.6. I took Motrin at about 5:00PM and my fever dissipated. That night, at about 10:00PM I went to bed and was unable to sleep at all that night (extremely unusual as I don?t have any problems sleeping). I felt my fever came back at about 11:00PM but tried to go without the Motrin until about 3:00AM. I checked my temperature at 3:00AM which was 101.9 degrees. Due to feeling extremely uncomfortable I took the Motrin at that time. My fever dissipated again and I was able to get maybe a couple hours of sleep.   On February 10th, I woke up with no appetite, joint pain in my elbow of my left arm (no history of injury) and a fever of about 100 degrees at 11:00AM. I had a very small breakfast at about 11:00AM. I haven?t felt hungry since 4:00PM today, consistent with a loss of appetite. Currently, I?m checking my temperature about every hour or so and have been going back and forth between 100-101 degrees. My elbow joint pain on my left arm has only started today and it has only flared up in the morning and then the afternoon. I took another Motrin today at 6:00PM and will take another tablet of Motrin before bed to get rest. I am scheduled to do an e-visit with a doctor tomorrow morning.

The fever went away that night but I still felt very fatigued for the next 3 days. By Wednesday, I was feeling better but still had some heart palpatations/racing heart. But Thursday, I was feeling good enough to go for a short run/walk, but Friday I woke up  feeling fatigue, nausea and headache again. My body does not feel strong enough to do simple things like walks outside. This morning i woke up with slight headache and a feeling that is hard to describe, but mainly fatigue and slight nausea.

                                                I had arm soreness the day of the vaccine (2/11/21). The following day I noticed an erythematous round lesion that was very tender and when palpated felt like a lump. The pain went away 2-3 days after the vaccine and the erythema/lump went away on 2/21/21. On 2/19/21 my left internal arm felt sore. I thought I pulled a muscle perhaps. On 2/21/21 the arm pain was worse and didn&#39;t feel like typical soreness that would come from exercise or sleeping in the wrong position. It was painful when I pulled my arm close to my body, as if something were being compressed. I palpated in the armpit and found a large lump slightly smaller than a golf ball. It was extremely tender and sent me into a panic. Someone pointed out it was the same arm as my vaccination, so I looked it up and learned about this side effect. Today (2/22/21), the pain is gone and the lump is smaller (feel like a typical enlarged lymph node).

I am a fitness trainer and RDN, no weight issue, and very high muscle composition, lungs are in excellent health.   Around mid afternoon next day, several hours after teaching an exercise class, I developed a fever and flu like symptoms. That Saturday night, I developed extreme nausea, along with sleep in and out the entire night due to nausea and fever.   This continued until Monday afternoon, over 2 days later. Then the symptoms disappeared in the blink of an eye, indicated it was definitely vaccination related.

                                                at 8am on 02/28/2021 I woke up in pain, feeling  tired and sick. All of my skin, back and spine hurt, in the way that your body is sensitive and extra painful when you have a fever but I checked and I haven&#39;t had a fever yet. All of the day on 02/28/2021 I experienced skin and back pain, headache, fatigue, and brain fog (difficulty focusing and making decisions) as well as swollen and tender lymph nodes in my left armpit and under the left side of my jaw. On 03/01/2021 I woke up and felt better in the morning, I went for a walk around 3 pm and around 4 pm when I got back and sat down I started to experience headache, severe nausea which turned into chest pain and chest tightness and I still have swollen lymph nodes.

                                                I am twenty-eight years old, young, healthy active girl. I have always been into fitness and yoga. I live a generally healthy lifestyle. I have been a singer, a dancer, and a flight attendant! I decided sign up for the COVID-19 vaccine in order to help our world fight against this pandemic. I wanted to protect my family and friends to eradicate this virus once and for all. It was with no hesitation did I jump at the opportunity to get this vaccine when it became available to me on February 12th, 2021 at the Convention Center. As soon as I received my shot I proudly posted my photo with tears in my eyes letting the world know that we were one human closer to a COVID-19 free world. I was Moderna proud.   My entire family had already received their Moderna vaccines because I come from a family of nurses, but none of them had experienced any side effects. I was confident I would be in the clear after their clear symptom free vaccine. Immediately following my vaccine my arm was a little sore, as expected. However, I did experience fatigue and mild leg cramps in my calves. One very odd symptom was that I could taste the vaccine in my mouth, like a metallic, strange taste, which I reported to my family, but everyone just laughed it off. The leg cramps went away after a day or two as well as the taste, but the fatigue continued throughout the week. I felt these symptoms were pretty average. I signed up for the V-Safe reporting system and put in my report and thought nothing of my initial vaccine symptoms.   Things took a very strange turn on the morning of February 20th, 2021 at about 10am. I woke up and my face was numb, tingling all over, twitching in different parts of my face pretty severely and uncontrollably. By 4pm the tingling moved into both of my arms and hands and by 5pm it moved into both of my legs. Shortly after the cramping and twitching began in both of my legs and I lost the ability to walk, lift my legs, and just the ability to feel my legs at all. I could not walk.  Obviously concerning, I thought I was originally having a reaction to a medication I had been taking for over a year called, Topamax, a nerve pain medication which can cause numbness and tingling as a side effect. I called my prescribing physician and he immediately ruled out the possibility of a reaction to this medication due to the length of time I had been on this medication, that I had not missed a dose, I had not increased or decreased the dose, and I had not experienced a reaction like this in the time that I had been taking the medication. He recommended I keep an eye on my symptoms and go to an emergency room if things worsen.   Overnight, my symptoms remained the same. I woke up on Sunday, February 21st, 2021 and I still could not walk, I could not feel my legs. My legs were still twitching and cramping. My face was still numb and tingling, but the twitching had stopped in the face. My hands had stopped tingling. At this point my mother who is a nurse suggested that I call Moderna, the vaccine provider, to report a possible side effect of the vaccine. Upon contacting Moderna, the company thought that it could possibly be a reaction between the Topamax medication and the vaccine, but they had no current information about these two having any interactions. They thanked me for reporting and told me to go to an emergency room if my symptoms continued or worsen.   Throughout the day on Sunday, February 21st, my symptoms remained. I was able to get to my feet, but I walking like a newborn baby giraffe or as my mother described, like a 105 year old woman. I was unable to feel my legs completely, lift them, move them without lifting them with physical help of my arms moving them. At this point on Sunday night I decided to contact my Primary Care Physician. She noted that this sounded similar to Guillain-Barre and that I sound immediately go to an Emergency Department before the symptoms get any worse. It was late on a Sunday night and I was unable to drive myself, so I waited.   Overnight on Sunday into Monday I began experiencing light flashes in my eyes, heart races, lower back pain, and worsening cramping in my legs. I knew that I needed to seek treatment in an emergency room.   On Monday, February 22nd, 2021 I was taken to the Emergency Room Department. They conducted blood work and a physical examination, but did not want to proceed with any MRI?s or CAT scans. The ER the doctors were baffled. They could not figure out what was causing my paralysis other than the vaccine was the only new thing that had been introduced to my body, but they could not verify or diagnose anything. They let me go with a referral to neurology.   While we were sitting in the ER my cousin, a nurse anesthetist at another local hospital, called my mother who was with me with some very alarming news. Her co-worker, had experienced the same symptoms back in December and was just going through recovery after his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He was told by the CDC there had been 19 reported cases through the CDC where after the first dose of the vaccine people have reported numbness, tingling, and the lose of the ability to walk after receiving the first dose of the mRNA vaccine, both Moderna and Pfizer. Her co-worker was also in the same age range as myself, very healthy, young, active. He was officially diagnosed with Transverse Myletis. He has taken a full two months to regain the ability to walk and still has numb patches on his legs. He walks very slowly, but is walking. He returned to work, but cannot return to his normal life working out and being active because he does not have the strength. He was told not to get the second dose of the vaccine.   There are unreported cases in this area by physicians who do not know where to turn with this information. It is hard to link these symptoms and cases because they are so obscure, but these same symptoms are occurring with those who have also had COVID-19. When I was being seen for an EMG test of my legs the physician performing the test said to us, ?I have a patient who received the vaccine and has the symptoms, maybe I should report it!?. My Grandmother?s physician just last week just sent a patient of hers with the same symptoms to neurology. I think this uncommon side effect is more common than is being reported and no one knows where to turn with the information.   I finally got into the head of Neurology. I was told, ?it?ll probably get better?, basically saying that they don?t know what they can do and they are at a loss for knowing what this is and why this is happening to people after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine. Doctors don?t have answers and the vaccine companies aren?t offering information to help link these side effects together. The physician told me not to proceed with the second dose of the vaccine due to neurological side effect that I have had. I should benefit from the first dose and it is not safe for me to get the second dose from this side effect.   I was unable to walk for weeks since this began on Feb. 20th. It is just now that this week I am slowly able to move my legs, but they are still very numb and heavy. I haven?t been able to drive or live my normal life. I cannot use stairs, walk long distances, stand for very long periods of time. I am twenty-eight years old and I walk like an eighty year old woman, wobbly.   I have reported my case to CDC, V-SAFE, Moderna. The CDC said they would be in contact with me due to my report of extreme adverse side effects via the V-SAFE report, but I have not heard anything from them as of today.  These are the uncommon side effects that need to be heard and reported. I don?t know why they are being ignored because I have been left without answers and without hope.

                                                12 hours after receiving the second shot of the vaccine I woke up in pain. My pelvis and legs and ankles ached. As well as my arm at the site of injection. My temp was 99.8. I took  one tylenol around 8:30 am. As the day went on it got worse. I took one tylenol at 10:30 am. I was nauseous, my heart was racing, I felt like I was going to pass out, my arms and legs began to tingle. My temperature peaked at 102.5 around 5pm. All of my joints ached severely. It felt like my pelvis had been crushed. Even laying my knees on top of each other while laying on my side was too much pressure on my knee joints. The only other time I&#39;ve felt like this is when I had Influenza A. At 8:30 pm I took one tylenol and one benadryl and was finally able to sleep. A few hours after taking the medication the joint pain had greatly decreased.  In the morning I no longer had a fever.

Approx 10 am she left the IMZ room and about halfway through the store, she fainted. CSM said the fell outside of patient&#39;s room and did not seem to hit her head or neck. 911 wasn&#39;t called because she came to right away. They got her water and a chair. I was brought over approx 10:10 am. I talked with her and she seemed cognitive, lucid and understands who she is, where she is and what happened. She said she waited the 15 min and felt totally fine but then she got up and fell about halfway through store. Approx 10:20 am we brought her over to pharmacy area for more privacy and RPH checked her BP. reported 130/90. I asked patient if she wanted the paramedics called just in case of a head injury. I asked her before palpating her head and neck. She said she felt no pain, no visible bleeding or lacerations, no inflammation or redness and she has full mobility in her neck with no pain. Patient said she did not want paramedics called and instead called her mother in law who lives nearby to see if they can come get her. She is worried about  40 min drive home. Pt overall physically seemed fine. She was just shaken, nervous and embarrassed as she&#39;s never had something like this happen before. She waited for about 20 mins until her father in law came and picked her up. I updated him of the situation and they left together.

                                                After the second dose of Moderna on 3/20/21 I experienced the expected low grade fever, body aches and chills on Saturday 3/21. The entire week following I had felt exhausted and had GI upset. Thurs day afternoon 3/25 I started to experience some dizziness which was out of the norm for me. On Friday 3/26 I woke up, unable to sit up or stand up without falling over and getting extremely nauseated. Everything was spinning and the only thing I could do was lay down. I took .5mg Ativan and 25mg Meclazine with no effect. After 4 hours of laying down, crawling to the bathroom and kitchen to get some food in, I ended up throwing up. My doctor suggested I go to the ER which I did around 2:45-3pm. I was admitted, an EKG was administered and a CAT scan. I was given IV fluids and 1mg Ativan and more Meclazine. My Vitals were WNL and no issues found iht EKG or CAT scan. I was d/c home around 8pm. I have not experienced any vertigo since but severe anxiety around it.  I believe this was caused by the vaccine as I have never experienced anything this severe before.

I could not walk straight without holding onto something. The nausea lasted all day. Day 2: The nausea came and went, yet the dizziness persisted all day. Day 3: I was feeling okay - not perfect - but improved up until 4pm that day before a work meeting (through Zoom) where the room began to not spin - but see saw, &amp; I became very very hot. Soon after the meeting, I laid down and felt very weak - felt very uncomfortable to stand or sit up. Day 4 (yesterday) only slight nausea here and there, dizziness happens only when I tilt my head in certain directions. Tried the epley maneuver - seemed to help a bit. Day 5 (today) moved my head to the right while sleeping and felt the see-saw feeling again. Currently typing this and my stomach feels unsettled, but not nauseated and heads feels very heavy. I have never experienced Vertigo before this.

Took 3hr naps the next few days. Swelling decreased.  I am now a week out, vaccine forgotten about, and rubbed my arm because it was itchy.  An hour later I find the vaccination site swollen up to about half a golf ball.

Now, approximately 10-12 days after I got the vaccine I have a raised red rash on my left arm.

Pain and discomfort radiated up into the shoulder as well and lasted for approximately 24 hours. Advil helped relieve some of the pain. Felt like an intense pulled muscle, radiating for hours. It was intense enough to interfere with normal sleep schedule.

First wrote the event off as catharsis from getting the vaccination over with, but a week has passed and I am struggling with my day-to-day. Having extreme difficulty focusing because of this silence, experienced a lot of issues with work this week, and am unable to even focus on free-time activities. Because there&#39;s no headnoise, there&#39;s nothing to help catch things that aren&#39;t being committed to memory properly, and I am almost instantly forgetting what I was doing if I did not write it down-- and even then I am having trouble focusing long enough to put the details to paper. When consulting with several friends, they reported having similar symptoms but recovered from their instances of it within 2-3 days. I&#39;m not having that luck.

I felt a little bit of tingling throughout my body. The medics at the facility had me drink water and wait there a while longer. I was told this was a normal reaction. I left the facility around 2:30 still feeling a bit dizzy and weak.  The feeling subsided after drinking more water and eating.

                                                Within 2 hours of getting vaccinated, I had severe arm pain at the vaccination site. Approximately 6-7 hours after getting vaccinated I began feeling body aches and chills and had trouble sleeping. When I got up the next morning at 8am (~12 hours post vaccination) I had a horrible headache (most painful I&#39;ve ever had), body aches, and exhaustion. My headache was at a pain level 10 so I took one Excedrin Migraine around 11am and napped for a few hours. The Excedrin helped to slightly lessen the headache for ~8 hours. I ate soup with dumplings for dinner around 7pm on 4/9 and two hours later began feeling extremely nauseous with severe stomach pains. Around 10pm I had a severe case of the chills and a low fever around 99.8 degrees. At 10:45pm I threw up for the first time. My headache came back quite strong and my fever began to spike. My nausea got better for an hour then came back along with the chills and cold sweats. I had severe aches and body pains along with the nausea and fever until throwing up again around 3 or 4am on 4/10. I continued to have a severe headache, body pains, nausea, and a fever of up to 101.8 for the rest of the night into the morning. I was able to sleep around 7am until 12pm on 4/10. On 4/10 I was able to eat some food, but still felt very nauseous and had a bad headache with a fever, although both had decreased slightly. I took advil around 1pm that day to help with the fever and it reduced from 101.8 to 99.5 in the evening. I still had body aches, a headache, and nausea at night on the 10th, although I was able to sleep a little better. When I woke up on the 11th my headache was much better and my stomach was less upset. The body aches and exhaustion were still present on the 11th all day, although a lot less severe than the days prior. I woke up this morning 4/12 feeling much better, with a very mild headache and body aches. The pain at the injection site began to lessen on 4/11 and is minimal today (4/12).

It felt like a tightness in my chest and it became hard for me to breath. Once a nurse checked my Bp and offered a bottle of water, as I was drinking the water my breathing began to improve.

On the 4th day after my injection (Wednesday, March 31st) I was lying down at 2PM because I was feeling strange. All of a sudden my feet and hands only got super cold, then cold and sweaty. I was lying with a heating pad and sat up to drink some water. I got super dizzy, couldn?t catch my vision. I tried to get up and walk to the door for some fresh air. Standing and walking felt like I was super drunk... couldn?t get my balance. That happened for about 30-45 minutes. I was super nervous as well with adrenaline pumping. I went to urgent care after about an hour and a half when I felt it was safe to drive. They didn?t know why that happened or what it was.

She is also undergoing allergy shots- she did not receive any allergy shot for 1 week prior to the initial vaccine and through 1 week after her last allergy shot- I do not prescribe nor administer those, so I do not know the makeup

                                                Heavy and painful period. I keep very close track of my period and usually I have moderate bleeding day one, cramps for 8 or so hours on day one, and then all uncomfortable symptoms go away by day 2 with very little bleeding day 2-4. This time, I have cramps for 48 hours and very heavy bleeding for 48 hours. During my period I was nauseous off and on, lightheaded most days and extremely fatigued the first two days enough so I couldn&#39;t work or get out of bed. This is all very different from my usual menstrual period and nothing changed in my diet or lifestyle from the previous month other than receiving this vaccine.

Was standing in the kitchen, moving my arm around as instructed, and became light headed &amp; seeing stars. I took one step to sit down and the next thing I knew I woke up on the ground. I had fainted unexpectedly. I had to lay on the ground for about 10 minutes until I gained the strength to get myself off the ground. The day afterwards I was extremely weak &amp; could not focus. Still a few days later I am not feeling 100%.

                                                The patient expressed nervousness before getting the vaccine, but very much wanted to get it done.  She took some deep breaths and we administered the vaccine in her left arm, after which she was ok.  I stayed to talk to her for 5 minutes while she was still seated.  After 5 minutes of talking, she told me she felt like she was going to pass out and that her arm was tingling.  She kept sitting and a minute later told me she was having cold sweating all over while feeling hot and also seeing spots.  I helped her lay on the ground and we called 911.  While waiting for paramedics, she recovered while laying down and spoke to her mother on the phone.  Once paramedics arrived they checked vitals several times with normal results.  She was then transported to the hospital at her request, although feeling better.

                                                Patient received Moderna COVID vaccine in the immunization room. There were no apparent immediate adverse effects following the injection, and the patient was instructed to wait in the lobby for 15 minutes to monitor for adverse effects or allergic reactions. Approximately 5 minutes after the injection, the patient lost consciousness and exhibited a stiff posture in the waiting lobby and EMS was called. Patient appeared to be not breathing for approximately 10-15 seconds and was carefully laid on the floor where she started breathing again. At no time was there no pulse. Patient regained consciousness after about 1 minute and expressed feeling confusion with the situation and numbness in the mouth but no other symptoms. EMS arrived on the scene promptly 2 minutes after being contacted and took over care of the patient. After the situation resolved, the patient was contacted on the phone and seemed to be feeling much better.

                                                I am currently *breastfeeding* a male baby who was 9.5mo old at time of *my* vaccine. That afternoon he took an unusually long nap, was unusually cranky and lethargic during the day; and by evening had a 100.7*F fever. He slept through the night (skipping his nightly feed--this has only ever happened three times since birth so very uncommon) and was still cranky and tired/sleepy the next day. His fever broke about 30hrs after onset. He has since had a significant change in wet/dirty diapers-- his total, daily wet diapers have decreased and his dirty diapers have gone from semi-solid stool to very wet, more explosive, and incredibly grainy/gritty ever since (it&#39;s been a week and a half now since my dose). I have continued to breastfeed during this whole time.

                                                Arm was tingly on date of vaccine minutes after injection. Arm became increasingly unusable for 48 hours. Extreme pain to move Arm at all. Then pain went away after 2-3 days. Then red blotch just below injection site appeared 2 days later, lasting about 4 days, with no other symptoms. Blotch went away. Then 7 days later, node in armpit was sore and after showering, red spottiness where blotch was occurred just below injection site. Within 30 minutes arm became increasingly cold feeling and tingly numb down to fingers. Can still use fine but feels weird. This has been happening for the last hour. But no pain and still able to move it fine. I feel fine overall, no other symptoms.

                                                Less than a week after my second dose, I started itching on my body. Where I scratched, hives would show up (I have a lot of pictures for proof if needed). Hives were painful, itchy, and consistent. I called a Teledoc and also went to Urgent Care. They prescribed me an anti-viral, antihistimines, steroid pills, and steroid topical creams. Nothing helped.  I bought oatmeal lotions and oatmeal bath, but sitting in the bath irritated and inflamed my back even more. The only thing that relieved the itching and pain, was making a paste out of the oatmeal bath powder, and covering my body. That being said, I had to take off of work for the week due to the uncontrollable pain and itching. Being at home, I basically just laid in bed covered in paste. But laying in the bed for too long also inflamed my back and caused pain. The symptoms started decreasing in severity. I started using herbal topical oils instead of the paste, when I could. I had two: one with the following ingredients: Menthol 14.5%, Methyl Salicylate 30%, Inactive Ingredients: Chlorophyll, ethyl alcohol, mineral oil, rose oil. The other: Menthol, Peppermint oil, Camphor, clove oil, and cinnamon oil . Those relieved my symptoms as well. I went to see a dermatologist 5/5 since the symptoms persisted. She prescribed Xyzal, Zyrtec, and more Prednisone. Said to come back in a month if symptoms still persisted. Went back yesterday (6/9) since I am still having symptoms and she diagnosed me with chronic urticaria. My symptoms have decreased in severity in comparison to when it first started. Now (two months after my second vaccine), I still get hives when I apply too much pressure to my skin (&#34;too much&#34; meaning things like: putting on or taking off my watch, hanging my purse on my right arm, accidentally rubbing my arm against a desk,  accidentally grazing my coffee table with my leg, etc.) At least my body isn&#39;t itchy, causing me to scratch like when it first started. But I am still having symptoms and a reation.

Arm was sore but nothing compared to joints (especially hips). Temperature was only slight at 98.7. Headache and body aches, joint pain were severe enough that I was forced to rest and unable to continue daily activities. Ache symptoms quickly dissipated after 48 hours, but a 2 inch diameter welt appeared, slightly raised and itching mildly like a mosquito bite. Welt is still present now, 5 days post-injection.

                                                Patient received vaccine at a drive-through event.  As she parked her car she saw another vaccine recipient walking to the ambulance for treatment and started feeling very anxious with a faster heart rate.  RN spoke to patient on site and she had no other complaints.  Patient monitored for a total of 30 minutes without further complaint.  Patient advised to call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room for any additional issues if needed.  Also advised to sign up for v-safe.  Patient left site stating she was feeling better (also saw other vaccine recipient return to car quickly and she said that helped).

Warm to the touch and slightly itchy like sunburn.  6 PM - Area  is doubled in size (about the size /shape of a thumb), much redder, and in a well-defined elongated oval shape.  Hot to the touch, firm and painful swelling that made sleeping difficult. Took Aleve and iced it. 1/6/20 7 AM -  Red area has spread out into a less defined circle about 2in in diameter.  Less swollen and painful but still hot to the touch. 6 PM - Area has spread into tear-drop shape about the size of my palm. Drew a line around the area. Still causes some difficulty sleeping. 1/7/20 - Area is less red and not as painful but I can still feel the original area swollen under the skin and hot to the touch. Spread slowed significantly and mostly stayed in the lines.

                                                This is my second pregnancy and at the time of my vaccination, I was 32 weeks 6 days gestation with an estimated delivery date of 2/15/21.  I tolerated the vaccine well initially with only a very minor sore arm the day after the vaccine. On 12/31/2020 (4 days after vaccination), I felt muscle fatigue around my hips and buttocks as well as significant fatigue. It seemed to improve over the course of the day and was not very noticeable for the next few days. On 1/4/21 (8 days after vaccination), my muscle fatigue in my hips, buttocks, thighs, and hamstrings bilaterally became very significant, preventing me from doing some activities that I had planned. I also had generalized fatigue. On 1/5/21, I had similar symptoms, but the muscle fatigue also began to include my shoulders bilaterally. 1/6/21, the muscle fatigue also included my neck and I was physically exhausted. 1/7/21 I started to note some improvement, and I also saw my OB who did bloodwork but also did suspect a possibly delayed reaction to my vaccine. Today (1/9/21) I am still experiencing muscle fatigue, but it does seem to be improved from several days ago.

                                                The day after the injection I had periods where the injection sight was warm to the touch (noticeably different temperature than the rest of my skin on my upper arm). By midmorning my left upper arm was very tender and extremely painful to the touch, even my shirt touching my skin hurt. By mid afternoon I was very fatigued and had to leave work and took a three hour nap. By the end of the evening the pain was resolved.

On 1/7/2021 I started to feel short of breath and run down. Sinus infection symptoms. I was sent home from work to get a COVID swab. That evening I lost my taste and began to feel achey. Negative test on 1/10/21. Saw urgent care on 1/9/21 for Covid swab and visit. He diagnosed viral and was sure I was positive. On 1/11/21 my energy returned and I wasn?t achey. Congestion and cough. By 1/13/21 felt fine other than lingering wet cough. This morning, 1/14/21 I noticed my arm itched and looked at it and I?ve got a small red rash around the injection sight and tenderness on palpation.

She started to feel better and left. Started to feel bad in the car on the way back to work. Her boss is a dentist and advised her to take Benadryl, which she did.  Traveling to Hospital now.  She has not yet been seen by a physician. Current symptoms are throat constriction, hard time swallowing, and having a hard time concentrating.  She is pale and feels unwell.   Wed Jan 13, 2021 16:09  Followed up with patient.  Patient is currently in the Emergency Room at Hospital. She has so far received steroids and benadryl.   Thurs Jan 14, 2021 08:56 Followed up with the patient again.  She returned home from the first ER visit at 17:30 last night.  About 4 hours after that her heart rate became elevated again (130-140 bpm while lying down) and she was confused, lethargic, and had a HA and backache. She went back to ER last night around 21:30. They gave her more benadryl in IV and toradol for the HA. She is now on PO benadryl every 4 hours for 4 days. Symptoms today include: runny nose, feels like a mild case of flu, HA and backache. Upon awaking this morning, prior to the morning dose of benadryl, her heart rate was a little elevated. She was also told she could alternate Tylenol or ibuprofen prn and use OTC cold remedies but hasn&#39;t needed any. The doctor said she is not a candidate for the next the second vaccine dose.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine on 01/06/2021. Normal pain at the injection site occured with little concern. Pain in armpit began 01/08/2021. I did not think anything of it, believing the pain to be from an ingrown hair caused by shaving or just something with the vaccine. I ignored it to spend time with family. On 01/12/2021 I noticed the pain had not subsided and deepened into the armpit causing pain to radiate from the area when lifting or moving heavy items.  I palpated the area and felt a pea sized lump. It moved freely. I could not locate it again. I continued to palpate into the top of my shoulder and discovered a large lump in the clavicle area. It is painful to apply pressure. I knew these areas to be part of the lymphatic system. I also did research on side effects of the Moderna vaccine but observed most people to have lymph node symptoms for only 24-48 hours within three days of receiving the vaccine then they subside.  I made an appointment that same day, 01/12/2021, with Dr. at clinic to be examined. At first, Dr was dismissive of my symptoms. Dr did physically examine my areas of complaint and scheduled an ultrasound for 01/15/2021 at  Hospital. On 01/13/2021 I noticed the injection site began to ache again. On 01/14/2021 I awoke from a nap at 6pm. I began showering for work when I felt a burning, itchy sensation on my inner left bicep. I observed two red spots on my inner left bicep close to my armpit with a red rash below the two red spots. I palpated the red spots to find a large and slightly smaller lump under the skin corresponding with the red spots. The rash itches. As of 01/15/2021, the ultrasound had to be rescheduled by the hospital as their ultrasound technician cannot make it into work because of a blizzard. I now have two lumps in the clavicle area that alternate swelling and reducing in size. I&#39;ve been taking tylenol every four hours when I&#39;m awake to control the pain. The ones in my clavicle now cause tension in the left side of my neck. I&#39;ve also applied warm compresses on the affected sites. It helps lessen the swelling for a bit but does come back.

No rotation. It started a few hours after receiving the vaccine. By 5pm it was at it&#39;s sorest and locked in position . Not warm to touch. Just painful.  This lasted a total of 3 days until all soreness and full normal movements without discomfort could resume.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

Increased heart rate of 120-150 continued for a couple of hours with minimal dizziness. About 5am, I had a bought of sudden explosive, watery stool. This continued 3 more times in the am, at times having incontinence. (This has never occurred before.) By 10 am, those symptoms had stopped. Only residual side effects were a headache and sore arm. On 12/31, it was noticed that I had hives on my abdomen and back. They were not itchy and I am unsure how long they had been there for; referred to allergy

Dizziness and severe nausea started and blood pressure decreased. Trouble concentrating and tingling in hands and feet. I was taken to the Emergency Room and hooked up to an IV and Heart Monitoring. I was given IV Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, and Zofran. I was going to get an injection of Epinephrine but my heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly after the first batch of IV meds and they were concerned that the Epinephrine may have made things worse. I was monitored for 4 hours and then discharged with instructions to take Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for 5 days, Prednisone 60mg every day for 5 days, Pepcid 40mg twice a day for 5 days and given a prescription for an Epi-Pen. I remained very nauseous and dizzy foe the next 48 hours. My injection site became swollen, red, and tender 48 hours after my injection and then re-flared up 11 days after my injection on 01/17/21.

Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

                                                Beginning when I woke up the following morning, I had a very severe headache. It lasted all day until I went to sleep. Figured it was from the vaccine and would be gone the next day. It was still there when I woke up again... and the severe headache and extreme light sensitivity in my eyes lasted for 20 straight days. It kept me from being able to work fully and had to cancel many of my client bookings. I had 2 days of no headaches- felt great- Jan 21st and 22nd. Then again through today it has been there. I can?t describe it very well as it feels like it?s all over and the pain is almost unbearable at times. Even when the headache is lessened/subdued by darkness or ibuprofen, I still feel it strongly in my left temple/behind left eye at all times. I haven?t experienced headaches like this ever before in my life, even though I?ve had random headaches here and there in the past. They have never been there when I wake up in the AM though and sleep has always made them go away previously. Although I can?t imagine this is specifically from the vaccine, it also seems like the timing is so related that I was advised to file a report here.

                                                I received the vaccine in my right arm, the placement of the vaccine was more towards the front of my arm, rather then the middle of my deltoid. My right arm was sore the next day (12-30-2020) , which is predicted, but the pain hasn&#39;t gone away. I cannot sleep on my right side, if I do, I cannot lift my arm, it takes a few hours for my arm to &#34;warm up&#34; before I can use it again with minimal pain. The pain is right in the middle of my deltoid, I can palpitate the exact location of the pain.

Soreness and warmth at injection site continued for 10 days.  24 hours after injection, numbness and tingling started and still hasn&#39;t resolved 2 weeks after injection. Decreased strength in right arm, pain and discomfort comes and goes through day and night. Arm will go numb for up to an hour  making it hard to grasp items, write, type, ect. Took Tylenol and Benadryl every evening, applied ice , stretching and movement to work muscle.   Appears that vaccine was given too low instead of 2 in from shoulder, given  6 in from shoulder by pharmacist

My partner was with me and said that after I got up I began shaking and he helped me to the ground where I continued to &#34;shiver&#34;, as he called it, for another few seconds before going limp. Once I came to (a few seconds later) I felt very confused at where I was and had a pounding headache and my ears were ringing loudly. It was all I could focus on. After that my partner helped me to bed where he continued to check on me and I slept for 5 hours.

Symptoms include severe myalgia, arthralgia, and constant chills but no fever. Moderate headache and tachycardia (100-130, most likely due to pain level). I had to leave work after about 2 hours d/t symptom severity. Symptoms were only slightly improved with 1gram of Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not history of adverse vaccine reactions. Symptoms resolved about 24 hours after onset.

I startes feeling achey and had chills which made it hard to sleep.  My joints, hips, and knees hurt a lot. 400mg of ibuprofen helped me enough to sleep.  I woke around 8am. Significant muscle aches ans joint pain. Ate breakfast at too ibuprofen at 9:30am.  It didnt help much, I managed to hobble to the grocery store for food late morning.  11:30 am my appetite was low, muscle aches bad. I cant recall if I took ibuprofen. Fatigue soon set in and I slept for a few hours.  Around 630pm,  my chills are back. I feel warm but am afebrile. My body temp is higher than normal (97.8 vs 96.6).    My muscles and joints hurt a lot. I might be getting a headache. I have no appetite. My face feels hot but my body is freezing. All day I have brief bouts of nausea that are mild and fleeting. I only gagges once when a sharp wave hit.

                                                32 weeks pregnant and second dose of Covid vaccine received on 1/21 at 11:00. Flu like symptoms (fever, chills, headache) began 0100 on 1/22 and lasted until about 1300 on 1/23. I had to call out sick from work on 1/22. Worked a 7L shift on 1/24 and at about 2000 noticed a petechial rash on bilateral lower extremities that spread up to lower abdomen. Called on-call L&amp;D Doctor and she advised for me to be assessed at L&amp;D triage. I was then admitted for 4 hours due to my rash and further workup concerning for DIC, thrombocytopenia and/or other possibilities. My petechial rash was very concerning for coagulation disorders and prompted many lab draws to be obtained. My labs showed elevated AST &amp; ALT that were previously normal, low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), protein in urine, elevated alk phos. I was discharged around 0100 for further workup the following day.  On 1/25 I went to clinic to have more labs done per Doctor. 1/26 at about 0830 I was called by my OB Docotor to immediately go back to Labor &amp; Delivery triage to be admitted for what she thought was preeclampsia based on my labs from 1/25 and 1/24. I was again admitted for about 4 hours for monitoring of baby, and myself for preeclampsia. My labs were still elevated and out of range mirroring preeclampsia, but my blood pressure was stable, so I was discharged around 1300. I followed up with labs at clinic on 1/28 and again on 2/2 as well as with home blood pressure monitoring.  My labs on 2/2 showed everything back to normal, causing the doctors involved in my care to believe this was an adverse event due to the moderna covid vaccine.  As a result I missed one day of work, was admitted to the hospital twice, and had 4 days of lab draws which will result in an excess of medical bills.

                                                Within  13 minutes of having the vaccine client stated that she was having blurred vision. The building where vaccines were given was 75 degrees that morning the client was bundled up with a winter hat, coat, sweatshirt, and gloves.  When she first stated she wasn&#39;t feeling good we had her remove all her outwear so she could cool off, she immediately began trembling uncontrollably. Vitals were taken 144/78, pulse 125,  4 minutes later 136/74 pulse 100,  5 minutes later 130/82 pulse 80. During this time client continued to tremble. She voiced her anxiety for getting shots and also states she hadn&#39;t even anything yet that day.  She was given 2 large glasses of water which she drank both of them . By 11:00 am she was no longer having any symptoms.

                                                I started getting dizzy and slightly nauseated after about ten or fifteen minutes. The dizziness worsened after about 30 minutes but the nausea went away. About 30-40 minutes after the shot, my head got very foggy feeling, my limbs felt heavy and weak, and I suddenly became very tired. I don&#39;t have any trouble breathing and my heart rate is fine. I&#39;m just going to sleep it off and drink lots of water.

                                                I woke up at approx 2:00am 02/03/2021 with my clothes soaking wet,even my bed sheets. I was chilling, very nauseated, had a headache, diarrhea, heart burn, and a fever of 101, very weak, muscle aches,  very fatigued, and no appetite. These symptoms lasted all day Wednesday 02/03/2021, Thursday 02/04/2021, and Friday 02/05/2021. I was able to eat very little on Thursday. When I woke up on Friday 02/05/2021 I was much more nauseated. I threw up two times Friday morning and was unable to hold my daily medications down. I still had all symptoms that I listed above. I called my endocrinologist Friday morning and he had me come to the infusion clinic to get a bolus of IV fluids and IV steroids....I was able to sleep for 3 hours whenever I came back from the infusion clinic and was able to hold some food down.  101.8 was the highest that I am aware of that my fever was. Saturday 02/06/2021- Monday 02/08/2021 most symptoms had subsided except mild nausea, heartburn and sinus drainage. I was able to return to work on Tuesday 02/09/2021. I had every symptom of COVID-19 other than loss of taste or smell. I was rapid tested and PCR tested on Friday 02/05/2021 and both results were negative.

I was sitting on the couch, and my partner noticed I have having a seizure, he lowered to me to the ground and called the ambulance. My seizure lasted for 1 minute.  When I was in the ER, they gave me 2 bags of fluids, they did an X-ray, CT scan, blood work, and UA, they reported to me that all the result were normal. They did not send me home with any medications. However, they did not clear me to drive. They said that I need to get cleared by a neurologist before I can drive, so that?s why I have not been back to work?

I started feeling itchy in that area as well. I started getting bumps all over. I took 2 puffs of my Symbicort, Benadryl, and Loratadine. I continued taking the Symbicort and Benadryl. I fell asleep siting up. By 12/24 I could not swallow and it would hurt my chest to breath so I decided to go to the ER.

                                                Onset of soreness around injection site within two hours; lingering soreness remains after ~60 hours; at peak, pain rating 6/10. Onset of general &#34;ill&#34; feeling within 4 hours (mild fatigue and body aches, sensitivity to sound). Physical discomfort increased overnight, reaching peak ~15-20 hours after injection but remaining severe throughout day 2 (unable to perform daily activities). 400mg ibuprofen every 6 hours helped to alleviate symptoms. ~15 hours after injection, sleep was interrupted by severe body aches along with nausea; followed within 30 minutes by vomiting.

Headache, dizziness, stomach pain, very tired, but couldn&#39;t sleep for the pain and discomfort. It&#39;s been almost 24 hours and I still feel as terrible as I did this morning.

At that point, my arm became hot to touch and severely itchy. On day 10 the symptoms began to subside and were manageable with tylenol and an antihistamine.   The second dose resulted in a similar reaction to the vaccine as the first dose. The symptoms were worse and included, headaches, exhaustion, muscle and joint pain to the point where I had to call out of work. The body aches felt similar to having the flu. This all occurred the day after the second dose. Two days after the second dose,  I am still tired and have a headache. The body aches are minor.

Also no appetite since the vaccine combined with dizzy spells. I?ve been to the ER twice thought it was anxiety but it?s becoming to consistent for anxiety.  Feel like my blood pressure is going up and down.  ER assumed it was anxiety because that?s what I thought it was at first. Normal doctor did virtual visit today and said it all seems to possibly be a reaction to the shot.

                                                I have had a non-stop pressure headache since the second dose. I drink plenty of water. I take Tylenol / Ibuprofen daily. Nothing helps. Laying down makes it worse. It throbs in the roof of my mouth and my nose. It is nauseating. I feel like someone is squeezing my brain. My blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen are fine.   I did reach out to a neurologist about this. I was thought to have IIH over two years ago when I was 70 lbs heavier, but I have not had a symptom since losing weight. Opening pressures and scans show no evidence of it. The headaches I am having now are significantly worse than that was. It hurts down my neck as well.  The headaches began approximately 18 hours after the second dose. I was nauseated. I had chills. I had a temperature. My joints ached. My muscles ached. My body ached I was seen at the hospital twice for the seemingly common and expected side effects. I received IV medication for nausea and plenty of fluids. The headache, however, did not let up. 60ish hours after the second dose and all other symptoms ceased. The headache, however, remained. It persists. The headaches get so intense sometimes that my body feels like it needs to jerk, or twitch. I honestly cannot explain this sensation. I feel like I have to really focus to keep my body from moving impulsively.  It is bothersome, but I am concerned with how long it is lasting, especially with reports of strokes following the vaccination.

I felt body aches, a horrible headache. The next day I had the fever (it went away on the 13th). the body aches were better.  I also had pain in my arm and the symptoms were all back in the evening. On 01/09 I was tested and was negative but on the 20th I was tested again and was positive. I was seen by the Doctor  on the 13th and he prescribed me something that helped me with the fever. He also diagnosed me with pharyngitis. After the 20th, when I was diagnosed positive I also started with shortness of breath and anxiety attacks.

                                                Within 2 hours of the shot, I got a headache and started feeling deathly ill.  I felt as if I was going to vomit and nothing I did helped.  My arm got a little red and sore a few hours after the injection.  Over the next few days my arm continued to get even more red &amp; irritated as well as swelling some.  I have photographs of each phase of the irritation; if this is needed, I will gladly send them in to you all.  I had to stay out of work that whole weekend (2/26, 2/27, &amp; 2/28) due to not being able to get out of bed.  I stayed in bed for the majority of the weekend sleeping and was not up moving around more than 8 hours the whole weekend.  Since I was still sick and having issues after so many days, the Medical Control Unit at my job (run by our Fire &amp; Rescue Department) made me get tested on 3/1/21 to make sure it was not COVID.   Later that afternoon, the test came back as negative.  I still was feeling nauseated and fatigued even weeks after the shot.  I have stayed nauseated since then and have also been very tired still.

                                                About 5 hours after my shot, I started to have a horrible headache.  As the evening progressed, my arm was extremely sore and a little red around the injection site.  Over the next couple of days I continued to have a headache and also ended up having nausea, muscle soreness, some food started tasting not right (I did not lose taste or smell), cough, &amp; horrible fatigue.   I went to Urgent Care on 1/17/21 due to feeling so poorly and had to miss work that evening.  While at Urgent Care, the doctor provided me with cough medication that also had something in it to help with nausea.  They also said that they would be doing a COVID test since I was having some symptoms and even though it was probably from the shot, they wanted to test anyway.  The test finally came back as negative.  A week after the shot was done, my arm turned horribly red and swollen around the injection site.  Over a few days, the spot on my arm grew a little bit but was just more so irritating that it was itching/hurting.  By week #2 after having the injection, the redness in my arm as well as all of the symptoms, minus the fatigue, went away totally.

Reports that the signs are redness of cheeks, swelling of lips, and face &#34;feeling funny.&#34; I advised the patient to take a Benadryl and monitor her symptoms. If they continue to worsen, seek out emergency medical treatment. Will follow up with patient via a phone call this evening or tomorrow.

When I walked, my heart rate increased to 130-140 BPM. I had to leave work at 1:30 PM due to the rapid heart rate. I thought I was having an anxiety attack. I got home and took my temperature and it was up to 100 F. I could not get out of bed. My fever spiked up to 103 F during the night. My heart rate remained around 90-110 BPM at rest and I continued to have chills. When my fever broke around 6 AM the next morning, my heart rate went back to normal at 65-70 BPM resting. I feel like the elevated heart rate and the fever were an adverse reaction to the vaccine and I&#39;m unsure whether to get the second dose.  I continued to have fatigue and a headache for three days after the vaccine.

On 15 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events the patients received second dose of their two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) for prophylaxis of COVID 19 infection.  On 15 Mar 2021, on the day of her second dose, the patient felt confused, disoriented and could not even drive herself back to home. On 16 Mar 2021, the patient developed fever and the worst body aches ever she had. The patient noticed that her teeth became sensitive to both cold and hot. The patient stated that her teeth were shocking in the whole mouth and the two teeth which had some work was hurting. The patient felt like something was poking her face almost like her face was paralyzed and felt nauseous. The event facial paralysis was considered medically significant and serious.  The patient tried acetaminophen which did not work and then took ibuprofen which was effective.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events confusion, disorientation, could not drive herself/impaired driving ability, nausea, fever/pyrexia, body aches/general body pain, sensitive teeth/hyperaesthesia teeth, poking in face/facial paralysis were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Nausea and fever are consistent with the vaccine safety profile.

                                                Significant pain in injection site. I was unable to sleep on that side for 2 nights. I felt foggy and very goofy, almost like I was high or something for the 5-7 hours after getting the shot. Throat felt like I was having massive allergies (not closing but thick? and itchy) Random sweats 5-7 hours after the shot. Mild headache for a day after. Exhaustion for a day after. My lymph node in my left arm pit is hurting today (day 6?).  5-10 random bumps on both arms within 3-4 days. They itched and looked more like acne than hives.

Sore arm developed later in the afternoon. No biggie.   Day 2: Tuesday. 24 hours later. Reeeeallllly sore arm, feeling okay. An hour after waking up: BAM. Immediately felt lightheaded, dizzy, thought I was going to pass out. Nausea. Pounding headache. No ability to do work the entire day. The couch was my friend. Moving my arm throughout the day alleviated arm soreness. Felt slightly better in the early evening. This was my worst day.  Day 3: Wednesday: 48 hours later. Headache. Energy in the morning. Wave hit me around noon and I was down the rest of the afternoon. Pounding headache. Lightheaded. Nausea. Waves of this mix throughout the day.  Day 4: Thursday: 72 hours later. Thought I had improved but headache quickly set in within an hour or two of waking up. Zoom meeting the first half of the day, tiredness set in halfway through, then waves of feeling lightheaded with headache and occasional nausea throughout the day.   Day 5: Friday: 96 hours later: Headache and waves of struggle all day.   Day 6: Saturday: 120&#43; hours later (at this time of writing!). Slight lingering headache. Best day so far. Was overcome by stronger headache and tiredness in the afternoon (starting around 3:00pm)

Two days after first dose: I started mensturating heavily and suddenly with severe menstral symptoms.  I continued to sporadically have light bleeding for 3 weeks. Prior to this event, I had not had a period in almost a year due to my birth control method. I have cramps, bloating, breast pain, irregular bleeding and weight gain. I received the second dose on 03/25/21 and by 03/30/21 I was experiencing yet another round of extreme PMS symptoms like severe breast pain, severe cramps that leave me bedridden, and intense food cravings. I have not had cyclic periods for several months prior to either of these events. It was jarring enough for me to start tracking my period symptoms because it was so out of the normal. I have been filtered into thinking any issues with my period are just something to deal with and to not seek medical attention, but I have missed approximately 6 days of work due to various symptoms after both of my doses.

Her mother was present and stated that her daughter has vasovagal syncope and that this always occurs whenever her daughter gets nervous about something (even at the eye doctor when receiving eye drops). The patient&#39;s eyes rolled into the back of her and began to shake uncontrollably and lost control of her bladder. The patient came to about a minute or so later and drank some orange juice. She was monitored for an additional 30 minutes. The mother told me not to call 911 since this has happened to her daughter before.

I had the chills and then a fever. I had nausea so bad I couldn?t hardly eat all day. I was dizzy, short of breath, exhausted, and had a sore throat. I was so tired and so dizzy I couldn?t get out of bed all day. These symptoms lasted at least 24 hours. I am still slightly tired today and dealing with a mild sore throat and headache. The adverse effects I had from the moderna vaccine were awful. I couldn?t take care of my kid or do anything all day. I didn?t even have the energy to look for a thermometer.

I mentioned it to the nurse who said most people say that about the second dose of Moderna. I waited in the waiting area 15 minutes. I&#39;ve felt pain coldness numbness heaviness and tingling  down my arm, shoulder and up my neck since. My shoulder  cracks and pops with pain. Limiting movement and interrupted  sleep because of the pain. I saw PCP on 3/10 and 3/17 about the pain. Was referred to ortho and saw ortho on 3/22. Was prescribed 6 days of prednisone and was told pain after IM vaccination was not unheard of and that I had to keep using my shoulder and arms. Pain is still present now.

                                                shortly after receiving vaccine patient felt very faint and almost passed out, then vomited.  Felt very weak and after about 1/2 hour said she was having difficulty forming words in her head.  Her mother did want an ambulance called when I asked her, and they came out and took her vitals, which were normal. They felt anxiety was the reason she was having trouble thinking of the words she wanted to use, and felt that she was not having an anaphylactic reaction since there was no rash at injection site or anywhere else forming, and patient had stated that she had passed when she had blood drawn in the past. They asked if she wanted to go to the hospital and she said no and that she felt she could go home with her parents. She was still feeling weak, but the paramedic felt she was ok to go home also.

                                                The night of the shot I had a headache and some fatigue with some nausea. The next morning when I woke up around 8 am my arm was sore and my entire body felt achy. Over the next couple hours my body was progressively achy to the point of not wanting to move. By 12 pm I was in tears of just how much my body hurt. This is also around the time I had a fever of 101.3. I took a double dose of ibuprofen and attempted to sleep it off however I was only able to fade in and out of sleep because despite taking medicine my fever started to climb more and more high and the chills started to intensify. I recorded my fever through out the day and watched it climb more and more high until about 6 pm it was at 103.4. My head was pounding, my ears were hearting, my body aches so much and despite having chills I felt as if my body was over heating to the point where I had to put a bag of ice on my neck and a cool wash cloth on my head to cool down. I took more ibuprofen and eventually my fever went down again. By 11 pm it was back down to 101.3 and I felt so exhausted o went to bed however I woke up about every 2 hours and tossed and turned all night as my fever went back up to about 102 and I had chills. I woke up today about 7 am feeling better from yesterday but my body is still slightly achy, fever is low grade at 100.6 and the chills have eased. The sides in the back of my throat are very swollen and painful still though and have been since the night I received the shot.

                                                I experienced what I felt was a panic attack a little over two days after I received my second dose of Moderna.  I had shortness of breath, mind fogginess, chest pressure, and dizziness when standing up.  It didn&#39;t seem to go away fully that night as I went to bed with slight shortness of breath and I woke up with chest pressure the next morning.  I continued to have slight chest pressure/pains that came &amp; went as well as a bad headache so I went to go see my doctor.  He suggested that it was from anxiety &amp; side effects from the shot since I had Covid in March of 2020.  I still have chest pressure/pain and headache that comes and goes.

                                                Immediately after getting the vaccine, I felt my heart race. I was a little lightheaded, but I thought it was normal, so I didn&#39;t notify the healthcare workers. Approximately, 20 to 30 minutes after the shot and after leaving vaccination facility, I had chest pain and shortness of breath, which stopped after about an hour. About 6 or 7 hours after the vaccine (9 or 10 pm), I started having shortness of breath, cough, mucus in my throat, slight chest pain, shivers and trembling (temperature was about 36.8 Celsius). At some point, for a few minutes, I felt lightheaded, dizzy, my speech was slow, slurry and I had brain fog. After some hours, the symptoms receded. I was able to fall asleep at about 3 am. The next day, I only felt a little shortness of breath and body aches. The second day after the vaccine, I felt almost normal except for a lingering, occasional shortness of breath.

Then for several days after that, my heart would randomly ?flutter? but it only lasted a couple seconds, I assumed it was anxiety. 4/11/21 I was on a walk and my heart started beating really fast and it was hard to breathe. I went back home. 4/12/21 I was at work when suddenly my chest felt tight and  it was hard to breathe for a few seconds. Then following that for days it was the fluttering again, off and on, maybe once every other day, but now my chest had started hurting and feeling tight without the heart palpitations. Just all of a sudden a tight chest, this continues every day including today . 4/26/21 I was at work sitting at my desk when my heart started beating wildly, I?ve never experienced anything like that before. It lasted longer than the others and was stronger, and towards the end it was hard to breathe. I spoke to my doctor and she ordered bloodwork. I went to urgent care and they listened to my heart and lungs, and did an EKG and said everything looks good at the moment. I can still feel the chest tightness. I bought a heart monitor so I can track these flutters.

                                                Within 24 hours of the second dose, symptoms of previously healed herniated disc / sciatica re-emerged and worsened. Lower back pain, numbness/pins and needles in the right calf and foot. Pain and numbness is still severe and has not improved in the course of two weeks.   There was no straining, lifting, movement, or injury that otherwise caused this flare up. The only variable was the vaccine.   On Wednesday, April 21, I received an epidural Epidural Corticosteroid Injection, which did not improve symptoms.   I have been unable to work since receiving the vaccine/ having this complication.

I ran over to her to catch her as she was slipping and she came back into conscious within less than a 30 seconds. She was sweating and was very hot. She was alarmed and anxious. I took her BP after she relaxed a bit and drank water and it was 128/86 and HR of 64. She was breathing properly. Just was really hot and sweating. We took her to a room to remove her mask and sit in front of the fan. The EMT&#39;s came in and took her to the ambulance to do a full vitals evaluation. She was then cleared to leave.

                                                Day 2 - Extreme fatigue and disorientation/vertigo, and felt like I could not breathe. Went to Urgent Care and was told it was an allergic reaction. Was prescribed an over the counter antihistamine and told not to receive the second vaccine.   Over the course of the following week pain throughout my body worsened - the most painful being in my ovaries, in my muscles, and (believe it or not) feeling like in my blood! I eventually stopped sleeping and psychosis developed. I was voluntarily hospitalized in an ER first, then in a Psych unit at Hospital where my psychosis was stabilized along as the primary concern while my physical health symptoms were monitored and managed with (what I assume was) patient-lead care. During my time in-patient I requested to stop taking my birth control pills, which was heard.   Upon leaving the hospital (currently 2 days out), I have continued taking prescribed mental health medications (Geodon 20mg in the evening, Prozac 40mg in the morning) and continue to monitor and manage my pain with over-the-counter Tylenol. Since leaving in-patient the pain is localized to pelvis/ovaries.

She was unsure if it was due to her allergy shots or due to the vaccine. Patient stated her brain fog got worse after a week and only happens when she is trying to focus on song lyrics or people&#39;s names. Brain fog has stayed the same way for about a month. Patient did talk to her physician and other MDs and no one could think of a cause of sudden brain fog.  She states she has no problems with memory if she isn&#39;t trying to focus on something.

                                                Initially after the vaccine I felt fine, after some time I began to feel very tired, drowsy and had a headache. As time past I started to get cold and began to get the chills. At this time I started taking my temperature which was running about 99-100F.  The chills became worse and I felt colder and sicker. My temperature climbed to 102.1 at which time I took some tylenol. My fever continued to climb to 103.1 within the next hour. The chills and fever lasted about 6-8 hours and then went away and I became very hot. I went to sleep that night after taking more tylenol just in case. The next morning I had severe fatigue, mild nausea  and a headache that stayed with me the rest of the day. I ended up going home from work due to the nausea and migraine type headache as well as intermittent chills that would come and go. By the next day 1/22 I was feeling much better over all. However a mildly painful red spot that was warm to touch appeared on my arm where the injection site was that stayed for the next 48 hours before disappearing.

                                                Exercised following injection. Noticed mildly sore arm within several hours. Much worse that night to the point that I was unable to lift things. Next day it was on/off pain, with very intense pain when it came on to the point that I was unable to lift or do things. On Sunday (next day), pain seemed to radiate from the shoulder up through my left neck to the cranium area. Monday (today) this evening - pain so intense that I was screaming and sobbing. Husband (also MD) had to medicate me as I was laying on bed screaming unable to move or roll over. He had to manually lift me. Significant pain in left neck (trapezius) area on inhales, near injection site. Pain has been getting worse each night.

                                                After the vaccine I got chills beginning at 10pm.  About 1am I got a fever but was already taking started tylenol and motrin because I developed a headache also.  The fever went as high as 101.2.  On Tuesday I woke at 2am soaked in sweat and the fever had broke.  Later that day the fever returned at 100.5 but broke on its on.  By Saturday I woke up again with SOB and super cold.  Fever had returned at 101 so I went to Urgent Care  because the fever just kept returning.  A chest xray was done and it showed my lungs were really inflammed.  The fever returned later but went away.  The SOB is still here.  And on  1/19 I got the same feeling with SOB, 101.1 fever and felt awful all over again. So I visited with my PCP and another chest Xray and blood work was done again.  The chest xray showed normal but was started on a Flovent enhaler to help with the breathing and SOB.

I started to itch and thought it was just dry skin. Then about 20 minutes later I started to get mild hives. I took Benadryl and that calmed it down. When I woke up the next day the itching went away and I just felt pretty fatigued throughout the day.

I fell asleep and woke up about 11:30pm with a 103.4 fever so I stayed awake a little and took ibuprofen and tylenol throughout the night.  When I woke the next morning the fever was 101 but went down to like 99 later that evening.  The fever finally broke about 11am the next day but returned later  that day for a little while.   I was so tired  I slept like a solid day and woke up yesterday feeling sluggish and developed another 100.3 fever last night, took motrin and I feel better today.

I had to take the day off work and slept most of the day.  I also had terrible muscular pain at the sight of the injection (L deltoid).  Tylenol helped with the arm pain. I had absolutely no side effects with the first dose.

                                                Body aches started 10 hours after 2nd COVID vaccine dose, but it was unclear if this was muscle soreness related to exercise. Slept poorly and awoke around 6 AM with distinct flu-like body aches and pounding headache, as well as sweatiness and feeling hot.  Took temperature at 9 AM and found no fever, but by this time the sweats had stopped. Took two ibuprofen 200 mg each at 7:15 am and symptoms reduced.  Felt weak all day and headache persisted, took ibuprofen twice more.  The following morning, about 45 hours after vaccine, awoke again with mild headache and nausea. Didn&#39;t vomit but nausea and weakness persist and haven&#39;t alleviated yet, I am submitting this at 11:30 AM, 50 hours after vaccine.

Patient was placed on prednisone as pretreatment for second dose. She took the first dose of prednisone on 1/28/2021. Received the second vaccination on 12/29/2021. Patient called ED nursing station one day after (1/30/21) receiving the second vaccine dose stating she had a fever of 102 and did not feel well. She treated it at home with ibuprofen and Tylenol. Her last dose of prednisone was on 01/30/2021. She went to work on 02/01/2021. Staff said they tried talking to her but it was like she was not hearing them. Shortly after she was found unresponsive in the bathroom. She was brought to the ED. She was responsive to voice but was aphasic and had left sided deficits. In  past records, she has had episodes of neurological symptoms that were unexplainable. Unable to obtain an accurate history on her due to aphasia so it is unknown what this could have actually started from. Reporting due to previous reaction to vaccine and recentness of second dose in relation to this incident. Did try Keppra to cover for possible seizure. Consulted with transferring physician and she is not a candidate for TPA.  She was transferred out to a facility with higher level of care.  During time in this ED, neurological symptoms did not improve.

The next day, at around 9:30am, the muscle aches started and I noticed a rash on my stomach. Around 3pm, I started to feel worse. I took a nap and woke up around 6pm soaked in sweat, with muscle aches, and a fever of 99. My fever never got above 100.8. The body aches were the worst part. It was extremely difficult to get comfortable. I did take Tylenol and Ibuprofen and it didn?t seem to help the body aches. It did however help keep the fever at bay.  I went to sleep that evening at 11:00pm. I woke up in the middle of the night around 2am, and all symptoms have resolved except for feeling extremely hot. The rash has gotten better but has not fully resolved.

At approximately 12:30 at night, I woke up due to the pain I was feeling all over my body (in particular in my joints and lower back). I also have a severe headache. At approximately 2:30am I experienced nausea and some vomiting followed by chills without fever. The headache, body aches, and extreme exhaustion continued until approximately 9pm the day after the shot. Two days later, almost all symptoms were gone (I still felt tired). I had a small red spot at the injection site that lasted 2 days but the injection site pain was way worse for the first shot than the second one.

Was close to vomiting.  Recorded my temperature the next day. Highest recorded temp was 100.7. Slight loss of appetite over the course of 2-3 to 2-4.  Arm started itching 2-4 and is still itchy today 2-6, but nothing extreme. Arm still is hard, raised up, tender and warm around injection site. Felt pretty much back to normal upon waking on 2-5.

                                                Saturday evening, started having sharp pins and needles sensation in joints (knees, hips, elbows and shoulders). I couldn?t fall asleep that morning I woke up vomiting. Had a fever of 101.1F. Had a fever all Sunday, got as high as 103.3F.  Had large red rash on the arm of the injection site that is hot to the touch, hard, itchy, and feels like a sunburn when you touch it (burns).  Had really stiff and sore neck and shoulders, hard to move head from side to side. Headache all day Sunday. Couldn?t sleep Sunday night because of pins and needles in joints again. Got up at around 6am vomiting. Fever of 100.1F. Temp lowered to 99.1 by 7:30pm. Tuesday, no headache or vomiting. Slept through the night without any pins and needles pain. No fever, but really stiff and sore neck and shoulders still. Red spot of arm has grown.

These symptoms have subsided, but I have noticed my allergic reactions to wine have become more reactive and sensitive.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Within 8 hours of receiving the 2nd Moderna dose in right upper arm, I was experiencing 9/10 sharp upper arm pain (00:30 2/10/2021). The pain was so intense I almost vomited and was not able to sleep. My range of motion was severely limited, and I had to use my left arm to help move my right arm.  This continued through 2/10/2021. At 1300 took 1000 mg Tylenol and had minor relief for an hour. Tried to stay hydrated and move my right arm as I could, which was still very limited. Woke up at 01:30 early morning 2/11/2021 with intense pain in right upper arm still, not able to sleep. Range of motion continues to be severely limited due to pain. Made an appointment with PCP office first thing. I was concerned I could have SIRVA and wanted to get a medical professional?s opinion. She said it is probably a combination of the Moderna vaccine and a ?bad injection,? meaning the nurse administering my vaccine at facility was very high on my deltoid (almost to my joint). I was told to call back if my arm pain or range of motion worsens.

                                                I had hives despite having taken my daily dose of Claritin that seemed to get worse as the day continued. I reached out to my Healthcare clinic and they were unsure if there was a simple treatment and almost required me to go the emergency room for this. I conducted a telehealth consultation with a doc who was not my primary care physician and was unfamiliar with my preexisting exercise urticaria condition that occasionally results in light hives but never anaphylaxis for me without Claritin. I declined going to the emergency room since this did not seem that serious and instead took another Claritin to try to get the somewhat worsening hives with no apparent cause to stop without an unnecessarily escalated situation. My throat was slightly itchy but I never became anaphylactic likely due to taking an additional Claritin and not doing anything requiring physical effort for the day beyond telecons from home because I left the office to telework mid morning after I started getting continually slightly worse hives. By evening I was ok and the next day just had a slightly sore throat but was able to work and just started the day with 2 Claritin without any further instance of hives appearing. The day after that I returned to my standard 1 Claritin dose with no ill effects. From this event, it seems clear that a 72 hour downing period from dose 1 is insufficient and should be upped to 96 hours. Prior to this more severe event, I had, on days 2 and 3, a sore left arm at injection site that prevented me from even reasonably lifting my arm to a height sufficient to grab my cell phone off it&#39;s charger while lying in bed without serious discomfort. That level of arm discomfort prevented me from working out or would have prevented me from anything other than light office work involving my vaccine arm. My level of tiredness for the couple days following this dose also required that I take an hour long nap days 1 and 2, and no nap at all is usually the norm for me.

                                                I had a bad headache despite taking a 600mg Ibuprofen at initial onset of this headache,  and felt increasingly overheated and sweaty throughout the night, the headache starting around 1800 day of injection, trouble sleeping and too warm feeling starting closer to 2300, and both headache and overheating lasting through probably about 0300 the following morning. Had I been in the office I would have had to go home ill, and I could not do much but try to rest during this time. The headache through the following day was light and I felt mostly normal by evening.

I have never experienced body pain like this. I had chills like I had a fever. I slept the whole day into the night.

I experienced headache and fatigue yesterday afternoon and developed back aches at 2030At 2330, I developed fever (100.5) with chills, nausea, diarrhea and faint feeling. I started blacking out while walking to get water and had to kneel down to the floor to prevent myself from passing out. I had tingling in my hands and feet for an hour after. I took ibuprofen at 0145, and fell asleep around 0230. As of now, I feel back to normal, other than sore arm and lingering fatigue. My fever is gone and temp back down to 98.3. I had COVID back in early December, so I expected this type of immune response with the first vaccine dose.

About three hours after and I felt soreness in arm but it wasn&#39;t bad. 7:00 pm - body aches and softness; chills, shivering and a fever at 2:00 am and lasted until about 6:00 am. Next day, I couldn&#39;t move because body pain was bad, and I still had chills and shivering and fever and arm rash came back - but it was less itchy and red and less painful as first dose of vaccine - used the cream from first dose and Tylenol. Saturday symptoms started going away. Sunday I woke up with no symptoms.

A week later in the afternoon of 18th, i began to have episodes of high heart rate and heart palpitations that would occur randomly without relation to movement. This happened for 24 hours and then disappeared the night of the 19th. I did have to take off work on the 19th because of it. I checked in with my OB ( I am 29 weeks pregnant) and they were not able to think of anything that would be causing the random periods of high heart rate that only lasted 24 hours as I had not been experiencing this previously.

I was having severe chills - never experienced these kinds of chills before. I took Tylenol. I tried to still go to work but I by was having difficulty breathing and on January 11, I called my primary care Dr. and waited for appt but on January 13, there was no appt available and she told me to go ER. ER  part of medical group/hospital. They told me I might have COVID.  Dr said severe reaction to vaccine. I was still having trouble breathing. I have albuterol inhaler that I use as needed. I had it in my bag and I used that (and I had been using it when I was having trouble breathing but it wasn&#39;t helping like it could have ). They sent me home but I was still having trouble breathing. I had difficulty breathing for about about three days and then it resolved. I followed up with my PCP - video visit after two days after ER and then I had an office visit with her. After two weeks, I felt recovered. Although my right arm still have pain - pinching sharp pain in my arm that comes.

Over the course of an hour the swelling in my right side of my face became so pronounced that my gums were hard affecting the shape of my lips. I got out of bed and brushed my teeth, flossed, mouthwashed and salt water rinsed wondering if I&#39;d maybe gotten something stuck in my teeth and went back to bed. By 1 am I was awoken by feeling like my teeth were going to fall out of my head it kept me up most of the night. I could feel my heart beating in my teeth. By morning, I had a small tear in my gums and the fluid had drained from the gums but there was an excess of tissue kind of hanging off my gums. I had typical mild fever and fatigue on Saturday, I took one dose of motrin. By Sunday the swelling was gone and my mouth felt better but I do continue to have some numbness on my upper right lip.

Took stomach meds (pepto bismol) with no effect.  Went to sleep and woke up in the middle of night with stabbing pain in my stomach. used a heating pad to help me go back to sleep.  the 2nd day my stomach felt as if it was a balloon- extremely bloated and it hurt to breath deep, and stand straight. Took pepto, gas x, and also tried tums- nothing helped.  Today is day 3, and I am back to feeling normal aside from still being very tired, and hazy.  No more stomach issues.  Called doctor to see what I should do today, and was advised to not take the second dose.  Would like a second opinion.

BP 102/58, HR 64, RRR no murmur, CTAB no wheezes. Patient was diaphoretic for less than a minute, then this resolved. She stated that the worst issue was feeling like she was going to have diarrhea. Confirmed patient has no allergies and she had taken zofran in the past with good relief and no adverse reaction and 4 mg ODT was given to patient. After a few minutes, patient felt able to ambulate to bathroom, we walked her to front lobby bathroom area and instructed her to wait another 15 minutes in observation area to make sure no further issues. She is going to have friends come to pick her up and lives with a friend and her fiance who will be able to monitor her.

                                                I have been experiencing tinnitus and potential hearing lose in right ear. When I first noticed it, I had a numbness by my right ear which subsided but three weeks later, I still have a ringing in my ear which I have never had issues with my ears and I am nervous to get the second dose. There are multiple reports of this very thing on website and it is concerning.

                                                I was 30 &#43; 2 weeks at the time of my second Moderna vaccine. My due date is 4/22/2021. Pregnancy has been uneventful until the second Moderna vaccine. At 3:00 am (14 hours post vaccine), I woke up with the urge to go to the bathroom. I went, urinated, and had a small amount of diarrhea. I laid back down and within 30 second had urge to go again. I repeated this six times back to back. I began to have severe lower abdominal cramping and could not sleep again. I didn&#39;t know if I had to urinate or defecate but the urge was extremely severe and constant. My temperature began to rise, and I was shaking/aching severely. I took 500 mg tylenol at 5:45 am and that kept my temperature around 99.5 (normal 97.5).  Around 7:30 am I called my OB and they told me to go to emergency/labor and delivery ward of the hospital. At this time, my diarrhea and urge to defecate to stop and it turned to a constant urge to urinate with near constant, severe, lower abdominal cramping. At the labor and delivery ward, they monitored the baby (stable and moving the whole time), did a fetal fibronectin (normal), did a CBC (normal except preexisting mild anemia), and a urinalysis (normal). Hospital determined I was not in labor and did not have UTI so they sent me home. I continued to have temperature raises (up to 100.4 but always took tylenol at this point), severe lethargy, no appetite, severe abdominal cramping, constant urge to urinate, severe shaking, etc. until approximately 8 or 9 pm that evening (32 hours post vaccine). Everything except the constant urge to urinate resolved. Three days post vaccine (evening of 2/15/2021), I began to urinate large blood clots. I scheduled an appointment with my OB for a repeat urinalysis and urine culture. I had the appointment on 2/16/2021 and the only abnormality was hematuria. Urine culture was negative. Doctor prescribed 7 days of antibiotics just in case (while waiting for urine culture). My symptoms finally resolved on 2/19/2021 (7 days after vaccination), with slow improvement after urinating the large blood clots. I have not had any symptoms since then and my baby appears healthy still in utero. I have no history of UTIs.

                                                I received my 2nd COVID19 moderna vaccine on 2/12/21. For 24-48 hours after I had fatigue, poor appetite, fevers (up to 103F), chills, and body aches. On 3/3/21 at around 12:15pm while sitting at my desk, I noticed heart palpitations. I checked by apple watch which said my heart rate was 130. I stepped outside for fresh air, came back to my desk and felt unusual for the rest of the day. I called my PCP who saw me on 3/4/21. EKG in office was normal. Labs checked. Stopped levothyroxine until TSH levels returned. On Monday 3/8/21 PCP called to tell me my TSH was 0.6 (down from 1.3 in 12/2020). Recommended dose change from 75mcg levothryoxine daily to every other day. I took my levothyroxine, felt ok throughout the day, and then at night I was up for 3 hours with heart palpitations. The next day I called my PCP who recommended we go down on the dose to 50 mcg. I got this from the pharmacy and took the dose on Friday, 3/12. After, I developed shaking/tremors, anxiety, palpitations, poor concentration, and overall ill. I saw an endocrinologist who recommended stopping the thyroid medication all together for a couple of weeks. On Monday, 3/15/21 my TSH was 1.49, rest of the thyroid panel was normal, and TPO 81.  I had repeat blood work on 3/22/21 at my TSH was 1.40. In 3 weeks, I have only take 2 doses of levothyroxine/synthroid. A medication I have been on since 2014. Endocrinologist diagnosed mild thyroiditis, recommends no thyroid medication at this time. Will repeat labs in 1 month. Symptoms slowly improving.

I kept saying i needed to go home, so he called an uber to my apartment. Nose was running, blurry vision, unable to walk alone when uber came to pick me and partner up. Kept seeing black and white stars when trying to cross the road to uber. Once I got home, I had watery stool in my underwear and had to stay on toilet for 30 minutes for watery stool to pass. Then kept alternating between feeling cold and hot while under blankets. Slept for 5 hours. Then felt fine. On Sunday, slept for about 15 hours - 18 hours. Throat kept hurting. Today, Monday, feel better but throat feels like there is a lump in it.

                                                One week after first dose of vaccine, I noticed excessive fatigue and a swollen lymph node in my neck. I did have the normal reaction of fatigue and arm soreness in the immediate days after, but that went away, and the next week I started feeling too tired to do typical daily activities. I am usually a very early riser and I worked out 5 days a week, but suddenly it felt impossible to get out of bed. These same symptoms have continued since January and are not improving. It&#39;s a very mild fatigue, but it is still bothersome and it&#39;s impacting my functioning.

                                                I received the vaccination at 7PM on 3/12/2021. At approximately 5AM on 3/13/2021 I woke up from sleep as a result of intense pain in my left arm emanating from the site of injection.  As the day progressed this pain got exponentially worse.  I took over the counter pain medication and used cold compresses to no avail. By the evening of 3/13/2021 I was completely debilitated as a result of the pain, it was severe, unending and excruciating. That evening, I was unable to move or use my left arm in any way and my left hand began to experience pain and swelling. lost all range of motion in my left arm and use of my left hand&#39;s ability to grip. As the evening worse on I became unable to ambulate without complete assistance (e.g. move or sit up in bed, change my clothes, walk down stairs) because doing so would result in small movements in my left arm that were completely excruciating. Any time my arm moved in any way I was effectively jumping out of my skin and screaming in agony. This pain was not alleviated in any way by any over the counter pain medications. The pain and symptoms were persistently terrible through the evening of 3/14/2021 when they began to slowly subside. I experienced lighter, lingering pain in this area for more than a week.

                                                The first day, I experienced a very sore arm, like many people, some hours after the event. The next day at work (around 10 am) I felt sleepy and fatigued. However, as noted, I am chronically ill, so I didn&#39;t think much of it. I believe that was the day that my faintness/lightheadedness started, but again, I have a lot of symptoms that come and go so I didn&#39;t pay it much mind. I also had diarrhea and nausea, but same reasoning. By Saturday I was really noticing the lightheadedness/faintness, especially on standing. I would have to lean for a minute against something on standing and felt like I was going to black out. I was also sleepy and low energy, but had trouble falling asleep. Sunday was bad as well and I had insomnia again, though the diarrhea cleared up by then. Today, Monday, I feel poorly, but I think it is chronic illness poorly and no longer vaccine side effect poorly (I am sleep deprived too). I have only experienced some lightheadedness on standing today and fatigue/sleepiness that may or may not be usual for me. I am putting down that I&#39;ve recovered because that is my best guess

Currently feels like there is a block or something in my right leg. Massaging it now.  -Hard to swallow/ swelling on right side of throat (I think my thyroid nodules are inflamed). Caused me to feel like my throat is closing. But I?m able to breathe fine when I don?t panic and concentrate on my breathing.  -Sense of impending doom, which relaxes when I focus on my breathing  -tingling right foot  2.5 hours after injection: left arm is starting to feel numb as well. Other symptoms persist, though oxygen levels are back to  98% and bpm is down to 88-90

                                                severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis; hallucinations; accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml; nightly terrors; fear of dying; intermittent delusions that children were taken away; intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin; This case was received via an unknown source (no reference has been entered for a health authority or license partner) on 17-Mar-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 17-Mar-2021.    This spontaneous case was reported by a pharmacist and describes the occurrence of HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) and ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) in a 30-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 031A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (Medical history was not provided).    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 3 milliliter. In March 2021, the patient experienced SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin). On 17-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml). On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 17-Mar-2021 to 18-Mar-2021 due to ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION. In March 2021, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) had resolved. On 17-Mar-2021, ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml) had resolved. At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinations), SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient did not have any psychological history; this was the first time she experienced hallucinations.  Treatment for the severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis included intravenous steroids and hydrocortisone.  Treatment for hallucinations included droperidol and lorazepam.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event (anaphylactic reaction), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding the events (Hallucination, anaphylactic reaction, sleep terror, fear of death, delusion, and formication) has been provided at this time. This report refers to a case of (accidental overdose) for mRNA-1273, lot # 031A21A. Further information has been requested.

                                                On 1/16/2021, the rash re-appeared on the site on injection and lower and has itchiness in that arm. Aside from feeling hot (no fever) and sweating at night and feeling very fatigues, my muscles were constantly twitching and I could not sleep through the night.  I would keep waking up and even felt like my hear rate had increased (felt higher than normal during these days). I was having frequent muscle aches on my arms and legs. My muscles either felt like they want to cramp or feel sore like if I was having carpal tunnel. I was having joint pain and tingling and cramping sensation on my calves, fingers, wrists.  On slight  1/15 and 1/16/21, I had slight congestion (burning sensation in nasal passages) and headache .  During that week I felt very off (not myself) and almost as if it had triggered my anxiety (not sure if it was related) and felt slightly lightheaded/dizzy.  I reached out to my primary care provider and she ordered labs to make sure potassium wasn&#39;t low or anything else abnormal going on. Labs came out normal.  I received second dose on 2/5/2021  (Moderna Lot #: 037K20A) and 8 weeks later, I am randomly having lymph node pain (under right armpit) which is the same side I received the vaccine, I randomly have been feeling like joint pain and feel slightly light headed (comes and goes).

                                                April 6th, 2021     Today at about 2:43pm, one of our technicians came to me and stated that a customer (employee too) had just got her second COVID-19 shot (Moderna), and she was at her car and not feeling well. The patient&#39;s co-worker had told us that her finger tips were numb and that she had a headache. The technician asked the customer to come back in, which she did and sat down in a chair immediately in front of me. I went directly to talk to her, as another technician was helping in the clinical services room, drawing up more shots.       I asked the patient how she was feeling, and what she was feeling.  She said she did not feel well, that her finger tips were numb, and she had this incredible pounding in the back of her head, and she ran her hand over the lower back part of her head and neck.  She looked down and I asked her again how she was doing, she said not well, that she was beginning to get light headed and was looking a little pale.  I called to the pharmacy team for help, to clear out the clinical services room and asked the technician to help me slowly walk her to the room.  As we got her in the room I asked her if she would be ok to lay down on the floor and put her feet up in a chair, briefly explaining that this would help with the dizziness and keep her safe should she faint, because she would already be on the floor. another technician popped in and asked her if she could get her a cold cloth for her forehead, Patient said yes and the technician did so. an employee was working at the computer and just quietly stayed working (for another store).  I moved around him and got the Blood Pressure Machine.  I asked the patient if it would be ok it I monitored her blood pressure, she said yes. Patient was always 100% coherent and helped move her arm for me. I asked the employee for a piece of paper to document the reading, but the technician ran and got me one.  Her first set of vitals were high.  I marked them down and the employee told me the time.  I just sat on my knees next to the patient for a while and tried to comfort her. I asked her a couple of times if she felt any change, and she said yes,     Shot given 2:40pm     2:45pm BP 149/99 Pulse 71   SX:  fingers numb, pounding in the back of her head  cool cloth placed on forehead  calmed area down &amp; quietly talked to the patient to determine how she was doing  ************************************************  (Patient volunteered that she had just gotten tested for COVID-19 and that she tested negative.) I asked patient how she was feeling and she said that she was feeling a little worse.  She said she was starting to get the shakes.  I asked her if she had gotten anything to eat on her lunch and she said no. I asked her if she felt like it and if her BP was good, how would she like a sip of juice.      ********************************************     I asked the patient how she was feeling and she stated that her tight felt ever so slightly tight, but she said &#34;I am asthmatic, and it did not feel any different than what she had experienced before.   I took her BP/P again...  2:55pm BP 157/105 Pulse 68  I looked at the employee and he looked at me, and I told the patient that I would be right back.  I quickly went and consulted with the technician and we decided that we should call 911 due to the increased in BP, pulse lower and the change in symptoms.  The technician called 611 and talked to an employee and I called 911 and explained what was going on and what our need was.  (The technician and I quickly discussed that neither of us felt that she was having an allergic reaction, just an adverse reaction, Epi was not called for. ) Employee stated that the clinic recommended we give her Benadryl.  I did a fast check w/ the technician, it was not on our standing order/ protocol. Antihistamines can exacerbate asthma.) Then I went back to the patient.  By the time I had gotten off the phone with 911, 2 more employees were in the room, and the patient was just getting off the phone with her father.  Once I got positioned in the room, one employee left,  I asked one employee sit down in a chair and the other employee was by the door leading to the pharmacy.  I told the patient that we had called for an ambulance.  I briefly explained due to her BP/P and her symptoms changing.  I asked her if she wanted another cool cloth and she said yes.  I asked an employee to get one for her from the sink in the pharmacy.  I was again kneeling at her side.  I saw her eyes well up with tears and a few tears were running down her face.  I asked another employee to get me a paper towel, which he did, and I handed it to the patient.  I tried to reassure her that things would be ok and this was just to ensure that she was safe.  She stated that she felt a little nauseated.  I then took her BP/P again.  3:05PM  BP 146/99 P 66 2 employees and I remained with the patient, all calm and I made sure she knew we were there for her.  I am not sure the time the EMTs arrived, but another employee let us know and we opened the door to let them in.  They asked the patient a lot of questions and I gave them my sheet of what I had recorded for her blood pressure and pulse (BP/P).  They asked the patient if they would help her into a sitting position, she said yes, but it was an awkward position, so I asked the patient if it would be ok if I helped support her back, she said yes, and I did just that.  I stayed with the patient until they got her situated on the gurney and I helped cover up her legs.  I went back to work when the EMT&#39;s wheeled the patient away.     The BP/P is the best of my recollection, as the EMT&#39;s took my sheet of paper.     At no time did the patient ever exhibit difficulty breathing, labored breathing or any change in her breathing.  She was calm and her chief complaint was the numbness in her fingers and the pounding headache at the back of her head.

More than a month later, I noticed the return of mild soreness at my injection site. While examining the site, I felt and visualized an obvious depression in my arm, also about 1 in x 2 inches in diameter, which appears to be muscle atrophy.

Then, black spots appeared in my vision, and I heard ringing in my right ear. I felt like I might lose consciousness, so I laid down on the ground. Within another minute, the symptoms started to pass. I never lost consciousness. This event only occurred one time.

Monday while on lunch I was driving and the world completely shifted and flipped in front of me causing me to pull over out of risk of wrecking my car. I do not have a history of dizzy spells or vertigo per se and there would be absolutely nothing that could have triggered this but the vaccine. I have an article where I am not the only one. Though I can still function im still scared to drive far and I occasionally feel like my eyes are floating

                                                Starting around 7 hours after the shot, I started to fell fatigued. My head also felt foggy. I went to sleep at 11pm, and awoke about every 3 hours. At 5 am, a terrible migraine set it. I took 1000 mg Tylenol and laid in bed for about 45minutes until it kicked in. At this time I also had complete body aches, but nothing hurt worse than my arm. The I slept another 3-3.5 hours. In the morning, the headache was less intense, the fatigue was still there but not debilitating, and the brain fog was present but minimal. I had nausea hit 3-5 times, but usually subsided within 5-10 minutes. 24 hours after the shot, I started spotting, mostly dark, chunky bits of uterine lining. I am not scheduled to start my period for 12 days. The spotting has increased - I?m now on my second tampon before heading to bed. I?ve also developed a small rash about 1-2 inches below the injection site, which feels warm, and is red in a rough square shape about 2?x2?. I still have a faint headache.

                                                On April 1, 2021 I received the first dosag of the Moderna. I left there and was fine, but on Saturday April 3, I began to swell. It started off looking like an insect bite, but as the day progressed, the bumps became knots that were painful and itchy. On April 4, I was in a lot of pain causing me not to be able to use my left arm so I did a virtual visit with Urgent Care. I was told I was experiencing the &#34;Covid Arm&#34; and to take Benadryl for the itching and bumps and Ibuprofen for the inflammation and pain, and to sit out of work. After a few days of  the Benadryl I experienced the next outbreak on April 6, and I used the virtual visit again, I was taken out of work and told to continue the Benadryl but to take it 3 times a day. Again, Benadryl worked a few days and on April 12th I had another breakout on my face, causing pain, swelling and discoloration. The doctors prescribed Prednisone and continued Benadryl. I took that for 5 days, and on Sunday April 18, I had the most recent breakout. I went to a dermatologist on 4/19 and was given triamcinolone cream, allegra and benadryl. I have to return in 2 weeks to be examined again. This allergic reaction has been ongoing for 19 days, and counting.

                                                Patient came in for her first scheduled Moderna vaccine. When the pharmacist went out to give the vaccine, the patient was visibly scared. She was crying and bouncing her leg nervously. When asked if she still wanted to get the vaccine, she said yes. Once given Moderna the patient felt dizzy. She was instructed to set back into the chair to prevent a fall. While dizzy, the patient again started crying. She did not actually lose consciousness. The patient was attended to closely (the pharmacist stayed with her throughout the duration). After 10 minutes the patient said she was feeling warm and was given a cold wet paper towel. After 10 more minutes the patient said she was doing okay and wanted to leave to get a drink. She left and was instructed to come back around 5 (she would be on lunch at the time). The patient returned and said she was fine.

                                                By 14:30 on April 21 I started to get body aches, nausea, a headache, and felt off. At 07:00 April 22 I woke up with severe body pain, a headache and a temperature of 102*. I utilized Tylenol to bring the fever down to 100* by 10:00. It rose again at 14:00 and 18:00 to 102* requiring more Tylenol. The fever broke around 02:00 on April 23. Body aches continue but not as severe. My injection side was sore April 21 and by 20:00 on April 22 it was very painful and became a large lump about the size of a golf ball. By 07:00 April 23, the injection site was still very swollen and painful but now is warm to the touch, and bright red.

I usually start my period at the same time of the month, but after the vaccine shot, period symptoms started and my period began earlier than normal.

                                                Day 2 after the 1st dosage of the Covid 19 vaccine (Moderna) I noticed that I had a slight cough. I was not feeling ill. Other than the tiredness. The cough would come and go. It was in no sense persistent. Day 3 after the vaccine, my cough returned in morning, around 10:00AM. I was no longer feeling any of the described side effects but this cough was now noticeable. It went away in the afternoon, around 2:00pm. It returned at night, briefly before bed time at around 11:00pm. Day 4 the cough was all day. On and off. If I got excited and if I moved around too much it felt like an asthma cough. I would then feel uncomfortable in my breathing. It persisted all day. At night I could not lay down to sleep. I needed to be propped up. I needed to use my Alvesco inhaler. Day 5, In the morning the cough was not immediate, I used an air purifier the entire night and day. Used the Inhaler again. My breathing felt unconformable but it was not as bad as day 4. Day 6, the cough was gone. Only when going up stairs or moving around too much did it come back for a few mins then would go away. Inhaler used again at night. No air purifier. Am able to sleep laying down again. Day 7 I am feeling better now and no longer have discomfort breathing. No longer need inhaler.

A couple hours later chills set in, aching, joint pain, and fatigue increased. Occasionally had a running nose, pain in abdomen when bending over like knife being drawn in a line across my hips. by 4:00 pm, so achy, tired, and nauseous. Terrible chills, followed by occasional hot flashes. No fever anytime it was taken. Could not do more than lay on floor and turn a quart of the way over. By 8:00 pm, symptoms start to ease. Am able to walk again. Back to chills/hot flashes, aches, joint pain, fatigue, runny nose, and shortness of breath. Day 2: Wake at 6 am feeling achy like my whole body had been tensed for a day, was awake off and on during the night with hot flashes/chills and body pain. Went through the day achy and fatigued, with no temperature control. Started feeling worse around 5 pm, but tolerable. Still short of breath. Day 3: Wake at 3:50 am with horrible aching in lymph nodes from armpits up through neck. Still rapidly rotating from chills to hot flashes. Do not sleep until 6 am. Get up at 7:30. Go through day mostly fatigued and a little achy. Had chills/hot flashes till approximately 11 am. Around 2 am aching in neck started to set in and increased throughout evening to the time of this report. Neck is so still and sore I can barely turn my head.

                                                I had a fever which started to increase dramatically; my site of injection was bright, bright red and super swollen and I started to trace it because it was growing so rapidly and it was hard. My fever got past 102. My injection site was almost as big as my upper arm - the redness and the swollenness was huge and it had irregular borders which suggested infection.. Day 3 had doubled it&#39;s size in a matter of hours. I did a telehealth visit - and they prescribed antibiotics: Clindamycin - 300 mg - 3 times a day for seven days. I felt so sick that I was out of work for three days. It took a few days after the antibiotics before it cleared up - so don&#39;t know if it was a Staph infection or if it was a reaction to vaccine. After the prescription, my arm was still super discolored for weeks.

I did not take my temperature, but assume I had a fever. I took ibuprofen and slept a lot. The symptoms would get slightly better and I would be hot. Then I&#39;d be extra achey and freezing all over again. This repeated several times. I received my shot approximately 48 hours ago. I still feel queasy, slightly achey, have a headache, and have tenderness in the arm where I received my injection.

She has Biphasic delayed protracted anaphylaxis as a result of multi drug allergy syndrome and her symptoms were consistent with that in this case as she has had this kind of on going response to other anaphylaxis events in the past.  She had severe joint pain for more than 2 weeks and has ongoing recurrent hives on the injection site that have not completely subsided yet.  She developed additional allergic responses and ultimately ended up in the ER after this and was seen by local allergist who advised DO NOT take next shot/vaccination.

                                                Remained in waiting room for 15 minutes as per instructions from medical staff. Within approximately 10 minutes of administration, I experienced a wave of warmth that led to a feeling that I would pass out. Called out to nursing staff that I was feeling &#34;dizzy&#34; (didn&#39;t know what else to call it). It was not like normal dizziness. Remained seated with legs stretched out to try to combat the feeling I would pass out. Nurses checked my blood pressure and it was in the low 70&#39;s. Along with low blood pressure, I experienced temporary hearing loss in left ear, nausea (feeling I could throw up), feeling I could diarrhea/defecate immediately (but held it in for obvious reasons), mental confusion. Nurses called the Emergency Department at my local hospital and told me I should (based on symptoms) be admitted to the hospital. Nurse said my blood pressure wasn&#39;t stabilizing at a normal rate of a typical vasovagal reaction. Nurse withheld administering Epipen and monitored the course of my symptoms. EMTs arrived and checked my vitals again in the Ambulance. In the Ambulance, I recall the technician saying my blood pressure was somewhere around 140. This reading is abnormally high for me (my typical blood pressure is around 110). I declined admission to the hospital due to my horrible medical insurance and worry about exorbitant costs. Symptoms did not resolve until approximately 50 minutes after the start of the incident (approx. 9:22 AM).

It was a true allergic reaction, my injection site was hot to the touch for hours. My skin did turn a little purple once in the hospital and I?ve missed two days of work looking like three due to this reaction to the vaccine.

                                                While at my doctors office for a routine visit, I experienced my body attempt to pass out, suddenly, as a blood sample was taken for a vitamin D test. I lost hearing with a ringing in my ears, was sweating profusely, could not support myself to sit up and my vision was going in and out, as I couldn?t keep my eyes open. My heart was racing, and the nurse said my lips went blue. The doctor and his nurses were able to get me into a bed and raise my feet above my head for 5-10 minutes to get the blood to come back to my head. I recovered within about 30 mins, as my heart beat slowly  calmed, and my vision and hearing restored. The rest of the day and the following day I experienced severe fatigue and brain fog - it felt like I was moving and thinking in slow motion.   A couple of days later I had a follow up with my primary care physician, as I was fearful from what I experienced. The doctor told me it happened because I had just been vaccinated with the 2nd shot the day before the blood was taken, and it somehow caused my body to go into shock.   I have given dozens of blood samples over my life time and never experienced anything like that. I do not have fear of needles and am completely comfortable with having blood taken. What I experienced was scary. I genuinely felt I was going to die and it happened with no warnings, and at a seemingly random time.   I experienced my heart racing uncontrollably after the first dose, but didn?t report it as I wasn?t sure it was significant. I want to share this experience because it was very traumatic for me.

                                                Flu-like symptoms for the first 3 days: fever, chills, body aches, headache, itchy skin, pain in injection site (left arm). A few days later I started my period. It was irregular with severe PMS, panic attacks, anxiety and depression, severe cramping, more bleeding and blood clots than usual, period lasted longer than usual. Every day since I have been having PMS symptoms (anxiety, depression, panic attacks) and cramping. The cramping feels like period cramps but I am no longer on my period. The cramps last all day long and are not going away. I also had severe eye pain in my right eye about 1 week after the injection. The pain lasted for about 2 days, and was a throbbing pain behind my eyeball. I have never experienced any issues with my eyes before. I also had covid January 2021 and did not experience any of these symptoms then.

                                                The day I received the shot I had fatigue and pain in all my joints as described though I am not sure if it was normal as I returned home at 10am and proceeded to fall asleep till 7pm even though the night before I had my regular 8hrs of slumber. The following week I was supposed to have my period. Instead I had abdominal cramping and the period did not come. It came 2 weeks after that (so 3 weeks total of abdominal cramping) aka my period was 2 weeks late. The period also did not discharge as normal (bloody mucus pieces over 5 days), it came out in one go as a decidual cast (with some bloody spotting for half a day tops). Honestly if I wasn&#39;t abstinent for 2021 I would have thought I got pregnant and just miscarried. After the  decidual cast left my body the abdominal cramping ceased. I have previously never had a decidual cast and at most in my entire life, my period has been 5 days late.  In addition, just 24 hrs after receiving the 1st dose and still ongoing today is that I erupted in cystic acne on my face, chest, shoulders, and back. I do have adult acne but on average I would have 2-3 pimples on my shoulders at any given time. After the shot I was sporting 15&#43; pimples in each of these locations. This may be hormonal acne due to the strange menstruation situation from above. I work from home and had to forge wearing a bra as the straps and bands would irritate the acne and cause them to form a &#39;head&#39; and then rip open and burst from contact.

I thought this was a normal reaction. 2nd day, I was nauseated all day. On 5/28 around 10pm, I started to itch really badly. When I woke up from trying to sleep, at 7am on 5/29 I woke up to hives all over my body. I went to urgent care around 11am and they determined I was allergic to the vaccine shot from checking on me. I was prescribed a high steroid immediately with an injection in my butt and they also sent me a prescription of steroids to take for several days.

                                                Exactly 2 weeks after having the second moderna COVID vaccine, the patient developed acute chest pain and shortness of breath. She was evaluated in the ER. Negative troponins, normal EKG, negative CT angio PE. She followed up with a cardiologist. Echocardiogram was normal. She was treated for presumed pericarditis with colchicine and NSAIDS with no improvement in symptoms. She had very severe chest pain and shortness of breath at times to the point that it was difficult to breathe and do light exertion. There was a second ER visit a month later for the same symptoms negative for acute MI/ heart failure. Cardiac event monitor showed many PVCs and there is slight symptom improvement with metoprolol but she is still symptomatic to some degree 2.5 months later. She is following up with general cardiology and electophysiology. There was also a TSH elevation at the time that symptoms started. This resolved upon recheck about 6 weeks later with no change in levothyroxine dose and a thyroid ultrasound was normal.

                                                On April 15th, the otherwise healthy 30 year old daughter of my cousin passed away in a hospital from a massive stroke and seizures related to encephalitis of unknown cause.    She recovered easily from Covid19 back in November of 2020, along with several of her close friends and family members with no lingering effects.  On March 30th, she was given a single dose of the Moderna vaccine along with her teaching colleagues at a local high school. She initially complained of mild nausea and vomiting but quickly developed a severe headache prompting her to visit the local ER where she received treatment for a migraine. She returned to the ER at least one more time after no relief from the headache. By April 3rd,Saturday, she no longer recognized her sister nor knew what a mask was for.  Her family rushed her again to the same ER and she was subsequently transferred the following day to a Hospital.   Due to dangerously high intracranial pressure, she suffered a stroke with paralysis of her left side and a seizure.  Multiple lesions were noted on her brain via MRI. A shunt was inserted to relieve the pressure, she was intubated and placed into a deep coma from which she would never awaken.  Despite these medical interventions and pharmacological interventions, the pressure did not subside.  A craniotomy was performed the following Saturday as a last ditch effort to relieve the unrelenting pressure in her brain.  The craniotomy was able to reduce the pressure but it was too late.  There was no longer any brain activity and my cousin&#39;s daughter was removed from life support after they were able to say their goodbyes.     The medical examiner will be examining her brain to attempt to find a cause but that report may take 6 months.

That evening I was tired and had a bit of a fever, but felt fine.  The following days were fine, except I was under a lot of stress at work and on the 3rd day I flew to  for a Bachelorette party weekend where I drank alcohol and stayed out a little later than usual. I get fine however. On the 5th day we spent it drinking on a boat and after leaving the boat exhaustion and the vertigo of being on a boat never left. I?ve been feeling this way since May 15 and it is now June 4. I?ve seen an ENT that thought it might be allergy related so I was tested for that, but I?m fine. I?m awaiting a full panel of blood test results from my Functional Doctor. Rest, relaxation haven?t helped. I?ve had brain fog, exhaustion and vertigo for almost 3 weeks now.

The area around the injection site was swollen, red, and painful to touch. I fell over on my way to the toilet due to extreme dizziness. I had three hours of diarrhea, and then took pepto bismal and bennydryl. Those remedies worked and my symptoms subsided and I was able to fall back asleep by 4am. In the morning I felt normal, besides some remaining pain and redness surrounding the injection site.

                                                Presumed right arm muscle injury.  Several hours after the injection my arm was extremely sore and painful. The joint was painful as well. No redness or swelling. It was tender to touch. I was having difficulty reaching my arm up or moving it upward. Ex: it hurt to lift my hand to touch my face.  I also couldn?t let it fall. If I got my arm above my head I would have to assist it down. I couldn?t sleep that night because of the pain. I was having trouble with pushing movements in that arm. And also letting it hang dependently (like letting my arm hang when I hinged forward). I started taking Motrin 24 hours after the injection. Motrin helped, so I took it Friday and Saturday. Sunday, my arm felt 99% back to normal.  Monday and Tuesday I didn?t notice anything.   Wednesday  morning I woke up with the same pain again and difficulty moving my arm. Wednesday night, I couldn?t sleep again because of the pain/couldn?t get my arm in a comfortable position. I?m taking Motrin, with not as much relief as before. I?ve applied heat and I?ve tried to stretch it as well.   The only way i really know how to describe it? is that it feels as if my deltoid was injured. And my other muscles are fine. It?s hindering my movement in that arm. It is again, tender to touch my deltoid area. The tightness has extended in to my shoulder and neck. It has now been 8 days since my vaccination.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the first dose of moderna vaccine on my right arm, my arm felt numb and tingly.  My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

                                                10:47a went into a room to wait for 15 minutes directly after the injection. Began to feel somewhat dizzy right afterwards. Continued back to my office. Informed my supervisor that I was feeling dizzy but informed him that I had a couple bites of oatmeal, and a few cups of coffee and was going to try and eat something and hydrate and I?m sure I would feel better. I went back to work for about an hour (I work at a desk). For about an hour I continued to feel dizzy and noticed I was cloudy and was staring off. After an hour I really became dizzy and walked to my supervisors office and informed him. It felt as though I was walking on the moon to get to his office. I also felt like I had a uti. I sat down in his office and informed him of what happened. As I was talking to him I began to pass out. I did not go out the whole way but he began speaking to me more. After feeling a little better I walked back over to my office. I felt waves of dizziness and being hot and cold. My husband came and picked me up around 1:30p from work. I felt better after getting in the car and going home. Once I was home I ate and had began to feel better. Around 6:00p I began to go through another wave and was experiencing body aches, hot and cold sweats, loss of appetite, tingling all over my body but mostly in my legs and feet. At that point I went in and laid down in bed for the rest of the night. Probably around 9:00p I began to feel better. I attempted to fall asleep around 11:00p but when I closed my eyes I felt like they were racing back and forth. So I got back up and watched something in tv until I fell asleep maybe about 30 minutes later. I woke up the next morning around 8:45a. I tossed and turned most of the night, however I felt better. It was like I had the flu for a few days and on the last day I felt better but was under the weather. At this point in the morning I was fatigued. I was able to perform some tasks around the house.  I then laid back down in bed for a few hours because I was beginning to feel dizzy and was experiencing hot and cold sweats. After a few hours I got up from bed and performed a few more tasks around the house. Then was able to sit down on the couch and watch some tv. At this point I?m still expediting tingling in my body at times. Still a little dizzy but able to focus and hot and cold sweats.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

                                                Developed severe itching starting on my forearms overnight on Thursday going into Friday that week after I received the vaccine. The itching progressed to my stomach/trunk and back. The more I itched, the itching worsened and pink bumps would immediately appear. The left side by my rib and over my left breast were the worst impacted. The bumps later appeared to join. I went to the ER that Saturday 1/9/21 after two doses of Benadryl didn?t help. I was prescribed oral antibiotics starting at 60mg a day for two days, then tapered down 10mg every 10 days. I?m currently on day 1 of 20mg. Also took Benadryl as the itching was keeping me from sleeping. I was also prescribed clobetasol cream to administer twice a day. Symptoms have markedly improved. The rash is now the same feeling as my skin, not bumpy. Hyperpigmentation remains. I?m being followed by my dermatologist whom I saw Monday 1/11/21. She performed a punch skin biopsy.

                                                I started noticing a blister type rash/bumps on my hands, wrists, elbows, and bottom of my feet 9 days after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. On the 10th day, I noticed it was getting worse and some of the spots were an itchy/burning feeling (it woke me up at night). On the 11th day, I went to the doctor and was prescribed oral prednisone (60 mg x 3 days, 40 mg x 3 days. 20 mg x 3 days, 10 mg x 4 days), hydroxyzine PRN for itching, and triamcinolone ointment. The rash started improving after 2 days on prednisone and I only used the ointment and hydroxyzine for 2 days.

                                                Patient had an appointment for her first Covid vaccination today at 10:30am. Pt came in feeling fine but anxious about getting her vaccination. Pt also mentioned to both intern and I that she is a hypochondriac. She got her IM vaccination and sat down for 15 minutes as we monitored her. After her 15 minutes of sitting down in pharmacy area and being monitored by our intern and pharmacist, they asked how she&#39;s doing. Pt expressed she felt fine but had a dry mouth, and the intern told her to call 911 immediately if any shortness of breath occurred, but patient felt fine and left. About 25 minutes later she returned and expressed that she had a metallic taste in her mouth and was anxious about the shot. We asked her to sit down so we can monitor her further and she did. Five minutes later she expressed tongue swollen a little and a little difficulty swallowing but had no trouble breathing. At that time pharmacy intern and I (pharmacist) decided to give the epipen injection and patient agreed. We had the patient sit down for another 30 minutes as we monitored her. Minutes later, pt started to feel better as we continuously monitored her. During this time patient requested water due to dry mouth. We handed her a bottle of water but asked her to please sip and not take big gulps. After 30 minutes patient felt better. No swollen tongue, no difficulty swallowing or breathing and anxiety had been relieved. Patient was notified by pharmacy to call MD to let him know of reaction and was also told to call 911 immediately if have any further reaction. PT felt comfortable to leave at this point.

Within a few minutes, I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I waited out the 15 minutes and went back to my office. When I got into my office I still felt lightheaded and I informed my supervisor. I explained to him that I was going to try and eat something and drink some water and I would feel better. I went into my office and continued to work for the next hour. After that hour, I began to feel very dizzy and &#34;out of it&#34; as I almost didn&#39;t know where I was at. I went to speak to my supervisor and I sat down in his office where I almost fainted. He took me back to my office where I sat with another co-worker. Duri time, I continued to feel light headed, although it came in waves. My husband drove me home, I showered, ate something and was feeling better. Around 6:00p, I began to feel lightheaded again and began to experience body aches, hot and cold flashes that would come in waves. Saturday morning, I woke up feeling better, but around 10:00a I began to experience the same symptoms. I laid down for a few hours that would get up and attempt tasks around the house, then I would  ended up back in bed at 6:00p with the same symptoms again. I did meet virtually with a doctor and she explained to me to wait it out. On Monday, I met with my pcp and she informed me of the same, that these symptoms would eventually go away. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the only symptom that remained was the dizziness. At times, I still will feel dizzy for instance Saturday morning I woke up and felt pretty dizzy throughout the day.

Pain, swelling, redness, and toughness began to dissipate around Day 5 and was markedly improved by Day 8 when I completely returned to normal activities.  Additionally, the first day after the vaccination, I experienced muscle aches/pains and severe generalized fatigue that almost made me call out from work. This fatigue and muscle pain was very strong for ~72 hours after the vaccination. However, I was still able to go to work, though my productivity was not the same given the amount of fatigue I experienced and the inability to utilize my right arm to the same degree I would during a normal work day.

                                                Was fine immediately post vaccine. Drove home and proceeded with a normal rest of the day at home. Went to sleep around 10 pm. Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

No relief with Excedrin. Fever broke 1/28 around 7AM All day today (1/28) I have alternated between chills and sweating. Aches are now mostly in my upper left back and hips/thighs. I have a large rash covering my left deltoid, where I received the injection.

The injector told me that she felt my muscle spasm as she put the needle in. Within one hour, my arm got very sore to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it. I am now 6 days later and still have extreme pain in my left arm and have a hard time sleeping due to the discomfort.

                                                After waiting my 15 minutes I got up to leave. I put my children in the vehicle and then called my husband. I noticed the tip and the right side of my tongue was tingly. I felt as if I had a lump in my throat. I looked in the mirror and my tongue was not red or swollen. I stayed in the parking lot and spoke with my husband incase I did have an anaphylactic reaction. My symptoms started getting better and fading around 9:45 AM, so I left the parking lot. I notified the vaccine clinic via text message of the reaction after I had already left the site. They offered me to see a provider, but the symptoms already started to go away, so he advised me to take benadryl when I got to my location.  Once I got to my location benadryl was no longer needed because the symptoms were gone. This was about 45 minutes to an hour after the vaccine was administered.

Slowly over time, pain began to worsen and expand down into fingertips, down side and up my neck. By 5pm, experienced severe shooting pain up and down right side, left arm and inability to move neck to the right. Severe tightness of neck muscles, back and arm on right side making movement difficult. Diarrhea, mild confusion, increased heart rate, body aches strong enough to release urinary muscles, chills, and headache. Pain level 8/10. Morning after (almost 24hrs past injection) still shooting pain down both arms, tightness in neck, arm and back, shooting pain down right side to all extremities, nausea, and headache.

                                                About 30 minutes after vaccine delivery I had a very fast heartbeat and felt warmth and a tingle go down my right hand. I felt woozy and had to pull over. When the police arrived, my pulse, oxygen level, and blood pressure were all normal though my blood pressure was 98, on the high end of normal. It took about 30 minutes for my head to clear and I still feel slightly out of it. The paramedic said my description was consistent with an adrenaline rush. I felt a lesser version of this after the first dose but they said I was probably dehydrated and sent me on my way.

                                                -Initially I had moderate side effects to my 2nd shot, shortness of breath/increase of asthma symptoms, severe joint pain, flu-like symptoms (slight fever, chills, loss of appetite, inability to sleep) lasting for a total of 4 days. I have anaphylaxis to Walnuts (2x needed epipen and hospitalization) and asthma, many seasonal allergies, and am highly biologically sensitive (have broken out in hives several times),  -8 days later I traveled to a high altitude location (Aspen, CO), and had 4 glasses of wine over a 8 hour period. For the next two days I skiied for 5 hours, going up to 12,500 ft in altitude. On the first morning after arrival I started feeling badly, with symptoms including dizziness, asthma symptoms (unusual for me as it is only exercise-induced), a headache in the front of my head, and a slight redness in my left eye. As the days increase my symptoms increased to the point of inability to leave the house. After 3 days I received an IV, oxygen, that did not help. On day 4 I went to the hospital after a virtual appointment with a clinician and had chest xrays taken as Hospital (never received the results) and was put on Diamox 250MG 2x/day, this helped slightly. Day 6 I left and traveled back to CT at low altitude, my symptoms did not improve immediately and got worse (eyes became significantly more red by this point), asthma and dizziness increased). Two days after arriving home I went to two doctors who misdiagnosed me with a sinus infection, water in my middle left year and left lung, and conjunctivitis. I was given antibiotic eyedrops that had no improvement for 36 hours. Upon receiving a 1mg cortisone shot these symptoms improved, I was also given 500MG of a Z-pack type antibiotic 1x day/4 days. I went to my PCP, doctor who was able to accurately diagnose my symptoms as an immune response to being unable to acclimatize due to my moderate immune response to the 2nd shot. My body went through significant inflammation. He treated me with Prednisone and continued my antibiotic.

This progressed through the night to include restlessness, trouble sleeping, headache, and hot spells. These symptoms continued for the entire next day and that morning I noticed a half dollar sized red splotch below the injection site. This spot was warm and tender to the touch.  By 36 hours after my injection my symptoms were gone but the arm splotch had grown to hand sized and was still warm and tender to the touch.

                                                Around 4 PM I started getting chills. I took Ibuprofen and it was much easier. It started coming back around 7:00 pm. I had super sensitive skin and chills that night and didn&#39;t sleep very much, if at all. I didn&#39;t go to work that day because I still had a fever in the morning. It broke mid-morning but I was nauseous all day and had a headache. I still had a headache the following day and I didn&#39;t want to eat the next day although I wasn&#39;t nauseous. Also on that third day- the redness and swelling started in my arm where the injection site was on the right arm. It was swollen, hot to touch. I called the Dr. again. I got a different doctor than the first dose. She thought it was an allergic reaction. She said to try antihistamines that day but if it didn&#39;t get better she did prescribe a different kind of antibiotic I took the antihistamines that day and it didn&#39;t get any better. So than I took the antibiotic and it got better. It was better by Friday evening.

                                                30 minutes after admin of IM, I developed tingling around the mouth and had a panic attack which I thought may be related to anxiety. However, I got the second shot and tingling around my mouth and tongue continued with some heighted anxiety but no panic attack. Two weeks after the last shot the tingling has continued on and off feeling like neuropathy of the tongue and mouth. It typically last thirty minutes or so and then subsides. This has happened 3 x since getting the second shot 3 weeks ago.

I also experienced cognitive function issues - memory gaps, brain fog, and could not walk a straight line. Those went away after the first week or so. I also had headache, body aches, fever, chills, dehydration, joint pain, and severe fatigue. This affected my daily life for about a week and half.

She stated as she got in to her car and began to drive away she felt her face become &#34;numb and tingly&#34; and returned to the facility right away. Upon entering the facility and reporting her concern, she was assisted to sit down in the side lobby area and VS assessed. She reported her face felt &#34;numb and tingly.&#34; She denied any SOB or difficulty swallowing at that time. She reported her eyes &#34;feel weird,&#34; but denied any vision changes. She also reported a scratchy throat and reported it sounded like she was &#34;under water.&#34; At 1225 she reported her eyes to be &#34;not that bad anymore.&#34; VS reassessed at 1230. She continued to report no SOB or other symptoms. At 1244 she reported her symptoms to be less or unchanged. Final assessed and this patient reported she felt good to go home. She was given Benadryl PO by pharmacy staff and denied any questions.

Her heart rate sped up (&gt;120) and her blood pressure was elevated (&gt;140). Her oxygen saturation level was normal. She was observed at the vaccination waiting area for 30 minutes, but ultimately moved to the urgent care for additional monitoring and management. After 15 minutes there she was given a dose of epinephrine. She reported relief from her clinical symptoms including abatement of the  flushing, itching, and anxiety. She will take Benadryl at home and consider her Epipen if needed. She will follow-up with me on the increased blood pressure and heart rate

                                                Itching all over the body started about 2 hours after receiving the vaccine ( around 11:30am). At noon, I noticed I was dizzy and weak, and I couldn&#39;t stand up without holding onto something. The itching got worse as the day went on and became intense and painful around 3pm. At that time, I noticed a rash on both arms, my legs and my chest, so I took 25mg of hydroxyzine (prescribed by my doctor) which has been helpful in the past for itching and rashes. Around 7pm, I had hives on my arms and legs, and the itching was getting worse and more painful. I also had intense itching on my face, especially on/around my nose. I took another 25mg of hydroxyzine but the itching wasn&#39;t subsiding and at that point, it was so bad that I couldn&#39;t focus on anything else. At 9pm, I still had hives and itching but also noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and it felt as though my throat was closing up. This continued throughout the night, with it being at its worst between 1-3am on March 12th. I woke up and the rash was gone, but the itchiness is still present and I&#39;m having trouble breathing. I keep choking and gasping for air.

                                                I received my vaccine at 4:09 pm on Thursday, March 11th, 2021. At 4:45 pm I began to get visual abnormalities while driving home in the right quarter of my visual field. It started with perceived motion on the right quarter of my vision that I would compare to the visual effects that occur after staring at an optical illusion , and proceeded to reduced peripheral vision in that side that lasted for about 20 minutes. at 5:00 pm I noticed I was having difficulty reading and typing text messages in my phone, as it felt like I had extreme dyslexia and very low reading comprehension. At 5:35 pm I called my sister, a pharmacy student in Boston, to try to explain my symptoms, but found myself having extreme word aphasia. I could not describe what was happening to me and couldn&#39;t recall family members&#39; names, descriptive words, or the name of my dog. I tried to stay calm while she looked things up and began cooking and listening to a podcast, since my comprehension of spoken words was fine. My headache got worse and I took an ibuprofen by 6:00pm. My boyfriend called me at 6:36 pm to check on me, and I found myself talking fluidly to him on the phone. I called my sister to reassure her and the visual abnormalities and reading and speaking issues were all resolved. I took my temperature at 6:36, and it read 99.9 degrees fahrenheit.

                                                12 Days after the second dose i started breaking out in hives body wide. They have gotten progressively worse to the point that at times i cannot walk/bend at full capacity or have to leave work early. I?m taking Prednisone, Claritin (4x 24hr tablet) and Benadryl to partially control symptoms. I will be applying fo the Xolair shot at the 6 week mark since the OTC medications are not working effectively.

                                                Developed hives on opposite arm shortly after shot (but idiopathic hives are normal for me and it was the wrong arm so I thought nothing of it). Full body aches, especially in legs, from about 6:30pm on 3/13 to midnight of 3/14. Location of shot was warm to the touch, sore, and slightly swollen. Temp was 98.6 F.  After midnight the aches became centered on my legs and became more severe coming in waves every few seconds. Tachycardia. Muscle weakness. Nausea. Teeth began to hurt (from clenching?). Severe dizziness and vertigo starting from 7pm on 3/13 and peaking around midnight. Migraine with visual disturbances beginning at 7pm on 3/13 peaking at about 9pm and lasting at least several hours. Vertigo and migraine seemed related. Former worsened every time the pressure in my head did. Looked like the room lit up briefly every few seconds. My sense of touch felt off - textures felt different than normal and couldn?t feel my back when I touched it. Leg pain began to lessen around 4am, and fully resolved around 7am. Dizziness began to improve around 6am but persisted, albeit to a milder degree, for most of 3/14. Brain fog and sinus pressure from around 7pm 3/13 persisting through the following day. Some nausea throughout 3/14 but less severe than on 3/13. Poor temperature regulation from about 6pm 3/13 to 3pm 3/14. Symptoms became tolerable around 3:30pm on 3/14 and had mostly resolved by evening. Muscle weakness resolved by evening of 3/15. Pressure headache resolved by late morning 3/16.

I couldn?t eat because eating made me feel nauseated. All I could do was drink water. This continued into the next day (Sunday). I slept almost the entire day. I had to call out of work on Monday due to severe exhaustion.

The next day 2-23-2021 I noticed the left side of my face feeling rather numb and two of my fingers on the left side kinda numb as well. I am still experiencing these symptoms as of today not as severe as before.

The additional swelling is still relatively mild and I don&#39;t have any other unusual symptoms (just arm pain, headache, insomnia, and a low-grade fever/chills the night of 3/17).

                                                On Saturday, February 20, 2021 I received my first dose of Moderna Lot# 024M20A. I was detained for 30 minutes due to having a sulfa allergy and then released. There were no concerns that day. My arm was very sore, which I was aware of could happen for a couple of days and then things seemed to clear up.  Sunday, February 28th, I woke up at 5 in the morning with a severe red, itchy rash that covered my arms, legs, chest, back, and scalp. I took Benadryl every 4 hours until 8pm in which symptoms grew worse and I drove myself to the Emergency Department.  Upon examination, the doctor diagnosed that this was a rash for nonspecific skin eruption. I was administered dexAMETHasone sodium phosphate (PF) (Decadron, EPINEPHrine (Adrenalin), and famotidine (Pepcid) at 10:32 pm. The epinephrine was supposed to relieve symptoms within thirty minutes and was administered into my left upper arm. It did not. They informed me that the steroid they gave me would take an additional 4-6 hours to kick in and would last 2-3 days. After detaining me to observe my body&#39;s reaction to the medicine; I was released approximately at 11:30 pm. They told me to continue taking Benadryl. At the end of the visit my vitals were as following: blood pressure: 113/69, weight 205 lbs, temperature 98.2 degrees F, pulse 91, respiration 18, oxygen saturation 99%.  I was only able to sleep 3 hours that night, wake up off and on due to severe inflammation and horrible itching.  Due to the lack of relief by the provided medication I began taking lukewarm oatmeal baths combined with cool showers every hour to help alleviate the itch. This helped to make the itching less strong but did not alleviate it all together. In between showers (no soap) I applied Calamine lotion and aloe vera lotion on every other rotation. These combined efforts helped to keep me from scratching as much as possible.   I was not able to go to work on Monday (3/1/21). Throughout the day of Monday, I continued to take repeated showers, baths, and apply lotion. I continued to take Benadryl as directed on the package. My rash did not seem to be clearing up and I was just able to make the itching slightly bearable. This continued through the night, where yet again I was only able to sleep 2-3 hours.  On Tuesday morning (3/2/21) I awoke with my back inflamed and hopped immediately into a cold shower. Upon my husband?s examination the rash suddenly had worsened. There were more breakouts of tiny itchy spots everywhere and the itching was unbearable.  As soon as Urgent Care opened at 8:00 am I checked myself in. My primary care physician was unable to secure me an appointment for the day and I couldn?t take it any longer. At this point I was so uncomfortable I started to feel helpless and hopeless.   I was seen by the PA-C at approximately 8:20 am. I informed the doctor that I had not had any changes to my diet, my medications, my laundry detergent, dish soap, body wash, lotions, toothpaste, deodorant, perfume, or any other thing of that nature. I had not been sick this year at all and I had not had any other vaccinations nor traveled outside of the country. Nor have I been quarantined this year because of Covid. I also told about my good friend in. She stated that exactly the same amount of days later after her Covid shot; she had a rash too but her rash disappeared after a couple of days and she did not need medical care for it nor was it itchy. I informed the doctor that the only thing I had that was new to my body was the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. It was the doctor&#39;s opinion that this was an allergic drug rash. The doctor also firmly recommended that I do not get the second dose of the Modern vaccine. He said that there have been credible reports released of delayed reactions such as this and even though there wasn?t a way yet to medically prove it, due to all of the information provided he strongly felt this was a reaction to the vaccine. My rash was so bad that as he lifted my shirt to look at it, even he was appalled.   I was administered methylPREDNISolone sodium succ (PF) (SOLU-Medrol) in the buttocks at 9:03 for treatment. I was also prescribed a predniSONE 50 mg tablet to take once daily with food for the next 8 days. Additionally I was prescribed triamcinolone 0.5% ointment to apply 2-3 times daily as needed for itching relief. I was released at approximately 10 am after an observation period to make sure I did not have a reaction to the methylPREDNISolone sodium succ (PF) (SOLU-Medrol). Upon my release I was given a doctor?s note to not return to work until Thursday 3/4/21. I was told to keep taking Benadryl along with the new medication to treat the rash. Approximately around noon hours later, I noticed an improvement in the rash on my arms. They were less spotty, inflamed and itchy. By 5 pm my legs were improving and were less itchy and spotty as well. I picked up my predniSONE prescription at 5:30 and took 1 tablet by mouth with food at approximately 6pm.  By late evening, the itching on my back, chest, and scalp had decreased by 50% although they were still majorly broken out. I did not take any more oatmeal baths but I did take a cool shower before bed using no soap.   On Wednesday 3/3/21 I awoke at 7 am. I was able to sleep through the night and only woke up twice to reapply aloe vera lotion. My arms and chest were no longer itchy but my back, scalp, shoulders, and behind my knees were still itchy. I was still very broke out on my chest and back but the skin did not appear to be as inflamed. My arms are no longer red and the spots are very tiny and pink. I picked up my triamcinolone 0.5% ointment at 10 am in the morning due to the pharmacy needing to order it. At approximately 11:30 am I canceled my 2nd dose appointment with that was scheduled for Friday, March 19th at 1:50 pm.   Thursday 3/4/21 I returned to work. I found myself to be very weak and very shaky if I stood for any amount of time. I had to work with students from my rolling chair, scooting around the classroom.  Sunday 3/7/21 I seem to have my strength back and am no longer shaky when I am trying to do daily tasks.  Thursday 3/11/21 It?s a week later and the bumps are finally  mostly cleared up. Half a dozen remain on my shoulders and have turned into pus filled bumps almost like pimples.   Thursday 3/25/21 All traces of the bumps are gone from my arms, legs, chest, and back. Only a couple of them remain now appearing to have turned into ?pimples?. My doctor prescribed me a steroid cream to help get rid of the remaining bumps.

                                                On March 29, 2021, severe vertigo and fatigue began. I  woke up at 7am feeling as if I was slammed with fatigue after about roughly seven hours of sleep. I stood up to walk my dog, and a simple chore like that felt undoable. Everything felt unbalanced and I felt and still feel as if I am weak and about to pass out doing simple things like even taking a shower.  My left eye feels very heavy and my head just feels like it&#39;s swaying on a cruise ship.

On a scale of 1-10 (where 10 is worse), body aches were consistently a &#34;level 6&#34; for the full 24 hour period. In a cycle of every 4 hours, pain would increase to level 8 (i.e. for a few hours I would have all over &#34;level 6&#34; body aches, then for a few hours I would have almost unbearable &#34;level 8&#34; body aches, then for a few hours it body aches would decrease to &#34;level 6&#34;. This cycle continued for the full 24 hours. At one point I was in tears and called my doctor for pain or sleep meds - since I was unable to sleep at all the night before due to pain and was in fear this would happen again).  Body chills would &#34;come and go&#34; during the 24 hours period. Fever (&gt;100.3 and &lt;101.3) began in the last 8-10 hours of the 24 hour period. All symptoms ended 24 hours after symptom onset (9-10pm on 3/2 to 9-10pm on 3/3).

                                                patient felt lump in the back of throat and plaques formed in the mouth. She reported that after the first dose , about 30 minutes after the vaccination, she had numbness in the lip while eating blueberries. she did not report this because she thought it was related to blueberries. She came back to the pharmacy and I instructed her to take 50mg of diphenhydramine while I observed her for 30 more minutes in store. Her symptomes did not worsen before I let her go home. The next day, she said she had more plaques on her tongue and also now on back of throat. She went to see dr. regarding this and Dr. told her that she has thrush, and not likely to be related to vaccine.

                                                Vivid, strange dreams noted on nights 1 and 2 post vaccine. Soreness noted at injection site 2 days post vaccine. On 3/14, woke with arm pain from shoulder to fingertip, some radiating numbness, and shooting pain. The pain was not unlike hitting the funny bone, but was in the shoulder to the fingertips. At times, using the arm was difficult and made me question the potential of it being a heart attack or other cardiac event.  Injection site was red, feverish,  hard, and tender. Area felt bruised. Red area was about 2-3&#34; high and 4-5&#34; wide. Arm pain subsided 3/15, but redness/swelling/feverish/tender site lasted until 3/20. The same area that was red and feverish became discolored and slightly grayer/pinker than surrounding skin on 3/20 and persists (as of now 4/3/21)

I started to feel an increase in my heart rate, experienced sweating, shaking, and shortness of breath. I was observed for 30 minutes and the symptoms lessened over that time. Driving home, I developed tingling and numbness in my face and  the odd sensation of hot/tingling/metallic in my mouth, throat, and on my tongue continues to come and go.

Immediately experienced vomiting after waking up. Extreme chills and aches that were better when I got into the sauna, shivering so much I couldn?t sleep. Assumed I had a fever. At 5:30am I woke up in a sweat. Finally started to feel a little better. Was very tired all the next day. I did go to work the rest of the week after March 31st. Had to be very careful that my blood sugar didn?t drop too much. When it did I would be come shaken and dizzy. Took me until Sunday to feel like myself again.

                                                Vision disturbances beginning  about 20 minutes after shot. The rest of the day was followed by extreme light sensitivy, without pain, which resolved the next day. Visual disturbances (vision sometimes blurry, shaky, or glitchy) continued for about 8 days, especially when looking at screens or the lights of traffic. This became accompanied by a jumpy feeling, feeling of fear that I may trigger a seizure, and extreme sensitivity to smells and nausea, strange body sensations. General hard-to-describe feeling of something being off, not painful but scary at times.

                                                Left arm became very sore throughout the day (3/26/21) at the injection site. The pain progressed into my left shoulder around midnight (3/27/21) and became very uncomfortable to where I could not sleep. My arm became very stiff despite having moved it consistently. I began experiencing body aches, chills, a low grade fever, fatigue, lack of appetite, and a headache.  My resting heart rate remained around 80 bpm (normal is about 56 BPM) throughout the day and spiked to over 100 bpm when I walked slowly if needing to get out of bed. Approximately 9pm on 3/27/21, the side effects subsided and I felt fairly normal the morning of 3/28/21.

                                                Six hours after receiving the fist shot of the Moderna vaccine there was pressure in my head that made my ears stuffy. My arm also started to hurt at this time.  23 hours after the shot I felt extreme fatigue, dizziness, stiffness and pain at the injection site, and nausea. The nausea was intensified after looking at a computer screen.  48 hours after the vaccine the fatigue reduced but the dizziness and nausea were still there. I vomited from looking at a computer screen for a work meeting 59 hours after the vaccine was administered. The nausea was caused by pressure in my head and also caused the stuffy ears and dizzy feeling.

                                                About 11 hours after receiving my second dose I could feel I had a sore arm. I was also getting pretty tired (but it was a long day filled with other activities so I wasn&#39;t sure of it was vaccine related). About 9pm (12 hours after vaccine) I was chilled. Temperature was elevated about 3 degrees above normal for me. Went to bed, did not sleep well was hot and cold off and on all night, also became really sore. All of my joints were sore leading to not sleeping well. The whole following day I was sore with chills, slept on and off. Also had a raging headache which started sometime during the night. By 9:00pm the day after the vaccine I was feeling less sore with a less intense headache. Woke up the next day and felt great, still had a sore arm but the body aches were gone.

At ~4am I was very nauseous and vomited once. The following day, I was weak and with residual headache and fatigue, which resolved by about 7pm. As similar to my first vaccine on March 15th, I had mild/moderate injection site soreness for the 3 days post shot. I am currently pregnant (first pregnancy) with estimated due date of October 30th, 2021.

                                                This is my second dose. For context I had COVID and had lingering symptoms; most notably a sore throat for three months. With the first COVID shot I had a fever, chills, fatigue, and arm soreness. With this second shot I had a headache (same day as vaccine), more severe arm soreness (on the first/second day after), fatigue (ongoing) and hallucinations (which started today, second day after in the am).  The hallucination was during/after sleep paralysis (which I?ve never had before) taken during a mid morning nap due to fatigue. If more details are needed please call.

                                                It was around 8:00pm on 05/25/2021 I was working at my job. My boyfriend was like you don&#39;t look good he said I had dark purple circles under my eyes and that inside my inside it looked yellowish reddish. I was walking but everything was spinning at the same time. The whole time I was trying to convince myself that I was feeling good and that I was okay. But I was like yeah I don&#39;t feel good at all. My job requires me to deliver packages but my boyfriend was like just sit down I&#39;ll do it for you. As I sat there people would come in and out of the elevator they looked all strange it was like I was hallucinating I felt like I was on drugs I was seeing things. I was seriously scared for my life I couldn&#39;t drive myself back home of course. I got home and kept going it last about 5hrs. Then I woke up like around 3am and was having a higher fever of 105.4 I took some medicine then when back to sleep but I had to get back up immediately as everything started spinning and I felt so nauseous. Then around 5am I started throwing up and threw up 4 times but it was just that yellow acid. I kept up with my medicine every 4 hrs. As the week when on and still to this day I just space out like I forget everything.

I was unable to work or perform tasks around the house for almost a week. Took Tylenol for headache. Symptoms lasted longer than 72 hours after vaccination. I was informed on day 4 that I had a patient who came back positive for COVID-19, I was at a low risk of exposure while taking care of her of but had been exposed within 48 hours of her positive test. Call placed to employee exposure line, I was tested via nasal swab for COVID-19 d/t symptoms lasting longer than 72 hours after receiving the vaccine. Symptoms finally resolved on 1/9/2021.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

The vaccinating pharmacist checked the patient and she said her lips were tingling/numb. The vaccinating pharmacist came and got me in the pharmacy. I talked to patient, she said her breathing was fine but felt like she was floating. She began to become incoherent and at that point we got her on the floor and called 911. I did not talk to the EMTs. They transported the patient out of the waiting room.  We reached out to patient after she returned home she is feeling better and may of just had a panic attack. She is making an appointment with her primary care provider.

                                                I started with really bad body aches and chills which were so bad that I had a fine tremor. Within 20 min of that vomiting and diarrhea. I had extreme fatigue to where I couldn&#39;t get off of the floor because I was so weak. My heart rate was super high. I felt overall really miserable for a long time and I was seen that morning. I slept like 18 hours the next day. The following day, 30th, missed work. I was tired. No more vomiting, fever and no more diarrhea, but still had body aches and chills and still very tired. Everything slowly started getting better and I was able to work on the 31st. I developed a headache and body aches for a while. My arm was also sore.

                                                Initially after vaccine within an hour I felt fatigue(drained within 1 hour of receiving vaccine). Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine I was having fever, chills, body aches, nausea, and vomiting, and diarrhea and dizziness and weakness and heart palpitations(probably related to dehydration). Symptoms remained for 3 days. Unable to hold down anything. Felt like I had covid all over again just without the respiratory issues and loss of taste and smell. Arm was very sore almost like a deep bone bruise. Brain fog developed again like after initially recovering from covid as did the fatigue. Still having lingering fatigue and now carpal tunnel like symptoms in both hands, slight weakness and numbness at times in right upper arm where vaccine was given. Reported event to Pharmacist to administered the vaccine and the CDC.

                                                Face swelling and redness with lip tingling and tongue tingling later after eating a few bites of a home prepared meal that has been eaten several times before. Started eating around 7 pm, have picture of red and swelling face at 7:11 pm. Contents of meal were shrimp, homemade egg noodles, chicken stock, pork, and romaine.  No breathing problems and felt fine besides face warm ness and some anxiety over possibly developing a new allergy, as these symptoms were similar to my adult onset allergies to oysters in 2011. Sought remote care at 7:41, spoke to RN over phone who recommended a video visit, then after video visit was recommended to go to urgent care. Arrived at Urgent Care around 8:50 PM.   Had a steroid shot of solumedrol 125 mg to IM the left arm around 9 pm, then took some Benadryl and famotidine at urgent care. Picked up prescriptions for famotidine 7 days, prednisone 4 days, and Benadryl as needed.  Taking medications now with careful watching of potentially allergic reaction provoking foods such as shrimp, fish, nuts, and wheat.

I asked her if she was short of breath and she denied. I asked her if she wanted  benadryl or epi and she declined but agreed to me calling 911. I  told patient that if she started to feel short of breath then I was going to give her epi. No medication was given to patient EMS arrived within 5 minutes and checked her out. They said she was not having an allergic reaction and asked if she wanted to go to ER but she declined. They advised that is she started to feel short of breath or tightness in the chest to immediately go to ER. The patient ended up leaving the store and was fine.

I had a headache. A couple hours after vaccine I was told I was exposed to COVID. Got tested on 31st - I tested positive for COVID. Got shortness of breath, the bad muscle ache, the loss of smell and taste; coughing, sore throat, headache; fever. I still have headaches and I still have some congestion sometimes. It is getting better but my sense of smell and taste aren&#39;t back. Fever, shortness of breath, cough etc lasted 10 days. I was out of work for two weeks. Called the doctor  (January 4th, 2021)- for Oxygen levels - were dropping - they were in the high 80&#39;s - the doctor let me stay home and monitor on my own as I have a nebulizer and inhaler at home.

My arm then become sore which worsened over a 48 hr period. Tylenol (500mg) didn?t help at all. 48hrs after injection, my arm was red and swollen around injection site. It still is red and swollen 9 days later. Injection site became itchy after 5 days and still is despite taking cetrezine allergy medication.  Four days after injection, i had a mild fever. I was 27 weeks pregnant when i got the injection.

They came in waves or rushes for the next hour. Doctor said i look like im getting oxygen and confirmed i had a racing heart. I took lorazepam to calm myself down and doctors concluded it was a panic attack although i know this was something i had never experienced before.

On Friday I started my period a week early and it was unusually heavy (this hasn?t happened much since I was a teenager) on Saturday I was bleeding so heavily and had lightheadedness, near syncope, headache, nausea, weakness, fatigue and brain fog. Usually menstrual cycle is not as heavy and doesn?t come early and I don?t experience these types of symptoms (usually just bad cramps and back pain with less heavy bleeding).

The pain often stops me from completing tasks such as taking off my shirt or extending my arm in front of me with any type of weight in it (even a water bottle).

Range of motion continues to be limited. Pain and night continues to inhibit sleep. At time of administration, pt was 4 weeks pregnant with a rough estimated date of delivery as 10/3/2021

Checked my heart rate with a pulse ox and it was in the 150?s. I realized had not taken my clonidine pill yet for the evening so I  took it and waited about an hour to hour an a half and my heart rate was still not coming down below 125. I ended up going to the emergency room and getting there by 3am. They immediately started running tests. My heart rate was in the 138 and my blood pressure was 148/100

                                                Pounding headache - increased in intensity over several hours.  Fever and chills - started about 9 hours post vaccine. It was manageable. Nausea and vomiting - nausea was on and off starting about 10 hours post vaccine. My body attempted to throw up twice but there was nothing in my body to bring up. The nausea and vomiting could have been from the intensity of the headache but I am unsure.  About 10.5 hours post vaccine I took 1000 mg Tylenol and then an hour after taking Tylenol, I tool 220 mg naproxen sodium. I was unable to fall asleep because the headache was so bad.   I woke up about 5 hours later and knew my fever had broken and the headache was mild. The headache continued on and off (most noticeable in the morning and at night) for about a week post vaccine.

                                                I started feeling very weird and could not sleep well the first night - I kept waking up with a pounding headache, but a different type of headache than I had ever felt before. I have had a constant low-grade headache since that gets worse at night.   The first night and that next day, Excedrin Migraine helped. I have been taking Ibuprofen almost every evening since then.

                                                I started to develop a reaction the first evening after receiving the vaccine. My arm was incredibly sore, I had neurological slip ups-i could not think thoughts fully all the way through and my tongue swelled overnight and I woke up to me frantically rubbing my tongue on my back teeth, which is extremely abnormal for myself.  the first night back started aching (I have never felt this pain before now), Developed swollen lymph nodes in my armpit and in my neck and chin on my right side of my body, was extremely lethargic.  and this continued for 3 days when the lymph nodes started to go down, and then an outbreak happened inside the right side of my throat, which is still in place today, seems to be healing now, but continued to get worse for 3 days before starting to heal. I am finally back to a normal level of energy and my mind seems to be working normally again, but my back is still in incredible pain.

Then around 9/10pm I had chills and low grade fever of 99 degrees F. I took tylenol and went to bed with extra blankets and a heating pad since my body could not get warm. I also felt very nauseous. I woke up around 12am with a fever of 101 and sweating. Took some ibprofen and fell back asleep. My fever broke in the night but when I woke up I felt achy and had a headache. I took ibprofen and my temperature was normal however about an hour or two later I started to get another low grade fever and too tyelnol again.  The fever went away and never came back but I had a slight headache for several hours and was very fatigued all day. The next day I woke up feeling fine.

                                                1st shot: no immediate reaction. Racing heart that night. No illness reported, 11 days later I had a small red spot at injection site that was hard and hot to touch but went away on its own in about 1 week. 2nd shot: I had the vaccine on Friday, Feb. 5, 2021 at 5:05p.m. and had immediate reactions. That night I had a racing heart (which I had with the first vaccine)The next morning, Saturday the 6th, I woke up very sick. Symptoms included total body aches, pounding head, loss of appetite, racing heart, general flu like symptoms. I noticed a large red knot/rash on my arm at injection site. By Sunday the 7th, the symptoms had subsided mostly but the knot/rash was larger. Sunday night the knot/rash was even larger, hard and hot to the touch, the redness has darkened. I went to urgent care and they said it was not an infection since I had no pain (just uncomfortable and slightly itchy) they thought it was an allergic reaction and gave me steroids. Monday the 8th (today) the red rash/knot is less dark and hard but larger/wider in size. I had dizziness, lethargy, racing heart and loss of appetite.  I have not worked since Friday the 5th.

                                                At the time of administration of the first does of Moderna vaccine, I was 6 weeks pregnant.  I had confirmed pregnancy with home positive test and missed period. I had an estimated due date of 9/24/2021.  This was my 4th pregnancy. I have had two uncomplicated pregnancies to term. In September 2020 experienced a chemical pregnancy with early pregnancy loss at 5 weeks.  The first 24 hours after 1st dose of vaccine I experienced extreme arm soreness in the arm that was vaccinated,  causing  headache and unable to sleep. After 24 hours I felt &#34;normal&#34;. 2 weeks and 3 days following the first dose of Moderna, I  had a miscarriage. On the night of 2/15/21 I lost the pregnancy with vaginal bleeding, bright red  blood, passing tissue, clots/ sac. I had an uneventful pregnancy up to that point, feeling well as I had with prior pregnancies.

                                                Received the vaccine intramuscularly in right arm at 1:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and muscle soreness began approx. 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Fatigue and headache present by 3:00 PM on 3/3/21. Began hydrating with water and Gatorade at this time. Muscle pain and join soreness present from right shoulder to right hand by 4:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and stiffness in fingers of right hand by 5:00 PM on 3/3/21. Mild congestion, brain fog by 6:00 PM on 3/3/21. Any contact between right arm and other objects or surfaces caused significant pain by 8:00 PM on 3/3/21. Took 800 mg ibuprofin to alleviate pain (pre-existing tolerance to NSAIDs necessitates higher than normal dosages). Swelling of the right arm and hand identified by 9:00 PM on 3/3/21. Swelling was most significant in the hand, and accompanied worsening joint pain and stiffness in the fingers. Applied a cold pack to address swelling (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off). Could not identify these specific side effects in the information available online, took a Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Swelling decreased overnight and was gone by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21. Diarrhea began at 6:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Will continue to hydrate with water and Gatorade. At the time of this report, pain in right arm still present from shoulder to wrist and entire arm is tender to the touch, but pain level has lessened. Pain and stiffness in right side of neck present by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Lymph nodes in right underarm swollen by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and swelling is still present at the time of this report. Will continue with regimen of ibuprofin as needed.  * I am recovering fine at home, but I wanted to log these side effects for data collection purposes. I couldn&#39;t find any information about these side effects online and that really freaked me out, so I hope that writing this report will help people in a similar situation.

                                                I had the first dose (Moderna, Lot 030L20A, Left Arm on 1/31/2021). The same side effect happened for both doses.  I am 18 weeks, 5 day pregnant. Pregnancy is normal, 1 baby, no issues thus far.  During the 24-48 hours post vaccine administration, I have had an increase of depression/self harm thoughts. I was diagnosed with mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder over 15 years ago, but have not experienced a major episode in over 5-7 years and have been able to manage these conditions without medication for over 10 years. With in the time frame given for both shots I have been extremely depressed, angry and had hurtful thoughts. I have done the necessary things to keep myself safe and to curb the thoughts, but I found it more than a coincidence to happen both times after the shot.   Normal side effects that occurred that I did anticipate - Sore arm, overall body fatigue.

This happened from between 12am-4am. Still feverish next day at 100f. Chills. Joint Paint.

During the night that of the 16th early morning 17th I woke up in so much pain from the injection sight to the tips of my fingers and up into my shoulder and beck under arm and right side of my chest. I was in so much pain I couldn&#39;t sleep and had a massive migraine. It has been another almost 12 hours and symptoms persist.

                                                Saturday 3/13 - Moderna shot @10am on L arm. Onset of sx @6pm. Fatigue, irritability, mild body aches   Sunday 3/14 - Upon waking Fatigue and severe body aches. Painful to walk, exert, lift a spoon. Required some assistance with activities of daily living. Nausea. Some improvement around 6pm.   Monday 3/15 - Upon waking Decreased fatigue, body aches resolved, nausea resolved. Soreness and fatigue in carpel tunnel area, feeling as though I had held a heavy phone for too long. Adjusted by keeping off phone during the day. Hand/wrist pain increased in the evening. Noted wrist and hand swelling @8pm. After applying ice around 10:30pm pain became suddenly severe with movement. Suspected ice was somehow a mistake and applied heat. Pain became excruciating. Took tylenol XS to sleep.   Tuesday 3/16 - Upon waking Moderate swelling and complete loss of mobility in both hands and wrists. Shooting pain that knocked the breath out of me. Unable to complete any activities of daily living independently (bathing, toileting, eating). Wore carpel tunnel braces all day. Some improvement in range of motion in the evening, able to open and rest hands semi-flat on an angled surface. R hand demonstrating faster improvement than L. Noted mild red bumps present on both wrists (more on L) and mild-moderate shooting pain from L thumb toward inner elbow, more severe in area closer to elbow. Upon rubbing the area close to elbow noted soreness and bumps under skin when applying mild pressure that aren&#39;t visible to the eye.   Wednesday 3/17 - Upon waking Red bumps resolved. Some improvement in all areas. L hand improvements mildly lagging behind the R. Able to complete activities of daily living with supportive assistance. Increased range of motion and moderate pain. More improvement @5pm. Regained 90% range of motion, shooting pains were mild-moderate.   Thursday 3/18 - Upon waking I have full range of motion. Mild-moderate pain with certain angled movements and levels of exertion. PCP telehealth appt @9am. Diagnosis: adverse reaction to moderna. Suspicion that there may be some connection with the complex migraine (though there was no numbness or tingling present) and to update my neurologist (you!). Recommendation was to report it and monitor sx. If sx not completely resolved in one week referral to othopedic.

                                                Symptoms did not start to develop until next morning. Started with slight fever and aches. Localized back pain severe by afternoon, slightly responsive to ibuprofen. By 4 pm had hives in unusual patterns and places (i.e. quarter sized on left wrist, symmetrically on either side of neck like Frankenstein, and significant swelling of upper lip), itchy and aligned with histamine reaction. Back pain progressed, but mild by second morning. Whole right side of face swollen by morning of 3/25/21. Slowly reduced via ibuprofen and Zyrtec, but still present at time of submission. Odd spikes of intense hunger, and mild cognitive impacts like forgetfulness, distractibility, and some confusion. Tired.

At that time I observed patient getting lightheaded, profusely sweating, nauseous, decreased blood pressure, and tightness in chest and throat.  Benadryl was administered and cool rags were applied to patient forehead and legs elevated.  Patient reported feeling better for a couple minutes then everything came back strong. had technician call 911, the EMS squad came and transported her to a local ER for observation.  I spoke with patient later in evening, she reported feeling better and that the ER thinks it was just her, having a panic attack. She reported no other symptoms and was discharged in the afternoon.

                                                8 days after the shot I had an episode of tingling and numbness bilaterally from my feet up to my thighs. I had difficulty walking, a lot of pain and a vibration sensation in my thighs with weakness. I was admitted to the hospital for 3 days and had abnormal neuro reflexes upon admission and severe brain fog, which I have never had before. MRIs and blood work were done in the hospital but they could not determine the cause and the hospital questioned it being from the COVID vaccination and has had me follow up further with specialists to see if there could be any other diagnostic causes. I have followed up with my PCP, 2 neurologists, a rheumatologist, allergist, dermatologist and will be seeing a hematologist.  (I now have joint pains, extreme fatigue, brain fog, peripheral neuropathy--none of which I had prior to the vaccination and thus far conditions outside of the vaccination have not been found. I also got a positive ANA after vaccination (I had negative in the past and my doctors are questioning if the covid vaccination triggered an autoimmune disorder now in me with the joint pain and swelling, fatigue, positive ANA, rashes and pain).  I have been out of work since February due to health impairments and am a healthcare provider myself.

                                                I am writing to you in regards my Moderna adverse reaction. I got your information from a small Facebook group that?s going through the same issues as me. On 1/31/21, I received my first shot of Moderna. I was told to stay 30min because I have a Sulfa allergy. I also received a flu shot 3 weeks prior. After 15 min I started to feel tingling in my face and throat tightness. As time passed, I started to feel like I couldn?t breathe at one point. As I continued to have issues breathing and started getting nauseous and lightheaded, they informed a nurse to look over me. The nurse had a student nurse do my vitals manually. She gives out standard numbers 60 heart rate and 120/80 blood pressure. My normal blood pressure is elevated in 130-140/80-90. I had to be picked up due to feeling unwell. I went home took Tylenol and slept.  The next few weeks I kept feeling zaps of sharp pain in my chest area. On the 12th day after the vaccine, I had a panic attack. The panic attack started with a sharp pain in my neck and when I inhaled it hurt. I got heart palpitations and again felt like I couldn?t breathe. I never suffered from a panic attack, so we called 911. The EMTs came my blood pressure was 200s/100s and elevated heart rate (sorry don?t remember exact numbers). It was suggested I go to the ER since my numbers were high. In the ER I told the doctor about my vaccine incident. They got blood work done and she decided to do a CT scan and X-ray since something was elevated ( I don?t remember what was elevated. I am working on getting that info). My EKG, CT scan and X-ray all came out fine. I was then diagnosed with panic disorder. I was sent home and after a few hours I started to feel an internal tremor.  I describe the tremor as having a cell phone on vibrate its usually is in my lower abdomen to pelvic area. My blood pressure kept spiking up into 180-190/80-100. I kept reaching out for help by going to ER once more, 3 urgent care visits and my primary. No one could help me, and I kept getting labeled as having panic/anxiety disordered. My primary doctor said I could be having adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I just have to wait it out. The internal tremor I feel constantly and sometimes it?s in my chest. I have muscle twitching, tingling in my lower limbs, muscle pain, and blood pressure spikes. I do feel like my symptoms cause anxiety because ill have these spells where I feel adrenaline running through me which will cause anxiousness. My blood pressure is getting better, but I still have spikes and have had another panic attack.  I have been on Lexapro 5mg and gabapentin 300mg 3x a day for 5 weeks. During that time, my symptoms have not improved. I will be getting off the medication soon. I never had any of these issues prior. I don?t drink, smoke or do any drugs besides the medication prescribed.   On 3/30/21, I reached out to my psychiatrist again and went into more detail about everything and she said she believes me about the vaccine side effects.  She recommended I go back to my primary care doctor and ask to be referred to UCSD covid long haulers study to see if they can help me. I wanted to share my information to see if it might be help to your research.  Thank you for your time

                                                Shortly following the initial vaccine, I felt slightly queasy and my arm had a stinging sensation radiating from the injection site.  The next day I had a headache that lasted for several days, and my arm was extremely painful (for several weeks.)  Following the second vaccine I also felt particularly queasy (stomach unease) and a headache.  In about 24 hours post second dose I felt extremely ill.  I had severe chills, fever, and loss of appetite.  I could not control my body temperature and my body ached all over.  The following morning I felt well enough to go to work but exhausted, headache and muscle aches.  My arm was painful for a few weeks. I have never experienced a vaccine reaction such as this with any previous vaccines in the past. It has been about 2 month since my last covid-19 vaccine. Since then I have felt sluggish, foggy and &#34;just not myself.&#34;  I feel like I just cannot recharge my &#34;battery&#34; completely.  Simple tasks take much longer to complete and I have difficulty with short term memory or thinking of the names of items I use on a daily basis or names of people I see regularly.  This has given me a great deal of anxiety because I do not completely trust myself to do my job appropriately without second guessing myself or having someone else check my work. I intend to follow up with my physician about this but as of yet have not consulted with anyone.

                                                I am prone to migraines, and started to get one around 7:30 pm, so I took 400 mg ibuprofen and 50 mg Sumatriptan/Imitrex as prescribed by my doctor. My migraine went away by 8:30 pm. Starting around 10:00 pm, I began to experience chills and shivering, despite being under covers/in bed. By about 11:00 pm, I was starting to feel nauseous and panicked -- racing thoughts, rapid heartbeat. I have experienced panic attacks before, so I thought that it could be the start of a panic attack. By 11:30 pm, I vomited about 1 L of fluids/bile/etc. My fever reached 101.0 at that point. I didn&#39;t vomit anymore throughout the night but remained nauseous. At 8 am the next day (4/7/21), my fever was at 100.9.  I was still nauseous and had a headache, so I drank Gatorade and an Alka Seltzer. I slept for most of the day. By 5:00 pm on 4/7/21, my fever was down to 99.5. I was able to eat toast and continue drinking water and Gatorade. It has now been 48 hours since the vaccine and as of 9:00 am on 4/8/21, I feel 100% back to normal, other than continued soreness at the injection site.

By evening my arm was swollen and painful (I usually sleep on my left side and couldn&#39;t because it hurt so  bad). There was also a slight rash around the vaccination site about 3-4 inches in diameter. Today my arm is not as itchy but is still swollen and painful.

                                                Around 3:00am-4:00am I woke up with extreme chills. And it felt as if my blood flowing was cold. I had a fever of 100.8 F .... My migraine came a few hours later after I slept for another two hours so around 630am and I was told not to take ibuprofen or aspirin. I used a cool rag to cover my eyes and that helped my head pounding as well as helped lower my fever a little bit it was 100 F around 8am .... Through out the day Friday it was as if my symptoms spiked and got worst before they got better. Lymph nodes on side of the injection site were very swollen and tender. My muscles and body was aching pretty badly. I felt very weak and extremely tired. I slept almost all of Friday away, it was hard to get out of bed and bc I was so weak and tired and slept so so long, I was not keeping myself hydrated and that def made it worse. My fever has remained between 100-102(at it&#39;s highest) ... Today is Saturday and around 3-4am on Sunday will make 48 hours since the symptoms began. The time is 7:45pm right now and again most of today I spent in bed. I do feel the symptoms are beginning to slowly diminish. Even the fact I am up and able to report all this is proof I am getting better bc just this morning I still could hardly get up from bed. I have showered and ate some soup and made myself drink plenty of water all of which helped me have relief from my symptoms. In conclusion the worst of it all I believe is over but it took me by surprise just how bad it has been. My advice would be plan at least a day or two to possibly have any symptoms or reactions and rest, and hydrate as much as anyone can, bc it seemed to work for me.

I did not alert the staff at the center since the symptoms did not worsen (and no other symptoms occurred) after the initial rush of elevated heart rate. The same elevated heart rate happened during my first dose, however I thought it may have just been anxiety initially.

                                                On 4/8 the expected flu like symptoms began. On 4/9 around 10am my back and chest hurt. Around 12pm on 4/8 I had severe nerve like pain in my neck, back, chest that was radiating throughout my arms and body. I went to the ER they did an EKG, X-ray, blood test, contrasted CT scan to rule out blood clots. My blood pressure and pulse and respiratory were all high. I was given morphine, toradol and a steroid through IV to control the pain. The pain caused me to feel immobile due to the more I moved the more it hurt. I was discharged after no life threatening issues were found even still with an elevated bp and pulse. The doctor did say he was concerned of the pain radiating but was unable to state from what. I was sent home with morphine pills (which I have no taken any as we are in a large opioid pandemic as well and I am a clinical therapist). I could not sleep when I returned home. I had to sit straight up. I took Tylenol and it relieved the pain slightly. On 4/10 I attempted a car ride to get out of the house. Shortly after leaving my house my face became bright red, I couldn?t breathe well, I felt extremely hot and the pain was no radiating down my legs. I went to the pharmacy that gave me the shot as they have a clinic. My bp was 147/97 with a pulse of 116 and a fever now of 101.4 ( I havent had the fever until this point). They advised me to go back to the ER. Upon arriving to the ER for the second time in two days. Same test were given besides the CT.  I was given toradol by IV and saline again. The pain continues to radiate though my body. I can barely move. Again it is not muscle pain but nerve pain! I can barely move my neck or legs. The hospital discharged me again as administer a Covid test. The rapid was negative. These are symptoms from the shot there is  no coincidence. My wbc was 7.2 on 4/9 but 17.1 on 4/10

That afternoon, about 4 hours after the shot I was extremely fatigued. I went to bed fine but woke up at 1 in the morning feeling sick, and unable to sleep. Symptoms were nausea and restlessness. By morning, around 8am I had developed a fever that hovered around 101-102 degrees. I had the chills, nausea, and unbelievable body aches as if I had a hospitalized case of the flu (I?ve been hospitalized with the flu before). The symptoms were gone roughly 24-36 hours after the  shot.

                                                Shoulder/arm pain one week after receiving injection. Pain was severe enough to wake me up at night and disturb sleep even after taking acetaminophen and applying a heating pad. Pain in shoulder increases with movement (shooting pain up to neck and down to elbow at times), but persists at a low level when still.  Pain level with movement makes it difficult to accomplish normal tasks (dressing, cleaning house, etc.) Pain level when still ranges from minor distraction (still able to accomplish remote desk work) but consistency/duration of pain is exhausting.    Iced shoulder on-and-off throughout day. Ice reduces pain somewhat (more effective than heat). No rash, itching, or redness on skin.

At around 10:35pm I began experiencing a strong headache and intense heart burn or acid reflux. At around 1am or 2am the acid reflux was so intense I begain feeling restless and could not sleep. In the morning I woke with maasive pain in my joints, a migraine that lasted all day, followed by liquid diahrreas and fever. I spent the entire day with a head and overall body ache. pain in joints, diahhrea and fever. The swelling and pain in my arm continued as did the size of the swelling and red bump on my arm. Today, almost 63 hours later the swelling and red bump is almost as big as my entire arm.

I felt no abnormal anxiety prior or within the 15 minute wait time. 35 minutes post-vaccine, driving home: Dizziness returned, more pronounced visual disturbances, hand tremor, tachycardia, feeling disoriented, confused, extreme brain fog, racing thoughts, panicky. Throat started to swell but resolved itself in about 10 minutes.  1.5 hours post-vaccine: Mentally and emotionally overwhelmed with this unexpected reaction, couldn&#39;t keep eyes open due to extreme fatigue - took a nap. After 3 hour nap: Remaining dude effects were brain fog, fatigue, general feelings of confusion, some dizziness, not myself. Moderate insomnia despite the fatigue. Day after, 4/16: Upon waking, left arm (injection site) extremely sore and stiff, moderately swollen, warm to the touch.  4/16, around 6 PM: I found small, raised red bumps that weren&#39;t itchy on upper left chest, spreading down onto top of breasts. I watched as similar bumps but darker in color appeared on upper shins, knees, and halfway up thighs on both legs. Both legs and feet showed unusual discoloration presenting as purple/ruddy with splotches of normal skintone peaking through. The little red bumps next appeared spreading up the left side of my throat/left side of neck, on both forearms (top of right forearm is where I will most frequently find hives indicating a reaction), and just a few on right hand and on thumb and index finger. I started to experience unbearable itchiness and feeling of skin crawling all over, on areas with or without the little bumps. Throat felt tight and swallowing became slightly more difficult; I took 37.5 mg of Benadryl as precaution for my throat and to ease the itching.  4/20: Contacted my doctor&#39;s office about my reaction including in-depth details. 4/21: Advised not to get the second dose by a physician standing in for my PCP on leave, and told to report

I had no anxiety surrounding the receiving of the vaccine nor anxiety about potential side effects. I was standing still and upright at the time of the attack and it lasted appx 30-40 min, subsiding to feelings of heightened anxiety through the remainder of the night. While anxiety and panic attacks have occurred in the past, it is not on a regular basis, nor has either occurred in over 6 months.

                                                Within  a couple hours of dose, I was feeling really awful as if I had the flu with a pounding headache, all of my body hurt, naseau as if I was going to vomit, and my arm was really hurting. It progressively got worse throughout the day with feeling hot and cold so I took an Extra Strength Tylenol in case of fever. I went to bed around 10 pm and woke up out of a dead sleep around 2 am feeling like I was having trouble breathing. All of my body hurt, I was freezing cold and shaking with chills, and really dizzy and my head was still pounding. My arm where the injection site was also felt like it was burning. I thought I would take a hot bath to ease the chills and go back to sleep, but when I got out my naseau was even worse, my head was really hurting, and I began getting really dizzy sitting on the floor. I called my roommate in and said, &#34;I think something&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m going to vomit or black out&#34; and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. I did black out and my roommate said I had what looked like three seizures and he called 911. I was shaking for several hours after that at the hospital.  It is now the same day, 4.27.2021, 9 am and I am home from the hospital. I still feel weak, dizzy and nauseaous and my entire body hurts.

All of these symptoms lasted for three days. I took Tylenol and ibuprofen - whenever one of these would wear off my fever would spike back up. I had all these symptoms on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th (fever finally broke into the morning of the 5th). On the day of the 5th, I started feeling better - but wasn&#39;t 100%  myself until after the 8th. I went back to work on the 8th but I was still very weak, shaky and fatigue that morning.  I took an OTC cold medication and I took Zofran as well - (one Zofran on one of the days). I was out of work for that entire week with that exception of the day that I received the vaccine on the 1st. I did not get a rash. I was in contact with my occupational health to report on the app.

About 6 hours after the vaccination, patient developed a facial rash (flat, red) on bilateral cheeks that lasted until 4/23/21. Patient took tylenol for the rash. On 4/24/21, patient began to have episodes of severe nerve pain (sharp, shooting) on the left temple area, lasting 10-30 seconds at a time. Patient took gabapentin and tylenol for this. On 4/25/21, the left temple sharp pain became less intense. The left side of face (temple area, jaw area) is sensitive to touch.

The next morning Monday 4/26 I woke up at 5am with a rash all over my body that itched and burned. This lasted for the next 12 hours.  I continued to have nausea, fatigue and headaches for the next 2 days.

Took a Pepcid then my Epi-pen around 1500, called 911 for ambulance. EMTs gave me 50mg of Benadryl through IV at 1530. Heartrate persisted above 140. At ER was given another Epi injection and Decadron at 1630. Heartrate very slowly decreased each hour following the second Epi; at 1730 it was consistently reading under 130bpm, at 1830 under 120bpm, at 1930 under 110bpm. Discharged around 2030, heartrate around 100bpm. Heart rate has been consistently under 100 at rest since I&#39;ve been home and then today (May 1) it&#39;s been consistently under 80 at rest.

I felt flushed and very hot but did not have a fever. This went on for a couple hours.

Then I got a fever and a feeling of extreme heaviness - like I couldn?t get out of bed, and when I did to get water or go to the bathroom, I was immediately exhausted and incredibly dizzy afterwards. I am able to be up and moving more today, however I still have a fever and extreme cold sweats. My poor partner thought I might have wet the bed my cold sweats were so serious. I had to steady myself a few times walking my kids to their bus stop this morning. I?m afraid to drive to work my ?heaviness feeling? and shakes are so intense. I don?t regret getting vaccinated, but it?s not been fun.

I began sweating profusely and had to lay down outside for 30 minutes before feeling well enough to stand. At that time, I reentered the store and told them of my frightening symptoms and they asked me to wait until I felt better. In this time,  blood pressure was checked by (excellent) staff and pharmacist that gave the shot, and it was low but rose to normal within the hour and I was able to make the short drive home.  I was entirely surprised by this reaction and was pretty scared at losing control of my body like that, I have never experienced anything quite so acutely intense.

                                                Outcome: unexpected/unexplained death Had first dose Moderna Vaccine 3/31/21. She described body aches and mild fever ? ?like I had COVID again for a day? ? lasting about 36 hours, and then felt fine.  Had dose # 2 Moderna vaccine about 6:50 PM at Community vaccination site. She was driver, received left deltoid injection from Doctor. During observation period reported no symptoms, was happy and talkative with family and staff.  Family reports later that evening she did not feel well ? ?just not hungry? and wanting to lie down. Slept well, then woke up feeling better except for left arm achiness at injection site. Did not report redness, rash, or any difficulty breathing. Was talkative, walking around, took a shower, and was planning to drive to the grocery store later that day.  Mid morning ? maybe beginning about 11 AM, family said she went in and out of bathroom several times. She told them she had vomited three times and was feeling shaky. Her oral temperature was 101.3.   About 1:30 PM, she was in her room and called out for her mother. When family went into the room, she was shaking ?like she was having a seizure? and then her eyes rolled back and she fell to her side and stopped breathing. Family called 911 and started CPR. CPR was continued by EMT?s once they arrived, but they were not able to resuscitate her.

Had fever, arm ache, and weakness as expected on day after and the next day. Remained fatigued after normal vaccine response subsided.   For the next week, had severe brain fog and difficulty processing/remembering/communicating; dry eyes; facial swelling; extreme fatigue; difficulty breathing.  After first week, brain fog lessened and became able to have short conversations. Fatigue lessened but continues (difficulty walking more than ~0.25 miles, difficulty breathing, get tired going up stairs).

                                                The afternoon after the first shot I was feeling very tired and in the afternoon my Lymphs were very swollen and it continued like that for almost 2 weeks. I had periods with intense fatigue, pain over the lymph nodes, and a fever of 99°.  The 2 weeks passed by and the lymph nodes were less swollen so I couldn&#39;t feel them beating like before. But then, the pain in my legs started. This was 2 weeks ago, my whole body ached. Like I had the most terrible flu. Then, a week ago, my joints are very painful, that includes toes, ankles, knees, shoulders, elbows, hands, fingers, and my cervical joint. My energy has been draining and everything feels bad like Life has been abandoning me.  I went to the doctor on May 18th (when the joints have just started to ache but my body was tired and very very low of energy) and I had blood tests, the funny thing is that I have been gaining weight but the result of the tests show that my blood red cell count is lower than average showing slight anemia, the creatinine, and blood sugar are also lower than average.  When I had the appointment with the doctor the nurses tried to measure my blood pressure and it was extremely low, 75/49 they tried to do it several times and the results were the same. Since then I have been measuring my blood pressure and is as max as 90/61. The other blood tests don&#39;t show infection or anything else, giving no explanation to my current state.  I consulted a friend&#39;s doctor yesterday and he told me that I might be suffering an adverse effect of the Vaccine. Last week I felt very ill so I missed my appointment for the second dose of Moderna, the max time to get the second dose is this week and I think I might not be able to get it.   I am really worried because due to this I am suffering illness that apparently can not be treated or has no cause. I have tried painkillers but those don&#39;t seem to be enough for the discomfort.  I can&#39;t keep going with my daily life, I have no strength and feel not good at all.

I wasn&#39;t able to do much. The next day, Sunday , it was even harder I couldn&#39;t walk It wasn&#39;t that my throat was closing up I just felt like something heavy was on my chest. On Monday I went to work and I could not walk even three ft. I went to the hospital I then followed up with my primary care. I was given an inhaler which I used for 2 days after which things began to return to normal. It was about a week total from the vaccine that I began to feel better.

                                                I had some pretty bad back problems and the reason I went to the doctor was because it was lasting for more than 3 days. Hip flexors were really tight and causing my back pain. I have had something similar happen before but it&#39;s always resolved itself within a week. And now I&#39;m three weeks out and still having this back pain and hip flexor tightness. For the first two weeks - the PT said I should be laying down or standing and only sitting for 5 minutes to help those hip flexors. I&#39;m limited now on activities that I can do. I am not suppose to lift over 20 pounds or bend over. I can&#39;t sit cross legged on the floor. PT gave me exercises to do to help.

After losing sensation in my feet, that is when I went to my PCP and they determined I getting loss of blood flow. They did blood work, that came back normal.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

                                                Around 2 AM, roughly 14 hours after receiving Covid Modena vaccine (1st dose) I woke up in a violent shaking situation.  I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

When I got home I took 2 extra strength Tylenol&#39;s and felt fine. At 3:30am that night I had pain and bruising on my left arm which I rolled on in my sleep and the pain woke up me. When I went to turn on my right side I heard a popping noise in my neck and was no longer able to move my neck to my right. I got up scared and started to experience chills, nausea, and dizziness.

Was unable to do most daily activities. Extreme fatigue and slept almost all day, also due to fever and pain from body aches/joint pain. Took Tylenol (700mg at 7:30am and 2:30pm) but fevers continued to register between 100.2 and 100.8. Fever was definitely higher at night but temperature unknown. Took Tylenol again at 7:30pm and at this point did not have fever, mostly did not have body aches/joint pain at this time. No symptoms besides tiredness the next morning (1/18/21)  Large red welt appeared at injection site, about 4 inches by 3 inches. Hot to touch, itchy at times, very sore. Still has welt as of 1/19/21.

I began to feel severe flu-like symptoms (hot/cold chills, sensitive skin, headache, dry/scratchy throat, fever dreams) which persisted for several hours during the night. The next day (1/16), the fatigue, headache, and chills persisted (although the chills decreased). I took Dayquil before noon and that seemed to help with the symptoms, and Nyquil at night so I was able to sleep. By the following morning, I still had a mild headache and fatigue but continued to improve. I felt normal again on 1/18.   I also had stiffness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site for 3-4 days.

                                                At about 7:30 pm, I started getting cold chills. I was under 3 heavy blankets with warm clothing and heat packs still shivering.  By 9 pm, body aches had started.  I took a 500 mg tylenol.  The cold chills went away with the tylenol but did nothing for the body aches. At 11:30 pm, I took 200 mg of ibuprofen because my entire body hurt and I was unable to fall asleep or really move much due to the discomfort. The ibuprofen helped reduce the intensity of the body aches but I got very little sleep.  At 6:30 am, the body aches were intense again  and I started getting hot flashes and nausea. My husband called in sick to help care for our 3 young kids.  I took another 200 mg of  ibuprofen  and that reduced the symptoms again. I can now get around the house instead of laying in bed but would not be able to work.  I did not ever have a measurable fever.  I do have a pretty sore arm

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

                                                Despite having mood disorders, I had achieved stability before the COVID-19 vaccine. About 8 hours after receiving it, my mood crashed. I felt angry, agitated, irritable, and dysphoric. This continued for over 3 days. I felt much worse during nighttime, with symptoms ranging from rage and violent ideation to desire for self-harm and suicidal ideation. I left a message with my psychiatrist. He responded that he hoped my symptoms would lessen the further away from the vaccine I got. The past 2 nights I have started to notice the symptoms subside.

                                                A few hours after receiving the first dose, I started with a mild headache and very sore arm. The headache and sore arm worsened and then around 9pm I started with horrible chills and body aches. My symptoms continued onto the next day, including intermittent nausea and extreme fatigue. I had to leave work early on Wednesday 1/20/21, called out of work on 1/21/21. My symptoms were gone by mid day of 1/21/21 except my fatigue and headache lingered until 1/22/21. I took extra strength Tylenol throughout the days.

My periods are very predictable and I am not sexually active. The evening I received the vaccine, twice  I had sharp pains in my uterus. It lasted for a few seconds and went away. It happened one more time in the middle of the night, jolting me out of sleep. My period has not come since I took the shot.  It?s been two weeks. This is very unusual.

                                                About 8-10 minutes after the injection, my vision got blurry. It was very brief- only a couple minutes long. If it had lasted until the end of my 15 minute post-injection observation period, I would have reported it then, but it didn&#39;t. I decided to include it here, because later in the day, I had another reaction. About 12 hours after the dose -around 7PM- I started getting chills and body aches and abnormally fatigued. The chills were intense almost as soon as they come on. The body aches were mild for the first couple hours and progressed to intense. Both symptoms lasted continuously for about 12 hours, then around 7AM they started to wane. I&#39;m not sure if I should list insomnia as a reaction, but despite how exhausted I felt, I could not sleep. It could have also been just general discomfort that kept me from being able to sleep. Through most of the following day I had mild aches and waves of chills. By the time I went to bed that night (last night at the time of writing this), the symptoms had mostly  cleared and so far have not returned.

                                                I received my second covid vaccine on Monday.  For the two days following the vaccine I felt very fatigue with nausea, 1 episode of vomiting, chills, elevated temps,  muscle and joint pain.  I left work early yesterday due to these s/s.  I also had some numbness to my left hand.  I had my vaccine given in my left deltoid.  The numbness in my left hand has resolved today, but now I am having right arm/hand,  heaviness, numbness with limited ROM.  It has progressively worsen throughout the day to the point that my hand is very shaky and I am starting to not have full control.  My handwriting has started to become sloppy and I am having trouble drawing up vaccines.  You can phone follow up, or you can reply via email.

My fever reduced to 99 degrees around 0730am and remained as such through the following day (1/28/21) as the chills, nausea, and cold sweats gradually faded away. I was deeply fatigued and unable to work.  Sometime mid afternoon I developed a crippling frontal headache That worsened in the light and standing. I have no history of headaches or migraines. I was still repulsed by the thought of eating. I took acetaminophen with a protein shake and it helped the headache And residual body aches enough for me to sleep. 1/29/21 I awoke still fatigued  with a minor headache.   I am a pro athlete with no underlying conditions. I have had my flu shot yearly with no side effects. I am extremely fit and eat a healthy balanced diet, maintain a healthy athletic weight, sleep 7-8 hours a night, do not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use recreational drugs. I was absolutely floored at how sick this shot made me.

                                                In day one I felt a little off and weak after the injection. This was a few minutes later and lasted about 2 hours. I took a Tylenol PM to sleep, but didn?t sleep well at all. On the second day, in the morning when I woke up the arm where the injection was administered was extremely sore and I couldn?t lift it. It felt almost numb, but I was in pain. I took Advil late morning and felt better but still couldn?t lift my arm above my chest. Around 4-5pm that evening, I was feeling tightness in my chest. Felt like something heavy was sitting on top of me and I developed a headache at this point. I felt super tired so I took an Advil PM to comfortably take a nap. When I woke up I still had a headache and chest tightness. At this point my body started to feel sore. The next day, 1/31/21, I am still feeling fatigued. Headache did not go away or subside. My body still feels sore especially my back, top area (I would say around shoulder blades). I still have chest tightness and had a fever of 101 today. I have taken an Advil for headache and body soreness - after an hour of taking Advil, still feeling the same.

                                                About 29 hours after injection, experienced sudden chills, muscle fatigue, and coughing. Unable to fully sleep throughout the night. Chills and coughing faded by around 1am 1/30/21 (36 hours post-injection), but replaced by a headache. Took pain reliever around 5 am. By 9am 1/30/21 (44 hours post-injections), all adverse side effects cleared.

                                                Severe muscle tension in cramping in right arm two hours after injection. In less than 24 hours the muscle cramping had extended up my neck into my face, specifically the masseter muscle of my jaw.  I also experienced some numbness on the right side of my face (unfortunately the locked masseter muscle was very noticeable). I was not able to sleep or eat when the pain built; hot and cold temperatures were highly reactive when trying to consume anything.   I saw my dentist for an emergency medical appointment on Monday 1/25/2021 with the dentist. I saw Dr. who prescribed a muscle relaxer and assisted me in identifying the masseter muscle as the source of pain and tension as well as exercises that could be done to treat the reaction. While there is no definitive evidence that the muscle cramping is directly related to the COVID vaccine, it is reasonable to suspect that it may have impacted the muscle tension and resulting locked masseter muscle that required clinical intervention. The muscle relaxer was somewhat helpful, however for my body and biochemistry, taking 400mg of ibruprofen every 6-8 hours was much more successful in treating the symptoms.

                                                Beginning the day after the shot I started with vaginal swelling which wasn?t terrible that day but by the second day (Thursday) it was severe. I worked that entire day not realizing just how bad it was but by the end of the day I could barely walk out to my car. I was in so much pain and so swollen that by the next day I could not do anything. I went to my GYN first thing that morning (Friday) where they swabbed to send for various tests which have all come back negative so far.  I had to return for a re-culture that had come back inconclusive and we are still waiting on those results. I have been given an antibiotic and prednisone which still have not resolved the swelling. I am about 50% resolved and almost 2 weeks later at this point but there is still significant internal swelling which is uncomfortable but not hindering me from working. I was out of work for an entire week and not able to do anything for that entire timeframe.

                                                Several hours after vaccine administration, I began to get a headache. That headache intensified over the next 24-36 hours. A severe headache resulted with a painful, stiff neck, occasional fever, occasional diarrhea, confusion, vision changes, and increased imbalance. These symptoms lasted for about 1 week before I sought medical treatment at a virtual urgent care appointment on 1/5/21. They referred me to an in-person urgent care facility that day. At that facility, they said my symptoms were very concerning and said I needed to seek immediate medical assistance at the ED and offered to call me an ambulance. My husband drove me to the ED from the urgent care facility. At the ED, they treated me with a migraine work-up but eventually discharged me with instructions to follow-up as I was &#34;diagnostically unclear&#34; at discharge. After a week, my symptoms had not improved at all and so my previous ED physician suggested that I return to the ED (after being unable to get care in a timely manner in an outpatient setting). At the ED on 1/12/21, they again treated me with a migraine workup but also conducted a CT scan and a COVID test. When both tests came back negative, they conducted a lumbar puncture procedure. Those results came back positive for viral meningitis. As I had no other illness or known exposure to any other virus at that time - and given the timeframe of the vaccine administration - my care team concluded that this was a rare reaction to the COVID vaccine. I was discharged with instructions to follow up with my PCP and a neurologist. My follow-up neurology consult is scheduled for 2/19/21.

                                                The patient stated that she had joint pain that began the day after she received the first dose of the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine and that she particularly had weak knees. She also stated that she had insomnia and was up all night. She also stated that she had a low-grade fever 02/02/21-02/03/2021.  By 02/04/2021 she stated that she was feeling better and that her symptoms were more mild. Today (02/10/2021) she states that she feels better but that she has had some increased pain and insomnia; she estimates, though, that these symtoms that she mentioned today are due to recent medication changes.

                                                I was vaccinated on the 14th of January. Initially I just had a sore arm and fatigue on the 15th. The night of the 17th I was working out and had a vasovagal type episode (never had this before). By the morning of the 18th I was fatigued and had a cough that can be described as a bronchial spasm type cough, I assumed that it had to do with the work out and the episode the night before. I woke up on the 19th very sick. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea. Because I am a healthcare provider I was able to go strait to the hospital and get an expedited COVID Test. By that afternoon I had my test back with positive results. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed. I had extreme headache, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath if I moved around at all, cough, loss of taste and smell, nausea, abdominal px, diarrhea, lac of apatite, extrema &#34;brain fog&#34;. These symptoms continued for about a week. Most of the symptoms subsided after that time except for the fatigue off and on and a continuous cough that as of 2/11/2021 has still not gone away.

                                                Patient felt faint and moved her self to the floor. She was unconscious and began to have  witnessed seizure activity, which lasted approximately 3 minutes. When she did become conscious again, she was disoriented and urinated on herself. 911 was called but when the ambulance arrived, they asked her if she was okay, and she said she was ok . Information relayed to the drivers of what was witnessed but they declined to take her to the hospital. Her  husband came and took her home about an hour later. No further seizure activity. Vitals were stable

During 1st 24 hours of having the 2nd dose I had chills, fever, body aches, sleeplessness. Symptoms subsided within 24-48 hours with the arm soreness taking about a week to completely go away.   A week and a half after receiving the 2nd dose I noticed a lump on my neck, lower middle near the collarbone. It is significantly pronounced. I saw my primary doctor for an already scheduled physical and she said I was fighting off an infection and it was normal. I mentioned I had the COVID vaccine and she said it isn&#39;t uncommon to see the lymph node swell after vaccination and it should go away in a couple of weeks. I wanted to report this because it can freak people out to see a lump in their neck so long after being vaccinated without any other symptoms. We need to list this as a possible side effect on the vaccine information. I feel completely fine except my neck is a little tender/sore from the swollen lymph node.

Monday 2/15 returned to work- saw doctor in person- increased prednisone from 20mg (tapered down) to 40mg (original dose) and added Spiriva. 2/17- Went to ED for status asthmaticus after using albuterol MDI 5-6x/day without any relief. Admitted 2/17 for asthma exacerbation- discharged 2/20. Discharged home with nebulized albuterol, prednisone slow taper, symbicort, Spiriva, Singulair &amp; Claritin. 2/23-2/24 Albuterol nebs 5x/day, still SOB.

Woke up with chills, severe body aches and bone pain, severe left arm pain, headache, nausea at 11pm. Felt worst I had ever felt in my life. Couldn?t get out of bed due to severe pain. Temp max 101. Lasted until 1pm next day and then resolved however felt tired for several days after and had episodes of tachycardia and pSVT for 2days after (h/o POTS and pSVT and think dehydration from episode with nausea and fever probably caused that)

Fever, chills, sweats, body aches, could barely move my left arm, pain in my bones and joints, pain in my pelvis, couldn&#39;t sleep because my body hurt so badly.

                                                Around 10:00-11:00 pm on 03/02/2021, I woke up with extreme soreness on left arm bicep (where injection was received and all over bicep). I kept waking up about every hour will chills and sweats as well as muscle and joint aches. From this time until approximately 7am, I used the restroom and urinated approximately 5 times. On an average night, I may use the restroom/urinate once at the most around 5-6AM.  This is usually only because the dog wakes me up to let her out at that time. At approximately 4am I took 40 mg (two 20mg pills) of DextroAmp-Amphet.  At 7am I attempted to shower for work. During my shower I couldn?t barely lift my arm to wash with out severe soreness. I also became very dizzy and nauseous. I had to get out and sit in front of the toilet because I thought I would vomit. Fortunately I did not. I then proceeded to crawl back into bed and call in to work (notifying them I was too sick to come in). I had extreme chills, muscle aches, and joint pain. I began to cry from hurting so bad. At approximately 7:45 I took 400mg of ibuprofen to help relieve symptoms. My body felt feverish (hot/clammy).  Around 8am I mustered up the strength to get dressed due to extreme chills. I then proceeded to eat a banana, peach yogurt, and a blueberry Benvita breakfast bar package with 4 wafers.  I then took a nap and have been laying in bed ever since until approximately 4:30 PM (with the exception of getup twice to urinate). My body hurt so bad, I barely moved. At approximately 4:30PM I got up to get orange juice and take 600 mg of ibuprofen.

                                                A huge rash under the injection site began to develop 7 days after the 1st dose.  It began as 2 bumps around the injection site that were hard, warm, and a little pink. Then a rash became hotter to the touch as the days progressed. It was raised, hot to the touch and sensitive. It was painful and uncomfortable to have; it caused me to not be able to sleep at night. I emailed my PCP, and she recommended: &#34;we are recommending taking Benadryl, it can be oral or the cream and just take Tylenol if needed. Sometimes using a warm compress on the site helps as well.&#34; I took Tylenol in the morning and Benadryl at night to help with the rash. I would also use anti-itch ointment to help with the discomfort. The rash lasted for another 5 days before the symptoms started to subside. I felt fatigue and week for roughly two weeks after the 1st dose.

Sudden onset.  Had to leave work in tears everything hurt. While I  do not have any known immune deficiencies, I do have pain problems from my  time in the military, frequent migraines and two discectomy/laminectomys in 2014.  Everything hurt, like I couldn&#39;t move or touch anything, my cats would step on  me while I was in bed and I would cry. This episode lasted till 0230 in the morning, after the 2nd shot that pain episdone lasted from 0730 pm to 1030 the next day.  Never have I ever  have felt such pain and now I have had  two episodes.

Then the nurse took me off for my next vaccine and said I had to be cleared by an allergist. Four days later at midnight I was at work and my heart rate was 140-150 and was very SOB and chest tightness,lightheaded and numbness/tingling of the mouth and had to be wheeled down by wheelchair to the ER. Then they drew my labs and potassium was 2.9. I have been in the ER three times since the vaccine. Since I have had the vaccine my blood pressure goes up very high for me 168/105,170/100,186/96,163,103 and I get chest tightness,SOB and lightheaded on and off also very dry mouth at times still. Heart starts racing out of now where and my normal heart rate is 60-80 and I have been very tachy since the vaccine.

We transported her to the Health Unit where she was evaluated and observed approximately 2 hours. Patient&#39;s vital signs remained in a normal range. Her physical exam was unremarkable. Stated she felt fine prior to getting her vaccine.  She stated she felt much better when she left our Health Unit and returned to work.

I tried treat at home with Benadryl but it was not helping. I called the virtual health. NP recommended getting a steroid shot. I could not get as the clinic was closing. So I talked to a provider that I work with and she was able to prescribe a steroid and hydroxyzine. My hives waned but didn&#39;t go away. Allergist prescribed steroids for another 7-10 days before hives dissipated.  *was advised ok to have 2nd dose; no symptoms after.

Then around 7:00 pm that day I started to get the body aches and so I went to go lay down for bed. I started to shake uncontrollably, have horrible body aches and chills, I went from hot to cold to hot again all through the night, i had a fever all night long, bad stomach cramps, super nausea all night long, and bad headache. This last all the way into the following night having me miss a whole day of work because I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. Since this second shot I have had severe heart palpitations, prolong period, blurred vision and severe body aches.

                                                Day of injection after I left the vaccination site I started to have a really bad headache and then sore arm (left arm where the injection was). Then about 7 hours after the injection I started to have a really bad stomach ache and cramps with nausea. This last all night long into the next day where it slowly went away. I was incredibly fatigued and the headache would not break. Then on the 3rd day Thursday January 7 I was feeling okay but not 100% myself. Then Friday January 08 I woke up and knew something was incredibly wrong because my stomach hurt way worse then before, i was so lethargic that I was falling asleep at my desk at work, I was shaking  uncontrollably, blurred vision, diarrhea with blood in stool and one close episode of fainting.  So at the point I ended up in the ER missing the rest of my work day. My symptoms didn&#39;t get better until the following Monday

On the following day, still very tired, stomach upset but arm pain much better. Today, all symptoms gone except stomach upset.

                                                1/23/2021 - The first Moderna vaccine. I had flu like symptoms, which included fatigue, muscles aches, muscle spasms, joint aches, chills, and shortness of breath for 2-3 days afterward.  2/20/2021 - The second Moderna vaccine. The side effects were much worse, including muscle aches, abdominal pain, back pain, headache, nausea, chills,  fatigue, and shortness of breath. I also found myself limping. 2/21, 2/22, 2/23 - I rested and stayed home from work. Most of my symptoms had improved by the evening of the 23rd, and I felt like the shortness of breath was also improving if I took it easy.  2/24 - I went to work where the shortness of breath became much worse after working for a couple of hours. I began to get dizzy, and my hands and feet were cold and tingling. The school nurse checked my temperature (which was normal) and oxygen levels (99%). I was sent home and told to take another day or two off.  I was fine if I was sitting still and doing nothing, but talking caused me to become winded. Walking and exertion of any kind caused me to become winded. Once winded, it would take 15 minutes of sitting still to get my breathing back under control. Then I would be hit by a wave of fatigue. Also, when my breathing was bad, I walked with a limp. 2/25 - I went to  the shortness of breath was still bad. They were concerned. They took a chest x-ray (which came back clear), did blood work (which was normal), and gave me a Rapid Covid test (which was negative). My oxygen levels were at 99%. They prescribed a 6 day pack of MethylPREDNISolon. If I was not better by Saturday, they wanted me to return. They also did a PCR test (this came back negative on 2/28).  2/26 - The steroid did not help, and by the evening, I was worse.  I went to the ER . The doctors there were concerned about a pulmonary embolism. They did blood work (which was normal), a chest x-ray (which came back clear), and an EKG (which was normal). My vitals were good, though my blood pressure was high for me (113/64). The doctor told me to continue the steroid pack and prescribed an albuterol inhaler. I was directed to contact a pulmonary specialist on 3/1 if symptoms did not improve. The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/5. 3/1 - The shortness of breath did not improve. I almost passed out while driving after I picked up my two small children from school. I could not catch my breath in the car and started to get lightheaded. When I parked, I stayed in the car huffing and puffing for several minutes. I was seeing spot, was dizzy, and my hands and feet were tingling. When I climbed out of the car, my legs buckled beneath me. I was able to grab onto the car and not fall. I had some really bad breathing episodes between 3/1-and 3/3. At these times, the breathing was so rough, that I couldn?t even talk. It would take 30 minutes or more of sitting still for me to be able to bring my breathing under control. 3/3 - Appointment with Pulmonary Specialist. I had an appointment  He ruled out asthma, as the inhaler and steroid were both ineffective. He considered anxiety, but the problem was clearly not a panic or anxiety attack. (I have experienced those before and know the difference.) He ruled that out. He ran a pulmonary function test (which was normal) and a CT scan with contrast (which was normal). The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/10.  3/4 and on - My breathing was better some days than others. The less energy I exerted, the better I did. If I did too much one day, my breathing would be worse the next day.  3/7 - Ajovy injection. I was past due for this monthly injection. Once injected, I had an allergic reaction to it for the first time ever (this was the 7th time I used it). A few minutes after the injection, the injection area had a rash and was itching like crazy. I put ice on it and took benadryl. It was fine by the next morning.  3/9 - Appointment #2 with Pulmonary Specialist. The specialist was not sure what the problem was with my breathing. I was the first patient with these vaccine side effects that he had seen. He scheduled more tests and said he wanted to read more literature. He wrote a note for me to work from home through 4/6.

                                                33 year old female with no preexisting health conditions received her first Moderna vaccine on Saturday, March 13 at 9am in the left deltoid. Patient immediately felt weird after receiving the vaccine - tingling and accelerated heart but no intervention occurred. Patient started with the basic side effects headache, sore arm, shakes/chills and fatigue/weakness and brain fog.  Starting around 24-36 hours after injection patient started to notice mild muscle spasms and tingling sensations. That has progressed to full paresthesia of the arms/hands and legs/feet. Patient also states paresthesia occurs in the face, neck, lips, torso and even occasionally in ears - but these seem less severe and wax and wane. The patient noticed vision changes and muscle fatigue described as muscles feeling like &#34;jello.&#34; Due to weakness, patient also complains of continued brain fog. The patient is also occasionally getting twitching and pulsating muscles.   The patient describes the neuropathy &#34;like my limbs are defrosting.&#34; It was described as cold tingling but at times intense. Patient noticed that cold temperatures make it more pronounced and movement helps to temporarily make it seem a bit better.

Today - a week after my shot - my arm is swollen, red, very hot, very painful, and a little itchy. I also feel pretty ill and strange.  I was also prescribed metronidazole and started that two days ago, and am wondering if that would contribute to this reaction.

                                                My arm started hurting a bit in the evening, but had no issues going to bed.  I woke up in the middle of the night around 1am, shivering, with chills and my teeth clattering.  I was so cold, I had to put on socks and was using two blankets.  I went to the bathroom and was very dizzy that I almost fell twice.  I also noticed my lips were blue/purple and my temperature was 99.9.  I struggled to go back to sleep because I was still very cold, but also very tired and felt my body drained of energy and had the most intense headache ever.  I felt my head throbbing and like it was about to explode.  I was still cold, dizzy and with a headache the next day.  Two days later, I still had a headache but lighter.  Took Tylenol since Friday night, but I did not feel a difference.  I missed two days of work because of my symptoms.

My condition continued to deteriorate over the next few hours. I ended up on the couch in the fetal position about an hour after injection crying and feeling like a couldn?t move. My skin kept getting hot every hour or two. No fever. My arm hurt so bad until Monday that I couldn?t lift it. I was fatigued and weak until Monday. I haven?t felt great off and on since, my throat has been sore off and on every single day since. Yes my throat hurts right now, I haven?t had a sore throat since my tonsils came out in 2014. Now since Friday April 2nd (two weeks after injection) I have covid arm.

Due to this we had pt stick around for 30 min post moderna injection (~3:50pm),  after around 10 minutes the pt alerted us to her reaction. Pt was having increasing shortness of breath and was starting to panic a bit. Pt had no visible signs of swelling of face or throat and no reaction at the injection site. Pt was given 50 mg of benadryl and a glass of water. After ~ 15 min the pt  had returned to baseline and was calm. Pt departed shortly after.

I woke up at 4:00am the next day with a horrible headache, sweaty but no fever, extreme tiredness, and arm pain. My headache is subsiding, but I have the chills and am sweaty and hot at the same time.

I was walking and suddenly felt dizzy and faint like I could pass out.  I went back to the pharmacy to tell someone and sat down in a chair.  Within a minute of sitting in the chair, I had a very weird feeling in my chest.  Then for about 10 seconds I had an extremely rapid heartbeat.  Coinciding with the rapid heartbeat was the feeling of a strong pulsing/heartbeat in my stomach for the 10 seconds.  It was something I have never felt before.  My skin got a little flush and I felt off/dizzy for a while.  They monitored me for 45 minutes and gave me water, then I left.

Approximately 8 hours  after taking the shot, which was administered between 1100-1130 am, I experienced pain in my Left arm. The following morning I was unable to lift my arm and I felt like I had &#34;brain fog&#34; or as if I was fighting a head cold. In the afternoon, I had to sit down after standing for about 10 minutes because I felt like I was getting dizzy and I was nauseated. Typically, I have been nauseated in the mornings because of my pregnancy, and this symptom does not usually effect me in the afternoons. Symptoms were gone the following day.

Slight eye pain in right eye when putting in contact lens in morning on Tuesday, 4/13.  Seemingly no issues throughout day. On Tuesday evening, eye pain when I would touch my eye or look in different directions, eye was very red. in the middle of the night, my eye pain woke me up. It hurt worse when I was laying on my back. Eye was watery/discharge. When I got up for the day on Wednesday morning 4/14, vision was blurry in right eye, pain, sensitive to light., and red. I was seen by an optometrist that morning who advised that I had uveitis with synechae forming. I then went to another optometrist that afternoon in hopes to be seen by a specialist within their Clinic. Same diagnosis. I am taking steroid and dilating drops for at least one week. I found a medical article on the relation of vaccines to uevitis: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6139748/   I have never had a reaction to prior vaccines and I am up to date on all and almost always receive the flu vaccine. No known autoimmune disorders.

That night I had leg aches throughout the night and took Tylenol. The next day still very exhausted and had headaches. By day 4/17/21 morning I was feeling better and able to get out and do things. No fever at all. The side effects are worth the end result of protection though! Just thought I should share. Thank you

Symptoms: extreme fatigue, sore muscles (aching) and some hardness at injection site, muscle weakness, joint pain, diarrhea, dizziness, fever, one case of the sweats (due to fever), headache, increased heart beat, sore throat (from dripping nose and yet it was also stopped up making the headache happen), and (some short breathing-but I have an inhaler for that, so I was fine).   I began feeling them in the evening about 8-9 hours after the shot. I didn?t sleep well that night, and spent most of it in pure agony and searing pain. I have fibromyalgia and the shot clearly aggravated that condition so I felt like my veins were on fire. -and still do.  Third day after symptoms have lessened, but still persist. Doing all I can to rest and get better.   HOW I TREATED: -Took Tylenol -Took an episome salt bath ?? first. Soaped and rinsed after. -Used a Cain or a family member help me walk to and from the bathroom so I didn?t fall over due to dizziness.  -Called my Dr. And asked for a limited dose of Tramadol-pain meds (I?m allergic to narcotics and opiate pain treatments) -I used 2 at home tens units and had them all over my body. (That I got originally for my back pain and fibromyalgia) -I used my top of the line leg massager (that I got originally for my fibromyalgia)  -My family made chicken soup -I drank water, Pedialite with juice, and mint tea. -Took my temperature regularly to keep up with Tylenol -Eventually used over the counter lidocaine and Aspercream all over my body. -Had a pressure cuff at home to monitor vitals

                                                Ever since a few hours after the 2nd shot I have been getting this stabbing pain in the back of my head towards my neck. It comes and goes and only lasts for a min or so. Its like someone id tapping the back of my head with an icepick once an hour. Over the last 2 days this pain has progressively gotten worse and worse. Today my head feels warm in that area. When the pain happens my vision is a little blurry and I get confused for a min. Like I cant remember what just happened and I have to think about it for a min.  This is starting to worry me and I am not sure who I need to talk to or where I need to go to.

Had shortness of breath chills and a feeling of anxiety and disconnection. Went to the ER because of shortness of breath I was diagnosed with acute gastritis and anxiety . I?ve been feeling sadness and fatigued ever since. Then 13 days after my second dose I began feeling the same way, chills nausea and a great sadness and disconnected from myself. I?ve reached out to my doctor and she is sending me to get checked. I?ve always been healthy, happy and very energetic this has been the healthiest and happiest I had ever been and then all of a sudden this is the only new thing in my body. Now it?s difficult to find joy in the things that I used to before. I randomly start feeling nauseous and cannot eat for a few days. I randomly cry and feel as if I am not connected to myself. There is nothing else that I can think of that can cause what I?m feeling. Many people who I?ve spoken to about this have said they have felt similar symptoms and they also received the Moderna vaccine

On 19th started something I can not explain and never felt anything like this before. I felt dizzy, nausea, fever without a temperature, felt overheated, hard to breathe. It felt like I am on drugs to the point I could put clothes on and was feeling like I am passing out. I could think or talk or anything. My boyfriend drove me to the ER but unfortunately all they could say it is the side effects after the vaccine..Nothing helped, I was dizzy and felt like my heart will stop any second... Today is April 24, I feel better however feeling of nausea, headache, and a foggy mind is coming back in the different moments. I noticed that my ears and throat are still burning but I don&#39;t feel sick, it is something else. I tried to go out for lunch but couldn&#39;t spend there even an hour, the feeling coming back, I can&#39;t focus and the noise bothers me... I used to be a completely healthy person. I afraid nothing will help me. I would like to report these cruel side effects.

On day 8 (April 9)  I developed a rash at my injection site which lasted 4 days. After that I still felt weird on my left side?random pains only on my left side and some muscle weakness  and soreness in my left arm. On April 22 I broke out in a very painful rash near my groin on the left side (same side as my vaccine injection). On April 25 I was diagnosed with shingles .

We got her water and wet cloth for her head and moved her to our vaccination room. Her heart rate was up and she continued to feel lightheaded.  She didn&#39;t want us to call anyone at first, but changed her mind so we called 911.  They arrived and checked her out and took her to hospital.

I had chest pain and my jaw hurt and I could not lay down because it was very comfortable for my chest and felt like there was more pressure when I laid down. I came out of it by sitting upright, breathing deeply and drinking water. It took about 2 days for my chest to feel normal again, it felt like my lungs had been really overworked, I was exhausted and I started feeling normal again about the 4th day from the event.

Reports now several months of fatigue, cough, ?chest and abdominal pain, unable to resume normal activites.   Stated she coughed up blood and felt very sick in first few days after vaccine, was seen by PCP who said it was expected vaccine effect.  Later continued to be sick and went to medical facility.  She stated labs were drawn that showed her liver and maybe kidneys were inflamed.   I think they may have also tested her for COVID which was negative.   I am not her provider.  She called health facility to ask for help.  I said I would put in VAERS report

                                                I received the vaccine on December 29th, 2020. The vaccinated arm didn&#39;t really hurt until the next morning when I woke up I could barely move my arm.  Around 10:00am  I started getting chills and having sweats. Over the next hour I became severely fatigued even with taking my adderall that morning. My body started tingling, I felt dissociated, had a headache, and a little light headed. Almost a little drunk feeling. I went home from work and slept most of the day.  When I woke up in the evening around 9pm I was sweaty, and my muscles and joints hurt. I took my temperature and it was  100.6.  The next morning on December 31st I no longer had a fever. My temperature was 98. something. The next several days and even now I continue to feel severely fatigued, and slightly dissociated. However, each day I seem to feel the side effects a little less.

I HAD A STEROID SHOT ADMINISTERED, AND WAS SENT A PRESCRIPTION FOR AN EPI PEN AND A &#34;PACK&#34; TO MY PHARMACY.  THE PHYSICIAN REACHED OUT TO OTHER COLLEGUES, ALL STATING THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF CASES ARISING WITH RED RASHES ON PEOPLES FACES, BUT NONE OF THEM HAD PERSONALLY SEEN IT YET. MY PHYSICIAN SAID I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO COME IN. I ASKED ABOUT MY DERMA- FILLERS, AND IF THEY HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RASH BUT NOTHING COULD BE CONFIRMED. MY TEMPERATURE WAS EXACTLY 98.5, HOWEVER THE DR STATED MY SKIN WAS HOT TO THE TOUCH.

                                                I developed severe hives all over my body hours about 19 hours after the shot.   Intense itching woke me up at 4:40am the day after receiving the vaccine.  The reaction worsened for the next 3 days and began to settle/decrease at the end of the 3rd day.   I also felt somewhat disoriented through  the allergic reaction period, and on the day after the vaccine I felt slight pain on my chest.  I did not experience shortness of breath or have trouble breathing at any point.

                                                Within 30-45 minutes of receiving my vaccines, I notices a red rash on part of my face and my ears were burning red and hot. My right cheek felt a little numb and I felt like there was a bit of a lump in my throat. The cheek and throat sensation went away in just a few minutes after I noticed them at first, did not persist. The redness on my face and ears went away, but returned on a smaller area later in the afternoon, then went away and have not returned either in the 3 days since I&#39;ve had it.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post injection, I felt a burning sensation move from my left deltoid, up my shoulder, and across my chest. I experienced burning in my chest for about 10 mins, and then it subsided. About 8 mins after that, I experienced moderate to severe cramping in my lower back and thigh muscles; which completely subsided after 10-15 mins. Two days after the initial injection, the injection site began burning/aching again, with movement up to my shoulder joint. It was to a point where I was tearful and unable to sleep. The following morning it had subsided, and just remains slightly sore.

                                                The following day, 12/23/20, I kept feeling like I was having brief waves of anxiety, with nothing to be anxious about. The anxious feeling kept occuring, but it wasn&#39;t until a week later than I realized that each time I felt that anxiety, my heart was actually palpitating.  I had a 12 lead EKG done via local EMT to confirm that it was actually happening, then made an appt with a local cardiologist.  Stress test, cardio sonogram, and 24 hour heart monitor tests were completed on 1/13/21.  My follow up is on 2/3/21.  Fortunately, I have not felt a palpitation since 1/10/21.

When I woke up the next morning My upper body (arms, hands, face) were swollen. At around 10 am I saw my Dr. and she felt my upper body was hot to touch but no fever. Swelling and torso had hives starting to form. Dr. gave me an injection of Solumedrol and sent me home to rest ansd to take benadryl.

                                                Initially, I had severe arm and back pain that lasted 3-4 days.  On day 1-2, I was extremely exhausted, so exhausted that I actually wet the bed and I have NEVER wet the bed as an adult, which was extremely embarrassing.  The worst part is, since the shot, day 1, my eye has been twitching. I have been reporting it .  I do not think it is just a coincidence anymore like I originally thought.  I have had eye twitches in the past but they have never lasted this long!  It has been 3 weeks and there is no end in sight.  The time between twitches is sometimes less, but the severity of the twitching is getting more intense, sometimes causing my eye to blink (although usually its a lateral upper eyelid twitch) and I have had 1-2 instances of my upper lip twitching along with it (within the last couple of days).  The eye is driving me crazy.  I can&#39;t fall asleep at night because it keeps me awake and it twitches when I&#39;m trying to fall asleep.  There has been nothing that has changed in terms of increased stress, increased caffeine consumption, decreased sleep, etc. to have explained this persistent eye twitching.  I did have my annual eye exam on 1/15/2021 and talked to him about it and he said we will continue to watch it.  It was just annoying at first but it will not go away and like I said, the intensity and pulsating of the twitch is getting progressively worse.

                                                The patient received the Moderna vaccine on January 21, 2021. She waited at the pharmacy for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine to be sure she would be okay.  She felt fine after 15 minutes and so left the store.  As she was walking to her car in the parking lot, she started to feel &#34;weird&#34; as if something was very wrong but she could not figure out why she felt this way.  She got in her car and drove back to work.  The feeling that something was very wrong worsened during the drive and she started itching on her arms and legs approximately 25 minutes after receipt of the vaccination.  She did not have a rash or hives but the itching became very intense and spread to her entire body within a few minutes.  She started to feel that her throat was tight or swollen but thought perhaps it was due to something else.  However, within another 15 minutes she was having difficulty swallowing and her voice changed as she was talking to patients (hoarse).  The throat symptoms continued for 30 to 45 minutes and were quite uncomfortable but she did not seek medical attention.  They started to resolve after 30 to 45 minutes.  However, her intense itching continued for several hours.  She took Benadryl but it did not help.  All her symptoms resolved after several hours and she slept well.  The following day, within 24 hours, she felt her throat swelling again.  This lasted for a few hours but she did not seek medical care because she could breathe.  She developed a temperature of 100.8 degrees Farenheit which resolved after 4 hours but then the intense itching started again and continued into the next day.   She saw her PCP (third day after receiving the Moderna vaccination) and received a steroid shot and started taking Claritin 10mg daily and Pepcid 20mg twice daily which helped some but did not relieve the itching.  The itching worsened again on January 26th, 2021 and she was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg which helps but makes her extremely sleepy.  She continues to have varying degrees of itching off and on since then.

Night of Jan3, I developed red, hive like rash around the injection - painful; swollen and my lymph nodes were swollen in my armpit as well. It progressively spread through my whole arm within 24 hours and looked like a &#34;poison oak&#34; rash. I took Benadryl. I emailed my doctor about (PCP). I missed a day of work on January 5th. The rash got three days progressively. The lymph node pain was gone about a week after. I did have the dr write a prescription for the second dose for an epi-pen but didn&#39;t have to use it.

                                                The day of the injection I had a very sore arm, just like my first dose. Then around quarter after midnight, I got up to use the bathroom. I recall extremely vivid dreams, and a little bit of disorientation. On my way back to bed I thought I?d take another ibuprofen to help me sleep because my arm was so sore. I remember feeling very dizzy, I did take my pill, and then I woke up on the floor. I was extremely disoriented and there was a shrill ringing in my left ear. As I came to, I recall really finding relief in the cold tile, and being concerned that I may have hit my head. I did a mental scan of my body and nothing felt painful, though stiff and sore, as I had the flu. I got back in bed and looked at the time, about 20 minutes had elapsed. The rest of the night I tossed turned, and felt quite feverish. I attempted to find radial and carotid pulses, which were extremely weak. That night, I  never did get a temperature, because I was quite disoriented. This morning I?ve been quite stiff and low energy. I feel discomfort in my kidneys, and have taken care to stay hydrated. I have reduced appetite, and some achiness in my body. My temperature right now is 100 even. It?s almost 3 o?clock, so about 28 hours has elapsed. I did not seek further medical care, as I live alone and transportation i would be a hurdle. I also not super concerned, mostly I just want you all to document that I painted, as I have not found that to be listed as a common side effect for the Moderna vaccine. I did call up a friend who is a paramedic, and feel reassured by her two cents.

Two previous pregnancies with healthy, live births (5/2015 and 2/2018). Received vaccination Tuesday 1/26 at 4 pm. Feeling tired by 9 pm. Had difficulty sleeping over night and bizarre dreams when I did fall asleep. Wednesday had moderate symptoms all day - fatigue, dizziness, body aches, joint pain, chills and hot flashes (no fever), nausea, and headache. Thursday morning (1/28), symptoms were more mild, but noticed urine was dark. By early afternoon, urine had gotten much more dark and looked to be blood in urine. Went to OB provider who confirmed blood in urine and urine sent out for culture, no infection found. Unknown cause of blood in urine. Headache has continued since 1/27, worse in the morning.

Contacted an APP and she had me treat it like a post-concussion, brain  rest, dark room. I could not work the rest of 1/7 and 1/8. Dizziness finally subsided that Sunday, 1/10, but headache continued (mild-moderate) for another 3-4 days.

The events, flushing feeling, felt anxiety, blood pressure fluctuation, hives around injection site and contralateral arm and chest, diarrhea, shortness of breath, throat tightness and heart rate abnormal, were considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 34-year-old, female patient who experienced serious events of shortness of breath, throat tightness and heart rate increased and non-serious events of flushing feeling, felt anxiety, blood pressure fluctuation, hives around injection site and contralateral arm and chest and diarrhea. The events occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of mRNA 1273 (Lot # 026L20A, expiration date unknown). Treatment administered include diphenhydramine and epinephrine. Outcome is resolved. Based on the information provided, which indicates a strong temporal association of the reported events with the administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded. The event of hives around injection site is consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA 1273 vaccine

                                                Client was administered her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine and immediately afterwards she stated her mouth was dry, her heart was racing, her throat felt dry and she found it difficult to breathe. She stated that she had the same symptoms after she received her first dose. 911 was immediately called. Her vital signs were as follows: BP=108/80, Pulse=88, Respiration=18. She denied any history of allergies but said she had asthma, for which she took Ventolin. She did not have any dizziness. The EMT personnel arrived shortly thereafter and determined she was having a panic attack. The client as well as the EMT did not think it was necessary to transport her to the hospital. They spoke with her until she felt calm and ready to leave the POD site. She was told to call 911 if the symptoms occurred again and she verbalized understanding.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

No additional instructions provided besides getting tested and need to follow-up with the provider if symptoms persist.  Day 7 - COVID-19 Test Results are Negative.

Then, in the middle of the night, I began experiencing chills. 3/11/21: chills continued through the night and into the morning, lasting all day. I had to sit outside in the sun in 72 degree weather run sweatpants and sweatshirt and drinking hot cocoa to feel warm. Then slept away most of the day. In the middle of the night, once chills subsided, it was immediately replaced with stomach pains l, which woke me up. I got up only to experience a throbbing headache and immediately lied back down. Hoped to sleep the pain away but pain persisted throughout the night. 3/12/21: stomach pains and throbbing head continued throughout the day, slowly subsiding. Stomach pains immediately after eating each meal, headache/sinus pressure whenever I coughed or laughed.  3/13/21: stomach pains are gone but slight headache still lingers. Head throbs in the top back or temples from time to time. However, can feel the beaches trending downwards in frequency and strength.

I woke up with neck pain, headache, tension and pain behind left ear. Pain got worse as the day passed. Following day the pain was unbearable and I went to the hospital. They provided medication for pain and antibiotics in case of infection. Medication was not working and pain progressively got worse. A day after going to the hospital the numbing in my mouth got worse and progressed to the entire left side of my head. By the evening , the left side of my face started dropping, at which time I went to the hospital again. The physician at the hospital advised I had Bell?s palsy and gave me pain medication, which did not work. The following day I saw my personal physician and he provided me with prescription medication for pain and relief of Bell?s palsy.

                                                1: the day after my first covid shot, in the evening, my heart rate jumped from around 70 to around 130 instantly when walking up the stairs in my house. This happened twice that evening and has never happened before. My pulse was pounding in my head and it took about 1-2 minutes of slow breathing to calm my heart rate again. I wore my heart rate monitor the rest of the evening and overnight, with no other adverse effects. Stairs had no impact on me the next day. I had also exercised that morning, and while my heart rate was higher than normal with that type of workout, I didn?t think anything of it at the time and didn?t have the pounding head issue.  Due to this issue, I?m a bit nervous about the second shot in the series.   2: I started my period the morning I got the shot; day 4 and 5 of my period were significantly heavier flow than normal. Day 4 also included cramps and nausea throughout the entire day, which is not normal for me.

                                                I got the vaccine about 10 days later I felt a large lump on my collar bump and very weird feeling. I called my sister and advised me to go see my Dr. I saw my Dr. the next morning and he felt it and said it was my lymph node and collar bone that was swollen and its an indication that you have Cancer in abdominal area, and I have been getting coloscopy since 20 because I have pre-cancerous cells. He ordered a CT and MRI and colonoscopy. The colonoscopy came back clear. The CT or abdomen, collar bone all came back clear.  They did a EDG, that came back clear. The next step was a biopsy, and made an appointment to see a General Surgeon. It started to not be as large.  When I got my second dose it was very painful a red.  I&#39;m still having issues but all test have came back clear. I have cancelled the General surgeon appointment, I really believe it&#39;s cause of the vaccine and all my test are clear.

                                                Extreme fatigue starting 6 hours after injection, continuing for ~36 hours. Mental fog starting morning after. Words sound like word salad; couldn&#39;t remember words for common things, couldn&#39;t understand things said to me. &#34;Tip of the tongue&#34; syndrome has continued to persist. Depression worsened. Suicide ideation.

                                                30 minutes after shot my throat was swollen.  I had previously taken a Benadryl.  After 1.5 hours I felt very weightless and felt like I was going to pass out.  Then a wave of nausea came over me.  That went back and forth for about 20 minutes.  The following 2 days, I had those same rounds of nausea and thinking I&#39;m going to pass out.  My left arm got a large red, itchy and red bump and red streaks going up my arm.

                                                The first two days, I was fine besides my arm hurting. Starting on Friday, there was some discomfort under my armpits.  I&#39;m prone to anxiety - so on Friday night I was extremely anxious and didn&#39;t sleep until 3am. On Saturday, the armpit pain became worse especially at night.  Again didn&#39;t sleep until 4am. There is swelling and pain still on Sunday morning.  I&#39;ve iced and put a warm compress on them which is helping slightly but the swelling and pain is still there.

                                                About 12 hours after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine, I began experiencing flu-like symptoms including all-over body aches, chills, low-grade fever, and headache. I was unable to sleep much that night. Nausea set in in the late afternoon of the next day in addition to fatiuge. I woke up on Friday, and about 48 hours after the shot, I became very nauseous, and experienced several hours of vomiting and diarrhea. I called my primary care doctor in the afternoon to inquire whether these symptoms were normal and she prescribed me a low dose of Zofran to curb the vomiting. The following day, Saturday, I continued taking Zofran since I was still quite nauseous though no longer vomiting and had a splitting headache. By Sunday morning, I felt marginally better and was able to eat and drink a little.

                                                Upon receiving the injection I was dizzy and a nurse brought me water. When I returned to my workplace, I got a migraine and felt mentally cloudy. The following day, I could barely lift my left arm and had some muscle soreness.  I was very fatigued for several days. Then, about a week after receiving the vaccine, I had severe muscle spasms in my back. They began in the thoracic region but at times the pain would travel to my lower back as well. These spasms continued for over a week. I sought relief by having a 60-minute massage, and the massage therapist informed me that she felt inflammation along the length of my spine, not in one localized area as with an injury, but along the erectors of my spine. The massage did help, but I still have chronic back pain, and have had migraines about once a week. I obtained a medical marijuana card and I now take CBD daily and use THC oral spray when I have a migraine or more severe back pain. I consulted with a neurologist who promptly dismissed my symptoms and said that it couldn&#39;t be from the vaccine, but there is absolutely nothing else that could have caused this. I am otherwise healthy and have had no injuries or events occur except for this vaccine.

                                                Pt felt very anxious but thought she was ok after receiving the shot.  When she stood (approx. 2 minutes after receiving shot), she immediately felt light headed and her throat felt tingly, but pt continued to talk without any issues and sat back down.  She became flushed and had facial swelling within 10 minutes.  Pharmacist administered diphenhydramine liquid (25mg dose) at this point and patient wanted to wait to see if that helped before taking the second recommended dose to equal 50mg.  Patient continued being able to talk and facial swelling improved within 10 additional minutes.  Patient remained under pharmacist supervision and walked a few aisles to ensure she felt normal before walking patient to her car where her husband was waiting (at 10:30am).  Patient reported she was very anxious and has had panic attacks in the past, but never to a vaccination.  Patient appeared to have returned to her normal state before pharmacist left.  Facial swelling was resolved but patient still reported mild throat tingles.  Pharmacist followed up with patient at 3:15pm and she reported she was feeling much better and experienced no additional adverse events nor required additional interventions.

                                                About 2 hours after the vaccine I started filling dizzy. It was evening, so I just went right to bed. When I woke up in the middle of the night the room was spinning. I fell back asleep, but when I woke up in the morning the room was still spinning and stayed spinning all day. I was very, very dizzy and nauseous all day (3/18). I vomited twice and struggled to keep even water down. I slept on and off all day due to fatigue and anything I tried to do made me dizzy, so sleeping was about all I could do anyway. The next day (3/19) I woke up improved, not 100%, but better. Still dizzy at times, but not as intensely and I was able to eat and drink without vomiting or nausea. For the next couple of days (3/19-3/21) the dizziness came and went, but was overall much better than 3/18. On 3/22 I woke up feeling terrible again, very, very dizzy and unwell. I was slightly nauseous from the dizziness, but was able to keep water and food down. I did a virtual appointment with a doctor, who said I had vertigo. I&#39;ve had vertigo only once in my life (in January 2021), and it wasn&#39;t anything as bad as this. By 3/23 I was so miserable, I couldn&#39;t walk without assistance since I was afraid I would fall. I went in to see a doctor in person,  confirmed the vertigo diagnosis and recommended physical therapy. I did physical therapy and they said I had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo both in my left canal and in my horizontal canal. I started to slowly improve, but was unable to work due to my inability to look at a computer screen that week (3/22-3/28). I was well enough to work for 5 hours a day the week of 3/29, but unable to drive as sudden head movements continued to cause dizziness. As of 4/4 I started driving again and am feeling mostly better, but I still have dizzy spells. Dizzy spells are short and manageable. I&#39;ve been very fatigued (likely from the vertigo, but who knows) since receiving the vaccine. As of today (4/8), I&#39;m still not feeling 100%. I&#39;m still very fatigued and still experience dizziness if I move my head too much.

                                                I fainted around 6:35 am on 4/10/21. This was about 10 mins after I had taken Tylenol because my fever was at 101 and I had a bad headache. My heart was racing and I felt very weak. I was crawling on the floor to try to get my husband because I felt like I couldn&#39;t stand. I passed out in the hallway and came to probably 30 seconds later (I&#39;m not sure how long it was, but I think it was only a little while) and was very disoriented. I then got my husband who told me to lay in bed but I felt so weak that I couldn&#39;t get off the floor for about a minute. Finally I was able to lay down in bed and I was very sweaty. I slept/laid there for a couple of hours and felt a little better after but had a bad headache until mid afternoon that day.

Lifting arm was more painful than I?ve remembered any other shot or vaccine being. Starting the next day (if not sooner), I also experienced an acute depressive episode that has lasted since vaccine almost continuously. Have had symptoms each day at least once, but most days throughout most of day that included crying, extreme sadness, and some suicidal ideation. The things I?m feeling upset about don?t feel rational. Different from normal depressive episodes for me and feels very much like something is happening chemically and that I don?t have control over emotions. Also have experienced headaches each day from 4/11 through today. Waking up with headaches and lasting throughout most of day. I did experience exacerbated migraines when I was suffering from Covid-19 symptoms.

I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

Severe events began at 3:30-4:00pm : Symptoms included cellulitis on injection site that last trough the week. Tiredness, lightheaded and wooziness increased until early morning with symptoms of extra heavy tiredness and lightheaded, wooziness and brain fog. My personal opinion is that it was some kind related to T cells, which are related to celiaq disease overactive response with gluten  or crosscontamination intoxication. Severe events began slowing down until fully dissapeared on the 3rd day after 2ndo dose.

Hives burned and were extremely itchy and uncomfortable, unable to sleep. Urgent Care provider prescribed prednisone 20 mg tablet, cimetidine 200 mg tablet and cetirizine 10 mg tablet and hives went away.   2nd outbreak of full body hives occurred early morning on April 13th.  2nd outbreak worse than the 1st outbreak with hives on face, neck, head/scalp, chest, torso, back, groin, arms and legs. Again, hives burned and were extremely itchy and uncomfortable, unable to sleep. Saw Urgent care provider and dermatologist on April 13th and dermatologist prescribed topical steroid creams, OTC Allegra 2x a day and Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg to take before bedtime. Significant improvement of hives the next morning. As of April 15th I am continuing the prescribed treatment and hives have greatly improved but as still have light markings where the hives were.

                                                She got her vaccine, initially she had bruising on her forearm that was blue/yellow with a swollen vein connected running down to her hand.  She had tingling and numbness in her fingers in a select few on the left hand.  She also had drooping of her left eye for a short period and a sensation on her left leg, swelling and pain.  She went to the urgent care on 4/15/21, they told her to go home and monitor it.  She knew that somewhat was not right and called a nurse at Hospital and went to the ER shortly thereafter and confirmed that she had a blood clot in her jugular vein IJ-DVT.  In the ER they gave her a shot of Lovenox in the ER into her stomach and run several tests.  They also gave her an anti-inflammatory in her right arm.   She was sent home with Eliquis for the next 3 months.  She has extreme exhaustion, and in addition to that she has had a lot of swelling on the left side of her leg, and visited the ER again on 4/17/21.  Her left foot became blue, very swollen, so they ran a number of tests which all came back negative.  She thinks these are side effects in relation to the previous.  She is still continuing with stiffness in her neck as well.   She also has a severe headache, fever of about 100, and severe achiness.   She has not been able to work due to these symptoms since 4/15/21.  The ER told her to have a lot of rest, no heavy listing/straining due to the clot.

                                                My partner and I got the vaccine around 1 pm, we decided to go home immediately after in cause any of us developed side effects. During the first couple of hours, I felt a little nauseated, but that went away. Everything seemed ok until at around 9pm I started to develop pain on my left arm. I took Advil and relaxed, at around midnight, I was in excruciating pain, I lost complete movement of my arm. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep that night. The next day I tried 800mg of Aleve which helped very little. I couldn&#39;t move or do anything I normally do. That night I also developed fever and I sweat a lot soaking the sheets and the mattress. The extreme pain continued for the next 3 days, until on the forth day, it went away. Today marks 8 days since my injection, and I woke up last night with the same pain. I took Advil and it alleviated somewhat. I could describe the pain as an inflammatory pain that pulses in the bone and nerves. If I tried to forcefully move my arm, it felt like my arm was being ripped from my body. I was in tears for days.

                                                On 2/3/21, I arrived for my COVID -19 2nd Moderna dose at Hospital. The woman who was administering the dosage asked me to reposition 3 times. She seemed rather flustered and kept saying &#34;she couldn&#39;t get the right angle.&#34; I had on a polo shirt with the sleeve rolled up above my shoulder to allow for adequate deltoid access. On the 2nd reposition she mentioned that she &#34;may need me to stand up.&#34; On the 3rd reposition she had me turn so my back was toward her and she said &#34;ok we got it.&#34; She then put the needle in and I immediately knew it was in the wrong spot. It felt extremely high and was the back of my shoulder. As she started injecting it I had a shooting pain go down my arm into my 1st and 2nd fingers. As she was finishing she stated &#34;did that hurt?&#34; &#34;that looked like it hurt.&#34; I reported it hurt to her. She stated &#34;She was sorry.&#34; My arm was very sore after the first injection so I had hoped that It was just going to be the same and maybe it would be fine despite it being extremely high and in the back of the shoulder. The  pain persisted to the point that I could barely lift my arm by that evening, which continued over the next 5 days. Ibuprofen took the edge off the pain. The pain persisted over the next week in which I contacted my supervisor and reported the incident due to receiving the vaccine at my place of employment. There was pain going into my deltoid, shooting pain in the lateral border of my scapula, throbbing in the shoulder at rest. Due to pain all the muscles tightened up and caused left sided neck pain and headaches. Significant difficulty with dressing, bathing, inability to sleep well, unable to lift arm past 60 degrees of flexion or abduction at shoulder without significant pain. Unable to lift anything in the left arm. Pain slowly improved with PT and use of meloxicam and at current date 5/4/21 still unable to lift items &gt;5lb or bear a lot of weight on the L arm. Continuing to have difficulty at work, unable to do certain mobs/manipulations due to the inability to push/pull.

Pain in my arm. Nausea and major, major, major migraines. I had migraines consistently - couldn&#39;t move off my couch. Those symptoms mostly went away after the third day.  I saw my OB/GYN this week and they said that my fetus stopped growing about three weeks ago.  Pregnancy history - my third pregnancy; none have gone to full-term. I have had a miscarriage before that was very similar to this one.  Estimated date of delivery - December 2, 2021. I have recovered from the immediate side effects. I get the fetus removed next week.

                                                I received my Moderna COVID vaccine on Thursday, May 20, 2021 and at that time I only had a slight fever and my arm was a bit sore at the injection site.     My reaction to the Moderna began in the wee hours of Friday May 21st.  I had a fever of 103.0, I did not go to walk in or my doctor because I took Tylenol and after a few minutes my fever subsided.  I went back to sleep.  Upon waking up I had body aches, a running fever, my head felt like I was in a fog that I couldn?t shake.  I was so tired that I could hardly keep awake.  My fever kept getting worse through out the day so I kept taking Advil (I had stopped taking Tylenol because it had stopped working).   Advil helped a little bit but I felt like my fever would never go away.   This happened through out the entire Friday May 21st.  Then in the middle of the night around midnight Friday into Saturday I began sweating profusely all the while having a fever and body aches and I was really really tired.  When I woke up at 5am Saturday my clothes were drenched in sweat and I felt better, but the entire weekend I had nausea and diarrhea.

Intermittent searing joint pain- like my sciatica was firing through my hips, legs and arms. Throbbing headache. Leg cramps- those I found concerning as I was aware of the more benign side effects .Lasted several hours. (20-44 hours post vaccine) brain fog. It gradually began to clear . Felt like I had a hangover and no sleep.  Then randomly- I fell 6/6 at about 845am... 46 hours after the vaccine. I never fall. I did not trip. I did not have the sensation of falling. I was walking and then down on the pavement outside a clients house (I?m a visiting nurse) it concerned me because I checked the area for trip hazards and there were none.

                                                I received the first Covid-19 Moderna dose at roughly 8:47 a.m. After waiting 15 minutes I continued with my normal routine. I took (2) Tylenol anticipating symptoms from the vaccine. I finished my workday and got off around 4:00 p.m. Got home and ate dinner around 5:00 p.m. I did a light workout with the Nintendo Switch Adventure Fit game for 30 minutes. At 8:00 p.m. I began to feel adverse effects. I was reading to the boys when I felt a general all-around weird feeling that almost made want to stop reading. As I kept reading, I found it at times difficult to figure out words. Which slowed down my usual reading speed. I read for 30-45 minutes and this would happen intermittently. After done reading I proceeded to tell my husband about my day and dreams. So sure, of what I was about to say but would suddenly forget. Regaining my thoughts, I would finish my story but would then suddenly forget again. I would also start tasks, like putting my dirty clothes in the hamper, but then lose focus on that task. Thinking maybe I just needed a good night?s sleep, I went to bed. Through out the night I just felt waves uneasiness. I would fall asleep but then wake back up again feeling weird. My hands were shaking, possible response to fear of the effects. I seemed to focus on my heart beat every now then making me think I might have experienced a slight rapid heart rate. I would also feel a weird intermittent fuzzy feeling that would rush from the back of my head to the front of my head. It was almost like a warning that I was going to feel bad again. Eventually, not knowing the time, I fell asleep. The next morning, I woke up at approximately 6:00 a.m. I felt fatigued mentally and physically, had a mild headache, slight fuzzy headed, slight dizziness, slight nausea and had a sore arm. I took (2) Tylenol around 9:00 a.m and decided to report my symptoms to my PCPs office and made an appointment with an available ARNP. I took (2) Tylenol again at 6:00 p.m. I felt almost back to my normal self the third day after my vaccination.

                                                The Moderna covid vaccine was the first vaccine I ever had.  On the evening of the 18th, I was sitting alone after work, scrolling my phone when my heart started beating very fast, hard, and irregularly. I felt pressure in my chest and a wave of tingling wash over my head. My vision went funny and grey around the edges as if I was about to pass out. It felt lie something was squeezing my heart. I sat on the floor, put my head between my knees and took deep breaths. The heart rate spikes seemed to come in waves with a feeling of pressure every few minutes. I called someone to take me to the ER and they arrived about 45 minutes after initial symptom onset. My heart rate had slowed slightly and the spikes were coming farther apart by then. It was cold in the car and it gave me chills, but I felt that it made me feel a little better. At the ER, they kept me from about 9:30 pm to after 3:00 am. My symptoms slowly abated, with heart rate spikes coming about every 15 to 30 minutes, but shorter, and not going as high. I sat there and watched the pulse monitor for abot 5 hours, varying between the 60s and 108.  I was discharged after several tests without a diagnosis and told to follow up with a cardiologist in 2 days. The attending physician verbally told me the tests were normal and I was fine, but when I viewed my test results online, it said I had an abnormal ECG, left atrial inflammation, and a possible heart attack. I was uninsured at the time, so they declined to run expensive tests. I also did not have a primary care provider.  Around midnight on the evening of the 20th/morning of the 21st, a similar thing occurred while I had a late night snack and watched a TV show. I did not feel as if I was going to pass out, but had regular heart rate spikes, and a rapid, irregular heartbeat with pressure in my chest. This time I also had nausea and burning in my stomach. I did deep breathing all night. Managed to doze for about an hour. This episode lasted until 6 am. I felt better then and tried to find a cardiologist, but was referred to the ER. By the time a friend took me there (around 7-7:30 am, I think), my symptoms had largely abated, but I was very fatigued and short of breath just standing. I was again discharged after testing with no diagnosis, but told to follow-up with a cardiologist. Again, I was verbally told again that the tests were normal and I was fine, but the notes said possible biatrial inflammation. By this point, my chest ached constantly.  A close friend came to help take care of me on the evening of the 22nd, and I got so excited to see her that my heart rate spiked again. I lay down and did deep breathing and couldn?t talk to her or look at her until the next day without intense heart rate spikes, nausea, chest pain, and chest pressure.   I saw Dr. on the 23rd. He diagnosed me with orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. He took my pulse while sitting (about 80, which is high for me, because my average resting pulse is usually in the high 40s/low 50s), and when standing. When I stood up, my pulse went to 120 and I became short of breath. He told me to drink pedialyte, ingest a lot of salt (he declined to recommend a specific amount), wear compression stockings, exercise while lying down, and ease myself back into activity. I should also keep my feet up as much as possible. I immediately started drinking a lot of pedialyte (a gallon to a gallon and a half a day), eating salty foods, and keeping my feet elevated.  I continued to be very fatigued with episodes of rapid heartbeat (though not as bad as I went to the ER for). I frequently got a squeezing feeling in my chest as if my heartbeat was irregular. I took my blood pressure regularly and it was usually low (90s/?). Anything that was remotely exciting spiked my heart rate. I could not watch TV, listen to music, game, talk on the phone, or even sit upright.All I could do was lie flat and play boring, unexciting games on my phone. This continued for weeks. I could only sleep on my back because sleeping on my side gave me a feeling that my heart was compressed and increased my heart rate. When I got out of bed, after a few seconds I would get black spots in my vision and a wave of tingling over my scalp and feel as if I were abot to pass out. Bending over and leaning on the counter for about 5-10 seconds makes this abate.  My friend had made me an appointment on April 28th, so I went to this appointment because I was not feeling better and wanted a second opinion. Dr. did not communicate as well, but seemed to agree with Dr. assessment. He prescribed fludrocortisone, metaprolol, and sertraline. He told me to take the fludrocortisone for two days before starting the metaprolol. The metaprolol seemed to help. It started keeping my heart beat irregularity/spike episodes from getting as high or lasting as long. Those have slowly diminished, though I still have a lesser version of them. The metaprolol also seemed to mostly end the squeezing feeling to my heart and irregular beat.  On the evening of the May 6th, my heart started beating very hard and fast. My blood pressure was 140/?. I stopped taking the fludrocortisone and ingesting salt. I also had a squeezing feeling at the bottom of my sternum. On the 7th, I was unable to take a full breath. Whenever I tried to inflate my lungs, the squeezing feeling at the bottom of my sternum would worsen and  keep my lungs from expanding. If I lay flat and only took shallow breaths, I didn?t notice anything, but as soon as I sat up or tried to stand, I could barely breathe. Dr. office referred me to the ER . At the ER, my blood pressure was 160/?. I was admitted to the hospital on the evening of the 7th and discharged on the 10th. During my stay, I was able to get temporary Medicaid to cover my hospital bills. Insurance through get covered would start on the first of June.  During my hospital stay, I lay flat constantly so I could breathe, and that symptom slowly lessened, though did not go away completely. I also started experiencing tension in my throat and jaw while lying flat on my back and could not find a comfortable sleeping position. I was seen by a cardiologist who ordered tests for me on the 8th and the tests were administered on the 10th.  I was briefly seen by a cardiologist, that morning and he said it was possible I had a hiatal hernia that was physically irritating my heart. At that time, my admitting doctor, told me nothing matched my symptoms and maybe it was anxiety. The discharge paper listed anxiety, depression, increased risk of falls, decreased cardiac output, high risk of bleeding, and orthostatic hypotension. Verbally, I was told I was a clot risk, but it was not on my discharge papers. I was not referred to psych or prescribed medication, or referred for an endoscopy, but discharged with the exact same symptoms I had been admitted for and told to follow up with a cardiologist in a couple weeks.  Over the course of the next couple weeks, without treatment, the tension in my chest slowly eased until I could breathe almost normally. Taking a deep breath still gives me a weird feeling of uncomfortableness and pressure in my chest, but only a deep one. I still get winded easily, but not fromstanding up or walking around my apartment. Bending over is hard. I started being able to carry things as long as they weren&#39;t heavy.  On May 18th and June 8th, I saw a primary care provider, who ordered more tests and referred me to a pulmonologist, endocrinologist (next week and the week after), psychiatrist and psychologist (but I am having trouble finding ones who will work with my insurance). I also saw a gastroenterologist, on the 21st, was prescribed Prilosec, and scheduled an endoscopy in early July.  I still have a lot of the same symptoms, some of them have lessened a little, and some are mostly gone. Fatigue is constant, shortness of breath, tightness in my throat, tightness at the bottom of my esophagus, and increased heartbeat are common. Nausea and stomach burning only occur occasionally, but I still have nearly constant discomfort at the bottom of my esophagus/top of my stomach. I constantly feel as if something is squeezing my throat. The very rapid heartbeat spikes seem to be almost entirely gone, thanks to the metaprolol, but there are still mild ones. Chest pressure occurs frequently, but usually goes away when I change position. Tightness at my jaw occurs cocurrently with the chest pressure. I can sleep on my side again, though it is still feels as if it increases my heart rate sometimes. I consider it an accomplishment that I can now sit upright most of the time most days. I sometimes have a few good hours in a day where I feel almost normal. I can walk on a flat surface for a short period of time, but going up even a slight incline causes heartbeat spikes and a feeling of my heart being squeezed and I have to stop immediately. Harder work like carrying heavy groceries or an extended period walking around a store would be impossible for me.  I still get black spots in my vision when I stand up, but only sometimes and have just kind of gotten used to it and expect to have to stop and bend over. Sitting upright without back support is uncomfortable and slumping at all increases the pressure at the bottom of my esophagus.  I am a massage therapist, but have been unable to work since this started. I can?t even take care of myself without the assistance of friends. I still don?t have a diagnosis that explains my symptoms.

Muscle aches, fatigue, just felt off.  Then arm was very sore.  Sunday night my arm pit really started hurting.  Hurst over my shoulder, clavicle, and down into the lateral side of my breast.  Bothered enough in the night that I didn&#39;t sleep well.  This morning 1-5-21 I have a red rash over the injection site, arm is swollen over deltoid and hot.  Arm pit and down into breast is still hurting significantly.  I took Ibuprofen yesterday and helped some with pain in arm pit.  Off an on SOB and chest feels tight.  No cough

Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

                                                The next morning following the vaccination, my right lower eyelid started severely twitching every 10-15 minutes for 4 days throughout the entire day, usually subsiding at bedtime. Each time it lasts from 30 seconds to 1 minute every single day. on the 5th day, the twitching stopped for approximately 15 hours but returned when I went to sleep and kept me up through the night. THis has really taken a toll on my livelihood and I am afraid of it progressing to Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never had this happen.

Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

                                                Day of shot had pretty extreme pain in the arm a few hours later into the night. Was pretty extreme next day - couldn?t move arm above head, hard to change in and out of clothes, etc. Following day still pain but maybe 10%better. Over weekend slowly got better. This Monday and Tuesday woke up with very slight pain but nothing that I had to adjust my everyday routine for like a I had the first few days so I thought I was in the clear. Then last night extreme pain back again. Can?t move arm/shoulder without pain. Can?t engage muscle without a lot of pain.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes, but no more than 7 minutes after I received the vaccine I felt odd, like something was about to happen. I felt a bit detached from my body and my surroundings.  I then felt a flush of heat and my throat suddenly closed up. I felt frozen, as if I couldn?t have drawn in a breath if I had wanted to. I quickly removed my mask and sat up in my chair and leaned forward. After approximately 8-10 seconds my throat opened up and I could breathe.  At this time I felt my heart was racing; I could feel my pulse in my neck without putting my hand to my throat. I started to take my pulse at this time and I could feel that my heart rate was beating fast, but was slowing down back to a normal rate. It took approximately 2 minutes for my heart rate to normalize.  I could now breathe, but my throat still felt a little tight, but I wasn?t completely sure. My throat felt as though I had a lump in it and it felt a little difficult to swallow. I wasn?t completely sure it was the vaccination or that I may have been thirsty. I sat for 15 minutes and I felt fine, no other issues. I had to go to a doctor?s appointment where they took my blood pressure (approximately 1 hour after the vaccination) and said that my bp was normal.   I left the appointment at 4:00 pm and noticed that it was no longer difficult to swallow. I noticed that my throat felt different. The feeling of the ?lump? was gone and I could swallow much more easily. It was at this time that I realized my throat had still been swollen. It had taken almost 2 hours from the time of injection for my throat to feel normal again.  I am healthy, have had several vaccinations in the past and have no known allergies. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I contacted my PCP the next day once they were open to describe my symptoms. She said that I should proceed with the second dose next month, but should take some precautions first.   I didn?t alert anyone immediately after the vaccination as I?ve never had this sort of reaction and wasn?t entirely sure of what it was. I was also in route to a doctor?s appointment and figured if necessary, could receive treatment there. My PCP advised me to take 2 Benadryl and a Zyrtec one hour before the next vaccination. She also advised that I wait for 30 minutes in the observation area following the next dose.   It is Monday evening and as of now I have had no other adverse effects. I have had minimal arm pain and no other effects at all.

                                                As the injection day wore on, my arm increased in soreness. By 9:00 pm on day of injection, I was unable to lift or move my arm, due to the pain. For 2 days after the injection, I was unable to perform many activities becuase I could not lift or move my arm. By 11:30 pm on Saturday 1/16, I started to be able to lift and move my arm, a tiny bit. On Sunday the 17th, I was able to lift my arm to shoulder height, but still had a great deal of pain. The pain started to lessen throughout the day on Sunday. When I woke up Monday morning, I was able to use my arm, but it felt &#34;dead&#34; (like when you sleep on a limb wrong). This feeling continued through Tuesday, and Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, into Wednesday the 20th, it feels like there is a tennis ball in my arm pit - when my arm is in normal position. When my axillary lymph nodes were felt, there is no swelling, but a greater amount of pain.

I took 800 mg Ibuprofen and then I had to take 1000 mg Tylenol and was sent home from work and Tylenol kicked in and I dosed every 8 hours and did that for a few days to be safe. The 31st wasn&#39;t bad - mostly felt fatigued and was getting on and off headaches. 1st - Feeling some fatigue still is all and then SI joint has still not resolved.

Normal treatment that works for me( rizatroban) only slightly lessened. Advil Tylenol alternated for migraine and chills. Arm much less sore this time. I would say normal injection soreness.  But stayed in bed all day due to migraine, chills and fatigue. No way I could have worked. 36hrs- woke up feeling really foggy and some dizziness.  After drinking a few glasses of water feeling somewhat normal.  No fatigue today, arm feeling almost normal.

I went to bed that night as usual. I was tossing and turning and woke my self up because i could feel my heart racing. I then proceeded to check my pulse and time myself. I had gotten 120 heart rate. Which i thought it couldnt be but the i have the oxygen sat that check oxygen and heart rate. I checked and my heart rate went up to 125. My head was pounding, i had a fever, the left side of my body ached, and i felt a lot of tension and my hands as if they were swollen. I took some Tylenol throughout the day and i still felt completely exhausted and horrible. This lasted at least 2 days. I contacted the ER nurse hotline they proceeded to tell me that all the signs and symptoms I had were reactions to the vaccine and if my heart rate went over 135 to go to the ER.

                                                Starting around 12 hours after injection- Severe, sharp joint pain all over and muscle aches, muscle contractions/twitching, 12 hour fever, mild-moderate stomach cramping and nausea, extreme fatigue and discomfort from body pain. Approximately 24 hours after vaccine, moderate facial dermal fillers (hyaluronic acid) swelling and pain/tenderness upon palpation. Most of the body pain and fever/sweats stopped after about 16-20 hours after vaccine. Took two Benadryl and an antihistamine (I&#39;m 110lbs) at bedtime day 2 for facial swelling and it did not continue to worsen after that. Day 3 today and the facial swelling is still going down and almost gone, with no more pain. Fatigued and worn out from the 12 hour night of no sleep with bad body pains and fever that first night, but otherwise feeling good besides slight migraine. Menstrual cycle just started today (day 3) so I believe the migraine is from that (common for me).

                                                I received my vaccine, sat in a chair facing the clock and noted it said 5:00pm.  Within a minute I notice tingling and slight numbness of my soft palate.  I found this odd, but didn&#39;t notice any swelling or difficulty breathing.  At 5:02 I texted my husband to make sure my Epipen was in the glove compartment in case I needed it later after leaving the vaccination clinic.  Over the next few minutes the numbness increased and started to spread to my oropharynx area.  I noticed my heart beating faster and wondered if my body was subconsciously anxious about the numb feeling even though I didn&#39;t feel worried because I was breathing fine.  Very suddenly my heart started to pound very hard, my entire laryngopharynx went numb and I felt like a deck of cards was sitting in the back of my throat.  I looked at the clock, it was 5:07.  I started to feel dizzy and weak, my heart felt like it was about to explode, my hands were suddenly cold, clammy and shaking, I started to get sharp stomach pains similar to other anaphylactic events, but still no effects on my breathing. I looked at the clock, 5:09, I knew I had to tell someone before I couldn&#39;t get up to walk.  As I started to talk to a staff member I felt very disoriented and suddenly went from feeling like I was going to faint to very hypertensive with pain shooting into my left arm.  The staff quickly tooth my BP and HR, I noted my BP was 166/100 (I am normally 114/72) and the doctor stated I was too tachycardic and needed to go to the ER.  At the ER I received Benadryl, Pepcid and an IV, but never needed any epinephrine.  The medications resolved numbness and stomach pain.  I left with the feeling of a tight turtleneck around my throat and it continues to come and go.  Every 6-8 hours I have had to take Benadry and a steroid to keep the intense itching numb feeling in my soft palate away.  I still have tightness around my neck that returns every 6-8 hours, but still no airway or edema issue.  I felt like I had anaphylaxis without the edema.

                                                About 3 hours after the injection, I was hit all of a sudden with extreme fatigue and dizziness. This lasted several hours until a took a 2-3 hour nap after lunch. I felt better enough after the nap to at least get through the rest of the day. However, by around 8 pm I had uncontrollable shaking chills. Could not get warm. Eventually fell asleep, and woke up 3 hours later with fever and severe body aches. My temperature was 101.5, but consider that my normal body temp is a full degree lower than average, so for me this was extremely hot. I felt like my body was radiating heat like a furnace. I was so hot and uncomfortable that I couldn&#39;t sleep, and gave up after an hour. I got up and had a Tylenol, tea, and snack (so as to not have the Tylenol on empty stomach). A little before 4 am I finally fell asleep again. When I woke up around 7 am, I didn&#39;t feel quite so hot anymore but there were still the body aches. As the morning went on, the aches reduced to just my upper body, neck, and the sore injection arm. I had a headache through the morning and early afternoon, but by late afternoon I was feeling more normal again.

My fever peaked at 101.2 at 2am. Pain relievers and fever reducers did not help. I had cold sweats throughout the night, not able to sleep consistently through the night due to body aches, headache and nausea. Left arm became swollen, hot and hard to the touch, this lasted through 2/17/21. The arm was itchy from 2/18-2/20/21. The fever and body aches lasted through 2/16 until about 10:15pm, around 11:00pm the headache went away. I was feeling mostly recovered with the exception of the arm by the morning of 2/17.

She had a tingling inside her mouth behind her teeth.  She was administered Benadryl.  She then got a tingling inside of the throat that moved down into her chest.  First Response team  was called.  She was having SOB.  She was moved to the ER where she was given more Benadryl and prednisone.  After that she had tingling in her lips as they were warm and puffy.  She was released around noon.  About 1:00 PM the same day pt started having SOB and the same bad taste in her mouth along with all of the other symptoms.  She took another Benadryl at 1:54 PM.   At 3PM she was sleeping and woke with tingling and hotness in her lips.  She started coughing and having trouble catching her breath.  This symptoms went away and came back at 3:46 pm.  She then again developed the same symptoms all over again but this also included swelling in the back of the tongue.   She took another Benadryl at 6:28 PM and then again at 10:28. About 11PM she got these mouth symptoms again along w/ really itchy feet and back.  She woke up at 5:50 AM she felt fine. At 8:00 AM she woke up and had the strange metal taste in her mouth along with a strange feeling in it.   At 11AM she had mild episode of the SOB and coughing.  At 3:15 she still has this taste in her mouth along with the strange feeling.  Pt is waiting on a CB from her PCP.

I was unable to get out of bed for 24 hours.  After 24 hours of this, my headache lingered for 2 days as well as my neck stiffness and malaise.  I would likely not get a 2nd dose ever again because the symptoms were so awful.  I am a Registered Nurse.

Extreme fatigue has been present since the evening of the injection.  GI symptoms including nausea, lack of appetite, and diarrhea, and gurgling upset&#39; stomach have been present since the day after the injection.  Severe trembling of the hands was observed on video, and body tremors were present in office.  Patient reports feeling unwell&#39;, exhausted, nauseous, and in pain. It won&#39;t let me continue.

As I was driving home at 3:50 pm I suddenly started to feel tingling in my lips and my throat felt swollen and my chest tight. I was halfway home and panicked so I went home and stayed put. My throat started to relax but my chest felt tight and I was dizzy and light headed till about 9pm. My lips ended up getting a little swollen and I?m still having a burning sensation in my cheeks and chin and my lips are still itchy.  I am a nurse and my husband is a physician and we had an epi pen on hand so I didn?t feel the need to go to the hospital as I was in good care but it was terrifying.

                                                On the 1/23  I started to have a rash at the area of the injection site. It was very uncomfortable. Very itchy and felt very hot.  I had to ice pack it and put calamine lotion to help with the symptoms. I did not take anything orally as I was not sure if it was safe to take anti histamines being that I am pregnant. The next day I went to work however I was still having a lot of itchiness in the area of injection.  I took a benadryl table at around 9 am.  At around 10 o&#39;clock I started feeling dizzy and not myself.  I felt that I could not think clearly and I was worried about passing out.  Specially due to my pregnancy ( 13 weeks at that time)  I decided to seek medical attention and went to urgent care.

But as of date indicated  yesterday first time got a large round swelling 3-4? diameter  (looks like a mosquito bite) that was itchy and felt like a mosquito bite.  Today that swelling is expanding twice in size. Maybe 6??  It is now giving a burning sensation and itchy and painful. My entire body feels lethargic since I woke up and in pain. Also felt I had chills in afternoon and a fever. Could not concentrate or do work, it was heavy symptoms that weren?t letting me sit or do activities for long. Just felt like being in bed.

She reported that symptoms persisted for 4 days afterwards. She took time off work to stay home during that time. She did not take any medication for the nausea. She also reported feeling &#34;achy joints&#34;. She took ibuprofen for the achy joints and those symptoms went away after 2 days.  She had not had any changes in her diet prior to vaccination. Patient called on 3/8/21 to talk to me (the pharmacist) about her symptoms. She informed me that she sent a message to her primary care doctor to inform them of her symptoms. I suggested that she go to an urgent care since her symptoms had not gone away and that she should schedule an appointment with her primary care doctor. I called the patient on 3/9/21 to follow up, but she did not answer her phone.

                                                Dizziness started around 230pm in the afternoon on Saturday, 3 days after the first does (i also felt a brief wave, Friday around the same time,  2:30pm only 2 days after my shot). Sunday morning when I woke up I felt full on vertigo (forward and back) and a disoriented feeling due to feeling a really strong pulse consistently in my head and whole body. This dizziness and vertigo caused naseua. I treated it with meclizine and ondansetron but it only mildly helped symptoms. I went to urgent care and got a steroid shot. They also measured that my blood pressure was high. The steroid shot also did not do much to change the dizziness. Today is Wednesday, a full week after my first shot, and I am still feeling dizzy, with pulsing pressure in my head and full body causing vertigo. I went to an ent today and was started on a z pack. I&#39;m not sure what else to try or how long to expect this or if this is considered an allergic reaction and I should skip my second dose?

Fever always maintained predominantly above 102, dropped to 101 before it broke and went down.

After the second shot, I began having extreme fatigue, continuing joint pain, which has progressed to a burning pain in my rib cage.  I am also having numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. This has caused extreme anxiety and difficulty working. I have gone from exercising very vigorously 6 days a week to light walking with extreme fatigue.

However, about 30 minutes after (I had already left the clinic) I started feeling lightheaded, dizzy, had a rapid heartrate, and felt like I was going to pass out (I never did pass out). I had a rapid heartrate and dizziness for about 48 hours. I also had a headache and extreme fatigue (also started about 30 minutes after the injection), but assumed those affects were normal.

I believe I got it then bc I wrote on Feb 14 exactly 2 weeks after seeing our factory partners. My head felt shaken like astigmatism in my brain. So haven&#39;t had a real period for a year and then after the vaccine worst cramps in my life. Then I have stomach hurting and GI issues every hour or so. Lastly my eyes have been red at night a lot and I would keep getting headaches from time to time for no reason and I&#39;m not a headache person.

Felt like everything around me and myself was in slow motion.   Got home and took allergy medication and it got a little better.  The heaviness of the tongue lasted about 24 hours but never felt SOB.

                                                I received the vaccination on 3/25. On 3/26 and 3/27 I experienced vaccination site soreness, which began to dissipate on 3/28. On 3/29 and 3/30 I experienced a persistent headache and also newly appearing red splotches at the injection site that went away within 48 hours. Then, on 3/30 I also began to experience extreme fatigue and felt &#34;foggy,&#34; which persisted on 3/31. During the night of 3/31-morning of 4/1, I woke up multiple times during the night alternating between hot flashes and cold sweats and feeling slightly short of breath, and my eyes were very bloodshot upon fully awakening. I recorded a temperature of 99.9 degrees F the morning of 4/1 and still felt fatigued, so I called off of work and slept most of the day. By the evening of 4/1 I felt entirely better, as if nothing had happened. I want to note that I was diagnosed with a mild case of COVID-19 during early December 2020, so I wanted to submit my vaccination experience in case you are disaggregating side effect data by whether or not patients have previously had COVID-19. Of course I cannot be sure that my symptoms were definitively related to the vaccine, but if they were then the duration of symptoms seems quite lengthy.

Later in the evening after 2nd shot on the 31st my arm became red, hot to the touch, swollen, and hard. Very painful and at times itchy. This lasted 4 days. The next day after the second shot (April 1st) I got severe nausea and severe joint pain to where I could not stand or lie down comfortably at all. No relief. Also got chills and felt very feverish although I had no fever. This lasted most of the day but subsided by late evening.

After about 5 or 10 minutes from receiving the shot I started feeling warm and nauseous.  The on site nurse came over and I did vomit.  I felt better almost instantly.  She was wonderful, but had me stay in the supervision area for an additional 20 minutes to make sure I didn&#39;t have any more nausea or other symptoms.

Finally at 53 hour mark after orginal vaccination, was feeling back to normal.

                                                After the vaccine, I walked up stair to leave. I felt flush, and my heart began to race. That evening, I noticed I was out of breath, more than usual. Then the next day, I was in tachycardia while resting. Climbing the stairs at home, my heart rate was above 140 BPM. I was trying to not move around alot to  keep my heart rate down. It was an uncomfortable feeling. I called my doctor and had a video visit on 01/18/2021 and the on 01/21/2021 my heart rate was up over 100 BPM while just sitting. It felt like something was off with the biochemistry of my body. I saw Cardiology on 01/22/2021 and on 01/23/2021 they sent me to see a POTTS specialists. When I took a shower on 01/25/2021 my heart rate went up and my nervous system was activated. I started taking cold showers afterwards. It seems to help. On 01/29/2021 I started getting tingling in my feet that moved to my hands. It flairs up when I am stressed. On 02/27/2021 I had bloodwork that shows my ANA as POS with the numbers greater than 2,560.  I know that 6 months prior, I had NEG ANA results.  I also experienced fatigue, trouble sleeping and brain fog.

That lead to dizzyness, the inability to see or walk properly. I was helped, by two people holding me up by each arm, to the medical room that was set up. They helped me lie down. I think about 5 to 10 minutes later, it&#39;s a blur, so I don&#39;t officially know how long this lasted, I was able to tack some water they offered. The vertigo seemed to have left, but I was still wobbly and weak. After about 25 or 30 minutes I started sitting up. After 40, I felt ok enough to drive home, though still a bit unsettled on my stomach and weak. This feeling lasted a couple of hours. I started to feel better at that point, and then mostly felt a bit tired and sore at the injection site.

Rash turned from red to purple before going away on day seven.

Patient had no known allergies, only advised that she was afraid of needles.  She did not come alone, she was with her mom for the fact she knew she might get really nervous with getting the immunization.  She was alert and ok during the whole process and left in good spirits. She stayed for more than 30minutes.  We had her wait until she felt ok to go home with her mom.  Management also stopped by make sure she was ok.  Tried to call her tonight to see how she was and left a message.

It stayed like that for over an hour, it kept coming in waves of dizziness, shortness of breath, low blood pressure and a racing heart 120

                                                The day of the shot I had some pain on my right side body, right jaw... on Wednesday I was just very tired and slept a lot. Thursday morning I woke with pain in my hips and Pelvis, and around 9am pelvic pain started that felt as sever as the pain I felt giving birth (20 months ago). Thurs/Friday and today (Saturday) it?s been so painful I?ve had a hard time walking, laughing, coughing and caring for my toddler has been immensely challenging. My period began Friday afternoon, a heavier flow than usual. To be clear I have VERY mild periods and am a very healthy young woman. This is unlike anything I?ve ever experienced and the only thing that is different was receiving the vaccine and upon further research it seems MANY women of menstruating age have been experiencing abnormal periods. Today I am still in so much pain it?s debilitating however it is less sever than yesterday (Friday) and the fatigue also continues even after sleeping 10 hours last night.

                                                About an hour after the vaccine, I had some strange nerve sensations on the left side of my body, including losing circulation to parts of my left hand and left foot. I woke up the morning after vaccination with much more pain in my left arm than dose 1 and flu-like symptoms. During that day, symptoms became progressively worse, with an increasing fever, chills, aches. I eventually left work to lay down when it became worse, and was very  feverish, hallucinating, and unable to sleep. Day 2 I had a migraine and body aches. Day 3 I woke up with severe hives, covering most of my face and chest, especially on the left side- my left ear was swollen to the point where it looked like I had had an accident. Day 4, all severe symptoms were gone, but I had cold symptoms (congestion, fatigue) for about a week after.

I have normal migraines but felt like I had been hit in the back of the head with a sledgehammer. It was so intense. I was not able to function as I normally do. I called into work sick, but remember throughout the day, I tried to respond to texts and e-mails and would try and fall back asleep. I was so weak, and my entire body hurt. I talked to my mom and husband on the phone and do not have any recollection of doing so. I didn&#39;t have a fever by that night. The next day, I worked from home but was still so weak and tired I had to take off and keep taking naps. The 3rd day, I finally started getting a little of my strength back and wasn&#39;t as tired. I continued to improve over the next two days; five days total.

I did not think much of this as I thought it could be a common side effect, however, the loose stools continued for over a week even with dietary changes. No other symptoms, just loose stools. Then about 5 days ago my stomach started hurting after I would eat. Extreme, painful bloating that is causing me to break a sweat. As I type this my stomach feels like I have a brick inside. I removed dairy, sugar, and anything else I thought might cause or worsen inflammation from my diet but nothing has helped so far and now I am experiencing anxiety every time I eat. I&#39;m also now very apprehensive about getting the second shot because I don&#39;t want these symptoms to worsen. It is interfering with my daily activities and ability to eat, work, and even sleep.

At around the 14 hour mark, I got debilitating nausea and a fever that reached 102.1. I vomited from about 12am-3:30am solid. I was able to go to sleep around 5, awoke at 7 with pain and nausea again, took a Tylenol, and was able to go back to sleep. I slept until 2:30pm. I still had joint and bone aches and a bad headache and a lower fever of about 101. That dissipated throughout the evening (Tuesday evening). Wednesday I felt a bit better aside from a very sore neck and headache. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol on Wednesday. Today (Thursday), I woke up with pretty significant vertigo. I have placed a call to my primary care provider. I still have some lingering neck pain as well.

                                                Starting  Sunday April 11th I began having diarrhea   in the afternoon it would need to frequent the restroom roughly every hour or so. As the day progressed The frequency increased and I began having a fever in the afternoon around 4:00 p.m.   The fever continue to increase into the night and reached a point around 102?F and was paired with loss of energy/lethargy. Temperature reach just above 103?F over the night but bounced to a low as 98?but stayed around a 101-102.  The night was filled with chills and it was highly challenging to sleep.   That Monday 4/11 brought serious headache to the frontal lobe and behind my eyes in a way of not felt before along with severe stomach cramps and frequent needs to go to the restroom due to diarrhea. There was also total loss of appetite. I was bed ridden and slept all day. The combined pain brought me to tears regularly.  I went to urgent care that afternoon and also took a covid test. That night the fever broke.  Tuesday 4/12  The fever dropped to roughly 99?F In the headache mostly went away But the stomach cramps became more severe . The stomach cramps may have been equally as bad the previous day but I don&#39;t recall due to the fever and lethargy. I began tracking the times of each stomach pain and restroom visit and my results show a frequency of stomach pain/craming every 10-15 min.  These  Pains also brought me to tears and i had no appetite.   On Wednesday there were also stomach cramps in the morning through the evening but they were much less frequent going from roughly once an hour to once every few hours

                                                I started to have feelings of dizziness two days after the vaccine. I developed a rash under my right breast for two weeks which scarred. The rash started four weeks after the first dose. It came and went during the day. I felt very weak and a little weird. It kept repeating over the next three weeks. It got worse one day and I had a burning feeling and it felt like a wave that went through my body. I went to the ER because it did not go away all day. I felt very weak. It slowly subsided after three weeks and I got the second dose eight weeks after the first. I feel better now, and it is only happening every few days. I have seen a Neurologist twice.

                                                On 4/15/21, that evening my arm became very sore and tender. It also felt very heavy. I started getting cold chills and at the same time being hot. I didn?t take my temperature but did take Tylenol. On 4/16/21, all day my arm began to feel heavy, like there was a 50 lb weight hanging off of it. I was still having cold chills and hot flashes constantly throughout the day. I felt tired, groggy like a cloud over my eyes and head, achy all over too. In the evening, I was freezing cold, couldn?t get warm. I had a heating pad on my arm where it was sore and my heated blanket. I went bed sleeping horribly and waking up freezing cold and then waking up again with a puddle of sweat around me. This happened constantly throughout the night. On the morning of 4/17/21, I was constantly having hot and cold flashes, the soreness moved from on top of my arm where the injection site was to my under arm, around my armpit. It hurt so bad to just apply deodorant to my arm pit. My armpit are hurt all day yesterday and last night.  I took a 3 hour nap yesterday because I felt groggy and tired. Everything seemed cloudy. I woke up and felt better but my arm still hurt snd definitely not 100%. I went to bed last night (4/17/21) sweating profusely off and on snd being freezing cold inbetween. I had to change my shirt twice last night and my pants once because I was so sweaty. I woke up this morning on (4/18/21) with my armpit area still hurting.

These were among the expected side effects and lasted 48 hours. As you can see from my list of meds, I am taking medication for anxiety and depression.  The odd symptom I developed was extreme depression.  I felt as bad as I did before I ever started taking my meds.  This lasted for 7 days, and I woke up the 8th day feeling perfectly normal again.

                                                I got my vaccine on Friday, April 9th at 1:30 p.m.  By 5:30 p.m., I felt extreme muscle pain throughout my body, arm soreness at the vaccine site, fatigue, nausea, and neurological impacts that reminded me of when I suffered a concussion several years ago.  My soreness and nausea subsided after five days, but my headache, lack of focus, light and sound sensitivity, and overall irritability have remained.  I find this deeply concerning.

Headache and weird mouth sensations went away after a day, but exactly 7 days after first shot, woke up to find a huge itchy sore welt / rash at site of injection (about 5inches diameter) and a really sore swollen lymph node in left armpit, and slight mouth tingling / swelling sensation which persisted all day. Spoke to physician remotely and will check in with someone at urgent care if symptoms persist

                                                Effects of vaccine were all normal during the first few days and through the first week.  Had a bit of heart palpitations and fever after dose #2 - but it subsided by day 2 and i was back to normal mostly, no real issues.  A week later i experienced an episode of almost-syncope in which i start falling forward in my seat and almost hit the wall in front of me and couldn&#39;t hold my head up.  This has NEVER happened to me before.  I did have a panic attack AFTER this because of how scared i had become of that feeling, but i recognize that and know the difference.  After that i continued to experience bouts of dizziness and disequilibrium.  I have almost fallen reaching for things, opening my car door, walking, etc.  Several weeks later i experienced another flare up of the syncope feeling while at work where i almost fainted again and was able to regain composure and the disequilibrium sensation lasted for several days to which i sought medical help.  I have been visiting a chiropractor and a physical therapist for over a month now with minor improvement.  I still experience unexplained episodes that prevent me from being able to work properly or leave my home as it would be unsafe to drive or be out in case i need medical assistance.  I have never experienced ANYTHING like this until i was vaccinated and three months later it is still affecting my quality of life.

Developed cellulitis on my lower right leg on Thursday, was put on Keflex on Friday, then switched to Bactrum on Saturday. By Sunday, the abscess was large and my leg was swollen double the size, red and hot to the touch. I spiked a fever and felt very ill. I went to the ER Sunday night. Was told I was septic and was admitted. Transferred to another hospital on Tuesday. On Thursday, I had surgery to cut out the abscess (I&amp;D). The following Sunday, my right foot and ankle became so swollen and red, another surgery was considered. Miraculously the swelling and redness went down through the night. I was sent home with a PICC line and IV antibiotics - Vancomycin. My Vanco trough kept showing low levels and I?m now on a dose of 1500mg 2x day. I am fatigued, nauseous, constant headache, spiking fevers 1-2 times a day for the last 7 days, my WBC and RBC is very low, I?m considered anemic now, waking up with night sweats when I do finally fall asleep...feels like no end in sight.

I was told to consume fluids and eat without relief. I had to be driven home by a co-worker. My dizziness has persisted daily until present with no relief. I have also developed worsening anxiety within the last month.

The following day it got worse, the rash went up the back of my left leg. The rashes were painful. I went to urgent care, the doctor said I had shingles. She gave me a prescription, and then it cleared up after two weeks. I had to be off work for two weeks.

                                                Less than an hour after I received the shot, I started feeling nauseous, dizzy, lightheaded, confused/brain fog (I literally felt drunk), hot and cold flashes and generally unwell. The next day, I woke up with a sore throat and a head cold. The brain fog, bad nausea, internal temp issues and general unwell feeling lasted through Saturday. The SCARIEST part was that it felt like my heart hurt when I was breathing on the fourth day. The entire experience was the exact same as the first shot, except that it took a little longer to feel sick and that my heart hurt MUCH worse. It was terrifying, because it hurt to breathe and I literally feared for my life. I currently have a shoulder injury, so I took ibuprofen (800 mg) and the heart pain went away and stayed away. I also experienced visual hallucinations!! It was kind of scary because I live alone. I strongly believe my body responded to the vaccine with inflammation - hence the heart issues and hallucinations. I&#39;m really concerned about these things for future covid vaccines, so please contact me about this. Thanks!

I then felt flush and my hands became clammy. After maybe 2 minutes these symptoms resolved, I never had any trouble breathing so I continued home and did not seek any medical attention. The whole time frame was about 5 to 10 minutes.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

                                                Approximately around 8:00 pm the same day as my injection I started to be in a fair amount of pain at the injection site (right shoulder) I took a bath still was in pain took Tylenol hoping it would take the edge off around 11:30 the pain started to increase so I put a heating pad on my arm . As the night progressed my shoulder pain intensified and then  I started to feel pain all over my by body mainly in the joints. It was very severe joint pain all over and especially in my right shoulder that I took another bath.  I couldn?t lay down or sleep I could barely walk around my bedroom but even that hurt so bad in my hips and knees. This feeling was very similar as if I were to having an lupus episode in my joints. Around 4 am on January 14th I finally took ibuprofen and eventually I was able to fall asleep. I later woke up around 9 am and thankfully pain free other than a mild shoulder pain where I got my vaccine.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins sitting after infection. I left and was driving and started feeling disoriented, dizzy, shaking and throbbing headache. I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

                                                Since receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 12/30/2020 I have been experiencing what almost feels like brain fog. I have had some trouble staying on task at work, trouble finding words, remembering common last names, etc. Oftentimes I will have this temporarily as a migraine aura, but it typically goes away once the migraine comes and goes. This seems to have come to stay since receiving the vaccine. I did have fatigue for approximately 3 days after the vaccine administration - 2-3 hour naps daily. This has improved some. I also had a dull headache that seemed to be there daily for approximately 2.5 weeks post vaccine- nothing I could not tolerate but it just did not want to go away even with my usual treatment - Excedrin Headache and ice.  The best way I can describe it is a dull pain all over the top of my head and forehead. I did have one headache that occurred approximately 5 days after the vaccine, that I would consider a &#34;bad migraine&#34; (Migraine that rendered me incapable of completing my daily routine - having to stay in bed, dizziness, etc). My face on the side with the weakness as a result of my brain tumor has also been a bit more &#34;tired&#34; than usual - facial palsy more pronounced. There have been times in my brain tumor journey where this happens for sometimes a couple of weeks at a time usually due to stress or an impending &#34;bad migraine&#34; coming on or if I have been exposed to or end up developing an illness later - but I never developed an illness an no additional stress. Facial symptoms include smile not as symmetrical (basically more assymetrical than usual - not wanting to move at all so much on the affected side) and more eye watering on the affected side. I do still feel a little lightheaded at times, but otherwise no other neurological symptoms. No upper respiratory symptoms or any other &#34;COVID-like&#34; symptoms. No nausea, vomiting, numbness, or tingling. Symptoms do seem to be improving this week.

                                                About a week after my first does, the injection site swelled more and was hard and warm to the touch and itchy. The next day the affected area was much larger and still hard and warm to the touch. That evening there was a dull, throbbing pain that radiated to my elbow joint and behind my shoulder. The discomfort made it a little difficult to sleep, but pain level about 4/10. I iced it that night and took some Tylenol. Today the pain isn&#39;t as bad 3/10 but the area is still swollen. The appearance reminds me of my allergic reaction to mosquito bites. I had a headache and took some generic Migraine medication.

Thought I was starting to feel myself by Sunday midday but then suddenly on Sunday afternoon almost exactly 48 hours after the shot I started to feel extreme confusion and short term memory loss. My body started shaking, I felt very hot and then very cold (back and forth) and began experiencing shortness of breath. It was all very scary and I ended up in the ER.

I was unable to tolerate sleeping on my left side that night and I had a bad headache. My arm is still sore now but I can tolerate pressure on it better. Yesterday around 1:00 pm, the day after the shot, I began having some itching along the back of my neck near my hair line. By around 7:00 that night my neck continued to itch, I was not scratching however, but also my upper posterior neck into my hair line became red, hot, swollen, and painful. It spread equally across my posterior cervical spine from the base of my head to about C7 level (pics taken). My headache worsened and pain spread all the way down my spine to my lumbosacral region. I still have these symptoms now but to a lesser degree. I feel nauseated today as well and had to stay home from work and contact my doctor because of these symptoms.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

By 8am, the fatigue set in and my headache got progressively worse. By 11am, I the nausea set in. I almost vomited multiple times. By 12pm, my headache was now a migraine. I was very fatigued, nausea, and had bad chills. I felt like I was freezing! The chills subsided within a couple hours and never returned. I had nausea on and off for 2 days and a nonstop headache for about 4-5 days. My arms was extremely sore and I didn?t start to feel any real relief for about 3 days. The soreness lasted about 5 days. On day 5, I noticed a large, grapefruit size, rash appear around the injection site

Pt verbalized that her baseline HR was around 118 and that she had anxiety. Pt was diaphoretic upon exam and asked for a bottle of water. Pt&#39;s request was honored. Pt walked around the room to relieve her anxiety and said she felt better.   Her HR went down to 90 after walking around the room. Pt was offered IM diphenhydramine and refused. Pt also refused Ambulance to transfer her to ER. At 4:30 pm patient took another Benadryl PO without medical advice. Pt is a registered nurse and wanted to be transferred to ER, where she works, by another RN.  Pt left facility against medical advice and declined EMS at 4:40 pm. BP was 190/140 and HR 104 when she left facility to go to ER, transported in private vehicle by coworker who is an RN. Called ER to check on pt and physician said she had recovered and that she did not require any further medical attention, the event was believed to have been anxiety related.

I went back to work on the 7th - it was rough but over the weekend I started doing better and the following week was better for me.

After consulting with a nurse over the phone, it was recommended to see a doctor, but no appointments available, so I ended up going to the ER. No cellulitis, but it was recommended to monitor and ice my arm. On day 10, it is still swollen, but not as much, and not bright red. Lump in throat disappeared on day 9 in the afternoon.

I got out of the house and stoped at a gas station and when I got out of the car, I started to feel extremely dizzy while walking. Got to my work place and took my temperature and it was 99.1. After a while dizziness and pressure on chest kept on getting worst.   I had someone at work take my vitals and my temperature was 101.0,  BP was 144/95, BPM was 120,  SpO2 was 98%.

                                                Started having symptoms about 26-30 hours after vaccine, headache, nausea, vomiting and hives to my chest and arms.  The following day hives increased to chest, armpits and abdomen - went to be evaluated., was having allergic reaction.  Was given Solumedrol IM injection and Rx for prednisone dose pack and Claritin, also told to take Benadryl.   The following evening hives  increased to chest, abdomen, back, arms neck and hairline.  Called in to work the next day and instructed to continue Rx treatment of prednisone, Claritin and to take Benadryl every 6 hours and advised to not get second injection.  Took mediations as prescribed at home but hives continued to spread with some mild swelling to eyes, face and lips.  By Sunday hives had improved to my chest, and and legs but started moving to my feet. Monday hives had improved by  about 50 percent, did call in to work and continue take Rx?s with Benadryl every 6 hours.  On Tuesday, most all hives had disappeared, except to lower legs and feet. Hives completely gone on Thursday.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the 2nd shot of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine around 9:25 am on 2/5/2021, after about 10 minutes I became hot and lightheaded.  Immediately after that I started getting tingling and numbness bilaterally in my hands and fingers with a heavy sensation.  My heart also started racing.  The nurses put me in a wheelchair and escorted me upstairs to the ER.  In transit my face and throat/neck started getting tingling as well.  By the time we reached the ER waiting room (9:42 am) I got the shakes/chills and was very cold.  I continued having the shakes for several minutes.  By the time I was brought back into the triage area (9:50 am) my legs from the shin to feet bilaterally started going numb/tingly as well.  I started having a cyclical reaction.  I would shake/have the chills for about 5 minutes (without any tingling/numbness in extremities), after that I would get a full body flushing sensation with feeling of lightheadedness and nausea, followed by numbness/tingling in both hands and feet. Then the cycle would repeat itself for several hours.  I continued to have a heavy sensation of my hands and feet until about 10:15 am.  After that the heaviness sensation did not accompany the tingling/numbness that persisted.  I was hooked up to IV fluids and IV benadryl at 10:45 am.  By 12:30 I finally stopped getting the chills/shaking sensation but I had a consistent body flushing followed by tingling/numbness in my hands and feet (mostly hands/arms) about every 5 minutes.  Around 1 pm I all symptoms had stopped.  The doctor said all my tests and blood work looked good.   I was discharged from the hospital around 2:45 pm with instrustions to followup with primary doc or return to the ER if symptoms got worse.   At 5:30 pm that evening all my symptoms came back, started with chills and then full body flushing sensation followed by tingling/numbness in both arms/hands bilaterally. I also had a hot sensation up the entire side of my left arm (injection site arm) up to my ear.     I took 2 500 mg tablets of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl at 6:20.  By 6:40 I was starting to feel a little better with less shaking and less body flushing/tingling.  Symptoms seemed gone by 7 pm.  I went to bed at 9 pm and woke up around 10:30 pm to my body flushing and my hands going tingling/numb.  I tried to sleep, but could not.  Around 11:30 pm I took 1 500 mg tablet of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl.  I woke up the next morning (2/6/2021) with no numbness/tingling shaking or body flushing.  I felt extremely exhausted and sore.  That day my symptoms did not return.   I woke up on Sunday 2/7/2021 with no symptoms, but around 8:30 am I had a lightheaded episode and hot sensation with a feeling of nausea.  I then started to get tingling in my face, mouth and lips.  It persisted for 2.5 hours until I decided to take Benadryl (2 25 mg tablets).  about 30 minutes after taking medication the tingling stopped.  It did not return.

I feel like I have gone through a significant altitude change and there has been no way to &#34;pop&#34; my ears, through yawning, blowing out with nose plugged/mouth closed etc.  It&#39;s disorienting,  I had the typical fever/chills/general sick feeling for 2 days following vaccine. Not a huge deal in the scope of things but I figured I might as well report it.

Chills so bad my teeth were chattering uncontrollably, body aches all over, joint pain, my skin hurt to be touched everywhere, and a mild headache.  I did not sleep all night due to being unable to get comfortable.  Tylenol did not help.  I never call out sick to work, but I did the next day because I felt so awful, and hadn&#39;t slept a wink all night.  around noon on 02/02/2021 the symptoms were more tolerable, and by the end of 02/02/2021 they were mostly gone except mild lingering HA.  by 02/03/2021 I was able to return to work.  Still didn&#39;t feel quite myself, but the worst of the symptoms had subsided.

Took ibuprofen and pain subsided.  24 hours after injection, site became red and under arm began to swell. Lymph nodes continued to swell so much that I could not straighten my arm. The peak of enlargement was Sunday Feb 6, over 48 hours after shot. Armpit continued to be enlarged until Wednesday February 10. Arm site was red and started to stripe red around to armpit. Redness faded around Wednesday February 10.

As a nurse this is very scary and effecting my job. For patients they do not want a nurse coming at them with a needle when I look like I have Parkinson&#39;s, or I am withdrawing . I have never in my life had this issue. I am starting to become very concerned as it is getting worse and not better. I didn&#39;t even think of connecting it to the vaccine until my doc and I started going over all the possible new things and I wrote every thing down. They pulled my vaccine record and it triggered me. I have no noting new no foods no meds, no health issues that happened prior to this.  I cannot do my job with my hands like this. I am very much pro vaccines, this is very scary for me.

                                                3 hours post vaccine, extreme arm pain. Couldn?t lift my arm to get my sweater off. By 10pm I had extreme chills (shaking so hard my jaw locked from being so tense). Sharp shooting pain in my right leg started (still sore today). I then had extreme muscle aches, I could hardly walk to the bathroom. Finally at 12:15 am I took Tylenol.  Was able to sleep until 4 am and woke up with all the same symptoms... still extreme. Kidney pain started around 6am.  I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep until 10am. Woke up feeling just as bad- couldn?t eat. Went back to sleep. Woke up at noon with a headache on top of the rest and had to take ibuprofen (I didn?t want to exceed the allowed amount of acetaminophen in 24 hrs). Kidney pain continued, muscle aches as well. Chills went away around 4pm.  Woke up today feeling pretty good except the headache and kidney pain. Headache subsided around noon. Noticed a giant, raised, hot spot about an inch below vaccine sore tonight... assuming it?s ?Covid arm? . Super strange! Thankful for the vaccine, but dang- I?ve never had any kind of reaction from any vaccine, ever. I get my flu shot yearly.

                                                Received the vaccine in the morning (Wednesday). While a sore arm developed throughout the day about 12 hours later started getting severe chills. Was awake all night alternating between freezing chills and a hot fever. Extreme body aches and could not get comfortable. Felt extremely  bad the entire next day (Thursday) with the same symptoms and could not work but towards the evening symptoms subsided. That following day (Friday) I felt better but started getting a headache before bed and that night after going to bed woke up at 2am with a migraine. Worst headache of my life. Felt so bad thought I was going to throw up. Pain subsided with Tylenol. Went back to bed and woke up the next morning nauseous (Saturday). Felt very nauseous through the morning and in the afternoon evening it was less extreme but still present. Felt fine when I woke up the next day (Sunday).

Beyond a week, any extra use of that arm would trigger discomfort in the shoulder that I haven&#39;t had before. This seems to have resolved as of 6 weeks post-vaccination.

                                                About six hours after receiving the vaccine I felt fatigued. Two days after receiving the shot I began having symptoms in addition to extreme fatigue, including nausea, low fever, headache, and muscle aches. Now it is 11 full days after the vaccine and symptoms have not abated at all. The doctor ordered a Covid test and blood work. They also prescribed zofran and meclazine which have not helped. It has been difficult trying to advocate for myself without coming across as an anti-vaxxer or conspiracy theorist. I wish doctors would believe me when I say this is caused by the vaccine. I am not an anti-vaxxer and was enthusiastic about getting the vaccine, but now I am frightened by my body&#39;s reaction to it.

                                                I had very extreme side effects, which lasted for several days. They included pain in the injection site, chills, headache, dehydration, fatigue, nausua, it was debilitating for the first several days. After about 3 days, the more intense symptoms subsided, but I am now experiencing life altering neurological complications. I am very fatigued, both physically and mentally. I have trouble concentrating, remembers words, or I stumble on my words. I will forget what I am saying mid conversation. I find it very difficult to focus and am experiencing memory loss. I feel my cognitive abilities have become impared. A week after the vaccine, I caused a major car accident. I believe the side effects of the vaccine to my brain were a major contributing factor to the crash. The side effects have been impacting me at work and in my personal life in many ways. I am worried I have suffered some sort of brain damage as a result of the vaccine.

Throughout the evening could not sleep for more than a hour or two at a time  due to feeling so ill. Woke up at 4:30am with entire body shivering/shaking.  Roughly two hours later woke back up and had sweat through all my clothes. Flu like symptoms continued till around 10am and by 5pm (day after shot) i felt fine. Was on Tylenol entire time and still felt extremely ill.

                                                On 3/1/2021, received second dose at 3:15pm and at 3:45pm driving home from work I developed chest pains and went to urgent care. I got there by 5:30pm and they ran an EKG; results were normal. On 3/2/2021, I left work at 2:30pm feeling ill and when I got home by 3:30pm I had flu symptoms. Symptoms were body aches, headache, fever, chills, nausea. This lasted for 24 hours. When I woke up on 3/4/2021, I was just tired with chest pains. I went to work and on my way home at 3:45pm shortness of breath started with increased chest pains. I went to urgent care and they told me to head to the ER. I got to the ER by 6pm. They ran blood work, EKG and Chest X-ray; results all normal. I followed up with PCP. I was out of work from 3/5/2021 to 3/12/2021. PCP thought I might have COVID. Took PCP test on 3/9 and results were negative. I was able to return to work on 3/15/2020 but still had shortness of breath and chest pains as well as feeling exhausted all the time. Due to no change, PCP provided me with script for Echocardiogram, Exercise Stress Test, inhaler as needed and to see Pulmologist.  Waiting on insurance company to approve echocardiogram and pulmologist appointment is 3/29/2021. It has been challenging to complete daily living activities like washing dishes, showering, climbing 20 stairs to my apartment, laundry, walking to the postal mailbox, etc. I get easily tired and winded. Prior to 3/1, I was healthy and exercising 3x&#39;s a week, walking 4 miles and hiked with no issues for the past year ranging 3.5-7 miles with incline.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

                                                Chest pain began on 3/22 around 2 pm with what initially felt like allergies--chest congestion and heaviness in chest. As the day progressed, pain set in to the degree that sleeping was uncomfortable both because of challenges breathing and because finding a spot that wasn&#39;t painful was challenging. Upon waking on 3/23, the pain was significant and continued to worsen between waking at 7 am with trouble breathing and being in a high level of pain along with disorientation by 9 am. I went to the emergency room at this time, where they performed a series of lab tests, imaging tests, cardiac monitoring, EKG 12 lead, and administered medications. No cause was found and I was sent home with prescriptions for an NSAID and an inhaler. The chest pain persisted off and on for two weeks prior to the emergency room visit.

                                                After giving the patient the first dose of Covid vaccine, she started having anxiety attack and then shortness of breath. The patient is on clonazepam, she took a pill, but she insisted on getting the Epipen as well as she was getting worse and worse. I had to give her a dose of IM Epinephrine. Few minutes later, she started breathing normally again. I monitored her for two hours at the pharmacy and I was checking her vitals and heart rate. Everything was back to normal by 11 am. She went home safe afterwards.

These were some of the worst headaches I have ever experienced in  my life, and I&#39;m still getting mild headaches even today. I was quarantining before the vaccine, so I am positive it is a side effect. I am not prone to getting headaches. I also felt weak and dizzy at times during the headaches, which lasted all day and impacted my ability to sleep well.

Within about 6-7 hours following my second dose,, Istarted getting some itchy bumps around my ankles and thighs which turned into a dull blown rash all over my body by day two, covering legs, arms, torso and back. I also had intense lethargy and nausea on the day following,  sleeping off and on from 10pm until 3pm the following day.  I messaged my primary care provider who advised me to take a regimen of antihistamines and Tagamet.

Was told it was normal so I put it off. Around 3 am on the 4/10/2021 I woke to pain in my arm pit. My lymph nodes were swollen. I went to the ER and they placed me on an antibiotic and said to call my doctor for an appt if it became worse. On 4/11/2021 I woke again around 3 am because my whole left arm was itching and it really hurt. That&#39;s when I seen that it was all swollen from my shoulder into my hand. I called my doctor on 4/12/2021 because the 11th was a Sunday and they told me to call your 1-800 number and wouldn&#39;t schedule me an appointment. Said they didn&#39;t have anything to do with vaccine symptoms. My arm isn&#39;t getting better. Now the whole left side from my neck to my waste itches also.

                                                ?Covid arm? rash developed on day 2 post vaccination. Seemed to be resolving/subsiding on day 5. Day 6 felt swollen lymph nodes and later in the day Covid arm rash began to be bothersome again. Day 7 Covid arm hot to touch, increased pain, burning and surface area of Covid arm. By evening it hurt to move and interfered with sleep. Day 8 and 9 post vaccination surface area of Covid arm continued to grow and there was an ?eye? in Center with even more pronounced redness. A heat type rash developed on the ?eye?/Center of covid arm, I believe due to heat/inflammation.

The day after the vaccine was administered I had major brain fog, had a hard time concentrating, was very tired, had pain at the injection site and had pain in my lymph node near my armpit on the same arm. Soreness from injection site went away after about 3 days and so did the lymph node pain. 5 days after the shot I began to experience lymph node pain again, and it is now day 8 after the shot and I am still experiencing lymph node pain. 7 days after the shot I began experiencing tingling and pain in my opposite hand, right hand.

                                                My first symptom that occurred was a raised bump that painful to touch and sore formed near my collar bone. It has now hardened but is still in the place it appeared. I went to the urgent care for this.  About a week after I had tingling sensations in my elbow and along the arm that was injected causing numbness and pain the following day. My arm began to be inflamed to the point of not being able to bend it and utilize it for every day activities because of the amount of pain it was causing. The pain in my arm was not caused by overuse or force of any kind to have caused the injury it just appeared and increased in pain. I have not gone to see anyone for this symptom yet.

Rash was mildly itchy.  Went away within 5 days.  After dose 2 the rash and lump appeared within hours but not as severe. The redness area was larger but not as much swelling.  It is 6 days out and I still have mild redness and itchiness. I also became ill by 2000 that evening with fatigue, headache, body aches,  and chills. I was not able to work the next day due to symptoms. I slept all day. I was feeling better by day 3.

                                                After some expected soreness at the injection site I experienced after 5 days extreme chills and severe night sweats. Slightly elevated temperature, nothing over 99. After several days of this, I began experiencing moderate headaches, insomnia and fatigue on a daily basis. I continue to experience these symptoms and am very worried.

                                                I had my first vaccine (Moderna, V00120) on February 26. About a week after,  I started feeling paresthesia, numbness in the right side of my body, specifically in the right leg and arm, and I started having difficulties walking.  Since the symptoms persisted, I went to the Dr. on March 23. I told him that I thought my symptom were out of the blue and I linked them to the vaccine, so I was visiting him to see if I should put my second vaccine in those circumstances, few days after. Doctor said that there was no relation between nerve damage and the vaccine and he recommended me to put it.  He sent me test thinking that could be multiple esclerosis. I did my brain MRI on Thursday 25 and on Friday March 26 I put my second dose.  About a week after the second dose my symptoms  were dramatically aggravated. I first started experiencing  a sudden fatigue that didn&#39;t even allow me to hold the cellphone or a spoon and I had to lie down. I couldn&#39;t hold my 8 months daughter because I felt such a strong weakness. This fatigue didn&#39;t allow me to work. This happened few days in a raw for few hours. On April 8th I started to feel needles and strong neuropathic pain that I had never experience in my whole life. On April 9th in the evening I had a massive crisis. I started to feel a sudden  having a lot of cold, starting shivering and then chattering teeth and strong headache. (Same reaction I had 12 hours after putting the second dose of the vaccine).  I had to lie down in bed and my husband had to cover me with a jumper and eiderdown, but I still was cold. I couldn&#39;t stop shivering. Then I had difficulty swallowing. And the worst part started when I felt all over my body an intense pins and needles, burning, electricity, very profoundly and spread all over in a very intense way., I thought I was dying. I started panicking, I didn&#39;t have control over my body. I had difficulty breathing and such a weakness that didn&#39;t make me speak because I couldn&#39;t stop chattering my teeth. Was the worst life experience ever until that moment. The situation lasted about 90 minutes and then went away. The next day, Sunday April 10th, I spent the whole day in bed to rest, but at night time I experienced the same crisis as the night before. It started with the sudden cold as well.  After that I didn&#39;t have more crises but the pins and needles pain remains and it made it difficult to sleep because of the pain and discomfort and I wonder if I would have it my entire life. I returned to the doctor. To a different one specialized in multiple esclerosis. Brain MRI came out negative but it was done one day before the second dose, so we cannot be sure. I did 3 MRI of my whole spine and some muscular tests to check the response of the nerves. They also took 8 tubes of blood. We are waiting for the results but doctor think is Guillain Barrel syndrome. She thinks I am suffering peripheral neuropathy.

Its 4.23 and no symptoms of period or premenstrual syndrome.

By the third day, I felt fine. &gt; 8 days after vaccine, April 25th, 2021, I woke up with a sore arm again (injection arm); it felt the same as the day I had gotten the shot. &gt; 10 days after vaccine, April 28th, 2021, I woke up and my face felt very puffy/swollen and I had a headache. I thought it was allergies/migraine and took some excedrine migraine but the brain fog got much worse and by lunch I had a fever (101.1). I also had an upset stomach; I was hungry, but everything bothered my stomach immensely. &gt; Today, April 29th, 2021, the brain fog is still there, my arm is only a little sore. My fever is lower (99.3) and I was able to eat better but still with some intestinal discomfort.  I do not know if it is the vaccine, but because I felt find for several days and then my arm started hurting again, I thought it was maybe that my immune system took a while to react, so I thought I should report it. I found very little information online regarding delayed side effects, but I don&#39;t think anything else could be the cause, especially because of the sore arm.

                                                1/23 vaccination  By that night, it was very sore at injection site. I felt instant pain. It was sore, little bit of pain for hour or so. Closer to end of the night, my arm started to feel &#39;heavy&#39;. I remember going to sleep, waking up 2 hours later, and my arm was completely numb. As I woke up several times due to bladder, my arm was numb no matter what sleeping position. This lasted, the pain, for 4 days. The numbness was ongoing, non stop, didn&#39;t matter if at rest or movement. I decided to go to the Urgent Care near my home. Told me that it would subside. Checked vitals, full body check up. Didn&#39;t see anything wrong.  *I have very bad healthcare with the system.  *It has got better that it isn&#39;t constant but it is still numb most days. I try to do exercises to alleviate.  *Second pregnancy, EDD 06/26/2021

Then on 5/29 I started experiencing extreme left side flank pain, chest pain, and shoulder pain. On 6/1 I went to the emergency department for this pain and the dicovered a splenic infarct, with elevated d dimer. I remained hospitalized until today 6/3/2021. May have been caused by a blood clot, but they did not detect a clot in the scans. I am not sure if this was caused by the vaccine or not, but I know other brands have been linked to clot formation.

                                                The next day I got hurting so bad I couldn&#39;t stand up. My feet hurt so bad. Whole body ached. Ran a high fever in my sleep. Woke up, could not be bothered to do anything.  Got congestion in my head and chest, an itchy cough that was so bad I would pass out. And if I moved my head it felt like I would pass out also. In a week I lost my voice and gained horrible pains in my sides as if someone were ripping at my muscles. In another week my left breast turned blue. It felt like it was on fire . And when I moved and my breast it felt like someone was ramming a large knitting needle through it. I got my voice back after weeks of not having it but I still don&#39;t sound like myself,  it&#39;s hard and I have to strain to talk. As if I&#39;m talking underwater. My throat sticks to itself inside. I have very bad congestion. My side/stomach muscles hurt so bad I can&#39;t sit up long without feeling like I&#39;m dying. My breast is still blue and painful. I am heading into my 3rd month with no period, I am extremely hormonal and cranky and now I&#39;m suicidal. Never been that depressed in my life until now. I&#39;ve been to several Dr&#39;s nobody knows what is happening or how to fix it.

                                                At first only moderate arm pain and soreness, fatigue and nausea and headache lasting 24 hours. Then two weeks of being totally fine. Then suddenly woke up on the 14th day feeling like I had been shot in the arm by a gun. Limited mobility in arm and shoulder, extreme pain at injection side and in shoulder. Range of motion that hurts feels similar to rotator cuff injury (which I?ve had before and therefore can identify.) The two weeks in between there were no symptoms. I don?t know if these are related, but just in case- I also woke up with a headache and rib pain on my right side. My elbow on injection site side now feels painful but I do have pain there sometimes anyway. Soreness from shoulder down to wrist. I am a bartender and had to go home early from work due to the pain. I am concerned this will not go away. Could it be SIRVA? Could SIRVA suddenly show up two weeks *after* an injection? Thank you.

The sensation subsided about 12 hours later decreased and was tolerable during the following day towards the evening about 48 hours after she had the initial vaccine she developed the sensation again but it was milder and she was able to tolerate it better.  48 hours after the vaccine she developed a herpetic outbreak.

Unable to work for that entire time. Took tylenol for fever (did not go below 99 for the 4 days), intense chills when the fever spiked, normally never cold (but freezing the entire time), spasms/shivers. Did not feel fully recovered for a week and a half.  Called the number for the clinic (because it was early in the pandemic).

At last I took Advil because I had chills. My temperature at that time was 103 I felt tired and for the next 36 hours my temperature was between 99-100 and I was in the bed the whole time I took Advil and Tylenol. I had an appointment with my doctor just to make sure everything is okay I couldn&#39;t even go. I had diareeha for the longest time and then I had nausea and it went through for the longest time and I still have most of the symptoms my stomach hurts and I have headaches constantly. My blood tests are normal but i still can&#39;t past the symptoms and my doctor says it can be related to the vaccination. On April 12 I had my periods but it was not that I just understand what that was it was really bad the blood was all over my body I went to the doctor and still nothing. I went to the emergency room for that and they gave me some medications to stop the blood but it didn&#39;t help. my doctor did a dnd procedure because of the bleeding after the procedure I got the results and my tissue was of a pregnancy and I had a miscarriage and I didn&#39;t even know.

                                                I received the vaccine on 12/29 at about 2:15pm. I had a sore left arm after shot which awoke me at 2am. I also work up due to fever (temp 100.1 ), chills, and myalgia. I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night and got very little rest as unable to get comfortable. The next day I still had fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, joint pain, low back pain, fatigue and headache (felt similar to prior bad flu symptoms). I was sent home from work early as symptoms continued throughout the day with a little relief from a 500mg of acetaminophen. The following day 12/31 symptoms were gone except for the left sore arm which was improving and now completely done on 1/3.

                                                The morning after my vaccine I woke up with a very sore upper arm. By 4pm that evening I had fatigue, chills, and body aches. I went to bed and slept much longer than normal and woke up the next morning without chills or body aches. My arm still hurt quite a bit and I started to have elbow joint and hip pain. The following day I started to have sciatica from my hip to my foot on my injection side, the left side. My elbow joint was sore for about 3-4 days after the injection. I also had some numbness right at the injection site the night of the vaccine.

The following morning (24 hours post vaccine) I still was having numbness and tingling in my feet and my legs from knees down felt weak and jelly like. I still was able to walk fine, but it was uncomfortable, not able to work out etc.  12/31 (48 hours post) I worked for 10 hours this day and symptoms were the same, that evening I continued to have same symptoms and my knees and ankles ached intermittently. 1/1- Same symptoms as previous days. 1/2- Same symptoms and started having tingling down back of upper leg from butt to back of knee, still tingling in feet.  1/2- Went to ER waited 8 hours and left. 1/3- Went to Emory ER and they ruled out GBS and said they have not seen this particular reaction to the vaccine but due to presentation they believe it is a vaccine reaction&#34;.

                                                At minute 12 after injection (8:31am on 1/5/20), the pruritis started on my scalp and my back. I informed the volunteer at the end of the drive line. She offered to have EMS evaluate me, however I declined as I thought the reaction was mild. Over the next 10 minutes, after being released from the driveline, I was so itchy I wanted to literally rip all of my skin off. The back of my throat started to itch, but never felt tight or swollen. No SOB or chest tightness. I checked my temp at 8:45 and I was at 101.0 and HR was 110bpm. I am a PA working in dermatology and got to work and took 50mg of diphenhydramine PO but was not improving. One of the doctors I work with and I decided it was best for me to get checked out in urgent care. I had my MA drive me there and was seen immediately. I had a blotchy rash over my entire body, but not raised or hived. Temp was 100.6, HR 86 and BP 127/78, respirations 16/min O2 sat 98% and the itchiness was still severe but I could tell the diphenhydramine was kicking in. I was then given 40mg of famotidine PO and 10mg Dexamethasone IM in the right buttocks while in urgent care. After about 15 minutes, my symptoms were improving, but not resolved. I was released and went home to rest. Throughout the day yesterday (1/5/20) my heart rate would spike as high as 130bmp (my normal is 60-70bpm). Then it would come down within a few seconds to about 100bpm and steadily stay between 90-100bpm all day. Last night I was woken up at 3:30am (1/6/20) with a HR of 132bpm and O2 at 97%. I took a few deep breaths, and it slowly started to drop to 100bpm. Since 6:00am, I am steady at 70-80bpm with occasional spikes of 96-100bpm and I can feel when my heart is starting to race. I have my pulse ox on for the day and will continue to monitor my symptoms. I still have occasional pruritis, but it&#39;s tolerable. I was discharged from urgent care with PO Prednisone tapered dose, however, I am very shaky already and do not want to make it worse, so have not started it yet. Not sure if I should? And I would like to know if I should receive the second dose? If so, should I pre-medicate? Please let me know if you have any further questions about my event. Thanks.

I have also had severe chills, nausea, vomited twice, generalized weakness and shakiness.  It is currently 12:10pm on 1/8/21 and these symptoms continue.  Two of my other co-workers were at this same facility at the same time on 1/7 and have had very similar symptoms as well as severe headache which prevented them to work today.  We are all physical therapists, healthy young individuals, no co-comorbidities and were very surprised by these negative reactions and concerned.

Also noticed slight numbness of fingertips to right hand. Patient attributed this to her mask being on too tight and receiving the vaccine in right arm and was discharged from clinic without stating the above. As patient began to drive 50 minutes to home, she called her husband and stated she felt numb inside her right gum and cheek- he advised her to return to clinic.

After the 15 minutes, I went outside and tood off my mask to get some fresh air.  I went back to work and was still feeling dizzy.  I drank water, ate some food and sat for a bit.  At about 1pm, I was still feeling dizzy but also started feeling off, as if I were intoxicated or like how you feel when you just wake up from having anesthesia, sluggish.  I then went home and slept for about 5 hours and now I feel much better.  Will someone let me know if it is recommended I still get the second dose next month?

The back of my tongue became very dry.   I felt better after 10 minutes and never passed out.  They took my vital signs and everything was normal.  I have never been bothered by needles before at all so it was strange.  However I do have a long history of anxiety so it?s possible it was just that.

Side affects started the following morning after my vaccine with arm pain and stiffness. After about 24 hours I had fatigue and chills with body aches. I slept for about 14 hours that evening then woke up the next morning without chills, body aches, and less arm pain. I then developed joint pain in my elbow and hip, as well as sciatica down my whole leg, that lasted for 2 more days. I also had numbness at the injection site for about 1 day.

                                                Two hours after the injection I experienced increasing soreness in my left shoulder up through the left side of my neck and down through the forearm. I became slightly nauseous through that evening. The pain and tightness got to the point I could not perform regular functions with the left arm. It felt as if my muscles were tearing and prevented me from sleeping. I took ibuprofen in addition to alternating ice and heat to no avail. It hurt to lift my arm, grip to pull or push even a blanket. This continued for 48 hours before there was slight relief. Full range of motion returned four days after the injection. For brief periods throughout the days following, I also experienced occasional slight heart palpitations.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

Also very vivid dreams, headache and intermittent nausea, but no vomiting. R upper arm at injection site is very tender, but no redness or warmth.  Ibuprofen helped with the aches and chills.   Unsure of exact temp, as thermometer just reads ?low? (think the battery needs to be replaced).   Pt rested, increased fluids, and used anti-pyretics as needed to recover. Symptoms subsided after 24 hours.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

                                                Moderately severe pain which made basic movements difficult and woke me up frequently throughout the night beginning evening of vaccination on 1/14/2021 and steadily worsening through the next day and night. Large oblong welt about 2 inches across at injection site. Symptoms started within a few hours of getting the injection and became steadily very significant by the next day. It took about 7 days to recover from the most significant symptoms and was still recovering from mild bruise and occasional itching but no redness. Today (1/26/2021) my arm started itching again, and I see that I have a large flat circular (about 2 inches across) red spot right where I had the welt a week ago.

                                                The HCW noted w/i 1 hr of vaccination a constellation of symptoms including dizziness, disorientation, and fatigue; and by 4 hrs she developed swelling LUE with pain and some swelling extending to the L neck.  Over the next several days she reported marked swelling and tenderness over the triceps upper arm area; persistent swelling and pain in the neck that required cold packs for a couple days.  The reaction appeared to be more pronounced and extensive akin to the Humira local reaction she would ordinarily get; the last dose of that was 4 months prior.  By history, it sounds like extensive angioedema.  At no point was there any pruritus, erythema, or hive or rash on any other part of the body; no respiratory compromise, stridor or wheeze; and no fever.  Symptoms subsided over several days and she was well on day of her presenting for her second vaccination.  The vaccinator (who is a pediatrician), an on-call allergist; and this reporter (a medical oncologist) all consulted on best approach.  The allergist recommends skin testing; Humira may have a polysorbate component; and we collectively thought a contraindication to proceeding.  Given the deliberation the HCW actually elected also not to proceed.  We informed her that early data suggests one dose of the Moderna vaccine may confer an approximate 80% protection.  She will present to EHS for further evaluation.

No relevant medical history and concomitant medications were reported.  On 08-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number: 011L20A) in the left non-dominant arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 08-Jan-2020, the patient received vaccine, which was of lack of correct administration as it was injected in the fat and not in the muscle and injection which was appears to be lower than where normally given. On the same date, after administration of vaccine, the patient had experienced swollen arm (swelling), hives on the back, 2.5in red circle, didn&#39;t feel good, was tired and couldn&#39;t process things well. On 18-Jan-2021, 10 days after the administration of vaccine, the patient had developed very large-red allergic reaction at the injection site with perfect circle and was hot to the touch. Treatment for the event included paracetamol (acetaminophen) and loratadine.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not provided.   The outcome of events didn&#39;t feel good, hot to the touch, hives on the back, tired and very large, red (2.5/3in circle) allergic reaction at the injection site was unknown. The event lack of correct administration, injection appears to be lower than where normally given, was injected in the fat and not in the muscle was considered to be resolved on 08-Jan-2021. The event swollen arm/hardness was considered to be resolved on 09-Jan-2021. The event couldn&#39;t process things well was considered to be resolved on 15-Jan-2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of a 37-year-old female patient who experienced non-serious events of lack of correct administration/injection appears to be lower than where normally given/was injected in the fat and not in the muscle ( inappropriate route of vaccine administered), didn&#39;t feel good, couldn&#39;t process things well, hot to the touch, hives on the back, swollen arm/hardness, tired and very large, red (2.5/3in circle) allergic reaction at the injection site..  All events excluding (large-red allergic reaction at the injection site with perfect circle hot to the touch) developed on the same day after the administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (lot # 011L20A, expiration date-unknown). The event of large-red allergic reaction at the injection site with perfect circle which was hot to the touch developed 10 days after the vaccine administration. Based on the information provided which includes a temporal association, a causal association between the administration of the vaccine and the other reported events cannot be excluded. Tiredness, redness and hives are consistent with the safety profile of the vaccine. The event of inappropriate route of vaccine administered is considered not applicable.

I started to think maybe the nurse gave me a shot to close to my shoulder bone. But that was not the case. By the following hours I could bearly move my left arm. I could not raise my arm above my chest with out sharp pain on left shoulder.. I left work early to work from home and it was hard to drive with the pain. By 7:00pm 1/27/2021 The pain was unbearable I had to take 2 ibuprofen 800 mg and a muscle relaxer.  I could not sleep all night the next day I called out from work. I woke up with still sharp arm pain and muscle soreness all over my body, tight muscles on both back shoulders and my back.  felt body aches.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills and body aches. I then went to bed. I was awoke shaking from being in such significant chills my body hurt all over through the bones something I have an experienced in a long time. I continue to try to sleep and rest the best I could but I stood up in the morning I felt tunnel vision and thought I was going to pass out I laid on the ground at a safety and collected myself over the course of five minutes. When I stood up I am mediately thought I was going to vomit Splash cold water on my face I force myself to eat and drink and take Tylenol and symptoms lessened but remained over the entire course of the following day another 24 hours. I?m about to go to bed and I will not know how I feel in the morning but this is definitely something I did not expect. My entire doctors office received vaccination on the same day out of a group of 15 people two of us had severe reaction similar to what I described and the other female that felt sick like me had worse symptoms and high fevers with the stores as well she has remained out of work as a result of her symptoms. We are both nurse practitioners so it?s not easy to cancel our schedule. I ended up tapping out today despite my leftover post vaccine side effects.

No fever.  Took Excedrin migraine and ibuprofen (no tylenol alone on hand). Suddenly had hot followed by cold flash and severe nausea. Then neurological panic attack (i have had this ONCE before approx. 10 years ago during a severe Migraine that was treated at ER). The anxiety attack did not affect breathing, but instead nausea and all over flashes of heat followed by BOTH arms from elbow to pinky and ring finger (ONLY) going numb. Called my primary care office and spoke to on call dr. While on phone with Dr. numbness and nausea resolved - less than 10 mins total. Agreed that was anxiety attack and all symptoms were within expected for vaccination. Returned to be to try and sleep.  Wednesday - 8 am to 10pm - severe body aches, slight elevated temp. 99.8, headache, and around 5pm started experiencing vertigo. Took maximum daily ibuprofen for body aches  and had some relief. No work or any productive activities were able to be completed.   Thursday (1/28): woke up less fatigued and less body aches. significant vertigo is still present. Headache is still present. No fever. Left arm pit still sore - no swollen lymph nodes that I can feel.

                                                Thursday morning I awakened sluggish and feeling foggy in the brain. I had chills and a tmeperature of 100.3 with tylenol. At 11:42 am my temp was 102.3. I had severe headache, fatigue, bodyaches, chills. neck stiffness and joint pain, light sensitivity, nausea/loss of appetite. Moderate swelling at injection site (left deltoid) and swollen lymph nodes. Dizziness.  I slept most of the day, awakening to use the bathroom and at that time check my temp. Today 1/29/2021 some things have improved. my temp have improved 98.5, my headache is there but not a 10. I still have not eaten today. I am still taking tylenol. The light sensitivity is gone. The neck stiffness is there, but improving.

My body hurt to touch. Left work early January 29 because I did not feel good. Afternoon of January 29 around 4 PM I noticed some redness approximately an inch and a half below the injection site. Looked like a lump under my skin and it was painful to the touch. I took Benadryl the evening of January 29 and the morning of January 30.,Not sure if the Benadryl is helping. I am keeping an eye on the redness and the lump, if it does not go away I will contact my provider. I do not feel the chills or feverish anymore and I was able to sleep through the night on January 29

Fever of 101, chills, aches, some nausea, and feeling like my body was on fire at times. I did have to leave early from work due to Advil and Tylenol not improving symptoms. I am however feeling a little better now over 48 hours post vaccine but still have some aches in legs and joints.

                                                At approximately 11:45 pm the same day I received my second Moderna injection for Covid, I woke up from sleep shivering uncontrollably. I felt like I was chilled to the bone and was shivering so hard my muscles all felt contracted. I did not have a fever at this time. I got extra blankets and tuned heat up and over next 45 minutes managed to decrease shivering. Around this time, I rechecked my temperature and had a fever of 101.7. I used tylenol and later motrin as the fever kept rising. I was in and out of sleep with severe body aches, arm pain at site of injection, and increasing fever even after taking ibuprofen an hour later. My temp eventually reached a max of 104.5 at which point I uncovered myself and got ice packs for my head and neck. I managed to get my fever down to about 102.6 and it stayed in that range until about 445am the next morning. I was finally able to get a little rest. When I woke at 815am, my fever was 100.5. From there, the more notable issues were the intense body and joint pains and skin sensitivity along with increasing arm pain at site of injection. My fever managed to stay low grade around 99.5 throughout the day but then started increasing again in the evening. At about 500pm, it was at 100.8. I took more medication to reduce it and was unable to sleep until about 2am still from the pain. I then slept for approx 6 hours into Sunday morning,  today, and have had no fever. I am improving with pains, but have noticed red blotchy areas near my injection site which still hurts immensely but is tolerable.

                                                The first night after receiving the shot I had pain in my arm, this was not severe, but enough that it woke me up in the night on the night that I had the injection (Friday).  The pain went away after about 2 days.  Today, (eight days later) I woke up with a horrible itch at the injection site.  I started to scratch the area (still half asleep) and could feel it swelling with every scratch.  When I got up and looked in the mirror, it was hard as a rock, swollen, and about the size of a baseball.  The swelling in the center was white and looked almost like cottage cheese bumps under the skin.  I drew a circle around the swelling and went to see clients for the rest of the day.  Tonight, when I got home I drew another circle to see how much the swelling had increased.  It had increased quite significantly.  The area (that is rock hard) is about 8 inches from top to bottom and four inch width.  It is rock hard still, itchy, and hot to the touch.  The area is red, but the white cottage cheese bumps are down a bit.  I have also had a headache for two days prior to the swelling.  I thought this was unrelated, but I don&#39;t think that anymore.  I normally do not get headaches.  If the swelling has increased by tomorrow, I will seek medical attention.

The swelled area was the the whole with of my arm. The injection site was also warm to the touch with some itching associated. On 1/14-16/2021 I had extreme exhaustion including irritability. On 1/17/2021 woke up feeling good, the arm pain went away and had no other symptoms. On 1/18/2021 at night I noticed a bump feeling like a cyst at the cite of injection and the itch reappeared. 1/19/2021 around 11am I visited a health clinic to show them my arm after asking fellow colleagues if any of them had the same reaction. At the health clinic we looked at the injection site and there was a red rash covering part of my upper arm and the nurse looked closer and said she saw puss granulars.&#39;

Symptoms lasted 6 days post injection diminishing on day 5 to include only moderate fatigue. On day 7 post injection, the first phyical activity (skiing) immediatly resulted in heart pain (angina) and inability to take a deep breath. Assessment at the ER for a heart attack showed higher than normal range of troponin (.031)but a clear x-ray and EKG. Tests were repeated 4 hours after initial tests and troponin was within normal limits (.020). I was discharged with a 2/100 risk of heart attack in the next 30 days and a follow up stress test. I believe this was a direct result of the Covid-19 Maderna shot. I believe is reduced my hearts ability to work at a normal capacity and respond to physical activity.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Four hours after receiving my second vaccination, I became very fatigued and and took a three hour nap.  When I woke up around 4 pm, I was still very tired and my  head felt like it was in a fog.  Around 5 pm I started to have the chills with body aches, my skin became very sensitive to touch-like almost a raw sand paper feeling. These symptoms progressively got worse as the night went on and I would have intermittent zinger like head pain in different areas of my head. By 8 pm, I was in pretty rough shape with and I checked my temperature and I had an oral temperature of 101 degrees. I then took 625mg Tylenol and when to bed with multiple layers on because my chills were so intense.  I woke up around midnight with extreme chills again and took more Tylenol. My nights sleep was very restless and didn&#39;t sleep much even though I was so exhausted.  The next morning, I still had the chills with a low grade temp and  body aches and was very tired but it was not as bad as the day before.   My symptoms remained the same throughout the day and were getting better as the day went on. That night, I found a rash all over my body especially on my inner arms by the  creases of my elbow and behind my knees, I also had a speckled rash on my abdomen and upper legs. I took 25mg of Benadryl and woke up the next day (2/10/21) with a faint rash that is slowly disappearing as the day goes on. Also, the I am still feeling some fatigue and body aches in my back.

The headache remained of constant intensity until it resolved late in the evening on 2/5/21. It was located toward the front of my head and felt like dull sinus pressure. The arm pain started out light and intensified throughout the evening, with the height of the pain occurring late in the evening of 2/4. The pain radiated to my shoulder and lower neck, depending on it&#39;s positioning. It was difficult to sleep the night of 2/4. This pain eventually resolved completely on the morning of 2/8. During the afternoon of 2/5, I noticed a red, raised, slightly itchy &#34;rash&#34; on my  arm about 2 inches below the injection site. It was painful also. The morning of 2/6, I noticed another small patch below it and by the evening of 2/7 I also had a small patch on my hand. All areas have resolved as of 2/10/21.

Could not lift arm. Could still move my hand. Woke up multiple times in pain.  By morning arm pain had decreased but felt lethargic and weak. By noon I had taken a nap. My 15 year old daughter said she came to check on me and I woke up but my eyes were rolling on the back of my head. I slept for over 3 hours. Woke up sweating  achy. Still felt tired and lethargic. Arm was still sore but was able to move it around. Went to bed again around midnight- woke up today (Thursday) and felt much better.

High heart rate, elevated blood pressure. Asked to water. Itching progressed. Then came hives, and severe nausea. Was given Benadryl, symptoms progressed, was given Epi pen medication in IV. Took hives away and cleared up focusing issues. Went to the hospital for monitoring.  Was given a steroid through IV. Needed more Benadryl about 2 hours later due to extreme itching. Was sent home with epi pens and steroid. Currently taking Benadryl every 4-6 hours for continued itching.

                                                I am due September 12, 2021. At the time of the first dose, I was five weeks and three days pregnant.  I had no noticeable side effect other than a sore arm which went away within 24 hours. At the time of the second dose, I was nine weeks and three days pregnant.  I went to bed early that night (7:30 pm) but attributed it to pregnancy.  I awoke at 3:00 am on 2/11/2021 with a headache, fever, nausea and pain and swelling at the injection site.  My temperature was 100.4. I ate some crackers and went back to bed until 6:00 am.  At 6:00 am, I still had a slight fever (100.4) and the nausea was still there.  I had some toast.  At 7:20, I vomited.  I went back to bed around 9:00 am and slept until noon.  When I awoke at noon, my fever had broken (99.6) but I had an intense headache centering around my left eye and upper neck/base of my head on the left side.  This headache has been continuous up to the time of writing this (4 days post second dose 2/14/2021).  Additionally, I have had an increase in nausea and vomiting.  On Friday, 2/12, nausea was constant throughout the day, and I vomited 7 times (5 of them happening in the morning between 5:00 am - 10:30 am).  On Saturday 2/13, the nausea subsided slightly and I vomited only twice.  Now, Sunday, 2/14, there is still nausea (vomiting once) and the headache.  My injection site is no longer swollen, but is still slightly red and has some bruising.

By 9am there was a golf ball size lump, I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a lymph node. The lump is painful when I move around and makes me unable to sleep. The lump has increased a bit in size and pain has increased to just above my left breast. I have been taking Naproxen and Tylenol for discomfort. I feel flushed but so far no fever has registered.

                                                My lymph nodes in my neck and my throat swelled up. My throat became red and swollen. (The throat symptoms were within 2 hours and lymph nodes swelled up overnight) I became congested and started sneezing and coughing. I got a fever, chills, headache - within two hours, body aches, fatigue. The rest of the symptoms came within 24 hours. On Saturday morning, I called URGENT CARE - and they had me talk to  an Urgent Respiratory Care 50 mg of Benadryl and ibuprofen - 800 mg every 8hours   - Following Monday still very sick and I was seen on Monday at Urgent Respiratory Clinic and at that point of time they did a COVID test (January 11th). Told to take: Mucinex and nasal spray and antibiotic because my ears were so full at that time they were not draining. They helped reduce the symptoms. I was sick for the entire week. It took me out of work for a week.

She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.

                                                I am currently a nursing mother and 24 hours following the vaccine my infant son, born 1/22/2020 (approximately 13 months old) presented with a rash (trunk), nausea and vomiting, lethargy, decreased mobility, and irritability.  Approximately 48 hours following my vaccine he presented with a rash on the backs of his shoulders as well as on each of his cheeks as well as a fever of 101.5 degrees. The fever was treated easily with Tylenol and did not return after the 6 hour mark.  At 60 hours post vaccine, he was evaluated by his pediatrician in person and evaluated. He was specifically checked for ear infection (negative), strep (negative), and COVID-19 (results not in yet). After the care provider&#39;s assessment it was determined that a report should be made regarding the incident and that I should contact the CDC regarding his reaction.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine I started to have an increased heart rate and blood pressure.  I was watched for close to an hour, and let go.  I experienced muscle and joint pain, which was to be expected.  Approximately 2 days afterwards, I started to experience dizziness, low blood pressure, and pressure in the middle of the back of my head.  The pressure became worse and worse, while continuing to experience the above side effects.  Since that time, I have been to the emergency room for pain all over, pressure in the back of the head, memory issues, blood in the stool, and extremely cold hands and feet without explanation.

Zaleplon insufficient duration so switched to Zolpidem PRN. She has not required more than a few doses of zolpidem but now we have uptitrated her to gabapentin 600mg nightly. She feels significant improvement in her sleep and work product, but continues to have intermittent cognitive errors and some decrease in work performance, that remain concerning to her.

I received my 1st dose of Moderna COVID vaccine around 5/45pm on Thursday 2/25 by a woman at the High School.  The shot felt fine at the time but I did notice she went a bit higher up on my shoulder.  However, the morning after, I was experiencing extreme shoulder pain with limited range of motion as the day progressed on 2/26. By night time of 2/26, I couldn?t remove my bra and had to ask my husband for assistance. I?m scared and terrified that I won?t be able to hold my newborn baby when he?s born. This is all I can think about. I don?t even care that I?m in severe pain. All I can think about is how this is going to ruin my experience caring for my child without full range in one of my arms. It?s 2:37am where I am and I can?t sleep because of the shoulder pain.

                                                This is a 37 year old female.  Within 10 minutes of her 1st dose Moderna, the patient developed a mild rash (location not specified).  She took a dose of diphenhydramine with some relief.  She went home.  2.5 hours later, she developed a facial twitching and reported to the ED.  She reported involuntary facial muscle twitching, like spasms, that were painful.  On ED presentation, BP=121/86, HR=93, RR=16, SpO2=98%.  ED noted no swelling, itching, SOB, chest pain, N/V/D, or rash.  The ED notes describe the symptoms as &#34;Numerous and varying facial movements including contraction of the lower cheek muscles on the left and then the right along with movement of the tongue from side to side at which point she bites or gets the tongue in the way while trying to speak.  Speech is therefore slurred however at times clear. Oropharynx is clear with mildly dry mucous membranes.  No oral or pharyngeal swelling, difficulty swallowing, or stridor.  Neck is supple and nontender without adenopathy. Differential diagnosis includes: allergic reaction, dystonic drug reaction (unusual to be varying from the left to the right), dyskinesia, anxiety, somatization or conversion disorder, among others.  Her symptoms are not consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy, stroke, or clearly tardive dyskinesia. Subsequently given diazepam, fentanyl, and 500mL IV fluids.&#34;  She was discharged home.  Patient returned to the ED on 12/31 (within 24hrs) with ongoing symptoms.  Patient was monitored and discharged home again.   One month later, on 1/28/21, chart notes indicate that she has continued to have intermittent symptoms continue.  A trial of steroids reportedly made symptoms worse.  She reports that she also feels fatigued and with &#39;brain fog.&#39;  She currently has a neurology consult pending.

This continued for 2 full days with fever breaking then coming right back, repeatedly, even with taking Tylenol every 6 hours. The headache was unbearable day 1 but mild day 2.  Fever got up to 102.4 at one point but was between 100-101 most of the time during those two days. I was not able to function or get off the couch at all day 1 and at about 50% day 2. By day 3 post vaccination I felt completely back to normal besides a very sore and swollen arm still. This continued for about 6 days post shot.

                                                Here is my story. Part 1: I had my second Moderna vaccine on 2/16. 36 hours later I was laying In bed when I all of a sudden felt very strange- sort of faint - like I was going to pass out. Then I started feeling like my Body was going numb. We called 911. I was taken to the ER. What followed was about 15-20 ?neurological? episodes (every ten minutes or so) where my entire body from head to toe became paralyzed- I couldn?t move any of my limbs. I also had no sight. I was not blacked out Bc I could hear everything that was happening. It was also accompanied by extreme chest pain, numbness, contratcing of muscles in chest cavity that felt almost like a heart attack. Each individual episode lasted about 3-5 minutes and then slowly the paralysis would undo and I?d regain feeling. And then the full episodes would start over a few minutes later. This went on for a few hours repeatedly while in the ER.  I was admitted for testing  and monitoring for two days (EEG, EKG, MRI, Catscan) all clear. Once discharged I had lingering neurological symptoms but not the full paralysis episodes. Lingering symptoms included severe chest pain, numbness/weaknesses predominant on the left side as well as other random areas. I was very weak and tired. I started to improve very slowly - by day 10 post hospitalization I was starting to feel like things were turning the corner and maybe I was on my way to recovery. Part 2: I started to finally feel more improved from the lingering neurological issues and then all of a sudden around 5:30PM I was in the kitchen making dinner for my kids on 3/2 and the episodes started again. Called 911. Again, every ten minutes or so they came on (maybe 15-18 episodes) of complete paralysis- this time accompanied by seizure like rapid eye movement from side to side and fluttering of the eyes. I was readmitted to the hospital where the episodes repeated to happen again, maybe 15-20 times. I was admitted. They did a 24 hour video EEG which ?caught? the episodes on video and sound but did not appear negatively on the EEG in terms of abnormal brain activity. I?ve been released as they say there is nothing to do. I have lingering muscle weakness in my eyes- I can?t focus my eyeballs or ?track? on an eye exam and continued muscular chest pain. I also have a lot of PTSD from the trauma of the events.

                                                The night after I received the vaccination, I had trouble sleeping. I would never get fully to sleep, just doze in and out of consciousness. The next night (Sunday), I was unable to sleep at all. This has never happened to me before, even when I would have a manic episode (and I did not have any symptoms of mania, other than sleeplessness). The next day I alternated between being so tired that I couldn&#39;t concentrate and feeling awake. That night, I went to sleep at around 11:30 and awoke the next morning as usual. The following night (Tuesday), I had a bit of trouble sleeping, but not anything unusual. I took antihistamine and melatonin and fell asleep as per usual. At this point, I still do not know if I will continue to have trouble sleeping in the future, but if I do, I will resubmit this form.

                                                Approximately six hours after receiving my second dose of the vaccine on 2/11/2021, I had chills, nausea, joint pain, a feeling of heaviness like I couldn&#39;t move or walk, a migraine. Most of those symptoms lasted for 36 hours, however the headache and the chills remained. The following Tuesday (2/16) I starting having severe difficulty breathing and was gasping often. I tried my inhaler and that did nothing. This persisted. On 3pm Thurs (2/18) I started feeling dizzy and by 4:30pm I could not stand. Went to the doctor on Friday (2/19) with a fever of about 100, inability to walk without assistance. I&#39;ve also been having memory problems. I went to a balance center EMT on 3/10 for a repositioning procedure and I still Additional information for Item 18: feel dizzy, so there were no results to date.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

I got under the covers. It hit 99.9 (fever). I slept hard for most of weekend. Arm was really itchy - I had swelling again. I didn&#39;t see a doctor. A couple of days after I got my shot - stomach issues, diarrhea, flu, body aches - those lasted a couple of days by Tuesday. Except the stomach pain lasted about a week. High blood pressure and migraines was having these too. Have struggled with heart palpitations and insomnia at night because blood oxygen level at night is in the low 90&#39;s. Doctor has said to wait a little longer to see if goes away. Metropole - or Toprol was added either right before the second dose or right after second dose of vaccine. Migraines and sleep issues are still an issue - as well as the low blood oxygen level. The symptoms that are typical vaccine related side affects have resolved.

                                                Minutes after receiving the shot on Monday, 3/22/2021 at approximately 11:15am, I (F/37yo) felt a very small, but acute tightness/pressure in my upper right chest area. I didn&#39;t initially report it as it was not one of the listed reactions I had read about in the information given to me -- I assumed I was very anxious, maybe breathing nervously, and that it would go away. The next day I felt very fatigued, light-headed, had extreme muscle and joint pain throughout my body, slight nausea, and the injection site (my left arm) was very sore. I took Tylenol and slept.  I felt weak and &#34;off&#34; the whole day. The acute chest pain I felt after the shot had now become less &#34;acute&#34; and turned into a wider and duller general pressure. The next day, Tuesday, I also began feeling intermittent flashes of hot or cold-like patches in my head, which I also consider a part of a general inflammation my body might be having. It is now Thursday, 3/25/2021 and the chest pressure has increased even more, having now spread from the upper right side to include the center of my chest. My headache is still lingering, I still don&#39;t feel like my normal self and feel &#34;off&#34; somehow, and the chest pressure is worrying me because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on internally. I reported the chest pain to my doctor and was told that my exact reactions don&#39;t make any sense in relation to the known adverse reactions to the Moderna COVID vaccine. I was advised to report this here and to also go to an urgent care clinic or emergency room if my symptoms worsen.

                                                Itching started 2 hours after injection. Chest, then back. Got worse in the middle of the night- groin and ankles very itchy.  1 week later (today) itchiness periodically continues - ankles, wrists, chest, scalp, groin. 24 hours after injection I had the most severe headache I?ve ever experienced, that strangely was worse when lying down. 2 Advil and propping myself in a sitting position to sleep helped it go away, and it hasn?t returned. It was so sudden (woke me up) and so severe that I had considered going to the ER since I already had experienced one adverse reaction to the vaccination. The headache was bilateral and felt like swelling at the top of my cervical spine and bottom of my occipital bone. Standing and moving my head temporarily decreased the pain and nausea, but I think Advil really helped the most.

Pulled over to get my breathing under control and turned my AC on high to cool body down. Symptoms still existed but got back on the road towards my work office. Throat started to feel like it had a gum all in it and felt like it was constricting. Chest started to hurt like there was a weight on it. 10:30am went to closet urgent care to where i was. Was there for 2 hours. They gave me IV fluids, steroid push through IV Oort, Benadryl through IV port and monitored the symptoms. They did not subside so they gave me a shot of epinephrine. When symptoms still did not go away they called EMS and I was transferred. They monitored my vitals and gave me lidocaine to drink and another liquid to relax my throat abs airway. Symptoms stated to subside but did not fully go away. Was discharged at 3:30 pm and a prescription for prednisone was called into my pharmacy. As of 9:40 on the same day vaccine was administered (4/6/21) throat is sore and chest is still tight, headache and sweats. Was advised to follow up with primary doctor.

The vertigo symptoms subsided after 2-3 days and treatment in the emergency room however the tinnitus has become permanent in my left ear for over 3 weeks now. It is loud enough to disrupt my sleeping and my ability to hear from my left ear. I still have slight dizziness spells intermittently. Additionally, I have begun to experience extreme arthritis and muscular pain throughout my body, which begun 2 weeks after the 2nd dose. I have begun to lose function intermittently of my feet, fingers, and arms at different times throughout the day.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID) and TOPIRAMATE (TOPAMAX) for an unknown indication.   On 04-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, the patient experienced TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird). On 03-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma) and ASTHENIA (Could not get up). On 04-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg) and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine). On 01-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low). At the time of the report, DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg), TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia), DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma), CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg), ASTHENIA (Could not get up), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine), HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Haemoglobin: low gram per litre (Low) LOW. In March 2021, Red blood cell count: low cells per microlitre (Low) LOW.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment informations reported were Levalbuterol tartrate  and Rivaroxaba 20 mg   This case was linked to MOD-2021-059897 (Patient Link).

                                                Shot given at 3:47- approximately 3-5 minutes later started to experience blurred vision, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.   Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

                                                I am confined to my bed for a large part of the day. It is hard to do my daily activities. I am 27 weeks pregnant currently. After the first dose of the vaccine, I had a burn like rash on my upper lip. It burned and I had red patches on my upper lips. I had been on antibiotics, but I do not have lip fillers or anything. The day after the vaccine I had really bad, body aches and severe joint pain. It was my entire body every muscle and every joint. It was a little better the next day but on the second day my back was really sore. I am currently on muscle relaxers and narcotics, but the pain is really bad.  Currently back pain is on the left side between my tailbone and my hip. I have had a problem with a torn muscle in that area during a previous pregnancy. I did not have any issue with my back during this pregnancy before the vaccine. I have been doing some physical therapy. I am very limited in my activities and on bed rest for most of the evening after the pain gets too bad. There has been no problem with the baby so far.

SHE STATED NO, THAT SHE  JUST FELT A LITTLE WEAK. SHE ASKED ME TO RETRIEVE HER A COKE, I DID. SHE STATED SHE FELT BETTER AFTERWARDS. AFTER HER 15 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD WAS UP, SHE STATED SHE WANTED TO WAIT LONGER TO MAKE SURE SHE FELT BETTER AND THAT SHE HAD CALLED HER HUSBAND TO COME PICK HER UP BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WANT TO DRIVE. SHE THEN STATED HE WAS NOT COMING TO PICK HER UP AND THAT SHE WANTED TO CONTINUE TO SIT JUST TO MAKE SURE SHE FELT OK AND THAT THE STRANGE &#34;FEELING&#34; SHE HAD WAS COMING AND GOING.  SHE DECLINED ANYTHING I ASKED HER (TO LAY DOWN, TO GET HER A COLD WASHCLOTH). SHE STATED SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST NERVOUS ABOUT THE VACCINE, AS SHE WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS TO GET IT. AFTER A FEW MORE MINUTES SHE ASKED FOR US TO CALL AND AMBULANCE. SHE STATED SHE JUST WANTED TO BE CHECKED OUT TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS OK AND THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO DRIVE UNTIL SHE WAS. SHE STILL SAID HER BREATHING WAS FINE, AND THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL LIKE SHE WAS GOING TO PASS OUT.  SHE DID THEN TELL ME THAT HER HEART FELT LIKE IT WAS BEATING FAST BUT THAT WAS EARLIER ON AND THAT IT HAD STOPPED. EMTS ARRIVED. I CALLED HER THE SAME DAY TO FOLLOW UP  AND SHE WAS HOME AND FELT FINE. SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN ATIVAN IN THE HOSPITAL TO CALM HER DOWN.  SHE STATED THE HOSPITAL SAID THEY DID NOT KNOW IF IT WAS HER NERVES OR A REACTION TO THE VACCINE.

                                                Within 1 minute of receiving the vaccine, I felt as if my body was on fire, along with dizziness and feeling like I was going to faint.  When I alerted the pharmacist, she brushed it off saying that I was just nervous. I waited the 10 minutes at the pharmacy and then left, still feeling dizzy and spacey. Then a feeling as if the vaccine was coursing through me, it was like an electrical shock feeling stinging me everywhere.  I called my mother being nervous, she ordered I go to Urgent Care. I told them what was going on, they wanted to call an ambulance. I said absolutely not since all of my vitals were normal. My breathing was normal. From 3-21 and on, I sporadically feel the electrical shock feeling at all different parts of my body. My skin also feels sunburned, but there is no rash anywhere. A day or two after, the left side of my face was swollen. That is currently no more. I went to my regular Dr., he strongly suggested for me not to take the second dose. He took blood to check for sediment rate I believe, that all came back normal. He referred me to an allergist, waiting to get that appointment.  To date, dizziness went away, sunburn feeling went away, electric shock feeling still comes and goes.  I never had any temperature, no tiredness, no rash.

                                                Approximately 18 hours after the shot, I had a near syncope event. My arms and legs became weak and heavy. My limbs still have not recovered their strength. I cannot be left alone because of near syncope events and I cannot stand long enough to make food or shower by myself.  I have had 6 more near syncope events, two of which landed me in the ER. About a week after the shot, I developed moderate vertigo with nausea and a worsening of tinnitus in my right ear. The tinnitus has returned to normal as of today, so far. The vertigo is decreasing slowly.  I am still nauseous, especially first thing in the morning. I still have limb weakness and shaking. The intensity waxes and wains. I check my blood pressure multiple times a day, especially when feeling light headed or faint.  Most of the time it is in 100-115/ 60- 90.  The worst near syncope episodes were 102/56 and 108/60, respectively. Blood sugars within normal range. Oxygen between 97-99% and pulse between 80-95 bpm.   Currently, I am on a 30-day event monitor for my heart. My doctor has prescribed a low blood pressure medication, 2.5 mg of midodrone, but haven?t taken it out of fear.

                                                About four hours after I received my shot, I started to feel severe arm pain in the arm/shoulder that received the vaccine. The arm/shoulder continued to be extremely sore and immobile the following two days, with a combination of constant aching, throbbing, and stabbing pain. On Friday, I began to regain some movement in my arm and it began to hurt only when moving it rather than a constant pain during the day. I am now 10 days out from my vaccine, and it continues to give me significant pain at night that impedes my ability to sleep. I also have not regained the ability to complete weight-bearing activities such as push-ups.   While being vaccinated, I thought my injection seemed too high on my arm. The injection site was just one finger width below my shoulder bone. I sought medical care through my local urgent care 48 hours after my vaccine, and the doctor who saw me agreed that the injection placement seemed odd.   I have not yet sought additional medical care, but I fear I will need to soon if the pain continues at the current level at night and continues to hinder my ability to exercise. After doing some reading, I&#39;m afraid the vaccine may have been placed in the bursa rather than the deltoid muscle, causing a vaccine injury that is causing my current pain despite being 10 days beyond my vaccination.

                                                Since the vaccine, I have had considerable pain and swelling in my joints on right side of body (right knee, right foot, right hand/fingers). This is off and on. Starting this week around 4/14/21, the fingers on right hand have been considerably more swollen and painful. The pain/swelling is unrelieved by elevation, NSAIDs, anything. Performing ADLs with right hand is more difficult.   The pain in joints started the night after the vaccine 2/9/21 and has come and gone but it significant worse now.

                                                Woke up in the middle of the night 6 hrs after the vaccine with sever stabbing pain through entire shoulder joint into back. Not a muscle ache. 6 hrs later the pain was shooting across my back and down my arm into my hand and was intolerable. Within 24hrs of getting the vaccine I was unable to raise my arm at all. There was tingling numbness and shooting pain in shoulder, back, ribcage, down arm and into hand. By the 2nd day. My hand had started to swell and my shoulder swelled.  I iced and took tylenol but nothing helped. I couldnt dress myself. I didn&#39;t sleep from severe pain for the subsequent 3 nights.  My shot was tuesday night and my symptoms didn&#39;t subside to a tolerable level until the following Saturday. I am still having difficulty raising the arm and its been a week. I noticed that the person who gave me the injection did it so high in my shoulder that it was about 2 mm below the bone at the top of my shoulder. It seemed a very strange location for a shot.

                                                Several hours after my shot I began having severe heart palpitations and became shaky and dizzy. It felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. Many hours later my body began to feel increasingly odd. Sore. Within an hour all of my joints were inflamed and painful and I felt like every inch of my body was on fire from the inside out. I was delirius and couldn&#39;t string words or thoughts. I fell asleep on the floor in the fetal position in front of the toilet because I was certain to vomit but nothing ever came. I couldnt really see well and my brain felt swollen. Each of my joints took turns feeling like they were trying to explode out of my body. My psoriasis lesions on my joints would suddenly feel as if I was suddenly being stabbed from the inside out causing me to scream out in pain. I&#39;ve never felt so awful in my life. The headache wasn&#39;t severe because I sometimes have debilitating migraines. And the nausea wasn&#39;t severe because I&#39;ve had norovirus twice. That said, I&#39;ve given birth 3 times without pain meds and nearly entirely silent.. and THIS VACCINE REACTION was the worst thing I&#39;ve ever experienced. Glad I might not die from COVID now but sweet jesus I thought I might last night.

                                                The vaccine was given on 4-23-2021 at about 11:30 AM at the Pharmacy. I came home and worked on my computer for about an hour. By 2 PM that day, I had the typical reactions expected of constant chills, fatigue, and soreness at the injection site of my left arm. I took a nap and covered up under many blankets. I drank lots of fluids to help. By 10 PM, I already felt lots of severe body aches and stiffness. Before midnight I started having chest pain. The chest pain continued all night making it difficult to sleep. I woke up completely around 7 AM on 4-24-2021 still feeling all body aches with difficulty moving, continued intensifying chest pain with palpitations, and now also felt nausea. I only ate a piece of fruit. I went with my family to our kid?s soccer games, but I was completely fatigued. I came home and took a nap, but felt chilled, the chest pain continuing, and soreness. When I woke up things were feeling even worse with the chest pain. They started to feel like a real heaviness on my chest, almost as if someone was sitting on me. I also felt a huge tightness the length of my sternum. I had palpitations. I started also having shortness of breath and could not walk up and down my stairs (which is never otherwise a problem).  I was very hot and sweating through my clothese. My sister took me to the ER because the pain became intolerable. I went to the Clinic, Hospital ER for the chest pain (lot so heaviness and tightness in the sternum) and shortness of breath. My blood pressure was really high in the 140s/90s. I was in a lot of pain. I had a temperature. They did an EKG immediately that showed PVCs and a slight pause. Then, I had an XRay of the chest and lots of bloodwork. They did give me fluids and pain medication. The bloodwork had elevated d-dimer and low potassium levels, so they did a CAT scan with contrast to rule out a clot. It showed no clot, but had very enlarged lymph nodes on the left. They believed all of this response and chest pain was due to my 2nd dose of Moderna&#39;s COVID 19 vaccine. I am still not completely recovered. I am feeling ill and chest pain with tightness, but at home now. I go back to my cardiologist for a repeat EKG and repeat bloodwork this week.

Did not respond to Cortisone cream, but did respond to ice packs and Benadryl. Resolved within 24 hours.

We immediately called 911 and we were able to get the patient to the floor safely and elevate her legs. Her convulsions stopped shortly after they began, and I stayed at the patient&#39;s side.  She had normal breathing and pulse and began to wake up shortly after her legs were elevated.  I applied a cold pack to the patient&#39;s forehead with her consent.  She was very disoriented upon waking up.  EMS arrived at 11:08 a.m. and took her blood pressure and blood glucose reading.  She was conscious when they arrived but still disoriented.  Her blood pressure was low and the patient said she felt like she was going to pass out again after they stuck her finger to check glucose.  EMS transported the patient to Hospital because of her persistent low blood pressure.  I attempted to call the patient this evening to check on her but was unable to reach her.

Felt fatigued for the following three days post vaccine.

                                                Approximately 8 minutes after the patient was given the shot she reported feeling a little funny. She said she felt like the space between her nose and throat was congested. I asked her if it felt like it was her sinus area and she said yes. She was able to breathe and talk at the time, but her speech did not seem normal. I asked if she would like some liquid Benadryl and she said yes. I gave her 10 ml of liquid diphenhydramine 12.5mg/5ml. After about 1-2 minutes she said she felt better. I asked if she would like to repeat the dose of Benadryl and she said no she was feeling better. She was able to breathe and talk at this time. After her 15 minute time limit for observation expired I asked her to remain seated in observation. I again offered another dose of Benadryl and she said she did not feel like she needed it that she was feeling much better. I went to get her a cup of water and asked her to take small sips. She remained in observation for approximately 15 additional minutes. I asked the patient before she left if she wanted another dose of Benadryl but she said she felt good and had Zyrtec if she needed anything, but didn&#39;t think she needed any more medicine. The patient was able to breathe, carry on a full conversation in her normal voice with no problem, and swallow with no problems at this point. I offered for the patient to remain in observation longer if she felt comfortable, but said she felt good and will call the pharmacy with any questions or concerns. I tried to call the patient about 8:30pm to follow up, but did not get an answer and was not able to leave a voicemail.

                                                The shot was administered very high on my right arm, slightly dorsal. About 6 hours after the shot, my arm started to get very sore and became hard to use.  By 11 hours afterward, the pain and weakness of my arm/shoulder became extremely uncomfortable and I began alternating taking Tylenol (1000mg) and Ibuprophen (600mg) every three hours (6 hours between the same drug), around the clock.  The following 2-4 days, my shoulder felt dislocated--it was very painful to move in some ways, felt weak, and I had some tingling/numbness in some of my fingers (most noticeably my middle finger).  Sleeping was difficult due to the pain. I purchased a sling and continued to rest, ice, and manage the pain. Each day there was some improvement.  On day 3 I saw a doctor about it.  She was not overly concerned about long-term affects, but suggested adding heat to my therapy.   I am now on day 7 after the shot, and although I do not have full range/use of my arm and some pain and weakness persists, it is much better.  I hope in another couple of days, it will be good as new.  Apart from the bad reaction in my arm, on day 2, I experienced some aches, fatigue, and slight chills.

                                                Pregnant at time of vaccination, due date June 10, 2021. Day and a half after vaccine, left arm pain began and still has not subsided after 2 weeks. Pain is very centralized to the injection site and is a sharp ache, that has not gotten better or worse. It interferes with daily activities and I have not been able to work a full day in 2 weeks. A hot compress offers mild relief, as does Tylenol.

                                                I had hives since getting the first dose that hadn&#39;t gone away.  After getting my second dose, I still had the hives and I woke up in the middle of the night and they had spread; I had them on my upper legs, my butt, my stomach, my back, my arms....  I went back to bed and managed to fall asleep.  I was then woken up by my husband who informed me that my eyes were a little swollen and my lips were quite swollen.  I had been told when I got my second dose to go to the ER if I had any swelling on my face, so my husband drove me to the ER.  They admitted me and gave me Prednisone, Pepcid and Benadryl intravenously; I was at the ER for about five hours before I was sent home with a nine day prescription for Prednisone and a prescription for an Epi-Pen; the doctor also told me to take one or two Benadryl every six hours for 24 hours.  Two days later I had an appointment with an allergist who told me to start taking two Allegra in the morning and two Zyrtec in the evening.  She also prescribed me Doxepin to help me sleep (I hadn&#39;t been sleeping well because the itching was keeping me awake).  Two days after that I had a follow-up appointment with my GP.  She was on board with everything the allergist said.

I thought that the breast on the same side (left) that I received the vaccine was more sore than the other breast (right).  One day I thought that I had put my sports bra on wrong it was so sore.  Another day I woke up from sleeping on my side because my breast was sore.  I also had some menstrual cramps.

I had a rash on my right breast into my arm pit, and my breasts became enlarged...I had a high fever and was feeling lethargic. I felt terrible over the next few days and started developing even more rashes. My face was swelling . I went to the Emergency Room and they diagnosed me with Shingles, I was on medication for the shingles and i still kept breaking out with rashes. the left side of my face began to droop and I was not thinking straight. I went to the ER about 4 more times along with visits to my OBGYN and dermatologist. My dermatologist did biopsies of the rashes and it was found to be that I had an allergic reaction to the Moderna Shot.

Caused a high level of anxiety for me, and I also had a fever and headache. I was drinking a ton of water.

I went to bed and I was unable to sleep from 2AM onward and I took my temperature and by the time I went to get up for work my temperature was 101F. Throughout the day I had chills and fever and headache and body aches. It got slightly better around noon the day after my vaccine. I was able to eat and everything okay all day, I napped during the day because I felt crummy. Around 4:30PM my fever went up again above 101 so I had to call into work. I didn&#39;t take any medications at all, I just ate and drank water. By the time I went to bed my temperature was around 99 and then the next day my temperature it was normal most of the day. The day after that I was able to go back to work - I work in healthcare.

Feeling of needing to slow down but not struggling to breathe. They gave me Benadryl within 10 minutes and that seems to knock those symptoms away. They observed me for 45 minutes and I was better.

Earlier in the day I noticed a little pain discomfort in my right arm pit. As the day wore on, I noticed swelling in my lymph nodes and the level of discomfort increased to the point that it disturbed my sleep. 1/3/2021: The pain and swelling at the injection site and armpit continued to be the same. I took ibuprofen to try and alleviate the level of discomfort. That evening before bed also took Benadryl to see if it would help with the injection site reaction. I also started experiencing a dull shooting pain and tingling from my armpit down to my wrist on my right arm. 1/4/2021: The injection site improved, no more knot, heat, or itching. It still remained a little swollen. Lymph nodes were still swollen throughout the day, but manageable with ibuprofen. Shooting pain and tingling still occurring sporadically throughout the day. 1/5/2021: Still a little discomfort in the armpit, but seems to be improving.

                                                Employee Recollection: Wednesday and Thursday  felt kind of weak and more tired than normal, but thought nothing of it.  In the early afternoon on Friday the symptoms got worse.   Tired and confused.  I slept through my alarm and woke up to my mom, who was watching my daughter for me, trying to wake me up.  I was very confused, dizzy and weak.  My mom said I was really out of it, and that I had a really hard time focusing on what she was trying to say to me.    When I checked in for work my O2 stats were in the upper 80&#39;s lower 90&#39;s.  My temp was also in the lower 90&#39;s.  That was after numerous attempts at taking my o2 stats and temps.  Co-worker said I was very confused, tired, dizzy and weak.  She said there were times when I was walking that I would reaching for walls and railings to regain my balance.  I left work at 6am Saturday morning.  I went home and went straight to bed.  Slept all day long until a few hours before my shift started at 9:30 P.M.   since then I&#39;ve been feeling better, but my temp and 02 stats are still low.  But I&#39;m continuing to monitor symptoms.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if anything changes.

Tuesday I woke up within 20mins I was nauseous and threw up multiple times. My body was achy and just felt &#34;blah&#34;. Was weak and dizzy when I stood up. I felt like my insides were on fire (like the worst temperature you&#39;ve ever had) but didn&#39;t have a fever. Felt like my brain was going to swell out of my head and it was the worst headache. I slept all day. Woke up long enough to call the dr and fell back asleep. Halfway through the day I ended up with a fever of 102 (it went down after a few hrs). Today I woke up still feeling weak and somewhat dizzy, spacey.

                                                This 38 -year-old female patient reported that soon after she received the injections she napped and felt the nap was due to the vaccine. Then, at 1700 the patient was asked how she felt and the patient stated that she felt very very good.  In the morning of December 31, 2020, the patient reported pain at the injection site, the patient was then treated with Tylenol 650 mg at 0934 with positive results. On the evening the patient reported anxiety, a sore throat and pain to the left arm due to recently receiving her COVID vaccination. The patient was then treated with Hydroxyzine 25 mg PRN, Cepacol Lozenge, and Tylenol 650 mg; the medications were effective.

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

                                                I  got it at 2pm Friday.  About 2 hours later my arm started feeling sore but not too bad. I did some light yoga and walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.  Otherwise took it easy that day. Satu I woke up with a slight headache which isn&#39;t unusual for me.  I still had mild soreness in my arm. I did a more difficult yoga workout and then walked 5 miles outside.  Took a shower after and relaxed for a bit. Then had dinner around 5 and within the hour started having diarrhea.  This lasted a few hours during which my arm started gradually hurting more, it was pretty bad. Could barely move it and hurt to the touch even. Shivering started soon after.  I never had a fever or fatigue during all of this. Highest temp was 98.4 with forehead thermometer. I talked to a doctor to put my mind at ease and he said I was having a big immune response to the vaccine, apparently younger adults between 20 to 40 are having bigger immune responses. The second dose is stronger so most are  having these symptoms after that one, but some are having it after the first as well. He also told me I should have taken it easy these past 2 days and that I likely overdid it. He advised that I take motrin or Tylenol, get under blankets to stay warm, and rest. That&#39;s exactly what I did and a little over an hour later I was feeling much better.   I&#39;m a bit freaked out by what the second dose is going to do to me since it is supposed to be worse. Is it safe for me to get second dose?

                                                About 24 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced extreme breast tenderness in both breasts. They felt sore to the touch all over, had the sensation of being full and heavy, and had to be supported in a bra in order to be tolerable. I liken it to postpartum pain associated with breast feeding and milk engorgement. I would list the symptoms the first night as moderate to severe. It limited my ability to do certain tasks because of the pain and discomfort. The breast tenderness has decreased in severity since then but it is now 1/11/2021 and both breasts are still tender. The severity is now mild. It&#39;s uncomfortable but does not limit my daily activity. Of note, I have had a tubal ligation and ablation and am not pregnant but I cannot track the timing of my cycle to know if the vaccine affected my cycle or caused hormonal changes that could explain the breast sensitivity.   I had arm soreness at the injection site for the first 48 hours but that has gone away. No other symptoms to report.

                                                I had the vaccine Sunday night and experienced fatigue that night, and then developed arm soreness that lasted for a little over 24 hours. I also developed minor body aches and felt crummy Monday and Tuesday. I was then fine for the rest of that week. Monday, January 4th at 7:30 PM, I felt something tingly, burning, and hot on my left arm. When I looked at it, I had a large round red rash that had a knot and was hot to the touch and itchy. At 3:30 AM on Tuesday morning, I woke up in pain and crying. I went to Urgent Care to have it assessed. The doctor diagnosed it as cellulitis in relation to an infection at the injection site and gave me an antibiotic and drew around it with a surgical marker. He told me to go to my PCP if it grew outside of the line or to the ER if I developed severe symptoms. On Wednesday, it had grown and was not getting any better and had started forming blisters. I called my PCP and he told me to take 2 Loratadine every 24 hours and to come in if it was not better by Friday. It appeared to be getting better and I was fine on Thursday. Friday morning, I woke up in pain again. The rash had spread across the majority of my upper arm. It was red and painful and itching with heat. I went in to see my PCP and he diagnosed it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He gave me a steroid, which seems to be suppressing the rash and symptoms. I still have a rash and itchiness, but my physician said it could last for another week or two until it goes away.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

I woke upbat 5am and the pain was still just as bad. Any little movement was excruciating. I could not change my clothes, brush my hair, wash my face. The only reason I waa still able to work is because I am a teacher and we are remote so I was able to sign on from home and sit at my desk with my arm in an imaginary swing because that was the only time it did not hurt. Later that night I could begin to move my arm a little before pain started but still needed help getting dressed, etc. The next two days I was able to move it little more before pain started.  It is now 5 days later and I can lift my arm up. I still feel pain but it ia tolerable.

Little out of it feeling.  This was pretty much done by 1/1/21. 1/7/21 one week and a day after injection, injection site became raised, hard, inflamed looking  and was itchy. Site was visibly red and raised and had approximate 3 in diameter.  Previously mentioned symptoms began again (waves of hot flashes, nausea, aches).  This lasted at least until bedtime.  Next day, 1/8/21 felt better and injection site, though still hard and red, reduced down to size of quarter.  No further symptoms BUT injection site now as of 1/20/21 still looks like a quarter sized bruise.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

                                                Around 6pm my arm starting getting sore. All night it hurt really badly and kept me awake. I took Tylenol around 3am and that helped. When I woke up the day after I had a HUGE lump on my arm at the injection site. It looked like a golf ball. It was red and hot. It stayed this way for about 3 more days and finally started to go down. The red mark at the injection spot remained though and continued hurting until about day 9 after the shot. Then it started getting itchy but remained red. I am now over 2 weeks post shot and the red mark is still slightly there but not very visible and the pain and itchiness has gone away.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

                                                Left arm pain began on Thurs. 1/7/21, approximately 30 minutes after vaccine.  Severe headache and pain radiating to left side of neck began approximately 22 hours after vaccine (around 2pm on 1/8/21) and left arm pain worsened.  On 1/9/21, unable to get out of bed-felt like I had been drugged- severe HA, fatigue, and left side of neck soreness.  Felt slightly better on 1/10/21 and 1/11/21, however stil unable to get out of bed due to severe HA and fatigue.  On morning of 1/12/21, fatigue relieved and severe HA relieved around 1pm.  Since 1/12/21, Severe HA, left arm tightness and left neck soreness has continued intermittently.  This is a HA I have never experienced before.  Yesterday, on 1/21/21, I had a severe HA all day at work and when I went home, I had to lie down the rest of the day/evening d/t severe HA, fatigue and left neck tightness.  I was unable to do daily chores and help my children with their homework.  I also woke up this morning with the same severe HA and left neck soreness/tightness.  I do feel this HA is from the vaccine as I have never experienced this type of HA prior to receiving the vaccine and I am not someone who gets HA&#39;s often.    I know the vaccine was given too high, as I give vaccines often for my career, and I am wondering if that has anything to do with my neck pain.  I did bleed a lot with the injection (do not think it went into my muscle) and am wondering if that has anything to do with my adverse reaction.  I am fearful these severe HA&#39;s will continue and I am extremely hesitant to receive my second dose!

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was dizzy. I sat down where they had us wait and the dizziness wouldn&#39;t go away. Became difficult to swallow - felt like a lump in my throat. More difficult to breathe then normal. Vitals taken. BP taken. Feeling like I had an epidural. Legs had a sensation like they were going numb and then they went numb. Benadryl injection given. Legs felt like they fell asleep. Waited and within second 30 min timeframe I was feeling a lot better so I left. 2:30 in the morning, my legs were asleep again and the lump came back in my throat and took Benadryl and it went away and I felt fine. I went to work the next day. At 7:00 that evening felt chilled and it came and went. I came up and took more Benadryl and rested.I went to work the next day and I sent a message to my Primary Care DR. - but leg was fine and the lump in throat wasn&#39;t there. On Saturday morning - after 10 days - had a headache that would not go away  (Very severe headache)- took Tylenol 1000 mg it didn&#39;t work. It was very bad Saturday night I took another Tylenol 1000 and Sunday morning it - headache still wasn&#39;t gone. Leg was numb again. This time the leg  numbness was worse than ever had felt. Left axilla - there was a lump/nodule and it was painful. Tried TeleHealth Med and they recommended I go to ER but I didn&#39;t feel good enough to do it. Dr.  I reached out to her and she took the history and she prescribed Prednisone; but wanted me to do a COVID test and Urine sample to see how I was doing before I took the medication so I did it next the day. Urine sample was clean. Prednisone 60 for four days 40 for four days and 20 for four days - On day Prednisone my legs feel fine, but the headache just lingers. On day two of Prednisone she told me to stop the Benadryl. Three days after Prednisone the lump under axilla resolved. I am taking coffee. Headache is still there but not as severe.

                                                About 25-30 minutes after I left the site I had chills and started feeling weird. I had to pull over because I started to black out. Was seeing stars, ears ringing, sweating, and feeling heavy. Almost passed out completely. Slurring words  while talking to 911. Went to ER. Have felt heavy, arm sore, heart rate high, and tired after this event today.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart started racing and I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

The day following also was tired achy and felt off/headache. On Thursday symptoms went away other than the arm and a slight headache. On Saturday the redness and I ring was gone, but I started having pain in my armpit and when I moved my arm in different positions. Hand was tingling with certain positions suggesting nerve pain. Lasted 2 to 3 days and got worse before better. Was mostly gone by Tuesday. Wednesday 8 days after injections the redness, itching, and swelling in my arm returned. Same size as the day after my injection. Called the doctor to see if I need to be concerned that the redness, itchyness, and swelling returned after completely going away 4 days earlier. Also feeling tired for the past 3 to 4 days but otherwise good. Some minor discomfort/pain in collar bone around and lump node in neck but is not consistent. Comes and goes. Not sure if the nerve pain in arm was related to the vaccine, but since the redness returned it may all be related.

My brain was telling me to walk forward and my legs were stumbling all over as I tried to walk. I went back to sleep and woke up hours later more stable but still with my head feeling very light(not quite dizzy). I was slightly nauseous and just blah most of the next day. I?d get slightly out of breath when talking for awhile. I was in a deep fog. To the point it took a few minute to process the sound my dog made with it coming from him. Overall, I felt like I was drugged or really intoxicated. I worry about my 2nd dose!

The next morning, I woke with minor side effects body aches, chills, slight fever and arm sore from injection. As the day progressed, my symptoms got worse. By body aches were so severe that it hurt to stand, sit, bend and curl my toes. My head was so full of congestion by the end of the night. I was meeting with a small group of family for New Year&#39;s and thought that I would get checked to make sure that it was nothing. I was tested for COVID and for Influenza. I came back positive for Influenza A. I was sent home with a sample of Xofluza. I was in bed for 2 days and symptoms started subsiding. I went back to work the following week.

It was sensitive to the touch to the point that I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body.  It also hurt to raise my arm any higher than shoulder height.  It went away on its own after about 36 hours.  One week later, on January 7th, my husband noticed that I had a large red patch on my arm where I had gotten the vaccination.  It was about 1.5-2&#34; across, raised, red and warm to the touch.  It was slightly itchy, but didn&#39;t hurt.  My husband noticed this in the evening, but I am not sure how long it had been that way since I had had long sleeves on all day.  By the morning, it had gone away.  I didn&#39;t treat it in any way.

                                                7 days after (Wednesday, January 27) receiving the vaccine, I developed a small itchy hive at the injection site. Considered it was a mosquito bite but woke up the following day (Thursday) with the area swollen, red, and hot to the touch.  I also had a stomach ache so I took Tylenol which did not help.  Friday, I took ibuprofen  and the redness and swelling subsided but the heat remained until the evening of Sunday, January 21 when I started having an anxiety attack and noticed a red ring/rash around the injection site.  I took benadryl but it&#39;s still there.  I read that people are calling it &#34;Covid arm.&#34;  It&#39;s not itchy, just a raised red circle/square about 5 inches in diameter around the injection site.  It is still very hot to the touch.  Besides this and severe anxiety brought on by it, I&#39;ve had no other symptoms.

                                                About 5 hours after the vaccine, I started feeling really hot especially in head and face. From there, I had fever and it started going up. Body aches; joint pain; headache; and this went on all throughout that night (Jan 2 and morning of the 3rd). The 3rd, my fever wasn&#39;t as high but I still had fever and felt really really tired and body aches/joint pain. On the 4th, when I woke up I noticed that I didn&#39;t have any taste and smell and so I went in and got tested for COVID 19 (the 4th) - positive for COVID-19.  I went to a clinic that could do a Rapid test. Doctor there gave me Azithromyocin - 2 the first day and one every day after; Dexamethasone once  a day for 10 days.  I could  Tylenol and Motrin (alternating because my fever wouldn&#39;t go down). The highest my fever got was that Saturday night got up to 103 degrees. The last day I had fever was the 5th of January and that was 99.8. Jan 7, 8, and 9th -  I continued to have other symptoms like really severe headache; no appetite; felt super tired and could hardly get out of bed. Those symptoms resolved about the 10th of Jan -  headache almost went away and fatigue was still there and it is still there. I got out of quarantine on the 15th and I went back to work on the 18th - I had no fever. I just felt tired. I couldn&#39;t sleep - throughout. I finally started being able to sleep just a couple of days ago. I had the second dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 30th - I had fever again; body aches; joint pain.

I had to be monitored for over an hour and then driven home. I was too dizzy to walk.

After about an hour, my arm was swollen and very painful to move and touch. I put an ice pack on and took Tylenol but the pain and swelling didn?t completely subside. I went to bed with Tylenol PM to help me sleep and woke up several times from the pain. Throughout the day today (2nd day), the pain has steadily gotten worse. I can barely move my arm due to the immense pain. The swelling is still there. I have been icing it and taking Tylenol but the pain has only gotten worse. I feel achy in my neck and the pain is radiating down my arm to my forearm, wrist, and fingers.

                                                Recieved 2nd moderna dose 02/04/2021 in my left arm at 10 a.m. approx.  No symptoms besides a small headache throughout day.  At 10:15 that evening I started to become chilled.  By 11 p.m. I had uncontrollable shaking chills, accompanied by a fever of 101 and body aches.  By 1 a.m. I was still having uncontrollable shaking chills and severe body aches and  Body sweats.  I had a sweatshirt on over a tee shirt and a heating pad on between the two with two comforters on. At 3 a.m. I had to take ibuprofen (800 mg) because my body hurt too bad to even touch my skin.  My eyelids hurt.  My toes hurt. My ears hurt.  My fever was up to 103.  I fell asleep finally and woke up at 730 a.m. feeling much improved besides some mild chills.  I made the wrong decision to go to work.  I arrived at work at 830 and by 10 a.m. I started to get chilled again, achy and feeling like I was going downhill again.  I decided to go home.  By the time I got home at 11 I had chills again, fever of 101 and body hurt.  I slept until 3 p.m. at which time I woke up chilled and wanted to take a hot shower.  My other half noticed I had hives on my face (which I documented in photos).  I took a benadryl and went back to sleep.  Woke up again at 7 p.m. tried to eat something but had no interest and just wanted to sleep.  Throughout the night I would get the sweats that would drench through my t shirt.  The following day, 2 days post 2nd dose I slept all day.  Not as chilled but very tired.  Noticed injection site was now red and swollen, again documented in pictures.  Slept all day.  Today injection site has gotten slightly larger based on markers I marked on my skin, but not as red.  Not too energetic but much improved.

                                                Moderna shot #2: About 6-8 hours in, I got the expected serious joint aches, chills, headache, and fever (101F). This lasted for about 2 days, managed well by alternating Motrin and Tylenol. A mild rash occurred a few days after shot #2.   Thought I was done since most of my colleagues bounced back after 2-3 days. Then 48 hours in, I developed a racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools. No position or relaxation method would resolve these symptoms. All I could do was lie down perfectly still with an ice pack on my forehead and hope this was short-lived and would pass. I could not sleep. I had no appetite. Over the 8 days this has been occurring, I lost 3 pounds.  I could not find any literature of anyone else having any cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. It scared me. I have no prior cardiac history and no history of anxiety. I went to the ER. Labwork showed an elevated D-dimer (luckily the CT scan showed NO blood clots), elevated WBC/neutrophils, and low potassium. Thyroid labs (which I had tested a few days later) were normal. The ER assumed the abnormal labs were due to the immune response to the vaccine and referred me to a cardiologist.   I did a virtual visit with the cardiologist the next day. He suggested a heart monitor and scheduling an echo. The heart monitor was mailed to me. I started wearing it on 2/4/21 (3 days ago). I am supposed to wear it for 7 days and then mail it back. My echo is scheduled for 3/4/21. Again, I have had no previous cardiac history. I am an active, healthy 38 y/o F.   These symptoms (racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools) have continued to last for another 8 days and are debilitating. I have not been able to work.   On day 7 of these symptoms, I called my PCP?s emergency line. They suggested calling the cardiologist to see if they would consider prescribing a beta blocker for symptomatic relief. I called the cardiologist last night. They prescribed Metoprolol. I haven?t taken it yet. It?s officially day 8. I thought I was in the clear and had not had symptoms since last night, but then just now another episode of these cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms have occurred but less intense than previously.   At this point, I have had had 10 days of symptoms post Moderna vaccine #2 but 8 of those days are specifally the cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. Although a little better, these symptoms have NOT resolved and continue.  I realize I am probably an outlier in terms of how I have reacted to this vaccine. I would love a call back to know if other people have had a similar experience, so I can understand if this is ?normal.? I understand 7% of patients in the Moderna vaccine trial had ?symptoms? lasting longer than 7 days. Were they symptoms similar to mine? Will this go away completely? Any help is appreciated.   Of note, I did develop a nice rash below my injection site on Moderna shot #1. Does that mean I?m more ?reactogenic? and would potentially have a harder time with shot #2? Does size matter in how you will react? Moderna is 100 mcg (instead of Pfizer?s 30 mcg) I am petite (5?2? and am now 106 lbs since I?ve lost weight).

The red areas were swollen, hot to touch, and each were a hard lump a little larger than a marble.  These two spots were about 3 inches below the injection site and an inch closer to the body midline.  These red spots worsened and joined together.  1/28/21 I was still experiencing the red raised area that had grown in size, still hot to the touch and now red and rashy around the outer edge.  Redness diminished over the weekend and resolved by 2/3/21.  Arm and shoulder still are achy and sore.

I started getting really cold and began shivering and had GI discomfort. At the 20&#43; minute mark I went to get the nurse. She returned with BP cuff and pulse ox, BP was elevated as was pulse. I continued to have waves of feeling weak, shaky and sick but nurse said I should go home an lie down at the hour mark. Once home my throat felt really dry and strange, I had a BM, laid in bed about 20 more minutes and decide decided I wanted to get check out. Went to ER and was seen ~3 hours after vaccine. BP and heart rate were still both up. I still felt nauseated, dizzy and cold. I was given Meclizine and Zofran. BP retuned closer to normal after about 40 mins and I was released, feeling better but fatigued.

                                                Client reported being anxious prior to vaccination, but did some deep breathing which she felt helped calm her down.  After the injection, she felt dizzy, &#34;the room was spinning&#34; and she was not able to focus on what the vaccinator was saying.  She reported feeling dizzy to the vaccinator who kept her seated and provided bottled water.  Clinic Manager and Vaccine Group Supervisor took initial vital signs.  Client also appeared to be shaking.  10:20am: BP: 130/96, HR: 90.  At about 10:25am, client reported feeling better.

She reported that her husband was waiting in the car to take her home.  Client&#39;s condition improved and was released from the clinic to return to her home.

                                                Towards the evening of the day of the vaccine, I got headache and body aches. Next day, it was like full blown Covid all over again - joint aches; fever - 101.6; sweats; body aches; rash around the injection site; headache; redness and warmness around injection site, too. I had extreme fatigue.I had a terrible cough. I didn&#39;t have a sore throat. I had a lot of shortness of breath. My shortness of breath and my cough was still lingering (from when I had COVID before the vaccine). Went to URGENT Care on Friday, 8th; They Took chest x-ray - COVID pneumonia -was what DR called - antibiotics  - took one course but didn&#39;t finish the second and prednisone - did finish the course of the asteroids. Next day they said the radiologist said it wasn&#39;t pneumonia.  I still felt pretty crappy the following week and then I was fine. I didn&#39;t work 11th or 12th but as the week went on I started feeling better. Symptoms have resolved. I had the second vaccine on February 2nd, 2021. It went better then first - but I had joint aches; fatigue; headache;chills on the day after and then they slowly tapered off the next two days and then I felt fine.

                                                For the first injection I experienced adverse reaction starting about 2.5-3 hours after injection.  Symptoms started with some imbalance, confusion, and numbness in left ear.  As the night progressed the numbness in my ear resulted in losing hearing in that ear due to my inner ear being numb.  I experienced vertigo symptoms, headache, fever, chills, achiness, and fatigue.  Hearing returned after two days.  Other symptoms subsided after 3 full days.  For second injection I broke out in hives (chest, trunk, arms, neck, face), itching, confusion, elevated heart rate, and fatigue after 1.5 hours post vaccination.  I took Benadryl after my school nurse tended to me.  Symptoms progressively increased through the night.  I experienced severe muscle pain, fever, chills, headache, spinal pain, and nausea.  These symptoms were severe throughout the night and the next day.  After a shower later in the afternoon the day following the shot, I broke out in hives again and blisters formed where my hives had been the day before as well as severe itching all over my trunk and hands.  I took benadryl again and attended a telehealth visit to describe my symptoms and he confirmed an allergic reaction.  Other symptoms subsided after taking benadryl all evening and tylenol.

                                                I began with having tremors/chills a few hours after receiving the vaccine.  I then developed a fever and pain, redness, swelling and warmth at the injection site.  Second day fever was up to 103.6, worsening symptoms.  Today (day 3), continued fever, very severe headache (can hardly open eyes or stand up), aches all over, appetite loss, shaky, chills, nauseous, hard to get out of bed.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:25 pm on Saturday Feb 13th. I woke up early Sunday unable to sleep due to all over body aches and joint pain. I did not have a fever at any point. I had chills off and on, but mostly horrible body aches everywhere. My left arm was also extremely sore. I knew this was all normal so I was not at all worried. Then Sunday evening my right knee started aching more than the rest of my body and started swelling. I took ibuprofen and went to bed. When I woke up Monday morning it was severely swollen and bright red and heat was radiating  from it.  I had to take a day off of work because I stand at work and it was making it much worse. So I iced it and elevated it and took ibuprofen, but it remained swollen and red and very painful. I was unable to bend the knee and couldn&#39;t crouch down or bend the knee to sit.  On Wednesday morning I went to my doctor at the clinic on the advice or a friend that is a nurse and a friend that is a pharmacist. See below (item 19) for what was prescribed. This took away the severe swelling within about a day and a half, but it&#39;s still painful and achy and hurts to bend. There is also still a bump on the top of my knee.  The all over body aches and joint pain lasted until about Friday the 19th . I have photos of my knee if you would like them.

Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

Fever and pain subsided a bit by the next morning at 8am but not fully. I stayed in bed and was in and out of sleep until 1 or 2pm. Headache and bodyaches stayed with me throughout the day and fever stayed at or above 101. Around 3 o?clock I took pain medication and was able to go about my day almost as normal but with fatigue.

Around 6:30 that evening I got very dizzy and shaky and needed to sit down. The next day I was very tired, had a headache, very foggy minded, an upset stomach, and the injection site hurt bad. I slept a lot that day. On the 1st of March I am feeling tired and have an even worse headache and have had an upset stomach and am tired.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

It felt like I was dying and trapped in a nightmare or drug trip. (I have never done acid but I strongly believe that this is what a bad trip would have felt like)

                                                Felt migrating heat/burning sensations off an on to the left arm after first vaccination which would come and go. After the first vaccine my heart rate elevated for about a minute with pounding, which I was evaluated for and then it subsided.  Two weeks after vaccination, a burning sensation returned to my left arm (where I had been vaccinated) and the sensation would come and go for the following two weeks. After my menses, I noticed that I started to feel hot sensations to both of my upper arms, which I then noticed to my upper back and neck. I questioned whether I should get the second vaccine and was not sure where the symptoms were coming from. I have never experienced anything like this before. I questioned if it was an anxiety symptom. I had the second vaccine and my right index finger and thumb briefly went numb, my heart rate elevated for a couple of minutes and then subsided.  The burning sensations  then became worse and the burning became so intense that it kept me up at night. Sensations have since also been felt to my low back, sides of hips and down the legs. I had an acupuncture treatment and was started on herbs which helped significantly so I could sleep. I also established a visit with an MD to explain my symptoms and was told to come back in a few days to have labs drawn.  The symptoms have not gone away. These sensations affect my work as I am a healthcare provider and need the use of my hands.  It has now been over two weeks and my symptoms have not gone away. Now I have migrating sensations that move all over my body which elicit a feeling of burning.  It seems that the sensations become worse as the day goes on and that they are not as prominent in the morning.

                                                This female patient received her second Moderna vaccine after experiencing no side effects from the first. She has a history of anaphylaxis to foods so she was observed for 30 minutes without any issues. As she went to her car to leave, she began feeling some throat itchiness and returned to let us know. We went to our first aid room and observed her further. Vital signs were taken and she had a slightly elevated blood pressure but good oxygenation and no change in voice character or breathing.  She was very anxious at this point and began saying she felt like her throat was going to swell .  It was decided to administer Epi and as soon as the needle inserted, she expressed immediate relief of her symptoms. An ambulance was summoned and she was brought to the ER.

Two days later, I developed a painful rash on my torso (under my breast on the right hand side). On  3/5 the rash spread to my back (if you drew a line from the rash on my torso to the rash on my back they would be in around the same spot on the right hand side).  The pain and itching intensified. I was able to get a Teladoc appointment. I participated in a video  appointment and had to send pictures of my rash. I was diagnosed with Shingles. I have never had Shingles prior to this. I?m only 38 years old.  The symptoms are still present with the same intensity and I am not able to work.

                                                Mar 5-2:30pm: arm began to feel sore. Mar6-12:00am  I can barely lift my left arm above chest level. The soreness has traveled from the injection site down to my wrist and fingers. The injection site is slightly pink, not really noticeable, and warm to the touch. I start to feel a little nauseous and also starting to get body aches and chills. From 12:00am-4:00am i constantly wake up because of arm soreness and body aches. At 4:00am, I woke up  to use the restroom and realized even the bottom of my feet hurt with every step I took. Took my temperature and it was at 101.5.  I went back to bed and fell asleep even though I kept waking. At 7:00am, the migraine started. I was trying to avoid taking meds just to be able to get a clear picture of how my body responds to the vaccine, But by 9:30am (22hrs post vaccine) I ended up taking Tylenol for severe migraine. It feels like someone is stabbing my temples with a very sharp object. Turning or even slightly moving my head strengthens the migraine. My arm is still so sore that I can barely move it!  Tylenol brings temperature down to 100.7°. 10:30am I began with extreme fatigue. By 12:30pm I went back to bed because I couldn?t stand my body aches and migraine. I slept until 4:00pm woke up feeling a little better. Migraine was still there but not as bad. At 8:00pm I began to feel pressure on my chest. That pressure slowly turned into pain. By 9:20pm I was in excruciating pain, I was in tears and I literally thought I was going to die. It hurt to breath. I checked into the ER by 9:30pm the pain was sharp and it would come, last a few minutes, then slowly ease off a bit. On a scale of 1-10 if was definitely a TEN!!!! The ER said it wasn?t cardiac so they sent me home. The DR did say that the chest pain could have possibly been caused by the vaccine, as many have seen different symptoms and everyone has reacted differently. I was home by 1:15am. The pains continued until 3:00am. By 8:30am on Sunday Mar 7, the only thing I was suffering from was soreness in the arm and my chest was sore from the pain. The pain in my chest was a 1 or 2 compared to the 10 that it was when I went to the ER, And that pain/discomfort has lingered all day.  I?m currently 22weeks 4days pregnant with a boy and expected to deliver July 7th. I?ve been pregnant 19 times have 4 living children and suffered 14miscarriages.

Approximately 4.5 hours later on January 6, 2021, I went outside in the cold temperatures. Upon returning inside to warmer air, the bilateral fingertips of both hands were pale white, numb, and painful. The time was 06:30 pm on January 6, 2021. At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.  January 6, 2021 at 06:32 pm was the first time I have ever had my hands respond in this manner to cold temperatures. I have felt one fingertip go numb and turn white for a split second, only one time in my life but it was not a repeat occurrence, and it only lasted for about a second when it occurred. This experience and reaction I currently have lasts from 15-30 minutes of bilateral fingertip numbness and discoloration with pain. The bilateral fingertips of both hands now respond in this manner every time they are exposed to cold temperatures. I signed up for V-Safe and did state that I was having this symptom through the Vaccine reporting system on V-Safe under other&#39;&#39; multiple times. Treatment I received from a health provider are as follows; I had a telemedicine visit on January 14, 2021 at 12:51 pm to address my concern of ?reaction to Covid vaccine, fingertips were numb, lasting 30 mins?. On 1/14/2021, I received a primary diagnosis of Raynaud&#39;s Syndrome by my Primary Care Provider.  On 1/28/2021, I was seen in person by my Primary Care Provider for a Well Visit to complete a physical with my primary care provider. I was provided with a referral to a Rheumatologist for further advice about receiving the additional second Covid vaccination in the series. I also was ordered to do lab work. On 2/2/2021, I was seen by a Rheumatologist for new diagnosis of Raynaud?s Syndrome, and advised that risk outweighed the benefits in regards to receiving the second vaccination in the Moderna Covid-19 series. On 2/3/2021 at approximately 1:45 pm, I received the second Moderna Covid-19 vaccination.  On 2//10/2021, small red, itchy bumps started to appear on both sides of my neck. On 2/15/2021, a bump appeared above my right eyebrow with what felt like a pimple. On 2/21/2021, the pimple had spread towards my inner eye and above my right eyebrow making my right eyelid swell. I received telemedicine care via an e-visit over telehealth with an urgent care and was provided an antibiotic for facial cellulitis. On 2/22/2021, I had one episode of emesis, and went in person to an urgent care. I received a different prescription of an antibiotic, and was provided with instructions of signs and symptoms of what to look for when to report to the emergency room. On 2/25/2021, my right eye started tearing up and the pain began to intensify. I was seen in an outpatient Ophthalmology Clinic and diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus and postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia. I was placed on a leave of absence from work as of 2/26/2021. 3/1/2021, I was seen in-person appointment with my primary care provider hoping to provide a work note, further assessment of shingles that have spread over neck and back of neck. Primary Care Provider noted diminished bilateral lower extremity muscle weakness and absent deep tendon reflexes.  Primary Care Provider referred me to the Emergency room ASAP to rule out Guillain Barre and herpes zoster meningitis.  Evaluated by the Neurology Consult team in the Emergency Room. Discharged with diagnosis of disseminated shingles and muscle weakness. Appointment made to Neurologist follow up on March 16, 2021 and for EMG/NCS.  On 3/5/2021, seen in-person by Primary Care Provider for hospital follow up. I was feeling diminished sensation increasing in feet, muscle weakness and pain radiating up my back along my spine at times, and near my shoulder/neck. Primary Care Provider was unable to do anything for me.  3/5/2021, followed up with Neurology in person. An order placed for MRI with IV Contrast of Brain and Spine. 3/9/2021, MRI of brain and Spine with IV Contrast completed. 3/9/2021, a re-eruption of shingles started to appear on bilateral areas of my chin and middle of my forehead close to my eye where the nearly resolved shingles were on my eye. 3/10/2021- Order placed for lesions to be swabbed for HSV and VSV and Dermatology Consult placed for 3/15/2021.

                                                Around 5 pm I had diarrhea, like how you poop from the colonoscopy prep medicine. It didn?t stop until my system was on empty. I tried my best to stay hydrated, but I?d have the diarrhea again if I drank enough to feel hydrated. I went to sleep around 9-10 pm with a sore arm &amp;  bad headache, feeling nauseous. I slept until about 4 am. When my husband woke up for work at 4 am, I was starting to feel pretty bad. I was anxious, felt like my heart was racing, couldn?t stop yawning (every 5 minutes for hours), was having severe leg and feet cramps (lasted as long as the yawning), fever of 102, headache, decided to take Tylenol. I kept falling asleep and waking up. At about 8-9 am the severe cramping and yawning stopped. I still had a fever. It was about 101.5, even with Tylenol in me. I continued to take Tylenol. My body was very tired at this point. I slept on &amp; off all day. My temperature went back and forth from about 101-102 the day after the vaccine. I went to sleep that night with a fever, although a little lower. I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours, it was helping but wasn?t making my fever go away. Day two I was weak and had a low grade temperature 99.5-100.5.  Day three I was finally starting to feel like I was getting a bit better. On and off my temperature was going up to 99.5-99.9, but no Tylenol anymore. It was the worst reaction I?ve ever had to a vaccine. I?m still not 100% myself, I still have a nasty headache. If there was a third dose in another month, I don?t think I?d go back for it. I?d be afraid it would get worse.

That day after the vaccine I was very lethargic, lightheaded and nauseous that whole day, but then felt fine the following day.  13 days after my 2nd dose of the vaccine I woke up with urticaria all over my body.  Every day since then I have urticaria that gets worse at night and early morning.  Last night I developed angioedema of my upper lip along with severe urticaria covering my whole body.  I took 50 mg of Benadryl and a Zyrtec and when woke up this morning, the urticaria was mostly gone, but I still have the angioedema, which has lasted all day today.  I have no other symptoms currently.

I had some chills and arm pain the day after the 2nd shot and where I got the shot it was hard, raised, Red and hot to the touch. And a slight headache. I woke up today 3/21/21 and my arm still hurts and it seems like the knot is even bigger with redness and still hot to the touch.

                                                got her first Moderna COVID19 vaccination on Wednesday 03/10/2021. She had no immediate problems with the shot such as arm pain or any other concerns, but by the next day 03/11/2021 she woke feeling very exhausted. They were having tests, and she is one of the main people in charge of this, so she just wrote it off as a reaction to stress. However as the day went on she was feeling worse including low-grade chronic headache, nausea, intermittent palpitations and waves of dizziness. She even had a little anxiety attack, thus she went home Thursday afternoon. She forced herself to go back to school the next day, knowing that if she could get through that day, she&#39;d have a whole week off for spring break. Unfortunately, despite decreased stress, she continued to feel poorly. She has a feeling of profound fatigue, constant headache at the base of the skull that Tylenol really doesn&#39;t touch, nausea, stomach rumbling, intermittent dizziness, and intermittent palpitations.  Not surprisingly, her anxiety has increased, so she started sertraline 25 mg one half tab on Tuesday 03/16/2021, and on Saturday 03/20/2021 she increased it to a full tab. Now taking PharmaGABA at night to keep the anxiety and heart racing down.

It seemed to be going away but the next night I was woken up in the middle of the night with extreme throbbing pain in my right knee. It was swollen but no injury had occurred. I couldn?t put any weight on it. I went to health. They diagnosed it as patellar bursitis with unknown cause. They checked my blood and ruled out gout and or trauma as a cause. My blood showed signs of an immune reaction (possible infection) but it was 2 days after vaccination. To be safe they put me on a 10 day course of antibiotics because of the rapid onset they were afraid it might be a localized infection that could spread (but couldn?t determine a cause as there was no injury or broken skin in the area).  I couldn?t put any weight on my knee and dr advised 3 days off work to elevate, compress, and ice. I am still using a knee brace at work and it is still mildly swollen. No known cause or signs of trauma.

Around 4:45 am, I started to have severe chills and body aches were getting worse even when I took 800mg Ibuprofen. I left work and felt really cold and my body would not stop shaking and crying due to the body aches. My fever reached 103 degrees and when I took Ibuprofen the fever went down to 100 degrees and I had a sore throat.

                                                After the shot I experienced severe brain fog. I could not drive, or even direct a person to my house. Then for the past 10 days I have experienced very strong and horrible night mares. I have also experienced several more episodes of extreme brain fog.

Injection site grew to about 3 inches in diameter was raised and hard.  By 3/31/21 no longer achy, but very tired and blood sugar continued to dip easily. Injection site still raised and hard and a smaller circle, approx 1.5 inches in diameter, within the larger circle developed and showed signs of peeling.  04/1/21 Still easily fatigued fever down to 99 degrees. Injection site still raised and hard but softening.

Sent home. It continued, and we had to call to have a sepository prescribed. This seemed to take the pain away for about 3 hours. I was unable to sleep for two nights due to pain, nausea and chills. I?ve been throwing up so much I threw up a little blood. I had to go back to hospital on 4/4/2021 because I couldn?t keep anything down. I was given 2 liters of fluids, multiple rounds of different anti nausea meds, a medication that lowered my stomach acid, since my throat is on fire due to throwing up, and sent home. It?s now 10:05 pm on 4/4/2021, I?m still a little nauseous, and exhausted because lack of sleep.

My main concern is I started hearing and seeing things on day 3 after the vaccine. I?m not sure if it was from dehydration or ? It lasted about 24 hours. It was pretty intense at times. I got scared. My dreams were very scary as well.  I?m wondering is this something that could of caused this reaction? It got as bad as I felt someone was in my house and I was sleep walking..  my next shot will be the 28th or 29th.  Thoughts?

                                                SEVERE side effects: visible swelling in arm below injection site for 30 minutes, agonizing burning pain through entire arm from shoulder to fingertips for about 6-8 hours, finally settled to dull aching pain. Extreme fatigue, barely able to get to bathroom or out of bed. Feverish and with headache, Tylenol somewhat relieved headache and fever but not arm pain. Fatigue has continued since date of vaccination, as only starting to recede somewhat, but not fully, on 6th day. Still very weak and shaky if standing for longer than a very few minutes. Unable to do basic household cleaning and need assistance for bathing and basic hygiene. Will not be receiving second dose, side effects way too severe to go through twice.

                                                I have been having dizzy spells where I feel very off balance. I am not dizzy to the point where I can&#39;t walk straight but I am dizzy where my head feels like it is in a fog. It is hard to explain, the only ways I have been able to explain it are my head is in a fog, or if you put your contacts in the wrong eyes and how things are blurry and off center. I have also described it as feeling like the items like people in front of me seem closer to me and the background is further away, almost like they are obviously separate from each other. Another way I have described it feels like I am standing in the room but not really there, it is a very weird feeling and it comes and goes. Sometimes it will last a few seconds other times a few minutes and one time longer than ten minutes. The light makes it worse and loud noises and lots of commotion make it worse as well.

Whole body was achy through the night and until about 7 pm the following day.   Waking up the following day I was still very tired. I experienced chills from 9 am to 5 pm.  No fever. The second day following the vaccine I became itchy all over my body.  No noticeable rash.  This lasted just that one day.

                                                I received my  first dose of the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.   Later that day, my shoulder began hurting- and the pain progressed rapidly.   After struggling to fall asleep, I woke up in the middle of the night in excruciating pain.  I couldn?t  move my arm forward, back, or to the side without extreme pain.  The pain was so bad, I felt nauseated and felt like I was going to pass out.  I was unable to go back to sleep.   I expected some arm pain and soreness with this vaccine, but nothing like this.    I have not been able to move my arm since  without wanting to scream in pain from the shoulder pain.   I cannot lift my arm to change, and haven?t been able to sleep without medicine.  I honestly don?t feel this is normal vaccine arm soreness.  The injection was very high up on my shoulder.   I scheduled an appointment with an orthopedic shoulder specialist right away- who prescribed a couple of different medicines for relief.   He ordered an MRI which will be done tomorrow.  I cannot complete normal every day routine activities because I can?t move my arm and am in extreme pain.

                                                First 36 hours was the normal fatigue, low fever, body aches, feeling hot and fatigued.  Then after that the fatigue stayed with some low grade temperature spikes off and on but never above 100.4. Took Tylenol. Then about a week after the vaccine I started feeling very fatigued. Hot all over like my skin was burning, and fatigued and weakness progressed. These symptoms were are first sporadic then progressed to daily. Eventually experience limb numbness, started having difficulty speaking. So fatigued I could barely get out of bed. Finally I got in to see the doctor after calling off from work for being to ill. Medical leave started 3/3/21 officially. I was hospitalized on 3/9/21 after symptoms progressed even worse to right sided facial weakness and body weakness with some left sided involvement. I stayed the night. All lab work and MRInwas conducted. All were pretty much. Normal. Neurologist hyppothisixed it was a combination of the vaccine causing a POtS flare with my system and the trialing of metoprolol for almost two weeks after my second shot, but the medication is hard to say. He said it was more likely due to my bodies reaction to the vaccine. My cytokine levels was not drawn until over a month later and it high. Currently I can still barely function 1-2 hours a day in intervals.

                                                I started to experience left shoulder pain a few weeks after receiving my second dose of the Moderna vaccine.   I took ibuprofen and naproxen to try to relieve the pain, but it would only help for a few hours and then the pain would come back.  I also have been using heating pads to help with the pain.   I thought the pain might be from me sleeping on my side so I bought a new pillow for side sleepers.  It helps a little bit but through out the day the pain will come back.  Sometimes the pain radiates from my shoulder to my left clavicle. And sometimes it hurts so much that I cant lift my arm.  And only after elevating it and resting does the pain subside a little bit.  At first I thought it might be job stress related because I do work at a high volume pharmacy that i s administering the covid vaccines, but even when I am not at work it starts to hurt.

                                                Saturday beginning at 11:00 AM - Severe headache over entire head and neck, extreme joint and bone pain especially through my back, hips, pubic bone, and knees. The pain reminded me of pre-labor. By the time I reached the urgent care facility around 1:30PM, I was experiencing weakness, dizziness, and fainting, and fever around 102. I was also having trouble breathing but that was due to my anxiety and fear from pain. Urgent care sent me directly to the ER. I arrived at the ER around 2:30 PM. I feel like I waited in the waiting room forever crying out for help because &#34;help me&#34; was all that I could utter. I was finally treated with IV fluids, a few rounds of toradol, Phenergan, benedryl, steroid, morphine. I was also given a spinal tap and kept over night for pain management and observation.

                                                I got my first dose of Moderna at pharmacy just before 8pm last night. Within about 20 mins of getting it my lips, tongue, and nose started to tingle. I knew something was really wrong when we stopped for food and I couldn?t taste the onion ring. Shortly after, my lips and tongue just went numb and my face felt tight. I would get a flutter of my heart racing then a rush of dizziness and felt like I was going out pass out. It was really strange.   The only other time I had felt anything like that is when I was given Vancomycin (even though I have a penicillin allergy) for my leg infection and my throat closed up rapidly.   I had my husband take me to the ER. When I checked in, my blood pressure was high which was unusual. They gave me a Benadryl shot and ran an EKG. EKG showed my heart rate was low but the doctor said since my blood pressure was so high it was probably offsetting it.   Five hours later, a lot of the symptoms had mostly passed and I got to go home. It is the next day and my  tongue still feels a little bit like pins and needles but overall feeling better this morning.

First she said she felt better then she reported chest pain. She stretched out her arms and clenched her fists. We called 911. Paramedics and Fire department arrived about 10 minutes later. They attached probes on her body and took reading. They said she was having a panic attack. About 5 minutes after she was calm. She told the paramedics that she used to black out from panic attack previously losing consciouness. She never mentioned this at time of interview prior to vaccination: She said she never lost consciousness today. She heard and saw everything. Paramedic said she was having a panic attached. They offered to take her to hospital but she refused and signed a release for them.  About 10 minutes later she was fine and walked away by herself after she was cleared by the paramedics. Her eyes never closed

She sat back down and then said that her heart felt like it was racing. I told her that I was going to get the nurse. I then informed RN of the situation. She said she still felt her heart was racing and that her chest felt heavy when nurse asked her about her symptoms. She then said she hadn&#39;t eaten all day hardly so she took a bar out of her purse and ate that to see if it would help. Her symptoms improved a little bit. However, a couple of minutes later, she said that her arms felt like they had pins pricking them. Medical Assistant took the patient&#39;s blood pressure in which it was slightly elevated. RN continued to monitor her symptoms. After 30 minutes of monitoring had passed and no resolution of symptoms, we told the patient that we were going to call an ambulance. The patient agreed. EMS promptly arrived 5 minutes later and took the patient into a room. After assessment, they decided it was best to take the patient to the Emergency Room.

                                                I felt mild quick disoriented feelings at the site but they never got big enough to worry about and didn&#39;t get worse.  Once I left the site and arrived home I felt mildly tired and laid down to discover my heart was beating fast and hard.  When I laid down I was very alert and awake and could not fall asleep.  I was still able to move around and concentrate on my tasks besides a very hard and fast heartbeat. I thought this was unusual because I didn&#39;t feel stressed at all though my heart was obviously working hard.  I also noticed that my mental subvocalization shifted to something quieter.  It was noticeable because it changed.  It seems to have returned to normal and comfortably slightly quieter.

                                                Approx 24 hrs after my first COVID19 Moderna shot I became overcome with severe dizziness that caused me to vomit without pause. During this time I was so dizzy that I could not walk and could barley move. I was completely disoriented. After approx 90 minutes my husband took me to the ER. There I continued to vomit uncontrollably for hours. In the ER they administered an IV, cat scan, and MRI. Scan and MRI were both normal, everything good. I was admitted to the hospital. Hours later I was diagnosed with BPPV. My BPPV is in the right ear in the posterior canal. During my time in the hospital I received 3 vestibular therapy sessions. After leaving the hospital, I received a fourth vestibular therapy at a PT practice. Hospital doctors have prescribed me Meclizine, methylprednisolone, famotidine, promethazine, and vestibular therapy. I still have serious vertigo and cannot drive and do normal activities. I have no history whatsoever of vertigo or dizziness.

By the end of the day, I could not move my left arm due to the excruciating pain in my shoulder and upper arm. The pain was so severe I couldn?t sleep that night from the pain. Next morning I went to the doctor as I couldn?t stand the pain and was concerned something was extremely wrong.  There was fluid built up in my shoulder and my left arm was retaining water even down to my wrist and fingers. Doctor gave me NORCO for the pain. The NORCO didn?t help the pain so I stopped taking after one day. By day 3 I could start to move my arm about 15 degrees from my body without excruciating pain. Each day after day 3 has slowly gotten a little better but my pain has yet to go away.

                                                Right after injection, I got really hot and flushed. I thought I am not a fan of needles - so I thought it was anxiety. My throat got really dry. They gave me a Dixie cup of water and I asked for more. After I had finished the one cup, I was clearing my throat and it felt like I couldn&#39;t swallow and my tongue had swollen up and I couldn&#39;t swallow any water from next Dixie cup. I couldn&#39;t swallow - it felt like it would get stuck at the back of my throat. The nurse said she was going to stab me with the epi-pen but had me lay down first and my face started to feel slightly numb and I told her that and she stabbed me in right hip with the epi-pen. They called the ambulance to take me to hospital and after the epi-pen was given they had me sit up and put a mask on my face and I was in a state of panic. I wore an oxygen full face mask and was breathing into it. The paramedics came in and put me on stretcher - monitored for six hours. Because of the adrenaline from the epi- pen - I had high blood pressure and heart rates - everything was really high. After a few hours, she told me that my tongue was looking better and there was better color in my tongue. I was sitting there every six hours - I was monitoring as how to I was doing. They gave me Benadryl and I think they gave me something else but I can&#39;t remember what it was. I came home and it was late at night - 11:00 or 11:30 and from there until February 1st, I was extremely sick. I went back to ER on 23rd; and did telehealth visits  - with my doctor  (right after ER visit from Injection was first one; and then I went to the hospital on the 23rd; Telehealth on 24th or 25th and I - I was running fevers of 104, 103 and went up to 105 almost- on 23rd of January - 3 days after injection - I&#39;m weak, I can&#39;t move - everything hurt. From head to toe. I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything. I was so weak, I couldn&#39;t even move. It was difficult just to use the bathroom. I had the fevers that was causing my chills and my body aches were bad. I had been trying to alternate Tylenol and Ibuprofen; I was finally prescribed Hydro Codone just to sleep. I was told to take this during the day and the Tylenol and Ibuprofen combo at night. Shoulder surgery was about a month after the vaccine - 18th of February - And on the 22nd of February I went to the hospital again for left side chest pains. - I couldn&#39;t breathe - I was discharged February 25th - I was on blood thinners for three months. - the surgeon said that I developed clots and I developed these shortly after surgery and ended up in the hospital for three days. The clots are unknown - blood clots started in the legs and then developed  the fluid/clot issue in the lungs  - I had a pulmonary embolism in my left lung. Surgeon said it could have been caused by vaccine as he did not work on the lower part of my body.

                                                I am a nurse practitioner, so as a healthcare worker, I received a very early vaccine. I have had little time to report what happened to me but not that it remains an issue I think I need to do so.  I had a very serious initial reaction and am now having chronic problems likely related to my vaccine. I received my first dose of Moderna 12/27/20 at POD lot# 025J20A and my second dose 1/24/21 at POD lot#029L20A.  After the first vaccine within a few hours I had significant injection site and arm pain. By the time I went to bed that night I could barely lift my arm over my head it was so stiff and warm. The arm was very painful, and I required Ibuprofen 800 mg TID for 3 days to control the pain. I did not have systemic symptoms from the first vaccine. After the second vaccine, within hours I had systemic symptoms of fatigue, generalized aches in my muscles and severe arm pain in the injection arm. I received the vaccine in the afternoon. I went to bed that night and woke up suddenly at 3 am, about 14 hours later. I had severe myalgias and rigors. I was barely able to move. I was not able to walk or perform fine or gross motor tasks without difficulty. I was unable to dress myself or get up to go to the bathroom. I required almost fulltime care from my husband for three days. On day 4 I developed severe headaches nausea and vomiting. The muscles still ached but I was able to walk and move again. My fine motor was still impaired for a total of 7 days. I was out of work for 8 days and did not feel 100% well for 12-14 days after the vaccine. As the symptoms started to resolve on day 5, I believe I had a mild case of Rhabdomyolysis as my urine was very dark almost brown and there was sediment in the toilet. There was no blood in my urine and no dysuria. I did a urine dip at work and it had protein and ketones but no bacteria. The specific gravity was very concentrated. I did not check my renal function at that time. My renal function a few weeks later was normal Cr 0.88. GFR 85. The dark urine and sediment lasted for about 2-3 days. I was drinking lots of water through this time-period and during then I was very ill. I was not seen at a hospital and rather I treated myself at home. During the above week was the first time I ever had neck or back pain. It did subside but I still had a dull aching in my neck after all of this. I had two episodes, one in late January and one in mid-February of left neck being very sensitive to touch, felt warm, and my ear was very hypersensitive to touch as well. It felt almost like shingles but there was never a rash and I took Acyclovir 800 mg TID for 3-5 days without relief. It subsided each time after about 7 days. This was on the same side of my body on the left as the vaccine was. In the end of March 2021 I began with left trapezoid pain in the same side of the body. I had some numbness in that arm as well so I saw orthopedics and received an MRI of my left brachial plexus which showed C3-4, C4-5, and C6-7 disc herniations that had not been present before. If the herniations were present in the past they were acutely inflamed by the inflammatory process the vaccine caused in my body. The MRI also showed significant and specifically left cervical and left axillary adenopathy this being the side of my vaccine. The pain spread beyond my trapezoid and become progressively worse into my neck and upper back only on the left side. The entire left side of my spine both cervical and thoracic was painful but the right side unaffected. It was very sharp nerve like pain shooting and running up into my head and anterior neck. Another MRI was done of the full cervical spine this time confirming these same herniations, but the discs appear to be pulling to the left with isolated left inflammatory process. The nerve pain became so severe that last week I began having numbness in that left arm and numbness into the left side of my face. A stat MRI of my brain only shows T2 flare pattern consistent with sequela of an inflammatory process of unknown origin. The foraminal stenosis at these spinal levels are very mild and do not explain my symptoms very well. Spine specialist reports that there can be symptoms of this nature but usually not with this mild of a pathology. The facial numbness has been identified as a trigeminal neuropathy of cervical origin but is rarely documented in medical journals and not seen by these spine specialists. There is a very significant amount of left sided nerve over stimulation, inflammation and adenopathy that is not explained. I have never had any spine or neck pain in my life before this and I have no history of traumatic events to explain this sudden change in my condition. I truly feel that ever since I received the Moderna vaccine and had that very severe reaction, my body has been in a constant inflammatory phase and there has been nerve pain in and around only the left upper side of my body where the vaccine was placed. I am scheduled on Monday for epidural spinal injections as I have been unable to find pain relief with any other therapies including dry needling, physical therapy, traction, tramadol, muscle relaxers, oral steroid bursts, etc. I know this may be a very strange and unique case, but I can say confidently that I believe the vaccine stimulated this entire cascade of events. If someone could please contact me related to this, I would appreciate it.

                                                Typical tiny bit sore arm immediately after injection  that was relieved by Tylenol. whole body aches the next 2-3 days that also was relieved by Tylenol. All symptoms subsided by after the initial few days and I was back to normal. I am an athlete and was able to run and do my normal highly active routine after injection until 10 days later when I suddenly woke at 2:30 am unable to barely move. My whole body felt numb and super weak. I was severely dizzy and lightheaded so I went back to bed until 6:30 am and the symptoms persisted so much and scared my husband enough to stay home from work to keep an eye on me. I slept so much that day and severely lightheaded dizzy and body numbness even on 1,000mg Tylenol. I am a highly sensitive person and a red head. I waited this long to get the shot because I know myself so well and wanted to see everyone else?s reaction. My husband got the Johnson and Johnson a week after mine and he was fine. No reaction. I called the cdc immediately after my reaction, I also had an odd swollen arm at injection site that wasn?t there for 10 days that appeared out of no where and it was super tender and painful and hot and itchy. The CDC said to call my doctor who said they haven?t seen or heard of this reaction yet and I should go to the ER if needed. We don?t have health insurance and I wasn?t having troubles breathing and felt they couldn?t do anything for me so I decided to stay home and rest. I am 2 1/2 weeks out now and still dizzy and lightheaded but no swollen arm, that lasted day 10-12. I am concerned getting the second dose as I hear it way worse.

                                                Immediately after I got the first vaccine, my head felt like it got the chills and felt so strange. I called 911 because I thought I was gonna pass out and would need assistance. I didn?t pass out but my head continued to feel strange for about 5 days. After this my head began to feel better for a few days and then the headache came back.  It is as if my head gets the chills. I have felt nauseous and had no appetite. I have been wanting to sleep a lot more. These symptoms still haven?t gone away 2 weeks out from being vaccinated. I feel similar to when I get my concussions. It is strange that the first Covid shot would bring back all of the post-concussion symptoms. I worry that it is negatively affecting me neurologically. I don?t know if I should go get my second shot. If I keep hurting my brain, I wonder what will happen as I age.  I tested positive for COVID 19 back in November and was real sick for about a week, but I didn?t experience any of this weird headache/chills sensation that is plaguing me now. I hope it will be resolved soon.

Sick the next day and began experiencing intermittent, sharp, squeezing chest pain every day until end of March! I was walking my kids in the stroller and felt the chest pain and then felt like I was going to black out on two walks. I told myself it was anxiety even though it didn?t feel like it and waited 6 weeks to see cardiologist.

I wasn&#39;t feeling well, but was able to go to work. I had a fever of 101.2 for the next 3 days, along with body aches, no energy--basically felt like I had the flu. I continued to have low energy for the next two day, but was fine after that.  Dose 2 - By 6pm, I had a fever of 102.4. I alternated between Tylenol and Ibuprofen, but couldn&#39;t get it below 101. On 2/15, I got it down to 99. I also had flu-like symptoms and remained in bed up until around the 15th. I called doc on 2/16 and he said I had an upper respiratory infection. He gave me antibiotics and cough medicine and said I could return to work after a COVID test, which was negative. In March, I had a cough and sore throat, then was out of work again for bronchitis in April. I still have trouble breathing, but that could be due to my allergy induced asthma.

It is now 4 months after and I am still having gastro issues and have been to my Gastroenterologist, my PCP, had a colonoscopy and endoscopy, and have had to be on hardcore pain killers and have missed a lot of work due to the side effects from the vaccine.

My hip joints hurt where I was not able to sleep or go for walks Monday - Wednesday. Tuesday evening (6/8/2021), I started experiencing left chest tightness, near my clavicle/sternum. I would get winded and felt the chest tightness while walking, especially up stairs. My head needed to remain upright because any movement resulted in very painful throbbing near the occipital lobe and upper neck. I felt fatigued and experience brain fog.   I called the respiratory, COVID hotline through the  Clinic and he advised me to be seen immediately. I went to (because we were out of town)

                                                Patient received her # 1 moderna on 12/30/2020.  Eight days later on 01/07/21 she woke up and felt a &#34;bee sting sensation&#34;.  She looked at her arm and noticed below the injection site was a reddened area approx 2.5 inches long by 2.0 inches wide.  The &#34;bee sting sensation&#34; has gone away shortly after noticing the reddened are and now is just tender to the touch.  Encouraged patient to put Ice on the reddened area and or Tylenol or Ibuprofen if needed for pain or swelling. Patient will report back to me tomorrow.  The health department will monitor this situation over the next couple of days. Encouraged patient to follow up with her primary care physician for worsening symptoms.

                                                6 days after vaccination, I started to feel ill. Throat slightly scratching, almost like I was getting a cold. Then it went away. 7 days after vaccination, same thing, started to feel a little ill. Developed an itch at injection site. Nothing could be visually seen at the injection site. Within a few hours, half dollar sized round res spot appeared, with knot under it. Warm to the touch. Felt like a sunburn, with a knot under it. Day 8 after vaccination, woke up with double the size of circle at injection site. By end of day, pounding headache on left side, felt nauseous and unwell. Injection site itchy, warm to touch and began to grow in size. Went to urgent care. Once there, injection site was about the size of a baseball. Dr stated it was a reaction and prescribed an antibiotic and oral steroids. He noted how hard the knot was and was worried about cellulitis and infection. He told me to report this delayed reaction and advised me to not get a second dose. Since being there, about an hour ago, I feel worse. Ears are ringing loudly, increased headache, and almost a wet feeling at swollen injection site.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 EUA Received shot at hospital at 2:30 pm on Jan. 5th.  Had a mildly sore arm that evening and next day at work.  I did notice I had a hard, reddened welt area around injection site, about an inch and half in diameter.  At 8:15 pm on Jan. 6th, I became increasingly achy, and by 9 pm, I could barely stand without my entire body aching.  I took 600 mg of Ibuprofen along with my usual nightly meds of Ambien, Trazodone, and 50 mg benadryl.  It was very hard to sleep that night, as no position was comfortable, and even the weight of the blanket hurt my skin all throughout my body.  I called in sick to work Jan 7th.  I continued to take Ibuprofen and benadryl as directed on the label throughout the day.  Around 4 pm on the 7th, I finally started to feel some relief from the body aches.  My upper left arm remains slightly itchy and has an even larger reddened area now, that measures 3 inches as of today, Jan. 16th.  It remains warm to the touch, and slightly hardened under the skin.  I do have pictures of my arm from January 6th, the day after receiving the injection, but prior to becoming achy, and from today, January 16th, that I would be willing to share.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccination around 10:00am. It was confirmed that it was okay to get the vaccine being that I tested positive for Covid on 12/23/20. Around 19:00 I started to get cold and by midnight I was shivering uncontrollably, I had a fever and had a massive headache. I alternated ibuprofren and Tylenol which did not work. I was only able to sleep from midnight to about 3:00am. The entire day I was shivering with a massive headache. It hurt so bad that I wanted to cry but it hurt worse when I did cry. My highest fever was 101 degrees. My fever broke around 19:00 on 01/05/2021 but the massive headache and body aches lasted the entire week. I felt like I was &#34;hit by a bus&#34; and my entire top part of my arm was in pain . I was seen by a doctor  at HS on Thursday the 7th to have my medical condition documented. My arm felt better by then. She had me take off the rest of the week and to return to work on the 11th. I finally started to feel somewhat better by the 9th

                                                Got my 1st covid vaccine around 9:30 am 1-18-21. Shot was administered with no issue, waited my 15 minutes and went home. Was feeling a little tired throughout the day and around 9 pm noticed I was starting to notice some mild flu skin, body aches and headache.  Went to bed around 10 and had slight shivering but figured it was maybe just a low grade fever and covered up with another blanket.  Within 20 minutes I had full blown rigors. My husband had me take a hot shower thinking it might help but it did not. I had uncontrollable shaking for a couple hours then finally fell asleep (I did wake myself up once from shaking). I woke up at 4 am no longer shaking but I had a terrible headache,  my whole body ached and I was wet with sweat. My muscles and joints were so sore I barely was able to walk to the bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up around 6 (had to get kids up for achool) but I couldn&#39;t so had my husband get them ready. He brought me some acetaminophen and I slept until 11am. Got up and still had body aches and headache but not as bad as in the night. Slept on and off all through the day 1-19-21 taking acetaminophen 2 more times for headache and sore body. Went to bed around 10 pm and woke up back to normal 1-20-21

                                                I had burning at the injection site immediately after receiving the vaccine. As I was leaving after 15 minutes I mentioned it to the person checking me out. At this time we noticed redness and hives starting at the injection site. I was told to sit for another 15 minutes but as soon as I sat down again the hives spread rapidly and I began to have dizziness and confusion. At this point I was taken to the ER and on the way I started having nausea and my throat started burning and felt tight. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and solumedrol and IM epinephrine. Since discharge I had one instance of hive and facial swelling and continued to take Benadryl for two days. I am now having episodes of shortness of breath and tachycardia.

Resolved by morning but fatigue continued. It was the exact same sensation felt last March and led to me not being able to get off couch for three weeks. Couldn&#39;t get covid testing until weeks after symptoms started and tested negative in March.   Numbness in lips. Lower lip&gt;upper. Started 2 days later. Resolved after gradually improving after 10 days. Fyi had lip injection/filler within the last 2 years. Moderate burning in Rt leg that started the Friday after the vaccine. No redness or edema. Resolved after 10 days.   Severe brain fog and fatigue and buzzing sensation in head. Much worse than baseline. Buzzing sensation was new. Slept all weekend. Improved to baseline after 14 or so days. Had sharp stabbing pains in the back of my head 7 days after the vaccine. Resolved after 3 to 5 days. Never had these sensations before. No history of headaches.  Went to PCP regarding leg pain, worsening brain fog and fatigue from baseline and unequal pupils that had previously resolved about 2 years prior. Pupils were unequal sizes when I woke up on 1/2.  Pupils now back to frequently being different sizes. No diagnosis made with previous episodes that had resolved. Maybe it was reactivated?  Also had visual distortions in left eye that were new on 1/3 that lasted two minutes. No pain associated with this.  Resolved.   Feel close to baseline now but hesitant to get second dose for these reasons.

She went to the hospital and had a negative Typhoid test, negative Malaria screen, normal urinalysis, a Hemoglobin of 9g/dl, and a WBC of 17,000. Today she reported that she did not have a good night. Her fever was better but she still had a severe headache and chills.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

In the next 6 hours, I threw up 2-3 more times, the headache also became worse (7 on a 0-10 scale), I got chills and was sweating, and could not get out of bed. My arm was sore, but the other sx were so bad, I did not notice. By midnight I was a little better. I slept on and off for 18 hours, then by 2pm, I was good enough to get out of bed and take a shower. I slowly became better and better and today (Monday - 3 days later), I am fine and was able to run a few miles.

                                                Night of the vaccine, arm hurt at the injection site, very slight raised area about the size of my palm. I woke up with my left pointer finger and thumb side of my hand starting to swell.  Pain at the injection site (slight) when my arm is not in motion and when my arm is in motion. 9:45 am the swelling was continuing and I felt strange all over, head felt cloudy, so I took Benadryl. 10:27 am hand swelling is reduced, but head and body still feel strange. Some acid-reflux type feeling happening Generally feeling off today.

I couldn&#39;t even turn over due to the pain I was feeling. I felt like my body had been hit by a truck, it brought me to tears several times. It continued for about 13 hours and then it was gone, just like that. I took 400mg ibuprofen and benadryl every 4 hours from 6am - 4pm that day and by 5pm I felt no more medication was needed and just like that it was over.

The following morning I began experiencing moderate aches and pains, generalized malaise which resolved quickly with Tylenol.  As the progressed, the achiness and increased and did not resolve quickly with Tylenol.  By 2:30 pm that day, I experienced chills that did not stop, and pain in the bones of my legs that felt like flashes of extreme heat, especially on the femur.  I began experiencing nausea. That night I was unable to sleep more than 3 hours.  Around 1 am of January 27th I began feeling chills, and pain once again.  I took Tylenol, and after a short while I began sweating.  Generally, the pain, chills, and burning sensation stopped that morning, however the nausea continued through the day, especially after trying to eat.

                                                4 hours after receiving it I got dry mouth and mild headache. Next day severe headache, body ache, and severe Short of breathe. Third day was worse same symptoms as the next day had to go to Urgent care because I couldn?t even bend down, walk from my room to the restroom without getting Short of breathe. Got a steroid injection. Missed a whole of work bet it was getting worse. Called my doctor to get seen because on the fifth day both ear pain and my voice was going out. Started Pro-Air Inhaler, Amoxicillin, methyl prednisone pack, and Prednisone. Started getting better by Sunday.  I have never been Short of breathe before

                                                The next two days I had a sore arm. But a week later, the following Monday and Tuesday, I had fatigue and headaches. I put the date as Wednesday because that is when the concerning possible reactions began. I woke with clogged ears feeling very sick. I took Advil Cold and Sinus and arranged to miss work. It felt like a possible ear infection in my left ear. Also my forearms were painfully sore. I had lifted a heavy box up the stairs the afternoon before but the pain in my arms was immeasurably more than ever expected. My ankles were also very tender as I had done a little jogging the day before and I normally walk. As the day progressed I was barely able to get out of bed. Sleeping and just laying there. My highest temperature was 101.25 at 2:45 pm. I had severe chills on and off. I reported these afflictions and was mailed a covid test by Thursday. The test came back negative by Friday evening. Wednesday night my whole body was tender and I had no appetite. I took tons of vitamins and drank tonic tea and took advil and nasal allergy medication. I am still using all of those. Thursday I woke drenched in sweat. My head was mostly cleared just a wet ear and I had a low grade fever on and off through the day. Just touching my body against a surface was painful. Or putting my hand on my hip. My forearms and ankles were no longer worse than the rest. I received my covid kit and taking it to be mailed was the only time I left my house. I was surprised to find extreme difficulty walking down the stairs with muscle strain and pain in my joints. I was not nauseous but had no appetite. Friday I woke up hungry and felt better. No fever. Fatigue and body tenderness but it was better. Saturday my body is only sore on my glands and jaw and back of head. And my muscle is sore in my left arm. The oddness of that being where my shot was given is what makes me wonder if it was an extreme reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it is a flu. I have never had the body pains I try to describe before.

                                                In the evening of receiving the vaccine, I started to feel brief sharp pains in my chest/ back.  Overnight, I was awoken by continued shooting  pains all over my body, and also fine shaking.  Around 2AM a headache started and progressed to be the worst headache of my life.  It was received in the morning by tylenol.  In the morning, I experienced extreme exhaustion and dizziness after climbing stairs I almost passed out, had to rest on the floor.  Later in the day I experienced hours of chills, a temp to 103, which came down with tylenol. By the evening I was feeling well but tired.  Today, 2 days after vaccination, I have neck soreness and am a little tired but well.

                                                I had previous anaphylaxis events that were treated and did not require hospitalization. I brought epinephrine pen and premedicated with Xyzal 5mg 9 hours before and Benadryl 25mg 1.5 hours before vaccine. 20 minutes after vaccine I felt flushing, nausea, low blood pressure. They had released me from the drive through vaccination site and I was driving and felt panicky, so I pulled over. I waited 10 minutes because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anaphylaxis or not. I felt OK after 10 minutes, so I drove to nearest ER and waited in parking lot several hours then drove home. I probably should have administered epinephrine and called 911 when I had that reaction. Continued with 25mg Benadryl every 4 hours and nightly Xyzal 5mg. The next morning (24 hours later)  I woke up scratching my face. I had a diffuse sandpaper rash all over my head and neck and was very itchy. Doubled my dose of Benadryl to 50mg every 4 hours. Also took 400mg of quercetin. The itching resolved and the rash was gone the next day, which was 48 hours after vaccine. I was fatigued for several days but fatigue is my baseline as a narcoleptic plus I was taking benadryl. I continued the Benadryl for a total of 4 days. I normally do not develop rashes unless I rub against hay and I did not have any contact with hay.

Over the next 3 weeks, my headache increased in nature, and accompanied with stiff neck, stiff hips and I could only lay on my back to sleep. The headache was mainly on my right side behind my eye.  I tried a high dose of naproxen, as well as massage, chiropractic and got no relief.  Finally on  February 2nd,  I went to the urgent care associated with my primary care provider because my primary care provider was not available.

                                                Day 1: 7 hours after the vaccine shot, I experienced mild fatigue and chills. Overnight, I had night sweats and insomnia. (Night sweats are a symptom that started after the first vaccine shot, and had dwindled until the second brought them up again).   Day 2: The next morning, I experienced intense fatigue, dizziness, chills, fever, headache with light and sound sensitivity, nausea, and intense fatigue. I was unable to get out of bed most of the day. I could not sit up without intense effort to even drink water. At approximately 11am, I took 600mg Tylenol, then was able to sleep for 3 hours. When I woke up my symptoms were much better, though I still had mild fatigue and achiness.   Day 3:  I was mildly fatigued but otherwise felt good.   Day 4: I awoke with a series of small rashes on my torso (front, back, and sides), as well as my inner arm. They were red, flat, not raised, and mildly itchy, One was around my umbilicus, a few under my breasts, and other splotched in random other places on my torso. My inner ears were also mildly itchy. I put generic rash cream on the rashes on my torso and arms, and the itchiness subsided. The redness decreased throughout the day, though they were all still visible by evening.    Day 5: I awoke and my entire torso was bright red *except* the places where the rashes had been the day before, which were normal skin color. Ears are itchy again, and skin is very mildly itchy. Other than that, no other symptoms. No trouble breathing, good energy.   I have never had rashes or an allergic reaction like this before. I assume it&#39;s an allergic reaction, due to the itchy inner ears and skin.

                                                A little bit of arm pain - mild; went away in a day or two. That night about 7 or 8 pm I felt muscle achy and tired. Next day I was really tired and spent the whole day in bed. I was feeling feverish. I took my temp. and it was around 100.1 degrees f and that is high for me as I am around 96-98 usually. I took Advil and Tylenol which helped but still didn&#39;t feel great and I was still muscle achy. I stayed home from work the next day as well because of the fever. Went back to work the following day, I was functional but not feeling great - felt brain foggy and my forgetful. I ended up taking Thursday off work because I didn&#39;t feel functional or with it. Loss of appetite started day after vaccine and it lasted a good week or so. No abdominal pain this time. Muscle aches cleared my by Monday the third day after the vaccine  and so did the fever. ALl my coworkers got second dose the day after I did and we all agreed it felt it like we got hit by a busy.

Upon sitting down, sudden onset of extreme chills, to the point of shaking so terribly that my muscles hurt.  I sat with 4 or 5 blankets on me and tried to rest until the shaking subsided.  I asked a family member to sit and monitor me, as I was unable to do anything due to the shaking.  This lasted approximately 2.5 hours, then stopped, leaving my muscles feeling sore and overworked. It was exhausting.

                                                She had pain in the injection site Tuesday night and then during Tuesday she got worse with nausea and some fever.  By Wednesday she was complaining that she could not pee even though she was drinking a lot of fluids.  She continued to complain it was the worst she ever felt and then at 0600 Thursday morning she woke us up and said she needed to go to the hospital.  We arrived at the hospital just before 0700 and she immediately threw up in the trash can.  We went into a treatment room and they took blood and started fluids as she became incoherent.  She said she had taken Tylenol so they started a drug to counter that but her liver function was all wrong and they started to look for a hospital that could transplant a liver.  She was air evade about 0930 to Medical center and just over 30 hours latter she was dead.  There is a pending autopsy.  She was a healthy 39 year old mother who got the shots because she worked as a surgical tech and she was the single mother of a 9 year old little girl.

                                                Pt has h/o HTN (not on medication) and occasional asthma(no hospitalizations), and allergies to Penicillin (tongue swelling), tree nuts (throat swelling), and Bees (local swelling); Pt notes she only takes benadryl for these reactions; she has never been prescribed or used epinephrine. Pt denies heart disease, strokes, diabetes, increased bleeding tendency. No early heart disease in family. LMP in the last week. Pt notes she was supposed to see allergist in past, but has not. Pt was feeling well this morning before she came to COVID vaccine clinic. Pt had received first Moderna Vaccine shortly before 0918am here. At 0938 Pt noted feeling &#34;heaviness&#34; in head and &#34;lump in throat.&#34; Pt denied itching/swelling to mouth, itching/hives to body, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea. No lightheadedness/dizziness. Pt walked to stretcher. BP at right forearm was 223/151 and then 221/132 on repeat. Heartrate in 90s. Sao2 on RA 100%. RR 18. Pt notes having high BPs at times, but not often as high here. Pt speaking is slightly hoarse voice. No strider. Pt speaking in full sentences. No oropharyngeal edema. No urticaria. No tachypnea or wheeze. HRT RRR. 2&#43; left rad pulse.  A/P: given Pt&#39;s h/o severe allergies and now new Globus sensation and change to voice I discussed with Pt that she was likely having allergic reaction. Given involvement of airway I recommended epi administration to neutralize reaction and transfer to ED for observation. I advised Pt that epi would increase heartrate and blood pressure. I determined benefit of treating anaphylaxis outweighed risk of elevating BP, even though she has hypertensive urgency BP values. Pt has some headache; she could be bordering on hypertensive emergency. I asked pharmacist to call 911 indicating early anaphylaxis and request of paramedic.  ~5 minutes after Epi (given at 0942) Pt notes lump sensation and voice improved. I had RN place IV to left AC and gave verbal order for benadryl 25mg IV. Pt notes some nausea and dizziness. Lump sensation continues to improve. EMS arrived ~0950. I gave report to paramedic.  I discussed with Pt that I would place referral to Allergy and Immunology; they will determine if and when Pt could receive second moderna vaccine.

Not bad enough to go to the doctor, but  it was an intense prolonged pain.

                                                Soon felt tingly and out of it, unsteady, worsening brain fog. Got worse after leaving observation area and returning to apartment. Trouble walking in straight line, walking into doorways, kept falling over and collapsing (skewing towards left and somewhat back, which is the side of me that is tightened and twisted in while the right is twisted out) but catching myself on the counter, even a slight sneeze started to knock me over, pulling on left, near-absolute brain fog (trouble making easy bagel lunch), started laughing at myself (like slightly tipsy), recognized I was useless and went to bed for rest of day. Was still a little loopy the next morning. See continuation page for the rest.

I was in the middle of treating a PT. Scratchy throat; mild cough; persistent moderate headache; runny nose; diarrhea; very pale. Never had a fever. I had weird neurological side affects (didn&#39;t lose taste or smell  ) issues with facial recognition - didn&#39;t recognize my own face and finding words for every day objects and making sentences was difficult . I was easily winded and had tightness in my lungs. I called Public Health office - and asked them what to do. She told me to go home. Dr  (telehealth visit) told me to take a test in the parking lot that day for COVID January 6. Treatment  - none. All o f my symptoms lasted until Friday January 8 except being winded and fatigued. Those last two symptoms lasted until January 19.  Verbal issues also lasted until the 19th of January. Facial recognition came back around January 12.  On January 27 I had second dose.

She then approached me and stated she had mild SOB but was not sure if it was due to her anxiety about the vaccine or if it was a reaction.  She had no other complaints of dizziness, throat swelling, hives, sweating, etc.  She was able to speak without hesitation or difficulty, but I asked her to remain in the store a little longer to be monitored and not to drive home.  Her BP was 123/68 and HR was 66.  She decided to take a alprazolam tablet which she uses for her anxiety.  About 15 minutes later, she did not feel any improvement in breathing, but was still able to speak.  Her BP was 122/68 and HR was 70.  I decided to call paramedics to be safe and evaluate the patient.  The paramedics arrived in about 5 minutes and assessed her.  They stated all her vitals were stable and felt she did not need further intervention unless her symptoms worsened.    She was advised to follow up with her physician.

                                                3/8/21 - received #1 Moderna vaccine in upper left arm.  It immediately caused intense pain throughout my upper arm.  By 5:30 pm, my arm felt like I was carrying a 15 pound dumbell in it.  I could barely move my arm.   3/9/21 - immediately noticed the whole upper arm was swollen with a lump.  I felt very fatigued throughout my whole body and my legs felt very heavy (could not go to work) 3/10/21 - very fatigued and my legs continued to feel heavy and lethargic.  I went to work but could not dance and sing like I typically do in class with my students.  I also noticed I could not lift up my left arm.  I also felt like my brain was very foggy.  I felt that I could have fallen asleep while driving to work and while driving home from work.  That evening I fell asleep at 7:00 pm standing up, leaning on a counter while waiting for my son to brush his teeth.  I have NEVER fallen asleep standing up in my life.  I had to go to bed at 7:30 pm due to extreme exhaustion. 3/11/21 - very fatigued and extreme leg pain.  My calves feel like there are knots twisting inside of them and as if they might explode from the inside out.  Still could not lift my arm high for more than a few seconds.  Could not sleep that night due to the severity of the leg pain. 3/12/21 - very fatigued and extreme leg pain continued and pain in both arms down into my forearms.   My calves feel like there are knots twisting inside of them and as if they might explode from the inside out.  Still could not lift my arm high for more than a few seconds.  I went to bed at 6:30 pm (not normal for me) due to extreme exhaustion and pain throughout my body.    I laid in bed for hours crying in pain until I got up to take Advil PM and finally fell asleep sometime after 11:00 pm. 3/13/21 - had to cancel my weekly class at the gym due to continued fatigue, pain throughout both arms and legs.  Unable to lift my arm long enough to brush hair and do a ponytail for my daughter.  My forearms had so much pain at night.   3/14/21 - could not go to the gym due to continued fatigue and pain throughout my muscles.  I can&#39;t lift my left arm to use a hair dryer.  My left arm has severe pain if I try to even hold my macbook in my left arm. This is horrific.  I am miserable and cannot yet function normally.

She was transported to the local emergency room via ambulance and said at that point she felt like her throat was starting to close.

Around 5PM I started having chills, cold sweats, muscle soreness, nausea, and vomiting. My arm was so sore i could not lift it al all. At some point around 9PM I passed out on my bathroom floor. My 6 year old found me and thought I had died and called her father crying hysterically. I think I was passed out for a few hours before I came too, as my child had the phone on speaker and her and my husband were both yelling at me to wake up. I crawled back to bed and went to sleep.  The next morning 2/4/21, I could hardly move to get my daughter ready for school, I had to call out of work. I was still having  chills, cold sweats, muscle soreness, nausea, and vomiting, headache, and I could hardly move my left arm.  on 2/5/21 I was still very tired, still had nausea, and a headache. 2/6/21 - 2/7/21 I still had a slight headache.  on 2/8/21 I felt better and went to work.

I felt like crap afterwards and stayed the full 30 minutes too. I had thought maybe it was anxiety, but I&#39;ve broken out all over in hives and I can barely talk now due to how hoarse my throat is. I felt off very quickly post vax and like I was drunk or something after my injection. I have had a high pulse, palpitations, bad headache, jitters, lightheaded/ dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling like I have to constantly swallow (and do), and other post vax issues. I have felt very out of it and overall very cruddy.    I hope you&#39;ll respond to this email so that I know it gets reported.  I have taken a lot benadryl and have an EpiPen handy if I ended up needing it. My mouth has been fine, but not my throat.. but it isn&#39;t closing up so I think it&#39;s okay for it to just be swollen. I have had so much going on post vax that I&#39;ve literally just been laying in bed hoping I&#39;ll feel better.   03/12/2021 The hives have come back and the itching hasn&#39;t ever stopped, my tongue is still super swollen and sore from me constantly accidentally biting it, my throat is still red, swollen, and sore, and I generally feel like crap. I&#39;m taking a ton of antihistamines to combat this and they&#39;re not touching it. I am probably going to need more steroids and a visit to urgent care tomorrow.  :(  03/13/2021  The email is too large with the new pics and it got kicked back...trying again minus the body hive pics.   The hives just keep spreading  :( . I know you can&#39;t see them all because the lighting isn&#39;t great, but you can make out the outlines of the welts like on my forehead. I have hives all over my face, throat, neck, chest, arms, and more every day. My whole body is very itchy even in areas without hives.    I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist&#39;s office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I&#39;ve never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I&#39;m going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can&#39;t take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that&#39;s if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I&#39;m already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t update.  I&#39;m still dealing with hives, but they&#39;re getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called (like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a PAC, PVT, but I do know I&#39;ve had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I&#39;m so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I&#39;ve been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she&#39;s having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I&#39;m passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the &#34;moderna arm.&#34;  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it&#39;s coming back in full force! I&#39;m still taking allergy meds too! This is just crazy!

                                                I just received my first injection last night, I have a welt about 1in tall x 2in wide it is hot to the touch and it is raised above the skin. Other than that my arm hurts as I was warned it was. My chest feels heavy but I do not know id that is anxiety or the injection.

She took a nap and when she woke up she could not lift her arm at all.  Had pain in the neck, wrist, arm.  She had pain/feelings in that arm.  She woke up sometime after midnight sitting up because she woke up and had a tingling sensation in her throat and felt as if her throat was going to close on her.  She did not go back to sleep fearing this.  She took 600 mg of Tylenol, as well as 600 mg today.  She has been better today, and thinks that she had the swelling and pain due to the way that the woman gave her the injection.   She has not notified her doctor.  She is not having any chills, and her arm is just sore right now, but able to use is otherwise.  When she lifts the arm it hurts, as well as shoulder/ball of her arm hurts.

Tried to make coffee/breakfast/get ready, but kept almost blacking out when I would stand more than a few minutes. Vision started blacking out, had a hard time breathing, weak, felt like I was about to faint, nauseated, felt like heart was trying to stop. Would lay down every time this would happen, then ears would ring and would have a headache. Finally was able to eat a banana after a couple of hours of almost blacking out multiple times and the banana seemed to help.  5pm: feel much better.  Wed 3/24: dizzy Thurs/Fri 3/25-26: dizzy and wee bit faint feeling. Didn?t feel right 4/03/21: still a little dizzy/vertigo  Could you shed light if this was an allergic reaction hours later, please?

She then slumped in seat and appeared to lose consciousness for a few seconds. She was breathing although breathing appeared mildly labored. She opened her eyes after a few seconds and began to shiver significantly. Pre-epinephrine assessment by APP: BP WNL, tachycardia and elevated respiratory rate. Skin cold. No wheezes.  APP administered 0.3mg of epinephrine IM at 1237 to right thigh through jeans. Patient tolerated well. Vital signs post epinephrine showed an initially high BP and heart rate and then returned to within normal limits 5-10 minutes later. Patient feeling much better after epinephrine.  I was assigned clinical site lead, I arrived on scene 3-4 minutes after APP. I called 911 and ambulance arrived within 3-4 minutes. Patient did not want to go to hospital but agreed to get in ambulance for 12 lead EKG and vital signs, all of which were stable. Patient refused hospital. Husband drove her home at approximately 1:30pm.  APP called MD on call, they called patient at approximately 2:30pm and reported to APP that she was at home with no further symptoms

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I noticed raised itchy bumps and redness on my left arm at injection site the morning after my shot, they could have been shortly after I was vaccinated, but I was really only looking for any issues that might be life threatening. Over the following two weeks, the bumps/itchiness worsened and spread across all of my body except at my hands, feet, face, and lower back. Nearing the end of the second week, as the conditions worsened my skin felt painful all over (like a very bad sun burn). Due to the discomfort, I was largely unable to sleep during this period and had difficulty focusing on work. At week one I started taking Benadryl and applying lotion on my skin. I informed my PCP as well as the clinic that administered the vaccine of my condition. The clinic said they could do nothing unless my condition was life threatening. My PCP advised that an itchy rash is a rare side effect of the vaccine but that it would get better typically within 8-12 days. He also advised on taking an additional over the counter antihistamine along with the Benadryl, which I did.  None of the antihistamines made the conditions better, they continued to worsen. I started taking Ibuprofen for the discomfort and pain. By the end of the second week, my rash became more painful especially at my chest, neck, and ears - the skin became quite red and looked a bit like a burn. At this point I did not believe I was having a safe reaction and reached out to my PCP and vaccine clinic once more.  I was not able to reach my PCP but did connect virtually with an online doctor who reviewed photos of my skin and prescribed a topical steroid. Doctor advised I see a specialist in person, with concern that taking an oral steroid might  mitigate the effects of the vaccine. I alerted the clinic that I would be seeing this specialist and they advised that I instead go to urgent care. The following day (4/6/21), I did both. Healthcare facility provided an oral steroid and did not think it would impact the vaccination. The Specialist did not want to prescribe a steroid in concern that it would mitigate the effects of the vaccine. He advised to endure the rash another 1-2 weeks. Later that night, I could not bare the pain and starting taking the oral steroid. Within 24 hours I started feeling some relief. I am on day three of six of the steroid and each day the pain, itching, and rash are getting better. I will have a meeting in person at the clinic where I received my vaccine this Friday for a doctor to assess my rash and determine if it is appropriate for me to take a second dose healthcare facility requested this meeting.

Fatigue, back pain.  On day 13 I also got a rash on the inside of my arm, on the bicep area.  It was red, bumpy, and slightly itchy.  I missed some work due to fatigue.

                                                Moderna shot 1 on 3/24. Symptoms began on 4/4 and worsened until 4/9: Fatigue, chills, low fever, sore throat, no voice, body aches, dizziness, bad headache, no appetite. Went to the doc on 4/5 for rapid and pcr covid tests. Both negative. Unable to work or do any regular activities. Symptoms began getting better, but were still very present on 4/11. Went back to the doc to see if I should be taking anything besides mucinex. Rapid and pcr covid tested again - negative. 4/13 only fatigue. 4/14 all symptoms returned by the afternoon. Have had about 4 hours during which I could actually do anything. It?s possible that this has nothing to do with the vaccine, but it is very rare that I get sick like this, and i do think it is from the vaccine, so I think it?s worth reporting.

It was in 10 second intervals for 14 hours straight.  I tried Tylenol, didn&#39;t help. I could not sleep. I thought it was over, but at 10 pm 4/8 I had the same pain, but it was on my left side and in 30 second intervals. Also at this time I had same burning, shooting pain from mid inner  left arm  that exploded at the armpit into left shoulder.

I had aches throughout my body, had a terrible headache, was incredibly tired (I slept for nearly 20 hours straight), was nauseous, and had no appetite. Despite returning to work just 3.5 weeks earlier after maternity leave and, therefore, having very limited time off to use, I needed to use my only sick day on 2/5. I finally felt normal by about 6pm on 2/6.

                                                Within 40 minutes approximately of getting the vaccine, my face became numb at the tip of my nose and the area above my upper lip. By one and a half hours later after the vaccine, the numbness had expanded from right below my eyes down to my jawline. This numbness lasted a few hours and by the following morning, the numbness had returned to just my nose and area above my upper lip. This numbness lasted about an extra day. Nausea lasted 15 minutes beginning approximately 40 minutes after getting the vaccine. Lightheaded and feeling somewhat disoriented began about 40 minutes after getting the vaccine and lasted two days. While I received the injection in my left arm, my right arm was actually sore, which started within a couple of hours after getting the vaccine and lasted about three days. Severe muscle aches beginning from my waist down to my ankles, which began about four days after getting the vaccine and lasted about three days total. No muscle aches above my waist was experienced. Soreness in my left arm at injection site as well as itchiness was observed about 8 days later. All side effects fully subsided about 9 days after the injection.

When headache was constant, I also got a Migraine headache that started on day 2 and ended midway through day 4. The Migraine may or may not be related. I sometimes still get them during my period even though I take Topiramate as a preventative.   I am also experiencing an increase in fatigue and slept excessively the first 4 days. The pain from my fibromyalgia spiked hard on day 2 and three. I am still in a flare.

                                                Client received first dose of Moderna at 0848. Per vaccinator who gave injection - client was tearful and reported anxiety about receiving injection. Per client she reports that her arm immediately felt &#34;heavy and tingly&#34;.  She did not tell anyone and proceded to post-vaccine monitoring area with her spouse. She reports that she started feeling &#34;more tingly&#34; at 0903. By 0908 she reported difficulty breathing and PHN responded.  She was making occasional gasping sounds and crying. She was able to speak and HR was  ~72 BPM per her wearable device. Respirations were shallow and frequent.  Spouse was supportive and stated that she was having a panic attack because she hadn&#39;t had a shot since her childhood and was very anxious about the vaccine. He also reported that they hadn&#39;t slept or eaten anything due to attending to elderly dog  and that &#34;this is what her panic attacks look like&#34;. PHN attempted to have client take deeper, slower breaths while continuing to assess. Client&#39;s breathing improved. Meanwhile 3 other PHNs responded and then client began to have difficulty breathing again. One PHN called 911. She then reported she was feeling  &#34;tingly everywhere&#34;  and her &#34;eyes felt like they were sweating&#34; Then her hands began to cramp and her face was pale. 0.5 mL epinephrine injected in RA at 0910 by another PHN. Vitals taken at 0910 were 120/85, 73bmp. She reported that her symptoms were beginning to alleviate.  EMS arrived at 0915 followed by paramedics at 0918. Vitals at 0918 were 110/68, 60 bmp, 100% SpO2. Vitals at 0922 were 131/98 and 62 BPM.  Paramedics discussed possibility of it being a panic attack but recommended going to hospital to be monitored - discussed spouse driving vs paramedic transport. At this point client shared that her HR at approx 0905 was 45 bpm per her wearable device. EMS discussed how this is another indicator of anaphylaxis and recommended ambulance transport. Client agreed and she was transported at 0930.

                                                Starting two weeks after the injection I became very exhausted and sleepy.  I went from having insomnia type sleep to sleeping about 14-20 hours a day.  I had two negative Covid  nasal swab tests in the following  week as well as a negative Covid blood test.  During this time my heart rate was increasing, and my oxygen levels were lower than normal.  Drs have done  full lab work ups multiple times over the last 2 months,  chest X-ray, 24 hr heart monitor, and EKG as well as several virtual dr appts and an in person  endocrinologist appointment this week.  The results of my 24 he heart rate monitor showed that my minimum heart rate was 86 over a full 24 hour period including sleep.  My normal sleep HR is 58-62.  My endocrinologist attributes the extreme tiredness and increased heart rate to the vaccine.  She also noticed in blood work that it has possibly affected my thyroid and I will be put on medication for that.  These symptoms have continued for over 2 months now and have affected my ability to work and conduct normal routines in my life.  One example is that my mother had to help me dry my hair because I was so tired and weak.  I have been unable to stay awake long enough to do much other than attend the work hours needed in a day and a occasionally a few additional light activities from the couch like using my phone or watching TV.  The symptoms ramped back up after my second vaccination.  I have been able to stay awake more hours on and off over the past week, but I am still far from back to normal.

She also noticed her left arm (arm of vaccination) became very itchy. After the itchiness subsided hours later, she noticed a tight, swollen feeling at the site of injection that was painful. She stated that today 4-23-2021, 8pm, that she is feeling better and her fever and chills have subsided. She still feels tightness and her deltoid area is swollen. We talked about how these symptoms can happen with vaccination and she will continue to use otc pain reliever to help manage painful symptoms. She asked me to submit reaction to VAERS as reaction worried her and she wanted her experience to help with the research and information that we are obtaining about this vaccine to help other people.

About one week after the vaccine, I woke up in the middle of the night with severely itchy hands and feet. This has continued every night for the past 16 days. I also have sore red/purple bumps on my fingers and toes. I began taking Allegra  which has helped, but middle of the night itching, particularly on the bottoms of my big toes, continues. I have no gotten any additional bumps, but the ones that remain are extremely sore (almost like blisters).

I had 10 pm, my swelling on my arm and rash was back - (I had an 8inch circle  (immediately it was that size)- raised, red skin, itchy and warm to the touch). I had a low grade fever. My body temperature is typically 96. I had flu-like symptoms; tired, lethargic; migraine - chronic ongoing; upset stomach; body aches. Not feeling good. I didn&#39;t have pain in my arm. But my whole body was just tired and achy. This went on for two weeks. The rash on my arm was only there for the first week. I took Benadryl - ( I didn&#39;t take it when I had to work - and took it mostly just h ad night for the week I had the rash) and a topical cream (steroid two times a day for the week I had the rash) for the itching. Three ibuprofen three times a day for the body aches and I took this for the full two weeks.

                                                Received 2nd Moderna shot on 4/21 at 1pm (it is currently almost 60 hours later). I was pretty out of it just a few hours after injection, so while I dont have specific times, here are some of the side effects I&#39;ve been experiencing. Note: I had a pretty significant reaction to the first shot so expected to have the same with the second.  Arm pain - pain radiated from injection site to fingers and fluctuated from uncomfortable to almost unbearable off and on throughout the next 48 hours. Felt better if I slept with pressure on the arm itself, but once I took it off, it throbbed relentlessly. Still have swelling, redness, and tenderness almost 60 hours later.   Fever - consistent low grade fever; spiked to 103.8 and plateaued between 99 and 101 for some time. Broke after 36 hours, but returned after 48.  Brain fog and confusion - consistent for first 24 hours.   Nausea/vomiting - was not able to keep most foods down, but alleviated after 24 hours. Returned after 48 hours and continued on to 60 hours.  Swollen foot - unsure if this is direct result of vaccine, but important enough to note. Left foot was very swollen after 48 hours (same side of injection). This was after returning to work and being on my feet.  Kidney pain - experienced pain similar to passing a stone in lower left kidney area a few hours after the shot. Continued until about 24 hours after.  Joint pain - all joints tender for the first 24 hours (all knuckles, elbows, knees, ankles, wrists). I experienced this with the 1st shot as well.   Itching - whole body, moderate level itching for almost 24 hours. No rash, just sensation. Returned at 60 hour mark.  General flu like symptoms- have carried over past 48 hour mark 60 hour mark.  39/F

                                                I received my vaccine in the left arm in the mid-afternoon on Sunday and experienced little discomfort the rest of the day with some soreness in the arm before bed.  The following morning i felt unwell and my arm was extremely sore.  It took some focus and energy to move.  I took 500 mg acetaminophen 3x  and Ondansetron 1x over the day due to feeling nauseous, low-grade headache, tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell.  I felt noticeably irritable.  My arm was sore to the touch and in the late afternoon i noticed i had a mild rash across the back of my arm  starting below my deltoid muscle and spread out and down close to my elbow.  It was not a bright red but the area was remarkably sensitive, so much so that i felt i should report the reaction because ive never had a noticeable reaction to a vaccine so i became mildly alarmed.   I put no creams on the rash nor did i take additional meds.  The following day (today) it has decreased significantly in sensitivity and has faded so much so that if you don&#39;t look for it, you cant easily see it.

                                                Arrived at facility to receive vaccine. Was wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt and expected to remove arm from sleeve, but was told was unnecessary and only lowered neckline.  Remember thinking &#34;wow, that is really high and really far back&#34; when received the shot. Minor arm/shoulder ache and weakness immediately after injection. Persisted and worsened as time went on. Sought a doctor visit after pain, weakness, and numbness in fingers became disruptive to sleep, workplace concentration, and minor tasks.  Had trouble figuring out what event caused the injury and inquired about whether it could have been vaccine related, considering the timing of onset of symptoms. Medical provider said it was possible, but treatment (anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxant, and physical therapy) would not change, and said adverse reactions should be reported here.

The date of my second vaccine, i felt my energy level drop a few hours after the injection.  I increased fluids, and reduced my work.  The next day i was extremely tired, the lymph node over my left clavicle was sore, and lots of body aches, (i was not surprised by this.)  On Monday i was expecting to feel better, however my energy level was still very low, and i have a fogginess to my brain, almost as if I was slightly inebriated.  I stayed home from work on Monday.  I am at work on Tuesday, 5/11, however I still feel like i have 40-50% brain function.  I do not see this as a serious side effect, but wanted to report if it is helpful for data collection.

                                                My teeth and gums started hurting the week after the first shot. They hurt 24/7. It is worse in the front but is throughout the mouth. There is no bleeding and I don&#39;t have a history of gum disease. I brush and floss regularly and see my dentist twice a year. There is sensitivity to hot and cold foods but also it hurts to eat anything but very soft foods. It hurts to chew food. I don&#39;t know for sure whether the vaccine is the cause. I am submitting this report because of the timing of onset and because I don&#39;t know for sure. I had the first Moderna shot at 2:40 PM on April 5, 2021. I had the second shot at 2:40 on May 3, 2021. Other post-vaccine symptoms that were temporary include extreme fatigue that lasted about a week, brain fog for a couple days, arm soreness, and tachycardia the day after.

I did seek my provider as I had a scheduled appt. I think I had a sore throat, too. The lymph nodes were slightly enlarged. I am having some spinal issues; back pain; leg issues; bladder issues and leg fatigue. I&#39;m currently off work and have been off work since mid April. I have seen my doctor multiples times. I had had many tests. Nothing has helped with the pain so far (getting physical therapy) and I&#39;m having spinal injections tomorrow.

My tongue felt weird and I was excessively thirsty throughout day and night. Monday, I had a fever, body aches everywhere, my skin hurt to the touch and my left arm was very red &amp; swollen and hot to the touch. Tuesday, no fever and my body wasn?t as achy, but I still felt weird,  my teeth started hurting and I had unquenchable thirst. Wednesday, my gums and tongue were now  tingling with a burning sensation. This morning, that burning sensation spread to my lips, face,  eyelids, scalp, forearms and fingers. And still excessively thirsty and everything tastes strange still and my mouth feels like I ate a bunch of black pepper. I?m very concerned  about this
