                                                Injection site pain began about 5 hours after getting vaccine and progressively worsened. Unable to lift arm above shoulder without significant pain at about 12 hours post injection. About 13-14 hours post vaccine, began having myalgias, chills. Took ibuprofen with some improvement of symptoms, but unable to sleep due to the combination of arm pain, chills and aches. Body aches and chills were gone by the morning but the arm pain lingered, less than the night before and improving each day, still there today, but much more tolerable.

                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

And then unable to complete daily functions: do to headache; suffered from headache - took one gram tylenol to address a low grade fever that day and the headache, too. fever subsided with tylenol. Headache was relentless; I tried 600 mg of ibuprofen as well to treat headache with no success; Started to suffer severe pain; couldn&#39;t open eyes from pressure of headache. Went to ER due to never having such a severe headache before. Tests did not show pathology that would cause headache. Was given one liter of IV fluids. Was given 25 mg of benydryl ; 10 mg of compazine. Along with toradol. And 20 meq of potassium. Discharged home with two prescription migraine medications. Resolution of symptoms by 27th. COVID Test was negative result.

                                                On Dec 28 - three hours after vaccine - started getting pain near injection site. It ached. 8:30PM that night I started getting itching from the midback to top of head on left side. Not left arm just the back, neck and face of left side. No rashes but a little red because I scratched. Then I noticed some bumps on my left side of my face and one hive on each knee and one hive on left shoulder. Telemed visit with dr. - took Benadryl - 25 mg. - within one hour of symptoms - at 9:00 pm per dr. Woke up next morning and had intense fatigue; muscles and back were really achy. Couldn&#39;t move my muscles very well. Felt like the wind had been knocked out of me. Bouts of itchiness. Slept throughout the day. That helped. But then had headache start - felt like a circle where my temples are to the back of my head and that is where is stayed. Next day - no fever and  but my symptoms improved except still had the symptoms but they had improved. Went to work on Wednesday because it started to go away - on and off headache - felt foggy. Bouts of itchiness and felt physically weak because my muscles had gotten so so tight. Felt a physical weakness for five more days. Headache went away by Wednesday night (Dec 30th). Itchiness went away. Three days symptoms went away although the physical weakness lingered until 5th  day. Used a heating pad for my muscles to help relax them.

                                                Saturday- felt fine for a Couple of hours after vaccine. Felt fatigued around 4 PM, laid down, lost ability to move arm, extreme pain in neck.  Sunday- more of the same throughout the day. At night when I took a shower the pain moved over the course of a few minutes in the shower from my arm to my lower back. Arm was fine, Lower back pain bad enough that I was limping.  Monday- woke up &amp; pain was evenly dispersed between lower back and head. Slight soreness in arm and neck. Took extra strength ibuprofen because I had to work. Totally fine for the rest of the day time. At night my arm and neck started to become very sore again. After I ate dinner I developed a very intense fever, chills/ shakes, my arm felt like it had a heartbeat and my heart was racing. Laid in bed all night. Felt scared and disturbed that this was happening days after the vaccine. Considered going to the hospital but I couldn?t move. Slept for 10 hours.  Tuesday (today)- feeling almost all better aside from slight pain in neck.

                                                I had slight dizziness for 20 minutes a half hour after the injection. But that&#39;s not the issue. When the lady gave me the injection, it felt like she wiggled it around in my arm. The injection itself was surprisingly painful. My arm hurt at first like I was punched in the arm on the first day (much like a flu vaccine). But then it got SIGNIFICANTLY worse the next day. I was in excruciating pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine. I had limited arm mobility and any movement caused agony. I couldn&#39;t sleep from the pain. I wasn&#39;t able to do my normal activities. The pain started to subside after 4 days, but had since started to get worse again. I&#39;m in a constant state of pain. It&#39;s now impacting my mental health. I can move my arm, but not without a lot of pain.

I was talking to people that were not there. I felt completely out of control. The only thing that helped was forcing myself to focus on the TV, which was extremely difficult. Symptoms started to die down around 3 AM, but did not go away. I slept for 4 hours.  1/20 8 AM- felt like and still feel like I am not in reality, I feel disassociated with my body (like its not mine), slightly out of control of my thoughts, I see subtle black and white flashing like last night but not as intense, paranoia like last night/not as intense, cant concentrate.

                                                I am not sure if the event that happened Sunday was directly related to the vaccine at all since it happened two days later, or if it was just a coincidence, or if the vaccine was just a physical stimulus trigger. I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

It was extremely severe and woke me up from my sleep. Movement made it worse. Nothing immediately made it better. It radiated down to my right shoulder. The pain lasted for about 2 weeks. I got a massage, used a heating pad, used an at home massage device, and Tylenol and ibuprofen.

                                                About 2 to 3 minutes after receiving my injection, I began to feel a burning sensation in my nostrils. It felt like a 4/10 pain. The burning sensation worsened when breathing through my nose. When trying breathing techniques to calm down (breathing deeply through the nose, exhaling out the mouth), the burning sensation deepened towards the back of my throat - but I never felt it in my lower throat and chest - only the top of my throat and nose.  The nurse on staff took me to a corner for closer evaluation. She had me remove my mask and checked my body for hives. I had no hives and the burning sensation occurred even after my mask was removed. She asked if I had trouble breathing or itchiness, I had neither of those symptoms. My heart rate was high and I began to hyperventilate because I was having a panic attack. I had no other symptoms besides the panic attack symptoms (tight chest, tingly face and hands, rapid heart rate, and dizziness) and the burning nostrils.  The sensation lasted about 5-10 minutes, then dissipated. I then put my mask back on after it was requested. I continued to be monitored by the nurse for another 20 minutes until I gained back my normal breathing and my heart rate lowered. I was scheduled for a 2nd dose and was dismissed with no other treatment or issues. I drove myself back home and rested for the remainder of the day.  I had no other symptoms that day, other than the typical sore arm, fatigue, and mild chills, which resolved themselves in a couple days. I had no other complications.

                                                I was given Moderna vaccine first dose in right arm. Sat down in observing area, within a few minutes I had a weird feeling, felt queezy. As soon as I felt queezy I passed out. I woke up they said within about 30 seconds and had full body sweats. Stomach ache, dizzy and head was tingly like I would pass out again. My calfs hurt like they had previously had muscle cramps. I went to ER, blood and urine tests were fine, heart and blood pressure was fine. Dr said he did not believe it was an allergic reaction, and that it was a stress response. I am not sure if it is because I had COVID in December.

                                                Arm pain began in early afternoon with skin tenderness beginning in the evening, which were followed by extreme chills, body aches that hurt to be still, muscle spasms, fever (102-101.4), throbbing headache (treated with ibuprofen x2 200mg Q4hr which helped some), then around 12am became hot and sweaty with aches and spasms persisting. Was able to sleep off and on every time I turned over onto my vaccine arm I woke because of the pain. Next morning I spent the day in bed with lingering chills, muscle aches, headache, and spasms, but less than night before. High Fever persisted (101.4) and a cough with mild shortness of breath developed. The night of 2/28 I took ibuprofen (same dose as before) and Benadryl which allowed me to sleep all night. This morning (3/1) I feel better, with fatigue, lightheaded, a mild fever of  99.3, and minimal muscle aches. Cough persists.

No appetite. Struggled to read and process things. Could not work. Sharp pains in lymph nodes at various times throughout the day. Chest felt very tight and arm hurt to the point I thought I might be having a heart attack. Had trouble sleeping due to lymph node pain. Ibuprofen did not help. The arm pain at injection site was annoying but I barely noticed it due to my other symptoms.

                                                The day i recieved the shot I started to get a headache and my arm was sore and red. At about 1:30 am the next day I noticed the arm I got the shot in had a rash all the was down to my wrist amd it went into my back. My back and face were warm to the touch. It hurt to move my arm. The day after I recieved the shot my headache was much worse.   Today which is the 2nd day after my shot my headache is terrible i am having a hard time doing every day things. And over the counter pain medication is not helping at all. The rash and sore arm is gone.

                                                Starting about 1 minute after vaccination I became extremely dizzy, blacked out/lost vision, had shortness of breath and a tight chest, lost feeling in my hand and fingers on my left side (the side I got the vaccine), was sweating but felt cold flowing through my body. These feelings lasted for about 30 minutes and my vision and feeling in my fingers and hand came back as the dizziness subsided and my body temp returned to normal.   Around 40 minutes after the vaccine I started experiencing echoing in my left ear (the side I got the vaccine on) and soreness around the vaccination site.   The echoing in my left ear lasted about 30 minutes and then subsided. The arm pain spread to the rest of my arm and I began to get a headache.  About 4 hours after the vaccine I began to experience intense back, hip, foot and hand pain making me unable to do any regular activities. The back pain feels like intensely sharp pain in my spine and hurts to the gentle touch. I previously had no back pain prior to the vaccine. The muscles surrounding my spine up to my shoulders were also painful/sore.  This pain subsided after 6 days. On about the 4th day after the vaccine I began experiencing underarm and breast pain on the side I got the vaccine.  It is now exactly 1 week since my vaccination and I am still experiencing the underarm and breast pain.  I have experienced lethargy since vaccination.

                                                Immediately after dose 2 of the Moderna vaccine I felt fatigued and slightly congested. At approximately 3 am (14 hours after vaccination due to daylight savings), I woke up with severe body aches, headache, skin tenderness, and chills indicating a fever. The following morning, these symptoms were joined by lack of appetite, weakness, and nausea upon attempting to eat. Symptoms lasted at full intensity for approximately 24 hours. At some point in the early hours of 3/15, my fever started to break and left me sweating on and off all night. By the morning of 3/15, symptoms were still present, but had greatly lessened in intensity. After approximately 36 hours, (3/15 at 3 pm) symptoms had mostly ended, though I still had a headache and felt weak. Today (3/16), feelings of weakness persist and I feel very &#39;foggy&#39;; slow to think and slow in movement. I did not take any NSAIDs or medicines of any kind to deal with symptoms, as I feared it would lessen the efficacy of the vaccine.

                                                Patient came in for first dose of covid vaccine (moderna) and received the shot in her left arm at 03/25/21 approx 1:30pm.  She was told to sit down near pharmacy for 15 minutes after receiving shot for observation.  However, since she is an employee, she decided to sit in the break room.  For 15 minutes, she was fine and she came back to pharmacy to let staff know she was fine.  At 30 minute point, she started feeling lightheaded, heart racing, shaky, foggy, and some nausea.  She sat down, was given ice pack for back of neck, instructed to put head down between legs and rest.  After talking to patient, she had eaten some after her shot, she was well hydrated.  She has had no previous major adverse effects from shot, aside from sometimes sore arm.  She is alert, communicative, and aware of her surroundings when I spoke to her.   At 2:17pm, patient is feeling a bit better, but still has lessened but similar SE.  Also, reports she has a bit of headache now.  Another coworker has offered to drive her home and she has her grandmother at home to watch her too.  Advised her to rest at home, take tylenol if headache persists, stand up and sit down carefully, and drink chicken soup until nausea is over.

                                                One hour after vaccination on Saturday got lethargic and so tired. Same the next day. Monday, the fatigue improved but Instartes to get muscle aches and stiffness. Soreness in my joints. By Wednesday evening my chest started to hurt for a few minutes and my heart rate temporarily Increased. As the days went on the symptoms became more regular. I also got extreme anxiety, a very fast heartbeat (up to 130 BPM), insomnia, sweating palms and feet, and very difficult to breathe. I couldn?t even get up to take a shower sometimes or sit up. I was admitted to the ER on I believe Tuesday the 23rd of March. This is all in the records. All tests came back normal  aside from low iron, but anemia tests came back negative. After all doctors refused to give me medication to directly treat it, I finally went to an urgent care where they gave me prednisone. It?s currently helping me. I was finally able to go for a walk today.

At this time I took Tylenol. With the fever came a head ache. My injection sight is very painful. I did not sleep very well. When I woke up at 7:00AM my fever was 100 degrees. It has stayed at 100 degrees until this point (1:30 PM). My headache became painful enough that I took 2 excedrin that have relieved most of the headache. My symptoms are improving as the day progresses. My injection site is still very painful. With the normal flu vaccine I get yearly I have never had any problems.

                                                12/29/2020- Received the Moderna Vaccine - no pain or problems until 01/04/2021 01/04/2021- Before bedtime my injection site from the Moderna Vaccine became itchy.  01/05/2020- Woke up to a swollen arm (about 3 times the size of my right arm) and the start of a rash (the size of a softball) Was in significant pain and unable to lift my arm. I called the nurse hotline where I received the vaccine. I was told to go to the ER immediately. The ER doctor informed me that they had been seeing this and that their personal vaccine location swelled up as well but went away a few days later. ER doctor gave me Benadryl cream (I can not ingest Benadryl due to an opposite reaction, I become extremely anxious.) The ER doctor informed me that the Benadryl cream wouldn&#39;t cause the same reaction. I was sent home with the cream and a wrap. Upon arriving home my rash grew exponentially over the following days. The site became hot (even after icing it) It remained itchy and painful.  01/11/2021- Went to primary care doctor. The rash and swelling had decreased although you could still see the ring of the rash. At this point, my hand was becoming numb after doing daily activities including typing. My palm and thumb area started to turn purplish/blueish when I would type for less than 20 seconds. The doctor told me they would start to reach out to other providers and figure out how to best move forward. In the meantime, there wasn&#39;t much to do besides wait and see what happens.  01/13/2021- Woke up throughout the night due to continued pain at the injection site. Called the primary care doctor who wasn&#39;t in the office, waited for a call back from their nurse but due delayed call back and  increased pain and numbness went to urgent care (which is under the same practice as primary care). The urgent care doctor performed tests regarding pinched nerve shoulder (as they believed I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder) and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed tissue damage but nothing else. I was not experiencing shoulder pain, although during one of the shoulder tests I found more discomfort in my left should (injection arm) than my right arm. Therefore, the primary care doctor thought I was experiencing a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  01/14/2021 - Primary care doctor called and informed me they had spoken with the infectious disease doctor in the area who informed them that they have been seeing a similar reaction amongst other people. (7 days after inject, swelling and rash) The infectious disease doctor reported they hadn&#39;t seen numbness. The primary care doctor advised me to wait 2 weeks to see how symptoms change before performing additional tests. The primary care doctor also advised me after speaking with the infectious disease doctor to not take the second shot.  01/16/2021- still experiencing issues with daily functioning. Still experiencing numbness in hand and arm. Still experiencing redness around the injection site (although much better still flairs up at moments)   Side note: 01/03/2021 - Went cross country skiing, did fall backwards but did NOT fall on arm.  Also confusion remains if  I was supposed to report this or if the primary care doctor/ER doctor reported this, therefore, urgent care doctor told me to report this reaction.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

Attempted to walk around at 10 AM, pounding headache was a 10/10 pain scale when upright. Nausea set in as soon as I was standing, ran to lay down to avoid vomiting. At 10:30 AM I sat up attempted to drink water and the vomiting began. Severe vomiting for about 30 minutes, then intermittent vomiting throughout the day until 6 PM. Headache did not let up all day, no response to medication (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, rizatriptan, magnesium). Headache subsided around 8 PM and  I was able to sleep. No symptoms today 1/22/21.

                                                Within 1.5 hours, I started getting a bad headache.  She was not hungry, was nauseated and was becoming clammy.  She tried to eat but it did not make it better.  When she got home, she continued to feel &#34;really bad like she was getting over the flu.&#34;  She slept for over 10 hours.  When she got up, she could not move her arm and her arm was sore at the injection (it was hard, a little swelling but was not red).  Then she started feeling worse with bad pain (like she had a stroke).  This was around 12 noon to 1 PM on 1/21/21.  Around 7 PM that night, she presented to the ER.  The ER doctor said he thought she was having a migraine but she has never had one before.  Her blood pressure was high at 127/110.  Her supervisor walked into the room and said her face was pulling and it looked like a stroke to her.  She reported severe pain from her ear to her neck on the right side of her head.  She left due to having to provide care to her newborn.  She went to hospital on 1/21/21 about 2100.   Her blood pressure was still high and she had a heart rate of 120 bpm.  She did lab work and CT scan.   ER doctor believed she was experience Bell&#39;s Palsy and that she had had a mini-seizure.  She provided prednisone 60 mg X 1 dose, Valtrex tid and shot of Toradol.  She prescribed Toradol for outpatient pain relief.

                                                After receiving moderna vaccine administration, we requested pt to wait at least 30 minutes prior to leaving the pharmacy. After 30 minutes, we came back to give the pt her vaccination card and as soon as she stood up, she fell slowly onto the floor and started having seizure (pt didn&#39;t hit her head per technician on scene) around 3:50 pm and became unconscious for a few seconds. She was able to answer our questions when she woke up, but was confused of where she at. She continued to call out random names.  We called the ambulance and assisted her while she was on the floor.  She had another seizure 5 minutes after the first seizure and became unconscious again for a few more seconds. After she woke up, we placed her on her side and monitored her pulse rates and her breathing while on the phone with 911 personnel.  The paramedic came 10 mins after the call. Pt had a history of seizure (she wore epileptic tag around her neck). Pt was taken by paramedic to the nearest hospital for further observation.

                                                I received the second dose of my Moderna covid vaccine at 10 am on Wednesday February 3rd. Around 8:30 pm I experienced extreme chills and had a 100-101 F fever all night. I woke in the morning still feeling weak because I spent the whole night uncomfortable from the fever and flushed  face I had. I walked towards another part of my house and fell down and fainted. I was unconscious for a few seconds before a family member was able to shake me and wake me up. I take no medications and am a generally healthy individual with no prior medical history or underlying Heath conditions. I also do not have a history of falls or issues from taking any past vaccines. I also am not allergic to anything or have experienced any allergic reactions in my life. It?s the second day now and I am still experiencing a 100 Degree fever and face flushing. I am currently self medicating at home with Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not gone to see a health care professional yet.

Tylenol seemed to help her fussiness during the day.  I am still experiencing side effects 7 days later including muscle aches, fatigue, weakness, headache, and nausea. I was evaluated at a local ED and all lab work was normal, covid test was negative.

These symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes and then they resolved. I did not have any of these symptoms since it initially happened on 1.8.21 at 230am. I did not seek medical care at the time since my symptoms resolved. I did contact my doctor on 2.1.2021 about this and he stated the symptoms I described aligned with symptoms of a panic attack, but if I felt it was related to the vaccine that I can report it.

                                                Received around 2pm on Friday, 1/15/21. Not sure exactly when this started, but noticed redness around injection site  that evening around 8pm, mildly itchy. Also felt a little bit tachycardic and anxious about 2 hrs after (4pm Friday) for 15-30 mins, but I think that may have been lack of sleep and my own nerves! But redness persisted at injection site, and had intermittent hives around injection site (smaller area within area of redness, about silver dollar sized hive area intermittently), noticed probably 5x over the next 8 days (last had hives on 1/23 PM, 8 days after). Hives were sort of raised white weals with red border. Redness persisted and began to resolve at around 10 days s/p shot, fully resolved by about 12 days s/p shot. Also seemed to have decreased appetite over that time, but also could be totally unrelated with stress

                                                Received my first vaccine 1/6/2021. I was very nervous about the vaccine, so I brought 4 epi-pens with me. My PCP and allergist advised me to sit x30 minutes after the shot. 25 minutes after receiving the shot, I felt very warm.  I looked at my hands and they were fire-cracker red in color. I began doffing my sweatshirt and my arms/neck/stomach and back were had a spotty rash. There was no hives/areas of elevation.  Nurses took my BP.  40 minutes without medication, rash and warmth resolved. A few hours later, I had a terrible headache and then around 8pm, I started with bad aches, chills, fever of 101. I took tylenol and did not resolved. The next AM, symptoms continued. I took advil and this had a better effect with sx resolving. My second dose, I received on 2/5/2021. I had a similar response about 10 minutes after the shot but warmth/reddness did not last as long, ~5-10 minutes. Had my BP taken, which was elevated (probably from my own anxiety). a few hours after the shot, I began with the headache, chills and fever--- though all mild. fever was 99 degrees the next day. 2/8/2021, I felt very fatigued and weird for a few hours. this seem to pass and I have felt normal since; just very tired. *** additionally, I did have COVID-19, testing positive 11/11/2020. my sx were mild compared to others.

                                                I sat down and I felt hot and got a little flushing. I experienced paresthesia - tingling of my finger - I only get that as a stress reaction or when one of my nerves is pinched so I thought one of my nerves got pinched when they gave me my vaccine. Had it for about 5 minutes and I kept wiggling my fingers. It only happened on my left hand (and not both hands as normal). I was tired and had insane drowsiness. I went home and took a nap. My arm was pretty sore. I think I took  a Norco. Drowsiness was severe the next morning - couldn&#39;t get out of bed. It impaired me so much I couldn&#39;t go to work. It felt almost flu-like - my body was sore and I felt cold. I didn&#39;t have chills but I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the blankets. I didn&#39;t leave my bed until Monday and I took acetaminophen. I called my doctor and she asked me to take a COVID test - tested negative. I went to work the next day but didn&#39;t feel good. Fatigue went away in just under a week.  Cold sweats -  I started having these on Sunday, the 17th. And they still reoccur every now and then - and those never had occurred for me before the vaccine. Where I wake up drenched in sweat. I don&#39;t feel feverish but when I walk out of bed I am cold.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

                                                First dose of Moderna vaccine received on 1/11/21 Monday on my right arm. The following day 1/12/21 Tuesday I started having itchy rashes on my left ear, along with right arm soreness. The rash on my left ear gradually progressed and spread as days go by until 1/15/21 Friday. I woke up with swollen ears, hives on my face, neck, chest, and upper body. On Saturday morning 1/16/21, my symptoms worsen with more itchy red rashes. On top of the rashes, my lymph node on my left neck felt swollen and tender. Also, I had a weird sensation in my throat that was not going away like something was stuck. After a TeleVisit, I went to the ER that day and got medical treatment. I was given Benadryl, Pepcid, Dexamethasone and IV fluids. Then I was sent home with Cephalexin, Prednisone, Benadryl, and Epi Pen. Right now, I still have symptoms of rashes on my face, ears, and chest but they wax and wane. I can feel it itching beneath my skin even if they are not showing. With my ears, I can say that they are not swollen and are less red now. I have no other known exposure but the Moderna vaccine. I do not have any known allergy either but to bee stings.

Symptoms stopped Sunday 24th around 9am.  I was unable to do daily tasks, stayed in bed all day. Did not seek medical attention due to these being listed as possible symptoms to the vaccine and told they would pass in a day or two.

                                                I am a MD student who got the first dose of the moderna vaccine on 1/4/2021. I had no immediate reaction other than arm soreness. A couple weeks after my first vaccine, I had a reaction when drinking miralax. Within ~5 minutes of having a few sips of a 17g solution, I had throat tingling/tightening, sense of impending doom, cough, dyspnea, nausea, fecal urgency, and intense chills with shivering. I stopped drinking the solution and my symptoms eventually resolved on their own (the chills and nausea took the longest, about 1.5 hours) - I didn&#39;t even think to take benadryl because it wasn&#39;t clear to me at the time if I was really having an allergic reaction (no hives, no vomiting - but in retrospect I&#39;m concerned). I&#39;ve had miralax in the past without any issues. I&#39;ve never had a vaccine adverse reaction. I have no history of atopy.

I usually have a little pain at the site of the injection but this was WAY worse which resulted in me icing the area and taking Ibuprofen. I also could not apply any pressure on the site so I had to make sure I only slept on my right side overnight. The intensity of the pain was MUCH better the next day, and today (2 days later) it is very bearable.  I also experienced lethargy the first evening after receiving the vaccine, but that went away the next day.  On the second evening since receiving the vaccine, I started to experience body chills and some minor body aches. I felt a sense of general malaise that I often experience when sick.

That next morning I woke up and took a hot bath, which helped with the pain. I continued to have pain throughout the day, as well as fatigue. The second day after the shot the pain was gone, but I noticed I had a rash around the injection site, about 2 inches wide by 3 inches long.

                                                I got the vaccine approx 10:10am yesterday. About 4 hours post-vaccine, I developed severe pain in my left arm which limited flexion and adduction. I started to become nauseous, but initially thought this was due to pain. Once I returned home from work, at approximately 5 PM, I started to develop chills and a worsening headache. After taking acetaminophen, I took my temperature and found it was 101.5. This remained all night, and I had a difficult time sleeping, waking with chills, sweats and Aching in my joints. Today, I took off from work and slept all day, waking occasionally with the sweats. My fever began to go down slowly and is now approx 99.7 with use of fever reducers every 6 hours. Headache is still present. I anticipate these will dissipate in another day or two.

She was taken to exam room where she received 0.3 mg Epinephrine IM into her right thigh. She was tachycardic in the 150s but was normotensive and satting 100% on room air. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving Epi, her breathing slowed down and symptoms began to fade. She was transported via ambulance per protocol.

                                                The day after my vaccination after I got home from work, I started to develop a cough, followed by chest heaviness. I then noticed that I couldn&#39;t get warm and started taking my temperature every half hour. The highest it got was 101.6 at 11:30pm that night. I couldn&#39;t sleep, so after eating some soup and talking one Tylenol PM, I did finally get to sleep. The next morning, my temperature was 98.6 and I felt perfectly fine. Summary of symptoms -cough -heaviness in the chest -body chills (was still cold in a really hot shower) -fever of 101.6  -fatigue -duration: only lasted for one evening from about 6pm until I woke up the next morning feeling just fine

                                                After receiving the vaccine in right arm on 1/13 I had injection site pain and an severe upset stomach until 1/19. I was fatigued from 1/13 until 1/24. On Friday Jan 15 the pain in my injection site improved, but the pain moved to my right collar bone and right side of neck muscles. On Jan 16 the pain returned to the injection site and increasingly got worse in my collar bone and neck. The pain continued to worsen and become intolerable on 1/20. On 1/20 I was having pain in my injection site, collar bone, neck muscles, and my throat was sore and hurt to swallow. I went to the ER . After going to the ER and waiting for medications to be ready at the pharmacy the pain moved into my ear and I had a severe ear ache for two days. My symptoms improved after 2 days with ibuprofen 3x/day, muscle relaxers 3x/ day, Benadryl and lidocaine patches. The pain was localized to the right side of body and did limit the ability to complete ADLs

No treatment has been undertaken. Some side effects have resolved while others continue.

She started loosing her balance, could not go up the stairs, trip and fall.  They did lab work, told her that she was fine.  She was having confusion and forgetful and let it run it&#39;s course.  She did have the 2nd vaccine, but is still having hot flushes from it.

She took Pepto-Bismol, Advil and could not hold anything down.   The brain pounding headache that didn&#39;t want to go away yesterday.  She is still having a headache, she feels like every step she takes she has to use the restroom due to diarrhea episodes.  She has been at home trying to sleep through the symptoms and has not seen a doctor as when she called with her first vaccine reactions they did not have any information to tell her since the side effects are so new.  She only gets up today only when she has to use the restroom.  She has been in the bed since she went home on 2/3/21.

                                                I had arm soreness the day of the vaccine (2/11/21). The following day I noticed an erythematous round lesion that was very tender and when palpated felt like a lump. The pain went away 2-3 days after the vaccine and the erythema/lump went away on 2/21/21. On 2/19/21 my left internal arm felt sore. I thought I pulled a muscle perhaps. On 2/21/21 the arm pain was worse and didn&#39;t feel like typical soreness that would come from exercise or sleeping in the wrong position. It was painful when I pulled my arm close to my body, as if something were being compressed. I palpated in the armpit and found a large lump slightly smaller than a golf ball. It was extremely tender and sent me into a panic. Someone pointed out it was the same arm as my vaccination, so I looked it up and learned about this side effect. Today (2/22/21), the pain is gone and the lump is smaller (feel like a typical enlarged lymph node).

I am a fitness trainer and RDN, no weight issue, and very high muscle composition, lungs are in excellent health.   Around mid afternoon next day, several hours after teaching an exercise class, I developed a fever and flu like symptoms. That Saturday night, I developed extreme nausea, along with sleep in and out the entire night due to nausea and fever.   This continued until Monday afternoon, over 2 days later. Then the symptoms disappeared in the blink of an eye, indicated it was definitely vaccination related.

All of my skin, back and spine hurt, in the way that your body is sensitive and extra painful when you have a fever but I checked and I haven&#39;t had a fever yet. All of the day on 02/28/2021 I experienced skin and back pain, headache, fatigue, and brain fog (difficulty focusing and making decisions) as well as swollen and tender lymph nodes in my left armpit and under the left side of my jaw. On 03/01/2021 I woke up and felt better in the morning, I went for a walk around 3 pm and around 4 pm when I got back and sat down I started to experience headache, severe nausea which turned into chest pain and chest tightness and I still have swollen lymph nodes.

                                                I am twenty-eight years old, young, healthy active girl. I have always been into fitness and yoga. I live a generally healthy lifestyle. I have been a singer, a dancer, and a flight attendant! I decided sign up for the COVID-19 vaccine in order to help our world fight against this pandemic. I wanted to protect my family and friends to eradicate this virus once and for all. It was with no hesitation did I jump at the opportunity to get this vaccine when it became available to me on February 12th, 2021 at the Convention Center. As soon as I received my shot I proudly posted my photo with tears in my eyes letting the world know that we were one human closer to a COVID-19 free world. I was Moderna proud.   My entire family had already received their Moderna vaccines because I come from a family of nurses, but none of them had experienced any side effects. I was confident I would be in the clear after their clear symptom free vaccine. Immediately following my vaccine my arm was a little sore, as expected. However, I did experience fatigue and mild leg cramps in my calves. One very odd symptom was that I could taste the vaccine in my mouth, like a metallic, strange taste, which I reported to my family, but everyone just laughed it off. The leg cramps went away after a day or two as well as the taste, but the fatigue continued throughout the week. I felt these symptoms were pretty average. I signed up for the V-Safe reporting system and put in my report and thought nothing of my initial vaccine symptoms.   Things took a very strange turn on the morning of February 20th, 2021 at about 10am. I woke up and my face was numb, tingling all over, twitching in different parts of my face pretty severely and uncontrollably. By 4pm the tingling moved into both of my arms and hands and by 5pm it moved into both of my legs. Shortly after the cramping and twitching began in both of my legs and I lost the ability to walk, lift my legs, and just the ability to feel my legs at all. I could not walk.  Obviously concerning, I thought I was originally having a reaction to a medication I had been taking for over a year called, Topamax, a nerve pain medication which can cause numbness and tingling as a side effect. I called my prescribing physician and he immediately ruled out the possibility of a reaction to this medication due to the length of time I had been on this medication, that I had not missed a dose, I had not increased or decreased the dose, and I had not experienced a reaction like this in the time that I had been taking the medication. He recommended I keep an eye on my symptoms and go to an emergency room if things worsen.   Overnight, my symptoms remained the same. I woke up on Sunday, February 21st, 2021 and I still could not walk, I could not feel my legs. My legs were still twitching and cramping. My face was still numb and tingling, but the twitching had stopped in the face. My hands had stopped tingling. At this point my mother who is a nurse suggested that I call Moderna, the vaccine provider, to report a possible side effect of the vaccine. Upon contacting Moderna, the company thought that it could possibly be a reaction between the Topamax medication and the vaccine, but they had no current information about these two having any interactions. They thanked me for reporting and told me to go to an emergency room if my symptoms continued or worsen.   Throughout the day on Sunday, February 21st, my symptoms remained. I was able to get to my feet, but I walking like a newborn baby giraffe or as my mother described, like a 105 year old woman. I was unable to feel my legs completely, lift them, move them without lifting them with physical help of my arms moving them. At this point on Sunday night I decided to contact my Primary Care Physician. She noted that this sounded similar to Guillain-Barre and that I sound immediately go to an Emergency Department before the symptoms get any worse. It was late on a Sunday night and I was unable to drive myself, so I waited.   Overnight on Sunday into Monday I began experiencing light flashes in my eyes, heart races, lower back pain, and worsening cramping in my legs. I knew that I needed to seek treatment in an emergency room.   On Monday, February 22nd, 2021 I was taken to the Emergency Room Department. They conducted blood work and a physical examination, but did not want to proceed with any MRI?s or CAT scans. The ER the doctors were baffled. They could not figure out what was causing my paralysis other than the vaccine was the only new thing that had been introduced to my body, but they could not verify or diagnose anything. They let me go with a referral to neurology.   While we were sitting in the ER my cousin, a nurse anesthetist at another local hospital, called my mother who was with me with some very alarming news. Her co-worker, had experienced the same symptoms back in December and was just going through recovery after his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He was told by the CDC there had been 19 reported cases through the CDC where after the first dose of the vaccine people have reported numbness, tingling, and the lose of the ability to walk after receiving the first dose of the mRNA vaccine, both Moderna and Pfizer. Her co-worker was also in the same age range as myself, very healthy, young, active. He was officially diagnosed with Transverse Myletis. He has taken a full two months to regain the ability to walk and still has numb patches on his legs. He walks very slowly, but is walking. He returned to work, but cannot return to his normal life working out and being active because he does not have the strength. He was told not to get the second dose of the vaccine.   There are unreported cases in this area by physicians who do not know where to turn with this information. It is hard to link these symptoms and cases because they are so obscure, but these same symptoms are occurring with those who have also had COVID-19. When I was being seen for an EMG test of my legs the physician performing the test said to us, ?I have a patient who received the vaccine and has the symptoms, maybe I should report it!?. My Grandmother?s physician just last week just sent a patient of hers with the same symptoms to neurology. I think this uncommon side effect is more common than is being reported and no one knows where to turn with the information.   I finally got into the head of Neurology. I was told, ?it?ll probably get better?, basically saying that they don?t know what they can do and they are at a loss for knowing what this is and why this is happening to people after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine. Doctors don?t have answers and the vaccine companies aren?t offering information to help link these side effects together. The physician told me not to proceed with the second dose of the vaccine due to neurological side effect that I have had. I should benefit from the first dose and it is not safe for me to get the second dose from this side effect.   I was unable to walk for weeks since this began on Feb. 20th. It is just now that this week I am slowly able to move my legs, but they are still very numb and heavy. I haven?t been able to drive or live my normal life. I cannot use stairs, walk long distances, stand for very long periods of time. I am twenty-eight years old and I walk like an eighty year old woman, wobbly.   I have reported my case to CDC, V-SAFE, Moderna. The CDC said they would be in contact with me due to my report of extreme adverse side effects via the V-SAFE report, but I have not heard anything from them as of today.  These are the uncommon side effects that need to be heard and reported. I don?t know why they are being ignored because I have been left without answers and without hope.

                                                12 hours after receiving the second shot of the vaccine I woke up in pain. My pelvis and legs and ankles ached. As well as my arm at the site of injection. My temp was 99.8. I took  one tylenol around 8:30 am. As the day went on it got worse. I took one tylenol at 10:30 am. I was nauseous, my heart was racing, I felt like I was going to pass out, my arms and legs began to tingle. My temperature peaked at 102.5 around 5pm. All of my joints ached severely. It felt like my pelvis had been crushed. Even laying my knees on top of each other while laying on my side was too much pressure on my knee joints. The only other time I&#39;ve felt like this is when I had Influenza A. At 8:30 pm I took one tylenol and one benadryl and was finally able to sleep. A few hours after taking the medication the joint pain had greatly decreased.  In the morning I no longer had a fever.

                                                Patient had appointment at 9:20 am. She was fine during the check in process, while receiving the imz and the 15 mins post vaccination wait time. Approx 10 am she left the IMZ room and about halfway through the store, she fainted. CSM said the fell outside of patient&#39;s room and did not seem to hit her head or neck. 911 wasn&#39;t called because she came to right away. They got her water and a chair. I was brought over approx 10:10 am. I talked with her and she seemed cognitive, lucid and understands who she is, where she is and what happened. She said she waited the 15 min and felt totally fine but then she got up and fell about halfway through store. Approx 10:20 am we brought her over to pharmacy area for more privacy and RPH checked her BP. reported 130/90. I asked patient if she wanted the paramedics called just in case of a head injury. I asked her before palpating her head and neck. She said she felt no pain, no visible bleeding or lacerations, no inflammation or redness and she has full mobility in her neck with no pain. Patient said she did not want paramedics called and instead called her mother in law who lives nearby to see if they can come get her. She is worried about  40 min drive home. Pt overall physically seemed fine. She was just shaken, nervous and embarrassed as she&#39;s never had something like this happen before. She waited for about 20 mins until her father in law came and picked her up. I updated him of the situation and they left together.

Arm was sore but nothing compared to joints (especially hips). Temperature was only slight at 98.7. Headache and body aches, joint pain were severe enough that I was forced to rest and unable to continue daily activities. Ache symptoms quickly dissipated after 48 hours, but a 2 inch diameter welt appeared, slightly raised and itching mildly like a mosquito bite. Welt is still present now, 5 days post-injection.

Hot to the touch, firm and painful swelling that made sleeping difficult. Took Aleve and iced it. 1/6/20 7 AM -  Red area has spread out into a less defined circle about 2in in diameter.  Less swollen and painful but still hot to the touch. 6 PM - Area has spread into tear-drop shape about the size of my palm. Drew a line around the area. Still causes some difficulty sleeping. 1/7/20 - Area is less red and not as painful but I can still feel the original area swollen under the skin and hot to the touch. Spread slowed significantly and mostly stayed in the lines.

                                                This is my second pregnancy and at the time of my vaccination, I was 32 weeks 6 days gestation with an estimated delivery date of 2/15/21.  I tolerated the vaccine well initially with only a very minor sore arm the day after the vaccine. On 12/31/2020 (4 days after vaccination), I felt muscle fatigue around my hips and buttocks as well as significant fatigue. It seemed to improve over the course of the day and was not very noticeable for the next few days. On 1/4/21 (8 days after vaccination), my muscle fatigue in my hips, buttocks, thighs, and hamstrings bilaterally became very significant, preventing me from doing some activities that I had planned. I also had generalized fatigue. On 1/5/21, I had similar symptoms, but the muscle fatigue also began to include my shoulders bilaterally. 1/6/21, the muscle fatigue also included my neck and I was physically exhausted. 1/7/21 I started to note some improvement, and I also saw my OB who did bloodwork but also did suspect a possibly delayed reaction to my vaccine. Today (1/9/21) I am still experiencing muscle fatigue, but it does seem to be improved from several days ago.

On 1/7/2021 I started to feel short of breath and run down. Sinus infection symptoms. I was sent home from work to get a COVID swab. That evening I lost my taste and began to feel achey. Negative test on 1/10/21. Saw urgent care on 1/9/21 for Covid swab and visit. He diagnosed viral and was sure I was positive. On 1/11/21 my energy returned and I wasn?t achey. Congestion and cough. By 1/13/21 felt fine other than lingering wet cough. This morning, 1/14/21 I noticed my arm itched and looked at it and I?ve got a small red rash around the injection sight and tenderness on palpation.

She started to feel better and left. Started to feel bad in the car on the way back to work. Her boss is a dentist and advised her to take Benadryl, which she did.  Traveling to Hospital now.  She has not yet been seen by a physician. Current symptoms are throat constriction, hard time swallowing, and having a hard time concentrating.  She is pale and feels unwell.   Wed Jan 13, 2021 16:09  Followed up with patient.  Patient is currently in the Emergency Room at Hospital. She has so far received steroids and benadryl.   Thurs Jan 14, 2021 08:56 Followed up with the patient again.  She returned home from the first ER visit at 17:30 last night.  About 4 hours after that her heart rate became elevated again (130-140 bpm while lying down) and she was confused, lethargic, and had a HA and backache. She went back to ER last night around 21:30. They gave her more benadryl in IV and toradol for the HA. She is now on PO benadryl every 4 hours for 4 days. Symptoms today include: runny nose, feels like a mild case of flu, HA and backache. Upon awaking this morning, prior to the morning dose of benadryl, her heart rate was a little elevated. She was also told she could alternate Tylenol or ibuprofen prn and use OTC cold remedies but hasn&#39;t needed any. The doctor said she is not a candidate for the next the second vaccine dose.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine on 01/06/2021. Normal pain at the injection site occured with little concern. Pain in armpit began 01/08/2021. I did not think anything of it, believing the pain to be from an ingrown hair caused by shaving or just something with the vaccine. I ignored it to spend time with family. On 01/12/2021 I noticed the pain had not subsided and deepened into the armpit causing pain to radiate from the area when lifting or moving heavy items.  I palpated the area and felt a pea sized lump. It moved freely. I could not locate it again. I continued to palpate into the top of my shoulder and discovered a large lump in the clavicle area. It is painful to apply pressure. I knew these areas to be part of the lymphatic system. I also did research on side effects of the Moderna vaccine but observed most people to have lymph node symptoms for only 24-48 hours within three days of receiving the vaccine then they subside.  I made an appointment that same day, 01/12/2021, with Dr. at clinic to be examined. At first, Dr was dismissive of my symptoms. Dr did physically examine my areas of complaint and scheduled an ultrasound for 01/15/2021 at  Hospital. On 01/13/2021 I noticed the injection site began to ache again. On 01/14/2021 I awoke from a nap at 6pm. I began showering for work when I felt a burning, itchy sensation on my inner left bicep. I observed two red spots on my inner left bicep close to my armpit with a red rash below the two red spots. I palpated the red spots to find a large and slightly smaller lump under the skin corresponding with the red spots. The rash itches. As of 01/15/2021, the ultrasound had to be rescheduled by the hospital as their ultrasound technician cannot make it into work because of a blizzard. I now have two lumps in the clavicle area that alternate swelling and reducing in size. I&#39;ve been taking tylenol every four hours when I&#39;m awake to control the pain. The ones in my clavicle now cause tension in the left side of my neck. I&#39;ve also applied warm compresses on the affected sites. It helps lessen the swelling for a bit but does come back.

No rotation. It started a few hours after receiving the vaccine. By 5pm it was at it&#39;s sorest and locked in position . Not warm to touch. Just painful.  This lasted a total of 3 days until all soreness and full normal movements without discomfort could resume.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

Dizziness and severe nausea started and blood pressure decreased. Trouble concentrating and tingling in hands and feet. I was taken to the Emergency Room and hooked up to an IV and Heart Monitoring. I was given IV Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, and Zofran. I was going to get an injection of Epinephrine but my heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly after the first batch of IV meds and they were concerned that the Epinephrine may have made things worse. I was monitored for 4 hours and then discharged with instructions to take Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for 5 days, Prednisone 60mg every day for 5 days, Pepcid 40mg twice a day for 5 days and given a prescription for an Epi-Pen. I remained very nauseous and dizzy foe the next 48 hours. My injection site became swollen, red, and tender 48 hours after my injection and then re-flared up 11 days after my injection on 01/17/21.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/19/2021 at my place of employment. Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

As the day went on, I began to experience a headache with sever fatigue. Later in the evening, began to have significant body aches, chills, nausea and what felt like a fever. Body hurt so much that it made it difficult to sleep. By next morning, all symptoms had subsided; however, felt weak and tired.

                                                Beginning when I woke up the following morning, I had a very severe headache. It lasted all day until I went to sleep. Figured it was from the vaccine and would be gone the next day. It was still there when I woke up again... and the severe headache and extreme light sensitivity in my eyes lasted for 20 straight days. It kept me from being able to work fully and had to cancel many of my client bookings. I had 2 days of no headaches- felt great- Jan 21st and 22nd. Then again through today it has been there. I can?t describe it very well as it feels like it?s all over and the pain is almost unbearable at times. Even when the headache is lessened/subdued by darkness or ibuprofen, I still feel it strongly in my left temple/behind left eye at all times. I haven?t experienced headaches like this ever before in my life, even though I?ve had random headaches here and there in the past. They have never been there when I wake up in the AM though and sleep has always made them go away previously. Although I can?t imagine this is specifically from the vaccine, it also seems like the timing is so related that I was advised to file a report here.

My right arm was sore the next day (12-30-2020) , which is predicted, but the pain hasn&#39;t gone away. I cannot sleep on my right side, if I do, I cannot lift my arm, it takes a few hours for my arm to &#34;warm up&#34; before I can use it again with minimal pain. The pain is right in the middle of my deltoid, I can palpitate the exact location of the pain.

My left arm was sore, and I started to feel fatigued  After 10 hours I was extremely fatigued, could barely get out of bed. Body aches, my left shoulder blade was very sore. I had chills, but the flushed skin had gone away.   After 16 hours I had a headache, body aches, fatigue, fever of 101.

My partner was with me and said that after I got up I began shaking and he helped me to the ground where I continued to &#34;shiver&#34;, as he called it, for another few seconds before going limp. Once I came to (a few seconds later) I felt very confused at where I was and had a pounding headache and my ears were ringing loudly. It was all I could focus on. After that my partner helped me to bed where he continued to check on me and I slept for 5 hours.

Symptoms include severe myalgia, arthralgia, and constant chills but no fever. Moderate headache and tachycardia (100-130, most likely due to pain level). I had to leave work after about 2 hours d/t symptom severity. Symptoms were only slightly improved with 1gram of Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not history of adverse vaccine reactions. Symptoms resolved about 24 hours after onset.

I startes feeling achey and had chills which made it hard to sleep.  My joints, hips, and knees hurt a lot. 400mg of ibuprofen helped me enough to sleep.  I woke around 8am. Significant muscle aches ans joint pain. Ate breakfast at too ibuprofen at 9:30am.  It didnt help much, I managed to hobble to the grocery store for food late morning.  11:30 am my appetite was low, muscle aches bad. I cant recall if I took ibuprofen. Fatigue soon set in and I slept for a few hours.  Around 630pm,  my chills are back. I feel warm but am afebrile. My body temp is higher than normal (97.8 vs 96.6).    My muscles and joints hurt a lot. I might be getting a headache. I have no appetite. My face feels hot but my body is freezing. All day I have brief bouts of nausea that are mild and fleeting. I only gagges once when a sharp wave hit.

                                                32 weeks pregnant and second dose of Covid vaccine received on 1/21 at 11:00. Flu like symptoms (fever, chills, headache) began 0100 on 1/22 and lasted until about 1300 on 1/23. I had to call out sick from work on 1/22. Worked a 7L shift on 1/24 and at about 2000 noticed a petechial rash on bilateral lower extremities that spread up to lower abdomen. Called on-call L&amp;D Doctor and she advised for me to be assessed at L&amp;D triage. I was then admitted for 4 hours due to my rash and further workup concerning for DIC, thrombocytopenia and/or other possibilities. My petechial rash was very concerning for coagulation disorders and prompted many lab draws to be obtained. My labs showed elevated AST &amp; ALT that were previously normal, low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), protein in urine, elevated alk phos. I was discharged around 0100 for further workup the following day.  On 1/25 I went to clinic to have more labs done per Doctor. 1/26 at about 0830 I was called by my OB Docotor to immediately go back to Labor &amp; Delivery triage to be admitted for what she thought was preeclampsia based on my labs from 1/25 and 1/24. I was again admitted for about 4 hours for monitoring of baby, and myself for preeclampsia. My labs were still elevated and out of range mirroring preeclampsia, but my blood pressure was stable, so I was discharged around 1300. I followed up with labs at clinic on 1/28 and again on 2/2 as well as with home blood pressure monitoring.  My labs on 2/2 showed everything back to normal, causing the doctors involved in my care to believe this was an adverse event due to the moderna covid vaccine.  As a result I missed one day of work, was admitted to the hospital twice, and had 4 days of lab draws which will result in an excess of medical bills.

The second night, and since, I can?t sleep. I have severe restless leg syndrome. My limbs feel heavy, but my legs literally ache to the point into painful when trying to sleep. I felt a bit sluggish the day after, but that has since passed. The restless legs is not letting up.

Vitals were taken 144/78, pulse 125,  4 minutes later 136/74 pulse 100,  5 minutes later 130/82 pulse 80. During this time client continued to tremble. She voiced her anxiety for getting shots and also states she hadn&#39;t even anything yet that day.  She was given 2 large glasses of water which she drank both of them . By 11:00 am she was no longer having any symptoms.

I&#39;m just going to sleep it off and drink lots of water.

                                                Symptoms reported: headache grand mal seizure. Was transferred to ER on 2/10/21. Per staff report ? I was sitting on the couch, and my partner noticed I have having a seizure, he lowered to me to the ground and called the ambulance. My seizure lasted for 1 minute.  When I was in the ER, they gave me 2 bags of fluids, they did an X-ray, CT scan, blood work, and UA, they reported to me that all the result were normal. They did not send me home with any medications. However, they did not clear me to drive. They said that I need to get cleared by a neurologist before I can drive, so that?s why I have not been back to work?

                                                I woke up at approx 2:00am 02/03/2021 with my clothes soaking wet,even my bed sheets. I was chilling, very nauseated, had a headache, diarrhea, heart burn, and a fever of 101, very weak, muscle aches,  very fatigued, and no appetite. These symptoms lasted all day Wednesday 02/03/2021, Thursday 02/04/2021, and Friday 02/05/2021. I was able to eat very little on Thursday. When I woke up on Friday 02/05/2021 I was much more nauseated. I threw up two times Friday morning and was unable to hold my daily medications down. I still had all symptoms that I listed above. I called my endocrinologist Friday morning and he had me come to the infusion clinic to get a bolus of IV fluids and IV steroids....I was able to sleep for 3 hours whenever I came back from the infusion clinic and was able to hold some food down.  101.8 was the highest that I am aware of that my fever was. Saturday 02/06/2021- Monday 02/08/2021 most symptoms had subsided except mild nausea, heartburn and sinus drainage. I was able to return to work on Tuesday 02/09/2021. I had every symptom of COVID-19 other than loss of taste or smell. I was rapid tested and PCR tested on Friday 02/05/2021 and both results were negative.

I started feeling itchy in that area as well. I started getting bumps all over. I took 2 puffs of my Symbicort, Benadryl, and Loratadine. I continued taking the Symbicort and Benadryl. I fell asleep siting up. By 12/24 I could not swallow and it would hurt my chest to breath so I decided to go to the ER.

Headache, dizziness, stomach pain, very tired, but couldn&#39;t sleep for the pain and discomfort. It&#39;s been almost 24 hours and I still feel as terrible as I did this morning.

At that point, my arm became hot to touch and severely itchy. On day 10 the symptoms began to subside and were manageable with tylenol and an antihistamine.   The second dose resulted in a similar reaction to the vaccine as the first dose. The symptoms were worse and included, headaches, exhaustion, muscle and joint pain to the point where I had to call out of work. The body aches felt similar to having the flu. This all occurred the day after the second dose. Two days after the second dose,  I am still tired and have a headache. The body aches are minor.

                                                Arm is swollen sore hot to the touch has a rash.  Pain is radiating down to my hand and up my shoulder. Also no appetite since the vaccine combined with dizzy spells. I?ve been to the ER twice thought it was anxiety but it?s becoming to consistent for anxiety.  Feel like my blood pressure is going up and down.  ER assumed it was anxiety because that?s what I thought it was at first. Normal doctor did virtual visit today and said it all seems to possibly be a reaction to the shot.

                                                I have had a non-stop pressure headache since the second dose. I drink plenty of water. I take Tylenol / Ibuprofen daily. Nothing helps. Laying down makes it worse. It throbs in the roof of my mouth and my nose. It is nauseating. I feel like someone is squeezing my brain. My blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen are fine.   I did reach out to a neurologist about this. I was thought to have IIH over two years ago when I was 70 lbs heavier, but I have not had a symptom since losing weight. Opening pressures and scans show no evidence of it. The headaches I am having now are significantly worse than that was. It hurts down my neck as well.  The headaches began approximately 18 hours after the second dose. I was nauseated. I had chills. I had a temperature. My joints ached. My muscles ached. My body ached I was seen at the hospital twice for the seemingly common and expected side effects. I received IV medication for nausea and plenty of fluids. The headache, however, did not let up. 60ish hours after the second dose and all other symptoms ceased. The headache, however, remained. It persists. The headaches get so intense sometimes that my body feels like it needs to jerk, or twitch. I honestly cannot explain this sensation. I feel like I have to really focus to keep my body from moving impulsively.  It is bothersome, but I am concerned with how long it is lasting, especially with reports of strokes following the vaccination.

I felt body aches, a horrible headache. The next day I had the fever (it went away on the 13th). the body aches were better.  I also had pain in my arm and the symptoms were all back in the evening. On 01/09 I was tested and was negative but on the 20th I was tested again and was positive. I was seen by the Doctor  on the 13th and he prescribed me something that helped me with the fever. He also diagnosed me with pharyngitis. After the 20th, when I was diagnosed positive I also started with shortness of breath and anxiety attacks.

No dyspnea, no angioedema sx, no nausea O 950:  bp 126/80, p 79, o2 sat 98% No distress,  Alert/oriented, slightly anxious appearing Wearing heavy sweatshirt over 2 additional layers, typically wears this sweatshirt for warmth when outside.   HEENT:  Face is flushed/red, no urticaria/hives.  No diaphoresis Mouth:  Lips pink, no edema, Pharynx: no redness,  Left tonsil 4&#43; and right tonsil 2&#43; this is pts baseline and she is scheduled for tonsillectomy in 2 weeks.  No angioedema Lungs: clear,  No wheezing, no stridor anterior and posterior lung fields CV: rrr Skin:  Left arm, some mild redness to area surrounding injection site. patient was observed scratching/rubbing the area a few times during her observation Patient encouraged to remove her heavy outer sweatshirt, given water Given 25 mg of benadryl- patient refused to take 50mg dose.  After sitting with observation for another 20 minutes, she was no longer flushed, or feeling warm.  Stated she was much better.  A:  Localized reaction to Covid vaccine-  Warm feeling most likely related to being overheated vs stress reaction to vaccine vs mild hypersensitivity response P:  Discussed red flag sx to seek treatment for- dyspnea, sensation of obstructed breathing, facial swelling, itchy throat, nausea- will discuss second dose after observation for ongoing sx.

                                                About 5 hours after my shot, I started to have a horrible headache.  As the evening progressed, my arm was extremely sore and a little red around the injection site.  Over the next couple of days I continued to have a headache and also ended up having nausea, muscle soreness, some food started tasting not right (I did not lose taste or smell), cough, &amp; horrible fatigue.   I went to Urgent Care on 1/17/21 due to feeling so poorly and had to miss work that evening.  While at Urgent Care, the doctor provided me with cough medication that also had something in it to help with nausea.  They also said that they would be doing a COVID test since I was having some symptoms and even though it was probably from the shot, they wanted to test anyway.  The test finally came back as negative.  A week after the shot was done, my arm turned horribly red and swollen around the injection site.  Over a few days, the spot on my arm grew a little bit but was just more so irritating that it was itching/hurting.  By week #2 after having the injection, the redness in my arm as well as all of the symptoms, minus the fatigue, went away totally.

                                                Within 2 hours of the shot, I got a headache and started feeling deathly ill.  I felt as if I was going to vomit and nothing I did helped.  My arm got a little red and sore a few hours after the injection.  Over the next few days my arm continued to get even more red &amp; irritated as well as swelling some.  I have photographs of each phase of the irritation; if this is needed, I will gladly send them in to you all.  I had to stay out of work that whole weekend (2/26, 2/27, &amp; 2/28) due to not being able to get out of bed.  I stayed in bed for the majority of the weekend sleeping and was not up moving around more than 8 hours the whole weekend.  Since I was still sick and having issues after so many days, the Medical Control Unit at my job (run by our Fire &amp; Rescue Department) made me get tested on 3/1/21 to make sure it was not COVID.   Later that afternoon, the test came back as negative.  I still was feeling nauseated and fatigued even weeks after the shot.  I have stayed nauseated since then and have also been very tired still.

The patient&#39;s medical history included unspecified teeth work on Dec 2020. Concomitant product used by the patient medroxy progesterone acetate for an unknown indication.   On 15 Feb 2021, the patient received the first dose of their two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) for prophylaxis of COVID 19 infection.  On 15 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events the patients received second dose of their two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) for prophylaxis of COVID 19 infection.  On 15 Mar 2021, on the day of her second dose, the patient felt confused, disoriented and could not even drive herself back to home. On 16 Mar 2021, the patient developed fever and the worst body aches ever she had. The patient noticed that her teeth became sensitive to both cold and hot. The patient stated that her teeth were shocking in the whole mouth and the two teeth which had some work was hurting. The patient felt like something was poking her face almost like her face was paralyzed and felt nauseous. The event facial paralysis was considered medically significant and serious.  The patient tried acetaminophen which did not work and then took ibuprofen which was effective.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events confusion, disorientation, could not drive herself/impaired driving ability, nausea, fever/pyrexia, body aches/general body pain, sensitive teeth/hyperaesthesia teeth, poking in face/facial paralysis were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Nausea and fever are consistent with the vaccine safety profile.

                                                Initially after the vaccine I felt fine, after some time I began to feel very tired, drowsy and had a headache. As time past I started to get cold and began to get the chills. At this time I started taking my temperature which was running about 99-100F.  The chills became worse and I felt colder and sicker. My temperature climbed to 102.1 at which time I took some tylenol. My fever continued to climb to 103.1 within the next hour. The chills and fever lasted about 6-8 hours and then went away and I became very hot. I went to sleep that night after taking more tylenol just in case. The next morning I had severe fatigue, mild nausea  and a headache that stayed with me the rest of the day. I ended up going home from work due to the nausea and migraine type headache as well as intermittent chills that would come and go. By the next day 1/22 I was feeling much better over all. However a mildly painful red spot that was warm to touch appeared on my arm where the injection site was that stayed for the next 48 hours before disappearing.

                                                Exercised following injection. Noticed mildly sore arm within several hours. Much worse that night to the point that I was unable to lift things. Next day it was on/off pain, with very intense pain when it came on to the point that I was unable to lift or do things. On Sunday (next day), pain seemed to radiate from the shoulder up through my left neck to the cranium area. Monday (today) this evening - pain so intense that I was screaming and sobbing. Husband (also MD) had to medicate me as I was laying on bed screaming unable to move or roll over. He had to manually lift me. Significant pain in left neck (trapezius) area on inhales, near injection site. Pain has been getting worse each night.

I started to itch and thought it was just dry skin. Then about 20 minutes later I started to get mild hives. I took Benadryl and that calmed it down. When I woke up the next day the itching went away and I just felt pretty fatigued throughout the day.

About 1am I got a fever but was already taking started tylenol and motrin because I developed a headache also.  The fever went as high as 101.2.  On Tuesday I woke at 2am soaked in sweat and the fever had broke.  Later that day the fever returned at 100.5 but broke on its on.  By Saturday I woke up again with SOB and super cold.  Fever had returned at 101 so I went to Urgent Care  because the fever just kept returning.  A chest xray was done and it showed my lungs were really inflammed.  The fever returned later but went away.  The SOB is still here.  And on  1/19 I got the same feeling with SOB, 101.1 fever and felt awful all over again. So I visited with my PCP and another chest Xray and blood work was done again.  The chest xray showed normal but was started on a Flovent enhaler to help with the breathing and SOB.

I fell asleep and woke up about 11:30pm with a 103.4 fever so I stayed awake a little and took ibuprofen and tylenol throughout the night.  When I woke the next morning the fever was 101 but went down to like 99 later that evening.  The fever finally broke about 11am the next day but returned later  that day for a little while.   I was so tired  I slept like a solid day and woke up yesterday feeling sluggish and developed another 100.3 fever last night, took motrin and I feel better today.

                                                the morning following the second dose of the vaccine I awoke with a terrible headache, felt nauseated all day (didn&#39;t vomit), and felt exhausted. I had to take the day off work and slept most of the day.  I also had terrible muscular pain at the sight of the injection (L deltoid).  Tylenol helped with the arm pain. I had absolutely no side effects with the first dose.

                                                Body aches started 10 hours after 2nd COVID vaccine dose, but it was unclear if this was muscle soreness related to exercise. Slept poorly and awoke around 6 AM with distinct flu-like body aches and pounding headache, as well as sweatiness and feeling hot.  Took temperature at 9 AM and found no fever, but by this time the sweats had stopped. Took two ibuprofen 200 mg each at 7:15 am and symptoms reduced.  Felt weak all day and headache persisted, took ibuprofen twice more.  The following morning, about 45 hours after vaccine, awoke again with mild headache and nausea. Didn&#39;t vomit but nausea and weakness persist and haven&#39;t alleviated yet, I am submitting this at 11:30 AM, 50 hours after vaccine.

Patient was placed on prednisone as pretreatment for second dose. She took the first dose of prednisone on 1/28/2021. Received the second vaccination on 12/29/2021. Patient called ED nursing station one day after (1/30/21) receiving the second vaccine dose stating she had a fever of 102 and did not feel well. She treated it at home with ibuprofen and Tylenol. Her last dose of prednisone was on 01/30/2021. She went to work on 02/01/2021. Staff said they tried talking to her but it was like she was not hearing them. Shortly after she was found unresponsive in the bathroom. She was brought to the ED. She was responsive to voice but was aphasic and had left sided deficits. In  past records, she has had episodes of neurological symptoms that were unexplainable. Unable to obtain an accurate history on her due to aphasia so it is unknown what this could have actually started from. Reporting due to previous reaction to vaccine and recentness of second dose in relation to this incident. Did try Keppra to cover for possible seizure. Consulted with transferring physician and she is not a candidate for TPA.  She was transferred out to a facility with higher level of care.  During time in this ED, neurological symptoms did not improve.

I took a nap and woke up around 6pm soaked in sweat, with muscle aches, and a fever of 99. My fever never got above 100.8. The body aches were the worst part. It was extremely difficult to get comfortable. I did take Tylenol and Ibuprofen and it didn?t seem to help the body aches. It did however help keep the fever at bay.  I went to sleep that evening at 11:00pm. I woke up in the middle of the night around 2am, and all symptoms have resolved except for feeling extremely hot. The rash has gotten better but has not fully resolved.

At approximately 12:30 at night, I woke up due to the pain I was feeling all over my body (in particular in my joints and lower back). I also have a severe headache. At approximately 2:30am I experienced nausea and some vomiting followed by chills without fever. The headache, body aches, and extreme exhaustion continued until approximately 9pm the day after the shot. Two days later, almost all symptoms were gone (I still felt tired). I had a small red spot at the injection site that lasted 2 days but the injection site pain was way worse for the first shot than the second one.

As the day went on started to feel sick with shivers,  fever, nausea and body aches. Very shaky and feverish in the middle of the night and woke up to the bed drenched with sweat. Was close to vomiting.  Recorded my temperature the next day. Highest recorded temp was 100.7. Slight loss of appetite over the course of 2-3 to 2-4.  Arm started itching 2-4 and is still itchy today 2-6, but nothing extreme. Arm still is hard, raised up, tender and warm around injection site. Felt pretty much back to normal upon waking on 2-5.

Woke up at 0300 with nausea and a fever of 100.9. Also had a mild cough, SOB, fatigue, and low appetite.  I called out of work that morning due to illness. I was instructed to get a COVID test that day. Results were negative. All symptoms resolved the following day with the exception of malaise which lasted until 2/5/21.

I couldn?t fall asleep that morning I woke up vomiting. Had a fever of 101.1F. Had a fever all Sunday, got as high as 103.3F.  Had large red rash on the arm of the injection site that is hot to the touch, hard, itchy, and feels like a sunburn when you touch it (burns).  Had really stiff and sore neck and shoulders, hard to move head from side to side. Headache all day Sunday. Couldn?t sleep Sunday night because of pins and needles in joints again. Got up at around 6am vomiting. Fever of 100.1F. Temp lowered to 99.1 by 7:30pm. Tuesday, no headache or vomiting. Slept through the night without any pins and needles pain. No fever, but really stiff and sore neck and shoulders still. Red spot of arm has grown.

These symptoms have subsided, but I have noticed my allergic reactions to wine have become more reactive and sensitive.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Within 8 hours of receiving the 2nd Moderna dose in right upper arm, I was experiencing 9/10 sharp upper arm pain (00:30 2/10/2021). The pain was so intense I almost vomited and was not able to sleep. My range of motion was severely limited, and I had to use my left arm to help move my right arm.  This continued through 2/10/2021. At 1300 took 1000 mg Tylenol and had minor relief for an hour. Tried to stay hydrated and move my right arm as I could, which was still very limited. Woke up at 01:30 early morning 2/11/2021 with intense pain in right upper arm still, not able to sleep. Range of motion continues to be severely limited due to pain. Made an appointment with PCP office first thing. I was concerned I could have SIRVA and wanted to get a medical professional?s opinion. She said it is probably a combination of the Moderna vaccine and a ?bad injection,? meaning the nurse administering my vaccine at facility was very high on my deltoid (almost to my joint). I was told to call back if my arm pain or range of motion worsens.

I conducted a telehealth consultation with a doc who was not my primary care physician and was unfamiliar with my preexisting exercise urticaria condition that occasionally results in light hives but never anaphylaxis for me without Claritin. I declined going to the emergency room since this did not seem that serious and instead took another Claritin to try to get the somewhat worsening hives with no apparent cause to stop without an unnecessarily escalated situation. My throat was slightly itchy but I never became anaphylactic likely due to taking an additional Claritin and not doing anything requiring physical effort for the day beyond telecons from home because I left the office to telework mid morning after I started getting continually slightly worse hives. By evening I was ok and the next day just had a slightly sore throat but was able to work and just started the day with 2 Claritin without any further instance of hives appearing. The day after that I returned to my standard 1 Claritin dose with no ill effects. From this event, it seems clear that a 72 hour downing period from dose 1 is insufficient and should be upped to 96 hours. Prior to this more severe event, I had, on days 2 and 3, a sore left arm at injection site that prevented me from even reasonably lifting my arm to a height sufficient to grab my cell phone off it&#39;s charger while lying in bed without serious discomfort. That level of arm discomfort prevented me from working out or would have prevented me from anything other than light office work involving my vaccine arm. My level of tiredness for the couple days following this dose also required that I take an hour long nap days 1 and 2, and no nap at all is usually the norm for me.

                                                I had a bad headache despite taking a 600mg Ibuprofen at initial onset of this headache,  and felt increasingly overheated and sweaty throughout the night, the headache starting around 1800 day of injection, trouble sleeping and too warm feeling starting closer to 2300, and both headache and overheating lasting through probably about 0300 the following morning. Had I been in the office I would have had to go home ill, and I could not do much but try to rest during this time. The headache through the following day was light and I felt mostly normal by evening.

My body hurts so badly that I could not take my dog outside to use the bathroom. I was hobbling around like I was 80 years old and I?m only 30. I was very emotional and had bursts of crying episodes. I have never experienced body pain like this. I had chills like I had a fever. I slept the whole day into the night.

I experienced headache and fatigue yesterday afternoon and developed back aches at 2030At 2330, I developed fever (100.5) with chills, nausea, diarrhea and faint feeling. I started blacking out while walking to get water and had to kneel down to the floor to prevent myself from passing out. I had tingling in my hands and feet for an hour after. I took ibuprofen at 0145, and fell asleep around 0230. As of now, I feel back to normal, other than sore arm and lingering fatigue. My fever is gone and temp back down to 98.3. I had COVID back in early December, so I expected this type of immune response with the first vaccine dose.

Next day, I couldn&#39;t move because body pain was bad, and I still had chills and shivering and fever and arm rash came back - but it was less itchy and red and less painful as first dose of vaccine - used the cream from first dose and Tylenol. Saturday symptoms started going away. Sunday I woke up with no symptoms.

I was having severe chills - never experienced these kinds of chills before. I took Tylenol. I tried to still go to work but I by was having difficulty breathing and on January 11, I called my primary care Dr. and waited for appt but on January 13, there was no appt available and she told me to go ER. ER  part of medical group/hospital. They told me I might have COVID.  Dr said severe reaction to vaccine. I was still having trouble breathing. I have albuterol inhaler that I use as needed. I had it in my bag and I used that (and I had been using it when I was having trouble breathing but it wasn&#39;t helping like it could have ). They sent me home but I was still having trouble breathing. I had difficulty breathing for about about three days and then it resolved. I followed up with my PCP - video visit after two days after ER and then I had an office visit with her. After two weeks, I felt recovered. Although my right arm still have pain - pinching sharp pain in my arm that comes.

A week later in the afternoon of 18th, i began to have episodes of high heart rate and heart palpitations that would occur randomly without relation to movement. This happened for 24 hours and then disappeared the night of the 19th. I did have to take off work on the 19th because of it. I checked in with my OB ( I am 29 weeks pregnant) and they were not able to think of anything that would be causing the random periods of high heart rate that only lasted 24 hours as I had not been experiencing this previously.

                                                After going to bed, I began to feel tingling in my face. Over the course of an hour the swelling in my right side of my face became so pronounced that my gums were hard affecting the shape of my lips. I got out of bed and brushed my teeth, flossed, mouthwashed and salt water rinsed wondering if I&#39;d maybe gotten something stuck in my teeth and went back to bed. By 1 am I was awoken by feeling like my teeth were going to fall out of my head it kept me up most of the night. I could feel my heart beating in my teeth. By morning, I had a small tear in my gums and the fluid had drained from the gums but there was an excess of tissue kind of hanging off my gums. I had typical mild fever and fatigue on Saturday, I took one dose of motrin. By Sunday the swelling was gone and my mouth felt better but I do continue to have some numbness on my upper right lip.

                                                after the shot, back pain intensified.  Throughout the day, the back pain turned into severe stomach issues.  Took stomach meds (pepto bismol) with no effect.  Went to sleep and woke up in the middle of night with stabbing pain in my stomach. used a heating pad to help me go back to sleep.  the 2nd day my stomach felt as if it was a balloon- extremely bloated and it hurt to breath deep, and stand straight. Took pepto, gas x, and also tried tums- nothing helped.  Today is day 3, and I am back to feeling normal aside from still being very tired, and hazy.  No more stomach issues.  Called doctor to see what I should do today, and was advised to not take the second dose.  Would like a second opinion.

                                                I was 30 &#43; 2 weeks at the time of my second Moderna vaccine. My due date is 4/22/2021. Pregnancy has been uneventful until the second Moderna vaccine. At 3:00 am (14 hours post vaccine), I woke up with the urge to go to the bathroom. I went, urinated, and had a small amount of diarrhea. I laid back down and within 30 second had urge to go again. I repeated this six times back to back. I began to have severe lower abdominal cramping and could not sleep again. I didn&#39;t know if I had to urinate or defecate but the urge was extremely severe and constant. My temperature began to rise, and I was shaking/aching severely. I took 500 mg tylenol at 5:45 am and that kept my temperature around 99.5 (normal 97.5).  Around 7:30 am I called my OB and they told me to go to emergency/labor and delivery ward of the hospital. At this time, my diarrhea and urge to defecate to stop and it turned to a constant urge to urinate with near constant, severe, lower abdominal cramping. At the labor and delivery ward, they monitored the baby (stable and moving the whole time), did a fetal fibronectin (normal), did a CBC (normal except preexisting mild anemia), and a urinalysis (normal). Hospital determined I was not in labor and did not have UTI so they sent me home. I continued to have temperature raises (up to 100.4 but always took tylenol at this point), severe lethargy, no appetite, severe abdominal cramping, constant urge to urinate, severe shaking, etc. until approximately 8 or 9 pm that evening (32 hours post vaccine). Everything except the constant urge to urinate resolved. Three days post vaccine (evening of 2/15/2021), I began to urinate large blood clots. I scheduled an appointment with my OB for a repeat urinalysis and urine culture. I had the appointment on 2/16/2021 and the only abnormality was hematuria. Urine culture was negative. Doctor prescribed 7 days of antibiotics just in case (while waiting for urine culture). My symptoms finally resolved on 2/19/2021 (7 days after vaccination), with slow improvement after urinating the large blood clots. I have not had any symptoms since then and my baby appears healthy still in utero. I have no history of UTIs.

I kept saying i needed to go home, so he called an uber to my apartment. Nose was running, blurry vision, unable to walk alone when uber came to pick me and partner up. Kept seeing black and white stars when trying to cross the road to uber. Once I got home, I had watery stool in my underwear and had to stay on toilet for 30 minutes for watery stool to pass. Then kept alternating between feeling cold and hot while under blankets. Slept for 5 hours. Then felt fine. On Sunday, slept for about 15 hours - 18 hours. Throat kept hurting. Today, Monday, feel better but throat feels like there is a lump in it.

After the migraine resolved, patient experienced extreme anxiety (likely panic attack) accompanying by uncontrollable shaking of both legs and loud crying producing tears. Prescription medications were taken on schedule, but the vaccination event may have triggered breakthrough anxiety and/or feeling of helplessness ~36 hours after vaccine received.

                                                I initially developed a painful injection site, which was to be expected. A few days post injection I then developed a rash directly over the injection site which was roughly 1 inch x 2 inches in diameter. More than a month later, I noticed the return of mild soreness at my injection site. While examining the site, I felt and visualized an obvious depression in my arm, also about 1 in x 2 inches in diameter, which appears to be muscle atrophy.

The area around the injection site was swollen, red, and painful to touch. I fell over on my way to the toilet due to extreme dizziness. I had three hours of diarrhea, and then took pepto bismal and bennydryl. Those remedies worked and my symptoms subsided and I was able to fall back asleep by 4am. In the morning I felt normal, besides some remaining pain and redness surrounding the injection site.

                                                Presumed right arm muscle injury.  Several hours after the injection my arm was extremely sore and painful. The joint was painful as well. No redness or swelling. It was tender to touch. I was having difficulty reaching my arm up or moving it upward. Ex: it hurt to lift my hand to touch my face.  I also couldn?t let it fall. If I got my arm above my head I would have to assist it down. I couldn?t sleep that night because of the pain. I was having trouble with pushing movements in that arm. And also letting it hang dependently (like letting my arm hang when I hinged forward). I started taking Motrin 24 hours after the injection. Motrin helped, so I took it Friday and Saturday. Sunday, my arm felt 99% back to normal.  Monday and Tuesday I didn?t notice anything.   Wednesday  morning I woke up with the same pain again and difficulty moving my arm. Wednesday night, I couldn?t sleep again because of the pain/couldn?t get my arm in a comfortable position. I?m taking Motrin, with not as much relief as before. I?ve applied heat and I?ve tried to stretch it as well.   The only way i really know how to describe it? is that it feels as if my deltoid was injured. And my other muscles are fine. It?s hindering my movement in that arm. It is again, tender to touch my deltoid area. The tightness has extended in to my shoulder and neck. It has now been 8 days since my vaccination.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the first dose of moderna vaccine on my right arm, my arm felt numb and tingly.  My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

                                                10:47a went into a room to wait for 15 minutes directly after the injection. Began to feel somewhat dizzy right afterwards. Continued back to my office. Informed my supervisor that I was feeling dizzy but informed him that I had a couple bites of oatmeal, and a few cups of coffee and was going to try and eat something and hydrate and I?m sure I would feel better. I went back to work for about an hour (I work at a desk). For about an hour I continued to feel dizzy and noticed I was cloudy and was staring off. After an hour I really became dizzy and walked to my supervisors office and informed him. It felt as though I was walking on the moon to get to his office. I also felt like I had a uti. I sat down in his office and informed him of what happened. As I was talking to him I began to pass out. I did not go out the whole way but he began speaking to me more. After feeling a little better I walked back over to my office. I felt waves of dizziness and being hot and cold. My husband came and picked me up around 1:30p from work. I felt better after getting in the car and going home. Once I was home I ate and had began to feel better. Around 6:00p I began to go through another wave and was experiencing body aches, hot and cold sweats, loss of appetite, tingling all over my body but mostly in my legs and feet. At that point I went in and laid down in bed for the rest of the night. Probably around 9:00p I began to feel better. I attempted to fall asleep around 11:00p but when I closed my eyes I felt like they were racing back and forth. So I got back up and watched something in tv until I fell asleep maybe about 30 minutes later. I woke up the next morning around 8:45a. I tossed and turned most of the night, however I felt better. It was like I had the flu for a few days and on the last day I felt better but was under the weather. At this point in the morning I was fatigued. I was able to perform some tasks around the house.  I then laid back down in bed for a few hours because I was beginning to feel dizzy and was experiencing hot and cold sweats. After a few hours I got up from bed and performed a few more tasks around the house. Then was able to sit down on the couch and watch some tv. At this point I?m still expediting tingling in my body at times. Still a little dizzy but able to focus and hot and cold sweats.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

                                                Developed severe itching starting on my forearms overnight on Thursday going into Friday that week after I received the vaccine. The itching progressed to my stomach/trunk and back. The more I itched, the itching worsened and pink bumps would immediately appear. The left side by my rib and over my left breast were the worst impacted. The bumps later appeared to join. I went to the ER that Saturday 1/9/21 after two doses of Benadryl didn?t help. I was prescribed oral antibiotics starting at 60mg a day for two days, then tapered down 10mg every 10 days. I?m currently on day 1 of 20mg. Also took Benadryl as the itching was keeping me from sleeping. I was also prescribed clobetasol cream to administer twice a day. Symptoms have markedly improved. The rash is now the same feeling as my skin, not bumpy. Hyperpigmentation remains. I?m being followed by my dermatologist whom I saw Monday 1/11/21. She performed a punch skin biopsy.

On the 10th day, I noticed it was getting worse and some of the spots were an itchy/burning feeling (it woke me up at night). On the 11th day, I went to the doctor and was prescribed oral prednisone (60 mg x 3 days, 40 mg x 3 days. 20 mg x 3 days, 10 mg x 4 days), hydroxyzine PRN for itching, and triamcinolone ointment. The rash started improving after 2 days on prednisone and I only used the ointment and hydroxyzine for 2 days.

Pt also mentioned to both intern and I that she is a hypochondriac. She got her IM vaccination and sat down for 15 minutes as we monitored her. After her 15 minutes of sitting down in pharmacy area and being monitored by our intern and pharmacist, they asked how she&#39;s doing. Pt expressed she felt fine but had a dry mouth, and the intern told her to call 911 immediately if any shortness of breath occurred, but patient felt fine and left. About 25 minutes later she returned and expressed that she had a metallic taste in her mouth and was anxious about the shot. We asked her to sit down so we can monitor her further and she did. Five minutes later she expressed tongue swollen a little and a little difficulty swallowing but had no trouble breathing. At that time pharmacy intern and I (pharmacist) decided to give the epipen injection and patient agreed. We had the patient sit down for another 30 minutes as we monitored her. Minutes later, pt started to feel better as we continuously monitored her. During this time patient requested water due to dry mouth. We handed her a bottle of water but asked her to please sip and not take big gulps. After 30 minutes patient felt better. No swollen tongue, no difficulty swallowing or breathing and anxiety had been relieved. Patient was notified by pharmacy to call MD to let him know of reaction and was also told to call 911 immediately if have any further reaction. PT felt comfortable to leave at this point.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 10:45a, I then went next door to be monitored for 15 minutes. Within a few minutes, I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I waited out the 15 minutes and went back to my office. When I got into my office I still felt lightheaded and I informed my supervisor. I explained to him that I was going to try and eat something and drink some water and I would feel better. I went into my office and continued to work for the next hour. After that hour, I began to feel very dizzy and &#34;out of it&#34; as I almost didn&#39;t know where I was at. I went to speak to my supervisor and I sat down in his office where I almost fainted. He took me back to my office where I sat with another co-worker. Duri time, I continued to feel light headed, although it came in waves. My husband drove me home, I showered, ate something and was feeling better. Around 6:00p, I began to feel lightheaded again and began to experience body aches, hot and cold flashes that would come in waves. Saturday morning, I woke up feeling better, but around 10:00a I began to experience the same symptoms. I laid down for a few hours that would get up and attempt tasks around the house, then I would  ended up back in bed at 6:00p with the same symptoms again. I did meet virtually with a doctor and she explained to me to wait it out. On Monday, I met with my pcp and she informed me of the same, that these symptoms would eventually go away. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the only symptom that remained was the dizziness. At times, I still will feel dizzy for instance Saturday morning I woke up and felt pretty dizzy throughout the day.

Pain, swelling, redness, and toughness began to dissipate around Day 5 and was markedly improved by Day 8 when I completely returned to normal activities.  Additionally, the first day after the vaccination, I experienced muscle aches/pains and severe generalized fatigue that almost made me call out from work. This fatigue and muscle pain was very strong for ~72 hours after the vaccination. However, I was still able to go to work, though my productivity was not the same given the amount of fatigue I experienced and the inability to utilize my right arm to the same degree I would during a normal work day.

Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

No relief with Excedrin. Fever broke 1/28 around 7AM All day today (1/28) I have alternated between chills and sweating. Aches are now mostly in my upper left back and hips/thighs. I have a large rash covering my left deltoid, where I received the injection.

                                                Woke up feeling very nauseated. Took a Zofran. While standing to get medication from cabinet my vision went completely black and face cold and clammy. I slowly laid down with feet above heart until it subsided and slowly went back to bed. My galaxy watch says pulse dropped to 40. Normally 60&#39;s. Later in the morning at 7am chills started and migraine with light aura (kind of like the pixels on an old tv). Took asa, tylenol, and drank water to help. Feeling hazy all day.

                                                Fever and chills started around 11 PM.  About 12 hours after receiving the dose.  I took 2 tablets of Tylenol 500 mg.  I still woke up with a fever and had to take another dose.  Every time a fever would break, I would get another fever.  I took about 4 doses of Tylenol about 6 hours apart.  I was also fatigued and slept most of the day.

                                                This was my second COVID vaccine. During the first vaccine, I felt no pain during injection. During this injection, I felt a very sharp pain. The injector told me that she felt my muscle spasm as she put the needle in. Within one hour, my arm got very sore to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it. I am now 6 days later and still have extreme pain in my left arm and have a hard time sleeping due to the discomfort.

                                                After waiting my 15 minutes I got up to leave. I put my children in the vehicle and then called my husband. I noticed the tip and the right side of my tongue was tingly. I felt as if I had a lump in my throat. I looked in the mirror and my tongue was not red or swollen. I stayed in the parking lot and spoke with my husband incase I did have an anaphylactic reaction. My symptoms started getting better and fading around 9:45 AM, so I left the parking lot. I notified the vaccine clinic via text message of the reaction after I had already left the site. They offered me to see a provider, but the symptoms already started to go away, so he advised me to take benadryl when I got to my location.  Once I got to my location benadryl was no longer needed because the symptoms were gone. This was about 45 minutes to an hour after the vaccine was administered.

                                                Around 4 PM I started getting chills. I took Ibuprofen and it was much easier. It started coming back around 7:00 pm. I had super sensitive skin and chills that night and didn&#39;t sleep very much, if at all. I didn&#39;t go to work that day because I still had a fever in the morning. It broke mid-morning but I was nauseous all day and had a headache. I still had a headache the following day and I didn&#39;t want to eat the next day although I wasn&#39;t nauseous. Also on that third day- the redness and swelling started in my arm where the injection site was on the right arm. It was swollen, hot to touch. I called the Dr. again. I got a different doctor than the first dose. She thought it was an allergic reaction. She said to try antihistamines that day but if it didn&#39;t get better she did prescribe a different kind of antibiotic I took the antihistamines that day and it didn&#39;t get any better. So than I took the antibiotic and it got better. It was better by Friday evening.

                                                30 minutes after admin of IM, I developed tingling around the mouth and had a panic attack which I thought may be related to anxiety. However, I got the second shot and tingling around my mouth and tongue continued with some heighted anxiety but no panic attack. Two weeks after the last shot the tingling has continued on and off feeling like neuropathy of the tongue and mouth. It typically last thirty minutes or so and then subsides. This has happened 3 x since getting the second shot 3 weeks ago.

I also experienced cognitive function issues - memory gaps, brain fog, and could not walk a straight line. Those went away after the first week or so. I also had headache, body aches, fever, chills, dehydration, joint pain, and severe fatigue. This affected my daily life for about a week and half.

She stated as she got in to her car and began to drive away she felt her face become &#34;numb and tingly&#34; and returned to the facility right away.

She reported her face felt &#34;numb and tingly.&#34; She denied any SOB or difficulty swallowing at that time. She reported her eyes &#34;feel weird,&#34; but denied any vision changes. She also reported a scratchy throat and reported it sounded like she was &#34;under water.&#34; At 1225 she reported her eyes to be &#34;not that bad anymore.&#34; VS reassessed at 1230. She continued to report no SOB or other symptoms. At 1244 she reported her symptoms to be less or unchanged. Final assessed and this patient reported she felt good to go home. She was given Benadryl PO by pharmacy staff and denied any questions.

Her heart rate sped up (&gt;120) and her blood pressure was elevated (&gt;140). Her oxygen saturation level was normal. She was observed at the vaccination waiting area for 30 minutes, but ultimately moved to the urgent care for additional monitoring and management. After 15 minutes there she was given a dose of epinephrine. She reported relief from her clinical symptoms including abatement of the  flushing, itching, and anxiety. She will take Benadryl at home and consider her Epipen if needed. She will follow-up with me on the increased blood pressure and heart rate

                                                Itching all over the body started about 2 hours after receiving the vaccine ( around 11:30am). At noon, I noticed I was dizzy and weak, and I couldn&#39;t stand up without holding onto something. The itching got worse as the day went on and became intense and painful around 3pm. At that time, I noticed a rash on both arms, my legs and my chest, so I took 25mg of hydroxyzine (prescribed by my doctor) which has been helpful in the past for itching and rashes. Around 7pm, I had hives on my arms and legs, and the itching was getting worse and more painful. I also had intense itching on my face, especially on/around my nose. I took another 25mg of hydroxyzine but the itching wasn&#39;t subsiding and at that point, it was so bad that I couldn&#39;t focus on anything else. At 9pm, I still had hives and itching but also noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and it felt as though my throat was closing up. This continued throughout the night, with it being at its worst between 1-3am on March 12th. I woke up and the rash was gone, but the itchiness is still present and I&#39;m having trouble breathing. I keep choking and gasping for air.

                                                I received my vaccine at 4:09 pm on Thursday, March 11th, 2021. At 4:45 pm I began to get visual abnormalities while driving home in the right quarter of my visual field. It started with perceived motion on the right quarter of my vision that I would compare to the visual effects that occur after staring at an optical illusion , and proceeded to reduced peripheral vision in that side that lasted for about 20 minutes. at 5:00 pm I noticed I was having difficulty reading and typing text messages in my phone, as it felt like I had extreme dyslexia and very low reading comprehension. At 5:35 pm I called my sister, a pharmacy student in Boston, to try to explain my symptoms, but found myself having extreme word aphasia. I could not describe what was happening to me and couldn&#39;t recall family members&#39; names, descriptive words, or the name of my dog. I tried to stay calm while she looked things up and began cooking and listening to a podcast, since my comprehension of spoken words was fine. My headache got worse and I took an ibuprofen by 6:00pm. My boyfriend called me at 6:36 pm to check on me, and I found myself talking fluidly to him on the phone. I called my sister to reassure her and the visual abnormalities and reading and speaking issues were all resolved. I took my temperature at 6:36, and it read 99.9 degrees fahrenheit.

                                                12 Days after the second dose i started breaking out in hives body wide. They have gotten progressively worse to the point that at times i cannot walk/bend at full capacity or have to leave work early. I?m taking Prednisone, Claritin (4x 24hr tablet) and Benadryl to partially control symptoms. I will be applying fo the Xolair shot at the 6 week mark since the OTC medications are not working effectively.

                                                Developed hives on opposite arm shortly after shot (but idiopathic hives are normal for me and it was the wrong arm so I thought nothing of it). Full body aches, especially in legs, from about 6:30pm on 3/13 to midnight of 3/14. Location of shot was warm to the touch, sore, and slightly swollen. Temp was 98.6 F.  After midnight the aches became centered on my legs and became more severe coming in waves every few seconds. Tachycardia. Muscle weakness. Nausea. Teeth began to hurt (from clenching?). Severe dizziness and vertigo starting from 7pm on 3/13 and peaking around midnight. Migraine with visual disturbances beginning at 7pm on 3/13 peaking at about 9pm and lasting at least several hours. Vertigo and migraine seemed related. Former worsened every time the pressure in my head did. Looked like the room lit up briefly every few seconds. My sense of touch felt off - textures felt different than normal and couldn?t feel my back when I touched it. Leg pain began to lessen around 4am, and fully resolved around 7am. Dizziness began to improve around 6am but persisted, albeit to a milder degree, for most of 3/14. Brain fog and sinus pressure from around 7pm 3/13 persisting through the following day. Some nausea throughout 3/14 but less severe than on 3/13. Poor temperature regulation from about 6pm 3/13 to 3pm 3/14. Symptoms became tolerable around 3:30pm on 3/14 and had mostly resolved by evening. Muscle weakness resolved by evening of 3/15. Pressure headache resolved by late morning 3/16.

The next day 2-23-2021 I noticed the left side of my face feeling rather numb and two of my fingers on the left side kinda numb as well. I am still experiencing these symptoms as of today not as severe as before.

                                                On Saturday, February 20, 2021 I received my first dose of Moderna Lot# 024M20A. I was detained for 30 minutes due to having a sulfa allergy and then released. There were no concerns that day. My arm was very sore, which I was aware of could happen for a couple of days and then things seemed to clear up.  Sunday, February 28th, I woke up at 5 in the morning with a severe red, itchy rash that covered my arms, legs, chest, back, and scalp. I took Benadryl every 4 hours until 8pm in which symptoms grew worse and I drove myself to the Emergency Department.  Upon examination, the doctor diagnosed that this was a rash for nonspecific skin eruption. I was administered dexAMETHasone sodium phosphate (PF) (Decadron, EPINEPHrine (Adrenalin), and famotidine (Pepcid) at 10:32 pm. The epinephrine was supposed to relieve symptoms within thirty minutes and was administered into my left upper arm. It did not. They informed me that the steroid they gave me would take an additional 4-6 hours to kick in and would last 2-3 days. After detaining me to observe my body&#39;s reaction to the medicine; I was released approximately at 11:30 pm. They told me to continue taking Benadryl. At the end of the visit my vitals were as following: blood pressure: 113/69, weight 205 lbs, temperature 98.2 degrees F, pulse 91, respiration 18, oxygen saturation 99%.  I was only able to sleep 3 hours that night, wake up off and on due to severe inflammation and horrible itching.  Due to the lack of relief by the provided medication I began taking lukewarm oatmeal baths combined with cool showers every hour to help alleviate the itch. This helped to make the itching less strong but did not alleviate it all together. In between showers (no soap) I applied Calamine lotion and aloe vera lotion on every other rotation. These combined efforts helped to keep me from scratching as much as possible.   I was not able to go to work on Monday (3/1/21). Throughout the day of Monday, I continued to take repeated showers, baths, and apply lotion. I continued to take Benadryl as directed on the package. My rash did not seem to be clearing up and I was just able to make the itching slightly bearable. This continued through the night, where yet again I was only able to sleep 2-3 hours.  On Tuesday morning (3/2/21) I awoke with my back inflamed and hopped immediately into a cold shower. Upon my husband?s examination the rash suddenly had worsened. There were more breakouts of tiny itchy spots everywhere and the itching was unbearable.  As soon as Urgent Care opened at 8:00 am I checked myself in. My primary care physician was unable to secure me an appointment for the day and I couldn?t take it any longer. At this point I was so uncomfortable I started to feel helpless and hopeless.   I was seen by the PA-C at approximately 8:20 am. I informed the doctor that I had not had any changes to my diet, my medications, my laundry detergent, dish soap, body wash, lotions, toothpaste, deodorant, perfume, or any other thing of that nature. I had not been sick this year at all and I had not had any other vaccinations nor traveled outside of the country. Nor have I been quarantined this year because of Covid. I also told about my good friend in. She stated that exactly the same amount of days later after her Covid shot; she had a rash too but her rash disappeared after a couple of days and she did not need medical care for it nor was it itchy. I informed the doctor that the only thing I had that was new to my body was the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. It was the doctor&#39;s opinion that this was an allergic drug rash. The doctor also firmly recommended that I do not get the second dose of the Modern vaccine. He said that there have been credible reports released of delayed reactions such as this and even though there wasn?t a way yet to medically prove it, due to all of the information provided he strongly felt this was a reaction to the vaccine. My rash was so bad that as he lifted my shirt to look at it, even he was appalled.   I was administered methylPREDNISolone sodium succ (PF) (SOLU-Medrol) in the buttocks at 9:03 for treatment. I was also prescribed a predniSONE 50 mg tablet to take once daily with food for the next 8 days. Additionally I was prescribed triamcinolone 0.5% ointment to apply 2-3 times daily as needed for itching relief. I was released at approximately 10 am after an observation period to make sure I did not have a reaction to the methylPREDNISolone sodium succ (PF) (SOLU-Medrol). Upon my release I was given a doctor?s note to not return to work until Thursday 3/4/21. I was told to keep taking Benadryl along with the new medication to treat the rash. Approximately around noon hours later, I noticed an improvement in the rash on my arms. They were less spotty, inflamed and itchy. By 5 pm my legs were improving and were less itchy and spotty as well. I picked up my predniSONE prescription at 5:30 and took 1 tablet by mouth with food at approximately 6pm.  By late evening, the itching on my back, chest, and scalp had decreased by 50% although they were still majorly broken out. I did not take any more oatmeal baths but I did take a cool shower before bed using no soap.   On Wednesday 3/3/21 I awoke at 7 am. I was able to sleep through the night and only woke up twice to reapply aloe vera lotion. My arms and chest were no longer itchy but my back, scalp, shoulders, and behind my knees were still itchy. I was still very broke out on my chest and back but the skin did not appear to be as inflamed. My arms are no longer red and the spots are very tiny and pink. I picked up my triamcinolone 0.5% ointment at 10 am in the morning due to the pharmacy needing to order it. At approximately 11:30 am I canceled my 2nd dose appointment with that was scheduled for Friday, March 19th at 1:50 pm.   Thursday 3/4/21 I returned to work. I found myself to be very weak and very shaky if I stood for any amount of time. I had to work with students from my rolling chair, scooting around the classroom.  Sunday 3/7/21 I seem to have my strength back and am no longer shaky when I am trying to do daily tasks.  Thursday 3/11/21 It?s a week later and the bumps are finally  mostly cleared up. Half a dozen remain on my shoulders and have turned into pus filled bumps almost like pimples.   Thursday 3/25/21 All traces of the bumps are gone from my arms, legs, chest, and back. Only a couple of them remain now appearing to have turned into ?pimples?. My doctor prescribed me a steroid cream to help get rid of the remaining bumps.

I was unable to work or perform tasks around the house for almost a week. Took Tylenol for headache. Symptoms lasted longer than 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

The vaccinating pharmacist checked the patient and she said her lips were tingling/numb. The vaccinating pharmacist came and got me in the pharmacy. I talked to patient, she said her breathing was fine but felt like she was floating. She began to become incoherent and at that point we got her on the floor and called 911. I did not talk to the EMTs. They transported the patient out of the waiting room.  We reached out to patient after she returned home she is feeling better and may of just had a panic attack. She is making an appointment with her primary care provider.

I had extreme fatigue to where I couldn&#39;t get off of the floor because I was so weak. My heart rate was super high. I felt overall really miserable for a long time and I was seen that morning. I slept like 18 hours the next day. The following day, 30th, missed work. I was tired. No more vomiting, fever and no more diarrhea, but still had body aches and chills and still very tired. Everything slowly started getting better and I was able to work on the 31st. I developed a headache and body aches for a while. My arm was also sore.

                                                Initially after vaccine within an hour I felt fatigue(drained within 1 hour of receiving vaccine). Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine I was having fever, chills, body aches, nausea, and vomiting, and diarrhea and dizziness and weakness and heart palpitations(probably related to dehydration). Symptoms remained for 3 days. Unable to hold down anything. Felt like I had covid all over again just without the respiratory issues and loss of taste and smell. Arm was very sore almost like a deep bone bruise. Brain fog developed again like after initially recovering from covid as did the fatigue. Still having lingering fatigue and now carpal tunnel like symptoms in both hands, slight weakness and numbness at times in right upper arm where vaccine was given. Reported event to Pharmacist to administered the vaccine and the CDC.

                                                Face swelling and redness with lip tingling and tongue tingling later after eating a few bites of a home prepared meal that has been eaten several times before. Started eating around 7 pm, have picture of red and swelling face at 7:11 pm. Contents of meal were shrimp, homemade egg noodles, chicken stock, pork, and romaine.  No breathing problems and felt fine besides face warm ness and some anxiety over possibly developing a new allergy, as these symptoms were similar to my adult onset allergies to oysters in 2011. Sought remote care at 7:41, spoke to RN over phone who recommended a video visit, then after video visit was recommended to go to urgent care. Arrived at Urgent Care around 8:50 PM.   Had a steroid shot of solumedrol 125 mg to IM the left arm around 9 pm, then took some Benadryl and famotidine at urgent care. Picked up prescriptions for famotidine 7 days, prednisone 4 days, and Benadryl as needed.  Taking medications now with careful watching of potentially allergic reaction provoking foods such as shrimp, fish, nuts, and wheat.

I asked her if she was short of breath and she denied. I asked her if she wanted  benadryl or epi and she declined but agreed to me calling 911. I  told patient that if she started to feel short of breath then I was going to give her epi. No medication was given to patient EMS arrived within 5 minutes and checked her out. They said she was not having an allergic reaction and asked if she wanted to go to ER but she declined. They advised that is she started to feel short of breath or tightness in the chest to immediately go to ER. The patient ended up leaving the store and was fine.

Got shortness of breath, the bad muscle ache, the loss of smell and taste; coughing, sore throat, headache; fever. I still have headaches and I still have some congestion sometimes. It is getting better but my sense of smell and taste aren&#39;t back. Fever, shortness of breath, cough etc lasted 10 days. I was out of work for two weeks. Called the doctor  (January 4th, 2021)- for Oxygen levels - were dropping - they were in the high 80&#39;s - the doctor let me stay home and monitor on my own as I have a nebulizer and inhaler at home.

                                                Within 10 min of injection i went to the 15 min waiting area and began to have a racing heart, feeling of impending doom, timgling in my mouth and throat, dizziness, shaking, sweating. They came in waves or rushes for the next hour. Doctor said i look like im getting oxygen and confirmed i had a racing heart. I took lorazepam to calm myself down and doctors concluded it was a panic attack although i know this was something i had never experienced before.

                                                1/26 evening I developed body aches, lower back pain, nausea, brain fog, fatigue.  On Friday I started my period a week early and it was unusually heavy (this hasn?t happened much since I was a teenager) on Saturday I was bleeding so heavily and had lightheadedness, near syncope, headache, nausea, weakness, fatigue and brain fog. Usually menstrual cycle is not as heavy and doesn?t come early and I don?t experience these types of symptoms (usually just bad cramps and back pain with less heavy bleeding).

The pain often stops me from completing tasks such as taking off my shirt or extending my arm in front of me with any type of weight in it (even a water bottle).

Pain was excruciating the night of vaccine administration causing very limited range of motion to arm and complete inability to sleep. Pain has lessened but continues to remain present. Range of motion continues to be limited. Pain and night continues to inhibit sleep. At time of administration, pt was 4 weeks pregnant with a rough estimated date of delivery as 10/3/2021

By 11pm I had a horrible headache and my body was aching. At midnight I still was feeling horrible and my chest was hurting and I was having difficulty breathing. Checked my heart rate with a pulse ox and it was in the 150?s. I realized had not taken my clonidine pill yet for the evening so I  took it and waited about an hour to hour an a half and my heart rate was still not coming down below 125. I ended up going to the emergency room and getting there by 3am. They immediately started running tests. My heart rate was in the 138 and my blood pressure was 148/100

My work has a protocol related to covid, they will not let me back for a week.

Nausea and vomiting - nausea was on and off starting about 10 hours post vaccine. My body attempted to throw up twice but there was nothing in my body to bring up. The nausea and vomiting could have been from the intensity of the headache but I am unsure.  About 10.5 hours post vaccine I took 1000 mg Tylenol and then an hour after taking Tylenol, I tool 220 mg naproxen sodium. I was unable to fall asleep because the headache was so bad.   I woke up about 5 hours later and knew my fever had broken and the headache was mild. The headache continued on and off (most noticeable in the morning and at night) for about a week post vaccine.

I have had a constant low-grade headache since that gets worse at night.   The first night and that next day, Excedrin Migraine helped. I have been taking Ibuprofen almost every evening since then.

                                                I started to develop a reaction the first evening after receiving the vaccine. My arm was incredibly sore, I had neurological slip ups-i could not think thoughts fully all the way through and my tongue swelled overnight and I woke up to me frantically rubbing my tongue on my back teeth, which is extremely abnormal for myself.  the first night back started aching (I have never felt this pain before now), Developed swollen lymph nodes in my armpit and in my neck and chin on my right side of my body, was extremely lethargic.  and this continued for 3 days when the lymph nodes started to go down, and then an outbreak happened inside the right side of my throat, which is still in place today, seems to be healing now, but continued to get worse for 3 days before starting to heal. I am finally back to a normal level of energy and my mind seems to be working normally again, but my back is still in incredible pain.

                                                I had little appetite after the vaccine. Around 6pm I started to feel cold with no fever. Then around 9/10pm I had chills and low grade fever of 99 degrees F. I took tylenol and went to bed with extra blankets and a heating pad since my body could not get warm. I also felt very nauseous. I woke up around 12am with a fever of 101 and sweating. Took some ibprofen and fell back asleep. My fever broke in the night but when I woke up I felt achy and had a headache. I took ibprofen and my temperature was normal however about an hour or two later I started to get another low grade fever and too tyelnol again.  The fever went away and never came back but I had a slight headache for several hours and was very fatigued all day. The next day I woke up feeling fine.

No illness reported, 11 days later I had a small red spot at injection site that was hard and hot to touch but went away on its own in about 1 week. 2nd shot: I had the vaccine on Friday, Feb. 5, 2021 at 5:05p.m. and had immediate reactions. That night I had a racing heart (which I had with the first vaccine)The next morning, Saturday the 6th, I woke up very sick. Symptoms included total body aches, pounding head, loss of appetite, racing heart, general flu like symptoms. I noticed a large red knot/rash on my arm at injection site. By Sunday the 7th, the symptoms had subsided mostly but the knot/rash was larger. Sunday night the knot/rash was even larger, hard and hot to the touch, the redness has darkened. I went to urgent care and they said it was not an infection since I had no pain (just uncomfortable and slightly itchy) they thought it was an allergic reaction and gave me steroids. Monday the 8th (today) the red rash/knot is less dark and hard but larger/wider in size. I had dizziness, lethargy, racing heart and loss of appetite.  I have not worked since Friday the 5th.

All symptoms lasted from 4 PM on 2/14/2021 until 10:30 PM on 2/15/2021. Some tiredness noted on morning of 2/16/2021, but seemed to improve by early afternoon. Redness still present at the vaccination site and pain when touching site still noted, but all other symptoms have since resolved. Treatment included taking Butal-Acetaminophen-Caffeine and Naproxen, as well as heating pad to site and exercising arm.

                                                At the time of administration of the first does of Moderna vaccine, I was 6 weeks pregnant.  I had confirmed pregnancy with home positive test and missed period. I had an estimated due date of 9/24/2021.  This was my 4th pregnancy. I have had two uncomplicated pregnancies to term. In September 2020 experienced a chemical pregnancy with early pregnancy loss at 5 weeks.  The first 24 hours after 1st dose of vaccine I experienced extreme arm soreness in the arm that was vaccinated,  causing  headache and unable to sleep. After 24 hours I felt &#34;normal&#34;. 2 weeks and 3 days following the first dose of Moderna, I  had a miscarriage. On the night of 2/15/21 I lost the pregnancy with vaginal bleeding, bright red  blood, passing tissue, clots/ sac. I had an uneventful pregnancy up to that point, feeling well as I had with prior pregnancies.

It took up my entire upper arm - the redness day. It was painful to sleep on but I could use it. On the third day of it ( a Wednesday, 13th) - to check in with DR - Telehealth appt - employee health - recommended ibuprofen and ice packs for a few days.

                                                Within seven minutes of vaccine administered, patient cried out that she thought she would pass out. She was lightheaded, arms tingling, felt hot then cold. We had her lay down on the floor and held her feet in the air. Within three minutes of doing this, she felt much better. She sat up on the floor and ate some Chex-mix and drank some water. She stayed thirty  minutes and felt good. She left and we made sure she made it home.

                                                Received the vaccine intramuscularly in right arm at 1:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and muscle soreness began approx. 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Fatigue and headache present by 3:00 PM on 3/3/21. Began hydrating with water and Gatorade at this time. Muscle pain and join soreness present from right shoulder to right hand by 4:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and stiffness in fingers of right hand by 5:00 PM on 3/3/21. Mild congestion, brain fog by 6:00 PM on 3/3/21. Any contact between right arm and other objects or surfaces caused significant pain by 8:00 PM on 3/3/21. Took 800 mg ibuprofin to alleviate pain (pre-existing tolerance to NSAIDs necessitates higher than normal dosages). Swelling of the right arm and hand identified by 9:00 PM on 3/3/21. Swelling was most significant in the hand, and accompanied worsening joint pain and stiffness in the fingers. Applied a cold pack to address swelling (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off). Could not identify these specific side effects in the information available online, took a Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Swelling decreased overnight and was gone by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21. Diarrhea began at 6:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Will continue to hydrate with water and Gatorade. At the time of this report, pain in right arm still present from shoulder to wrist and entire arm is tender to the touch, but pain level has lessened. Pain and stiffness in right side of neck present by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Lymph nodes in right underarm swollen by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and swelling is still present at the time of this report. Will continue with regimen of ibuprofin as needed.  * I am recovering fine at home, but I wanted to log these side effects for data collection purposes. I couldn&#39;t find any information about these side effects online and that really freaked me out, so I hope that writing this report will help people in a similar situation.

                                                I had the first dose (Moderna, Lot 030L20A, Left Arm on 1/31/2021). The same side effect happened for both doses.  I am 18 weeks, 5 day pregnant. Pregnancy is normal, 1 baby, no issues thus far.  During the 24-48 hours post vaccine administration, I have had an increase of depression/self harm thoughts. I was diagnosed with mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder over 15 years ago, but have not experienced a major episode in over 5-7 years and have been able to manage these conditions without medication for over 10 years. With in the time frame given for both shots I have been extremely depressed, angry and had hurtful thoughts. I have done the necessary things to keep myself safe and to curb the thoughts, but I found it more than a coincidence to happen both times after the shot.   Normal side effects that occurred that I did anticipate - Sore arm, overall body fatigue.

During the night that of the 16th early morning 17th I woke up in so much pain from the injection sight to the tips of my fingers and up into my shoulder and beck under arm and right side of my chest. I was in so much pain I couldn&#39;t sleep and had a massive migraine. It has been another almost 12 hours and symptoms persist.

                                                Saturday 3/13 - Moderna shot @10am on L arm. Onset of sx @6pm. Fatigue, irritability, mild body aches   Sunday 3/14 - Upon waking Fatigue and severe body aches. Painful to walk, exert, lift a spoon. Required some assistance with activities of daily living. Nausea. Some improvement around 6pm.   Monday 3/15 - Upon waking Decreased fatigue, body aches resolved, nausea resolved. Soreness and fatigue in carpel tunnel area, feeling as though I had held a heavy phone for too long. Adjusted by keeping off phone during the day. Hand/wrist pain increased in the evening. Noted wrist and hand swelling @8pm. After applying ice around 10:30pm pain became suddenly severe with movement. Suspected ice was somehow a mistake and applied heat. Pain became excruciating. Took tylenol XS to sleep.   Tuesday 3/16 - Upon waking Moderate swelling and complete loss of mobility in both hands and wrists. Shooting pain that knocked the breath out of me. Unable to complete any activities of daily living independently (bathing, toileting, eating). Wore carpel tunnel braces all day. Some improvement in range of motion in the evening, able to open and rest hands semi-flat on an angled surface. R hand demonstrating faster improvement than L. Noted mild red bumps present on both wrists (more on L) and mild-moderate shooting pain from L thumb toward inner elbow, more severe in area closer to elbow. Upon rubbing the area close to elbow noted soreness and bumps under skin when applying mild pressure that aren&#39;t visible to the eye.   Wednesday 3/17 - Upon waking Red bumps resolved. Some improvement in all areas. L hand improvements mildly lagging behind the R. Able to complete activities of daily living with supportive assistance. Increased range of motion and moderate pain. More improvement @5pm. Regained 90% range of motion, shooting pains were mild-moderate.   Thursday 3/18 - Upon waking I have full range of motion. Mild-moderate pain with certain angled movements and levels of exertion. PCP telehealth appt @9am. Diagnosis: adverse reaction to moderna. Suspicion that there may be some connection with the complex migraine (though there was no numbness or tingling present) and to update my neurologist (you!). Recommendation was to report it and monitor sx. If sx not completely resolved in one week referral to othopedic.

Localized back pain severe by afternoon, slightly responsive to ibuprofen. By 4 pm had hives in unusual patterns and places (i.e. quarter sized on left wrist, symmetrically on either side of neck like Frankenstein, and significant swelling of upper lip), itchy and aligned with histamine reaction. Back pain progressed, but mild by second morning. Whole right side of face swollen by morning of 3/25/21. Slowly reduced via ibuprofen and Zyrtec, but still present at time of submission. Odd spikes of intense hunger, and mild cognitive impacts like forgetfulness, distractibility, and some confusion. Tired.

Benadryl was administered and cool rags were applied to patient forehead and legs elevated.  Patient reported feeling better for a couple minutes then everything came back strong. had technician call 911, the EMS squad came and transported her to a local ER for observation.  I spoke with patient later in evening, she reported feeling better and that the ER thinks it was just her, having a panic attack. She reported no other symptoms and was discharged in the afternoon.

                                                8 days after the shot I had an episode of tingling and numbness bilaterally from my feet up to my thighs. I had difficulty walking, a lot of pain and a vibration sensation in my thighs with weakness. I was admitted to the hospital for 3 days and had abnormal neuro reflexes upon admission and severe brain fog, which I have never had before. MRIs and blood work were done in the hospital but they could not determine the cause and the hospital questioned it being from the COVID vaccination and has had me follow up further with specialists to see if there could be any other diagnostic causes. I have followed up with my PCP, 2 neurologists, a rheumatologist, allergist, dermatologist and will be seeing a hematologist.  (I now have joint pains, extreme fatigue, brain fog, peripheral neuropathy--none of which I had prior to the vaccination and thus far conditions outside of the vaccination have not been found. I also got a positive ANA after vaccination (I had negative in the past and my doctors are questioning if the covid vaccination triggered an autoimmune disorder now in me with the joint pain and swelling, fatigue, positive ANA, rashes and pain).  I have been out of work since February due to health impairments and am a healthcare provider myself.

                                                I am writing to you in regards my Moderna adverse reaction. I got your information from a small Facebook group that?s going through the same issues as me. On 1/31/21, I received my first shot of Moderna. I was told to stay 30min because I have a Sulfa allergy. I also received a flu shot 3 weeks prior. After 15 min I started to feel tingling in my face and throat tightness. As time passed, I started to feel like I couldn?t breathe at one point. As I continued to have issues breathing and started getting nauseous and lightheaded, they informed a nurse to look over me. The nurse had a student nurse do my vitals manually. She gives out standard numbers 60 heart rate and 120/80 blood pressure. My normal blood pressure is elevated in 130-140/80-90. I had to be picked up due to feeling unwell. I went home took Tylenol and slept.  The next few weeks I kept feeling zaps of sharp pain in my chest area. On the 12th day after the vaccine, I had a panic attack. The panic attack started with a sharp pain in my neck and when I inhaled it hurt. I got heart palpitations and again felt like I couldn?t breathe. I never suffered from a panic attack, so we called 911. The EMTs came my blood pressure was 200s/100s and elevated heart rate (sorry don?t remember exact numbers). It was suggested I go to the ER since my numbers were high. In the ER I told the doctor about my vaccine incident. They got blood work done and she decided to do a CT scan and X-ray since something was elevated ( I don?t remember what was elevated. I am working on getting that info). My EKG, CT scan and X-ray all came out fine. I was then diagnosed with panic disorder. I was sent home and after a few hours I started to feel an internal tremor.  I describe the tremor as having a cell phone on vibrate its usually is in my lower abdomen to pelvic area. My blood pressure kept spiking up into 180-190/80-100. I kept reaching out for help by going to ER once more, 3 urgent care visits and my primary. No one could help me, and I kept getting labeled as having panic/anxiety disordered. My primary doctor said I could be having adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I just have to wait it out. The internal tremor I feel constantly and sometimes it?s in my chest. I have muscle twitching, tingling in my lower limbs, muscle pain, and blood pressure spikes. I do feel like my symptoms cause anxiety because ill have these spells where I feel adrenaline running through me which will cause anxiousness. My blood pressure is getting better, but I still have spikes and have had another panic attack.  I have been on Lexapro 5mg and gabapentin 300mg 3x a day for 5 weeks. During that time, my symptoms have not improved. I will be getting off the medication soon. I never had any of these issues prior. I don?t drink, smoke or do any drugs besides the medication prescribed.   On 3/30/21, I reached out to my psychiatrist again and went into more detail about everything and she said she believes me about the vaccine side effects.  She recommended I go back to my primary care doctor and ask to be referred to UCSD covid long haulers study to see if they can help me. I wanted to share my information to see if it might be help to your research.  Thank you for your time

I had no anxiety surrounding the receiving of the vaccine nor anxiety about potential side effects. I was standing still and upright at the time of the attack and it lasted appx 30-40 min, subsiding to feelings of heightened anxiety through the remainder of the night. While anxiety and panic attacks have occurred in the past, it is not on a regular basis, nor has either occurred in over 6 months.

Then I got a fever and a feeling of extreme heaviness - like I couldn?t get out of bed, and when I did to get water or go to the bathroom, I was immediately exhausted and incredibly dizzy afterwards. I am able to be up and moving more today, however I still have a fever and extreme cold sweats. My poor partner thought I might have wet the bed my cold sweats were so serious. I had to steady myself a few times walking my kids to their bus stop this morning. I?m afraid to drive to work my ?heaviness feeling? and shakes are so intense. I don?t regret getting vaccinated, but it?s not been fun.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

                                                Around 2 AM, roughly 14 hours after receiving Covid Modena vaccine (1st dose) I woke up in a violent shaking situation.  I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

By the time I received the vaccine it was 1:15pm and by 2:30 I had a throbbing headache (I had a slight headache already before the vaccine). When I got home I took 2 extra strength Tylenol&#39;s and felt fine. At 3:30am that night I had pain and bruising on my left arm which I rolled on in my sleep and the pain woke up me. When I went to turn on my right side I heard a popping noise in my neck and was no longer able to move my neck to my right. I got up scared and started to experience chills, nausea, and dizziness. I went back to bed to try to calm down. I was not able to move my neck at this point or pick up my head off the bed. I called my sist

Was unable to do most daily activities. Extreme fatigue and slept almost all day, also due to fever and pain from body aches/joint pain. Took Tylenol (700mg at 7:30am and 2:30pm) but fevers continued to register between 100.2 and 100.8. Fever was definitely higher at night but temperature unknown. Took Tylenol again at 7:30pm and at this point did not have fever, mostly did not have body aches/joint pain at this time. No symptoms besides tiredness the next morning (1/18/21)  Large red welt appeared at injection site, about 4 inches by 3 inches. Hot to touch, itchy at times, very sore. Still has welt as of 1/19/21.

I began to feel severe flu-like symptoms (hot/cold chills, sensitive skin, headache, dry/scratchy throat, fever dreams) which persisted for several hours during the night. The next day (1/16), the fatigue, headache, and chills persisted (although the chills decreased). I took Dayquil before noon and that seemed to help with the symptoms, and Nyquil at night so I was able to sleep. By the following morning, I still had a mild headache and fatigue but continued to improve. I felt normal again on 1/18.   I also had stiffness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site for 3-4 days.

                                                At about 7:30 pm, I started getting cold chills. I was under 3 heavy blankets with warm clothing and heat packs still shivering.  By 9 pm, body aches had started.  I took a 500 mg tylenol.  The cold chills went away with the tylenol but did nothing for the body aches. At 11:30 pm, I took 200 mg of ibuprofen because my entire body hurt and I was unable to fall asleep or really move much due to the discomfort. The ibuprofen helped reduce the intensity of the body aches but I got very little sleep.  At 6:30 am, the body aches were intense again  and I started getting hot flashes and nausea. My husband called in sick to help care for our 3 young kids.  I took another 200 mg of  ibuprofen  and that reduced the symptoms again. I can now get around the house instead of laying in bed but would not be able to work.  I did not ever have a measurable fever.  I do have a pretty sore arm

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

                                                I woke up lightheaded. I had dizzy spells throughout the entire day, starting at 6AM. I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

                                                Despite having mood disorders, I had achieved stability before the COVID-19 vaccine. About 8 hours after receiving it, my mood crashed. I felt angry, agitated, irritable, and dysphoric. This continued for over 3 days. I felt much worse during nighttime, with symptoms ranging from rage and violent ideation to desire for self-harm and suicidal ideation. I left a message with my psychiatrist. He responded that he hoped my symptoms would lessen the further away from the vaccine I got. The past 2 nights I have started to notice the symptoms subside.

                                                About 8-10 minutes after the injection, my vision got blurry. It was very brief- only a couple minutes long. If it had lasted until the end of my 15 minute post-injection observation period, I would have reported it then, but it didn&#39;t. I decided to include it here, because later in the day, I had another reaction. About 12 hours after the dose -around 7PM- I started getting chills and body aches and abnormally fatigued. The chills were intense almost as soon as they come on. The body aches were mild for the first couple hours and progressed to intense. Both symptoms lasted continuously for about 12 hours, then around 7AM they started to wane. I&#39;m not sure if I should list insomnia as a reaction, but despite how exhausted I felt, I could not sleep. It could have also been just general discomfort that kept me from being able to sleep. Through most of the following day I had mild aches and waves of chills. By the time I went to bed that night (last night at the time of writing this), the symptoms had mostly  cleared and so far have not returned.

                                                My period was scheduled to come 1/14/2021, the day after my 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine.  My periods are very predictable and I am not sexually active. The evening I received the vaccine, twice  I had sharp pains in my uterus. It lasted for a few seconds and went away. It happened one more time in the middle of the night, jolting me out of sleep. My period has not come since I took the shot.  It?s been two weeks. This is very unusual.

                                                I received my second covid vaccine on Monday.  For the two days following the vaccine I felt very fatigue with nausea, 1 episode of vomiting, chills, elevated temps,  muscle and joint pain.  I left work early yesterday due to these s/s.  I also had some numbness to my left hand.  I had my vaccine given in my left deltoid.  The numbness in my left hand has resolved today, but now I am having right arm/hand,  heaviness, numbness with limited ROM.  It has progressively worsen throughout the day to the point that my hand is very shaky and I am starting to not have full control.  My handwriting has started to become sloppy and I am having trouble drawing up vaccines.  You can phone follow up, or you can reply via email.

My fever reduced to 99 degrees around 0730am and remained as such through the following day (1/28/21) as the chills, nausea, and cold sweats gradually faded away. I was deeply fatigued and unable to work.  Sometime mid afternoon I developed a crippling frontal headache That worsened in the light and standing. I have no history of headaches or migraines. I was still repulsed by the thought of eating. I took acetaminophen with a protein shake and it helped the headache And residual body aches enough for me to sleep. 1/29/21 I awoke still fatigued  with a minor headache.   I am a pro athlete with no underlying conditions. I have had my flu shot yearly with no side effects. I am extremely fit and eat a healthy balanced diet, maintain a healthy athletic weight, sleep 7-8 hours a night, do not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use recreational drugs. I was absolutely floored at how sick this shot made me.

I took a Tylenol PM to sleep, but didn?t sleep well at all. On the second day, in the morning when I woke up the arm where the injection was administered was extremely sore and I couldn?t lift it. It felt almost numb, but I was in pain. I took Advil late morning and felt better but still couldn?t lift my arm above my chest. Around 4-5pm that evening, I was feeling tightness in my chest. Felt like something heavy was sitting on top of me and I developed a headache at this point. I felt super tired so I took an Advil PM to comfortably take a nap. When I woke up I still had a headache and chest tightness. At this point my body started to feel sore. The next day, 1/31/21, I am still feeling fatigued. Headache did not go away or subside. My body still feels sore especially my back, top area (I would say around shoulder blades). I still have chest tightness and had a fever of 101 today. I have taken an Advil for headache and body soreness - after an hour of taking Advil, still feeling the same.

                                                Severe muscle tension in cramping in right arm two hours after injection. In less than 24 hours the muscle cramping had extended up my neck into my face, specifically the masseter muscle of my jaw.  I also experienced some numbness on the right side of my face (unfortunately the locked masseter muscle was very noticeable). I was not able to sleep or eat when the pain built; hot and cold temperatures were highly reactive when trying to consume anything.   I saw my dentist for an emergency medical appointment on Monday 1/25/2021 with the dentist. I saw Dr. who prescribed a muscle relaxer and assisted me in identifying the masseter muscle as the source of pain and tension as well as exercises that could be done to treat the reaction. While there is no definitive evidence that the muscle cramping is directly related to the COVID vaccine, it is reasonable to suspect that it may have impacted the muscle tension and resulting locked masseter muscle that required clinical intervention. The muscle relaxer was somewhat helpful, however for my body and biochemistry, taking 400mg of ibruprofen every 6-8 hours was much more successful in treating the symptoms.

                                                Beginning the day after the shot I started with vaginal swelling which wasn?t terrible that day but by the second day (Thursday) it was severe. I worked that entire day not realizing just how bad it was but by the end of the day I could barely walk out to my car. I was in so much pain and so swollen that by the next day I could not do anything. I went to my GYN first thing that morning (Friday) where they swabbed to send for various tests which have all come back negative so far.  I had to return for a re-culture that had come back inconclusive and we are still waiting on those results. I have been given an antibiotic and prednisone which still have not resolved the swelling. I am about 50% resolved and almost 2 weeks later at this point but there is still significant internal swelling which is uncomfortable but not hindering me from working. I was out of work for an entire week and not able to do anything for that entire timeframe.

                                                Several hours after vaccine administration, I began to get a headache. That headache intensified over the next 24-36 hours. A severe headache resulted with a painful, stiff neck, occasional fever, occasional diarrhea, confusion, vision changes, and increased imbalance. These symptoms lasted for about 1 week before I sought medical treatment at a virtual urgent care appointment on 1/5/21. They referred me to an in-person urgent care facility that day. At that facility, they said my symptoms were very concerning and said I needed to seek immediate medical assistance at the ED and offered to call me an ambulance. My husband drove me to the ED from the urgent care facility. At the ED, they treated me with a migraine work-up but eventually discharged me with instructions to follow-up as I was &#34;diagnostically unclear&#34; at discharge. After a week, my symptoms had not improved at all and so my previous ED physician suggested that I return to the ED (after being unable to get care in a timely manner in an outpatient setting). At the ED on 1/12/21, they again treated me with a migraine workup but also conducted a CT scan and a COVID test. When both tests came back negative, they conducted a lumbar puncture procedure. Those results came back positive for viral meningitis. As I had no other illness or known exposure to any other virus at that time - and given the timeframe of the vaccine administration - my care team concluded that this was a rare reaction to the COVID vaccine. I was discharged with instructions to follow up with my PCP and a neurologist. My follow-up neurology consult is scheduled for 2/19/21.

                                                The patient stated that she had joint pain that began the day after she received the first dose of the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine and that she particularly had weak knees. She also stated that she had insomnia and was up all night. She also stated that she had a low-grade fever 02/02/21-02/03/2021.  By 02/04/2021 she stated that she was feeling better and that her symptoms were more mild. Today (02/10/2021) she states that she feels better but that she has had some increased pain and insomnia; she estimates, though, that these symtoms that she mentioned today are due to recent medication changes.

                                                I was vaccinated on the 14th of January. Initially I just had a sore arm and fatigue on the 15th. The night of the 17th I was working out and had a vasovagal type episode (never had this before). By the morning of the 18th I was fatigued and had a cough that can be described as a bronchial spasm type cough, I assumed that it had to do with the work out and the episode the night before. I woke up on the 19th very sick. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea. Because I am a healthcare provider I was able to go strait to the hospital and get an expedited COVID Test. By that afternoon I had my test back with positive results. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed. I had extreme headache, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath if I moved around at all, cough, loss of taste and smell, nausea, abdominal px, diarrhea, lac of apatite, extrema &#34;brain fog&#34;. These symptoms continued for about a week. Most of the symptoms subsided after that time except for the fatigue off and on and a continuous cough that as of 2/11/2021 has still not gone away.

During 1st 24 hours of having the 2nd dose I had chills, fever, body aches, sleeplessness. Symptoms subsided within 24-48 hours with the arm soreness taking about a week to completely go away.   A week and a half after receiving the 2nd dose I noticed a lump on my neck, lower middle near the collarbone. It is significantly pronounced. I saw my primary doctor for an already scheduled physical and she said I was fighting off an infection and it was normal. I mentioned I had the COVID vaccine and she said it isn&#39;t uncommon to see the lymph node swell after vaccination and it should go away in a couple of weeks. I wanted to report this because it can freak people out to see a lump in their neck so long after being vaccinated without any other symptoms. We need to list this as a possible side effect on the vaccine information. I feel completely fine except my neck is a little tender/sore from the swollen lymph node.

Woke up with chills, severe body aches and bone pain, severe left arm pain, headache, nausea at 11pm. Felt worst I had ever felt in my life. Couldn?t get out of bed due to severe pain. Temp max 101. Lasted until 1pm next day and then resolved however felt tired for several days after and had episodes of tachycardia and pSVT for 2days after (h/o POTS and pSVT and think dehydration from episode with nausea and fever probably caused that)

                                                Around 10:00-11:00 pm on 03/02/2021, I woke up with extreme soreness on left arm bicep (where injection was received and all over bicep). I kept waking up about every hour will chills and sweats as well as muscle and joint aches. From this time until approximately 7am, I used the restroom and urinated approximately 5 times. On an average night, I may use the restroom/urinate once at the most around 5-6AM.  This is usually only because the dog wakes me up to let her out at that time. At approximately 4am I took 40 mg (two 20mg pills) of DextroAmp-Amphet.  At 7am I attempted to shower for work. During my shower I couldn?t barely lift my arm to wash with out severe soreness. I also became very dizzy and nauseous. I had to get out and sit in front of the toilet because I thought I would vomit. Fortunately I did not. I then proceeded to crawl back into bed and call in to work (notifying them I was too sick to come in). I had extreme chills, muscle aches, and joint pain. I began to cry from hurting so bad. At approximately 7:45 I took 400mg of ibuprofen to help relieve symptoms. My body felt feverish (hot/clammy).  Around 8am I mustered up the strength to get dressed due to extreme chills. I then proceeded to eat a banana, peach yogurt, and a blueberry Benvita breakfast bar package with 4 wafers.  I then took a nap and have been laying in bed ever since until approximately 4:30 PM (with the exception of getup twice to urinate). My body hurt so bad, I barely moved. At approximately 4:30PM I got up to get orange juice and take 600 mg of ibuprofen.

                                                A huge rash under the injection site began to develop 7 days after the 1st dose.  It began as 2 bumps around the injection site that were hard, warm, and a little pink. Then a rash became hotter to the touch as the days progressed. It was raised, hot to the touch and sensitive. It was painful and uncomfortable to have; it caused me to not be able to sleep at night. I emailed my PCP, and she recommended: &#34;we are recommending taking Benadryl, it can be oral or the cream and just take Tylenol if needed. Sometimes using a warm compress on the site helps as well.&#34; I took Tylenol in the morning and Benadryl at night to help with the rash. I would also use anti-itch ointment to help with the discomfort. The rash lasted for another 5 days before the symptoms started to subside. I felt fatigue and week for roughly two weeks after the 1st dose.

While I  do not have any known immune deficiencies, I do have pain problems from my  time in the military, frequent migraines and two discectomy/laminectomys in 2014.  Everything hurt, like I couldn&#39;t move or touch anything, my cats would step on  me while I was in bed and I would cry. This episode lasted till 0230 in the morning, after the 2nd shot that pain episdone lasted from 0730 pm to 1030 the next day.  Never have I ever  have felt such pain and now I have had  two episodes.

Four days later at midnight I was at work and my heart rate was 140-150 and was very SOB and chest tightness,lightheaded and numbness/tingling of the mouth and had to be wheeled down by wheelchair to the ER. Then they drew my labs and potassium was 2.9. I have been in the ER three times since the vaccine. Since I have had the vaccine my blood pressure goes up very high for me 168/105,170/100,186/96,163,103 and I get chest tightness,SOB and lightheaded on and off also very dry mouth at times still. Heart starts racing out of now where and my normal heart rate is 60-80 and I have been very tachy since the vaccine.

Stated she felt fine prior to getting her vaccine.  She stated she felt much better when she left our Health Unit and returned to work.

I tried treat at home with Benadryl but it was not helping. I called the virtual health. NP recommended getting a steroid shot. I could not get as the clinic was closing. So I talked to a provider that I work with and she was able to prescribe a steroid and hydroxyzine. My hives waned but didn&#39;t go away. Allergist prescribed steroids for another 7-10 days before hives dissipated.  *was advised ok to have 2nd dose; no symptoms after.

                                                Day of injection after I left the vaccination site I started to have a really bad headache and then sore arm (left arm where the injection was). Then about 7 hours after the injection I started to have a really bad stomach ache and cramps with nausea. This last all night long into the next day where it slowly went away. I was incredibly fatigued and the headache would not break. Then on the 3rd day Thursday January 7 I was feeling okay but not 100% myself. Then Friday January 08 I woke up and knew something was incredibly wrong because my stomach hurt way worse then before, i was so lethargic that I was falling asleep at my desk at work, I was shaking  uncontrollably, blurred vision, diarrhea with blood in stool and one close episode of fainting.  So at the point I ended up in the ER missing the rest of my work day. My symptoms didn&#39;t get better until the following Monday

Then around 7:00 pm that day I started to get the body aches and so I went to go lay down for bed. I started to shake uncontrollably, have horrible body aches and chills, I went from hot to cold to hot again all through the night, i had a fever all night long, bad stomach cramps, super nausea all night long, and bad headache. This last all the way into the following night having me miss a whole day of work because I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. Since this second shot I have had severe heart palpitations, prolong period, blurred vision and severe body aches.

I slept until 1p that day (normally up at 6a) and went to bed at 8p (normally in bed about 10p).  Zero energy, migraine, nausea and zero appetite.  The fever broke at about the 24hour mark.  On the following day, still very tired, stomach upset but arm pain much better. Today, all symptoms gone except stomach upset.

                                                1/23/2021 - The first Moderna vaccine. I had flu like symptoms, which included fatigue, muscles aches, muscle spasms, joint aches, chills, and shortness of breath for 2-3 days afterward.  2/20/2021 - The second Moderna vaccine. The side effects were much worse, including muscle aches, abdominal pain, back pain, headache, nausea, chills,  fatigue, and shortness of breath. I also found myself limping. 2/21, 2/22, 2/23 - I rested and stayed home from work. Most of my symptoms had improved by the evening of the 23rd, and I felt like the shortness of breath was also improving if I took it easy.  2/24 - I went to work where the shortness of breath became much worse after working for a couple of hours. I began to get dizzy, and my hands and feet were cold and tingling. The school nurse checked my temperature (which was normal) and oxygen levels (99%). I was sent home and told to take another day or two off.  I was fine if I was sitting still and doing nothing, but talking caused me to become winded. Walking and exertion of any kind caused me to become winded. Once winded, it would take 15 minutes of sitting still to get my breathing back under control. Then I would be hit by a wave of fatigue. Also, when my breathing was bad, I walked with a limp. 2/25 - I went to  the shortness of breath was still bad. They were concerned. They took a chest x-ray (which came back clear), did blood work (which was normal), and gave me a Rapid Covid test (which was negative). My oxygen levels were at 99%. They prescribed a 6 day pack of MethylPREDNISolon. If I was not better by Saturday, they wanted me to return. They also did a PCR test (this came back negative on 2/28).  2/26 - The steroid did not help, and by the evening, I was worse.  I went to the ER . The doctors there were concerned about a pulmonary embolism. They did blood work (which was normal), a chest x-ray (which came back clear), and an EKG (which was normal). My vitals were good, though my blood pressure was high for me (113/64). The doctor told me to continue the steroid pack and prescribed an albuterol inhaler. I was directed to contact a pulmonary specialist on 3/1 if symptoms did not improve. The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/5. 3/1 - The shortness of breath did not improve. I almost passed out while driving after I picked up my two small children from school. I could not catch my breath in the car and started to get lightheaded. When I parked, I stayed in the car huffing and puffing for several minutes. I was seeing spot, was dizzy, and my hands and feet were tingling. When I climbed out of the car, my legs buckled beneath me. I was able to grab onto the car and not fall. I had some really bad breathing episodes between 3/1-and 3/3. At these times, the breathing was so rough, that I couldn?t even talk. It would take 30 minutes or more of sitting still for me to be able to bring my breathing under control. 3/3 - Appointment with Pulmonary Specialist. I had an appointment  He ruled out asthma, as the inhaler and steroid were both ineffective. He considered anxiety, but the problem was clearly not a panic or anxiety attack. (I have experienced those before and know the difference.) He ruled that out. He ran a pulmonary function test (which was normal) and a CT scan with contrast (which was normal). The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/10.  3/4 and on - My breathing was better some days than others. The less energy I exerted, the better I did. If I did too much one day, my breathing would be worse the next day.  3/7 - Ajovy injection. I was past due for this monthly injection. Once injected, I had an allergic reaction to it for the first time ever (this was the 7th time I used it). A few minutes after the injection, the injection area had a rash and was itching like crazy. I put ice on it and took benadryl. It was fine by the next morning.  3/9 - Appointment #2 with Pulmonary Specialist. The specialist was not sure what the problem was with my breathing. I was the first patient with these vaccine side effects that he had seen. He scheduled more tests and said he wanted to read more literature. He wrote a note for me to work from home through 4/6.

Today - a week after my shot - my arm is swollen, red, very hot, very painful, and a little itchy. I also feel pretty ill and strange.  I was also prescribed metronidazole and started that two days ago, and am wondering if that would contribute to this reaction.

                                                33 year old female with no preexisting health conditions received her first Moderna vaccine on Saturday, March 13 at 9am in the left deltoid. Patient immediately felt weird after receiving the vaccine - tingling and accelerated heart but no intervention occurred. Patient started with the basic side effects headache, sore arm, shakes/chills and fatigue/weakness and brain fog.  Starting around 24-36 hours after injection patient started to notice mild muscle spasms and tingling sensations. That has progressed to full paresthesia of the arms/hands and legs/feet. Patient also states paresthesia occurs in the face, neck, lips, torso and even occasionally in ears - but these seem less severe and wax and wane. The patient noticed vision changes and muscle fatigue described as muscles feeling like &#34;jello.&#34; Due to weakness, patient also complains of continued brain fog. The patient is also occasionally getting twitching and pulsating muscles.   The patient describes the neuropathy &#34;like my limbs are defrosting.&#34; It was described as cold tingling but at times intense. Patient noticed that cold temperatures make it more pronounced and movement helps to temporarily make it seem a bit better.

                                                My arm started hurting a bit in the evening, but had no issues going to bed.  I woke up in the middle of the night around 1am, shivering, with chills and my teeth clattering.  I was so cold, I had to put on socks and was using two blankets.  I went to the bathroom and was very dizzy that I almost fell twice.  I also noticed my lips were blue/purple and my temperature was 99.9.  I struggled to go back to sleep because I was still very cold, but also very tired and felt my body drained of energy and had the most intense headache ever.  I felt my head throbbing and like it was about to explode.  I was still cold, dizzy and with a headache the next day.  Two days later, I still had a headache but lighter.  Took Tylenol since Friday night, but I did not feel a difference.  I missed two days of work because of my symptoms.

                                                I received the vaccine on December 29th, 2020. The vaccinated arm didn&#39;t really hurt until the next morning when I woke up I could barely move my arm.  Around 10:00am  I started getting chills and having sweats. Over the next hour I became severely fatigued even with taking my adderall that morning. My body started tingling, I felt dissociated, had a headache, and a little light headed. Almost a little drunk feeling. I went home from work and slept most of the day.  When I woke up in the evening around 9pm I was sweaty, and my muscles and joints hurt. I took my temperature and it was  100.6.  The next morning on December 31st I no longer had a fever. My temperature was 98. something. The next several days and even now I continue to feel severely fatigued, and slightly dissociated. However, each day I seem to feel the side effects a little less.

THE PHYSICIAN REACHED OUT TO OTHER COLLEGUES, ALL STATING THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF CASES ARISING WITH RED RASHES ON PEOPLES FACES, BUT NONE OF THEM HAD PERSONALLY SEEN IT YET. MY PHYSICIAN SAID I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO COME IN. I ASKED ABOUT MY DERMA- FILLERS, AND IF THEY HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RASH BUT NOTHING COULD BE CONFIRMED. MY TEMPERATURE WAS EXACTLY 98.5, HOWEVER THE DR STATED MY SKIN WAS HOT TO THE TOUCH.

                                                I developed severe hives all over my body hours about 19 hours after the shot.   Intense itching woke me up at 4:40am the day after receiving the vaccine.  The reaction worsened for the next 3 days and began to settle/decrease at the end of the 3rd day.   I also felt somewhat disoriented through  the allergic reaction period, and on the day after the vaccine I felt slight pain on my chest.  I did not experience shortness of breath or have trouble breathing at any point.

My right cheek felt a little numb and I felt like there was a bit of a lump in my throat. The cheek and throat sensation went away in just a few minutes after I noticed them at first, did not persist. The redness on my face and ears went away, but returned on a smaller area later in the afternoon, then went away and have not returned either in the 3 days since I&#39;ve had it.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post injection, I felt a burning sensation move from my left deltoid, up my shoulder, and across my chest. I experienced burning in my chest for about 10 mins, and then it subsided. About 8 mins after that, I experienced moderate to severe cramping in my lower back and thigh muscles; which completely subsided after 10-15 mins. Two days after the initial injection, the injection site began burning/aching again, with movement up to my shoulder joint. It was to a point where I was tearful and unable to sleep. The following morning it had subsided, and just remains slightly sore.

                                                The following day, 12/23/20, I kept feeling like I was having brief waves of anxiety, with nothing to be anxious about. The anxious feeling kept occuring, but it wasn&#39;t until a week later than I realized that each time I felt that anxiety, my heart was actually palpitating.  I had a 12 lead EKG done via local EMT to confirm that it was actually happening, then made an appt with a local cardiologist.  Stress test, cardio sonogram, and 24 hour heart monitor tests were completed on 1/13/21.  My follow up is on 2/3/21.  Fortunately, I have not felt a palpitation since 1/10/21.

                                                Initially, I had severe arm and back pain that lasted 3-4 days.  On day 1-2, I was extremely exhausted, so exhausted that I actually wet the bed and I have NEVER wet the bed as an adult, which was extremely embarrassing.  The worst part is, since the shot, day 1, my eye has been twitching. I have been reporting it .  I do not think it is just a coincidence anymore like I originally thought.  I have had eye twitches in the past but they have never lasted this long!  It has been 3 weeks and there is no end in sight.  The time between twitches is sometimes less, but the severity of the twitching is getting more intense, sometimes causing my eye to blink (although usually its a lateral upper eyelid twitch) and I have had 1-2 instances of my upper lip twitching along with it (within the last couple of days).  The eye is driving me crazy.  I can&#39;t fall asleep at night because it keeps me awake and it twitches when I&#39;m trying to fall asleep.  There has been nothing that has changed in terms of increased stress, increased caffeine consumption, decreased sleep, etc. to have explained this persistent eye twitching.  I did have my annual eye exam on 1/15/2021 and talked to him about it and he said we will continue to watch it.  It was just annoying at first but it will not go away and like I said, the intensity and pulsating of the twitch is getting progressively worse.

                                                The patient received the Moderna vaccine on January 21, 2021. She waited at the pharmacy for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine to be sure she would be okay.  She felt fine after 15 minutes and so left the store.  As she was walking to her car in the parking lot, she started to feel &#34;weird&#34; as if something was very wrong but she could not figure out why she felt this way.  She got in her car and drove back to work.  The feeling that something was very wrong worsened during the drive and she started itching on her arms and legs approximately 25 minutes after receipt of the vaccination.  She did not have a rash or hives but the itching became very intense and spread to her entire body within a few minutes.  She started to feel that her throat was tight or swollen but thought perhaps it was due to something else.  However, within another 15 minutes she was having difficulty swallowing and her voice changed as she was talking to patients (hoarse).  The throat symptoms continued for 30 to 45 minutes and were quite uncomfortable but she did not seek medical attention.  They started to resolve after 30 to 45 minutes.  However, her intense itching continued for several hours.  She took Benadryl but it did not help.  All her symptoms resolved after several hours and she slept well.  The following day, within 24 hours, she felt her throat swelling again.  This lasted for a few hours but she did not seek medical care because she could breathe.  She developed a temperature of 100.8 degrees Farenheit which resolved after 4 hours but then the intense itching started again and continued into the next day.   She saw her PCP (third day after receiving the Moderna vaccination) and received a steroid shot and started taking Claritin 10mg daily and Pepcid 20mg twice daily which helped some but did not relieve the itching.  The itching worsened again on January 26th, 2021 and she was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg which helps but makes her extremely sleepy.  She continues to have varying degrees of itching off and on since then.

Lasted for approximately eight hours after receiving vaccine. I had to call off of work for the rest of the day.

Night of Jan3, I developed red, hive like rash around the injection - painful; swollen and my lymph nodes were swollen in my armpit as well. It progressively spread through my whole arm within 24 hours and looked like a &#34;poison oak&#34; rash. I took Benadryl. I emailed my doctor about (PCP). I missed a day of work on January 5th. The rash got three days progressively. The lymph node pain was gone about a week after. I did have the dr write a prescription for the second dose for an epi-pen but didn&#39;t have to use it.

                                                The day of the injection I had a very sore arm, just like my first dose. Then around quarter after midnight, I got up to use the bathroom. I recall extremely vivid dreams, and a little bit of disorientation. On my way back to bed I thought I?d take another ibuprofen to help me sleep because my arm was so sore. I remember feeling very dizzy, I did take my pill, and then I woke up on the floor. I was extremely disoriented and there was a shrill ringing in my left ear. As I came to, I recall really finding relief in the cold tile, and being concerned that I may have hit my head. I did a mental scan of my body and nothing felt painful, though stiff and sore, as I had the flu. I got back in bed and looked at the time, about 20 minutes had elapsed. The rest of the night I tossed turned, and felt quite feverish. I attempted to find radial and carotid pulses, which were extremely weak. That night, I  never did get a temperature, because I was quite disoriented. This morning I?ve been quite stiff and low energy. I feel discomfort in my kidneys, and have taken care to stay hydrated. I have reduced appetite, and some achiness in my body. My temperature right now is 100 even. It?s almost 3 o?clock, so about 28 hours has elapsed. I did not seek further medical care, as I live alone and transportation i would be a hurdle. I also not super concerned, mostly I just want you all to document that I painted, as I have not found that to be listed as a common side effect for the Moderna vaccine. I did call up a friend who is a paramedic, and feel reassured by her two cents.

Two previous pregnancies with healthy, live births (5/2015 and 2/2018). Received vaccination Tuesday 1/26 at 4 pm. Feeling tired by 9 pm. Had difficulty sleeping over night and bizarre dreams when I did fall asleep. Wednesday had moderate symptoms all day - fatigue, dizziness, body aches, joint pain, chills and hot flashes (no fever), nausea, and headache. Thursday morning (1/28), symptoms were more mild, but noticed urine was dark. By early afternoon, urine had gotten much more dark and looked to be blood in urine. Went to OB provider who confirmed blood in urine and urine sent out for culture, no infection found. Unknown cause of blood in urine. Headache has continued since 1/27, worse in the morning.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

Day 3 -  Extreme body aches, chills, fever (100-102F), arm soreness, nausea, fatigue.  Day 4 - 6 - Symptoms persisted, headache, fogginess, extreme fatigue, nausea, and low-grade fever.   I contact Employee Health again on Tuesday 2/16/21 and was scheduled for an Employee COVID-19 Test on 2/17/21 at 11:30 am. No additional instructions provided besides getting tested and need to follow-up with the provider if symptoms persist.  Day 7 - COVID-19 Test Results are Negative. However, my symptoms still continued with a low-grade fever (99-100) for an additional 4 to 5 days.

                                                3/10/21: site of injection became increasingly sore and fatigue increased throughout the remainder of the day. Then, in the middle of the night, I began experiencing chills. 3/11/21: chills continued through the night and into the morning, lasting all day. I had to sit outside in the sun in 72 degree weather run sweatpants and sweatshirt and drinking hot cocoa to feel warm. Then slept away most of the day. In the middle of the night, once chills subsided, it was immediately replaced with stomach pains l, which woke me up. I got up only to experience a throbbing headache and immediately lied back down. Hoped to sleep the pain away but pain persisted throughout the night. 3/12/21: stomach pains and throbbing head continued throughout the day, slowly subsiding. Stomach pains immediately after eating each meal, headache/sinus pressure whenever I coughed or laughed.  3/13/21: stomach pains are gone but slight headache still lingers. Head throbs in the top back or temples from time to time. However, can feel the beaches trending downwards in frequency and strength.

                                                Mouth started tingling within 15 min of receiving the shot. Was extremely tired within an hour, slept all day until following morning. I woke up with neck pain, headache, tension and pain behind left ear. Pain got worse as the day passed. Following day the pain was unbearable and I went to the hospital. They provided medication for pain and antibiotics in case of infection. Medication was not working and pain progressively got worse. A day after going to the hospital the numbing in my mouth got worse and progressed to the entire left side of my head. By the evening , the left side of my face started dropping, at which time I went to the hospital again. The physician at the hospital advised I had Bell?s palsy and gave me pain medication, which did not work. The following day I saw my personal physician and he provided me with prescription medication for pain and relief of Bell?s palsy.

                                                1: the day after my first covid shot, in the evening, my heart rate jumped from around 70 to around 130 instantly when walking up the stairs in my house. This happened twice that evening and has never happened before. My pulse was pounding in my head and it took about 1-2 minutes of slow breathing to calm my heart rate again. I wore my heart rate monitor the rest of the evening and overnight, with no other adverse effects. Stairs had no impact on me the next day. I had also exercised that morning, and while my heart rate was higher than normal with that type of workout, I didn?t think anything of it at the time and didn?t have the pounding head issue.  Due to this issue, I?m a bit nervous about the second shot in the series.   2: I started my period the morning I got the shot; day 4 and 5 of my period were significantly heavier flow than normal. Day 4 also included cramps and nausea throughout the entire day, which is not normal for me.

I called my sister and advised me to go see my Dr. I saw my Dr. the next morning and he felt it and said it was my lymph node and collar bone that was swollen and its an indication that you have Cancer in abdominal area, and I have been getting coloscopy since 20 because I have pre-cancerous cells. He ordered a CT and MRI and colonoscopy. The colonoscopy came back clear. The CT or abdomen, collar bone all came back clear.  They did a EDG, that came back clear. The next step was a biopsy, and made an appointment to see a General Surgeon. It started to not be as large.  When I got my second dose it was very painful a red.  I&#39;m still having issues but all test have came back clear. I have cancelled the General surgeon appointment, I really believe it&#39;s cause of the vaccine and all my test are clear.

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

                                                The first two days, I was fine besides my arm hurting. Starting on Friday, there was some discomfort under my armpits.  I&#39;m prone to anxiety - so on Friday night I was extremely anxious and didn&#39;t sleep until 3am. On Saturday, the armpit pain became worse especially at night.  Again didn&#39;t sleep until 4am. There is swelling and pain still on Sunday morning.  I&#39;ve iced and put a warm compress on them which is helping slightly but the swelling and pain is still there.

                                                Had seizure symptoms at 2:30 am the following day.  Husband woke to our dog whining.  I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

                                                1st outbreak of full body hives occurred early the morning on April 11th. Hives on neck, chest, back, head and scalp. Hives burned and were extremely itchy and uncomfortable, unable to sleep. Urgent Care provider prescribed prednisone 20 mg tablet, cimetidine 200 mg tablet and cetirizine 10 mg tablet and hives went away.   2nd outbreak of full body hives occurred early morning on April 13th.  2nd outbreak worse than the 1st outbreak with hives on face, neck, head/scalp, chest, torso, back, groin, arms and legs. Again, hives burned and were extremely itchy and uncomfortable, unable to sleep. Saw Urgent care provider and dermatologist on April 13th and dermatologist prescribed topical steroid creams, OTC Allegra 2x a day and Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg to take before bedtime. Significant improvement of hives the next morning. As of April 15th I am continuing the prescribed treatment and hives have greatly improved but as still have light markings where the hives were.

Muscle aches, fatigue, just felt off.  Then arm was very sore.  Sunday night my arm pit really started hurting.  Hurst over my shoulder, clavicle, and down into the lateral side of my breast.  Bothered enough in the night that I didn&#39;t sleep well.  This morning 1-5-21 I have a red rash over the injection site, arm is swollen over deltoid and hot.  Arm pit and down into breast is still hurting significantly.  I took Ibuprofen yesterday and helped some with pain in arm pit.  Off an on SOB and chest feels tight.  No cough

Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

Each time it lasts from 30 seconds to 1 minute every single day. on the 5th day, the twitching stopped for approximately 15 hours but returned when I went to sleep and kept me up through the night. THis has really taken a toll on my livelihood and I am afraid of it progressing to Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never had this happen.

Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

                                                Day of shot had pretty extreme pain in the arm a few hours later into the night. Was pretty extreme next day - couldn?t move arm above head, hard to change in and out of clothes, etc. Following day still pain but maybe 10%better. Over weekend slowly got better. This Monday and Tuesday woke up with very slight pain but nothing that I had to adjust my everyday routine for like a I had the first few days so I thought I was in the clear. Then last night extreme pain back again. Can?t move arm/shoulder without pain. Can?t engage muscle without a lot of pain.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes, but no more than 7 minutes after I received the vaccine I felt odd, like something was about to happen. I felt a bit detached from my body and my surroundings.  I then felt a flush of heat and my throat suddenly closed up. I felt frozen, as if I couldn?t have drawn in a breath if I had wanted to. I quickly removed my mask and sat up in my chair and leaned forward. After approximately 8-10 seconds my throat opened up and I could breathe.  At this time I felt my heart was racing; I could feel my pulse in my neck without putting my hand to my throat. I started to take my pulse at this time and I could feel that my heart rate was beating fast, but was slowing down back to a normal rate. It took approximately 2 minutes for my heart rate to normalize.  I could now breathe, but my throat still felt a little tight, but I wasn?t completely sure. My throat felt as though I had a lump in it and it felt a little difficult to swallow. I wasn?t completely sure it was the vaccination or that I may have been thirsty. I sat for 15 minutes and I felt fine, no other issues. I had to go to a doctor?s appointment where they took my blood pressure (approximately 1 hour after the vaccination) and said that my bp was normal.   I left the appointment at 4:00 pm and noticed that it was no longer difficult to swallow. I noticed that my throat felt different. The feeling of the ?lump? was gone and I could swallow much more easily. It was at this time that I realized my throat had still been swollen. It had taken almost 2 hours from the time of injection for my throat to feel normal again.  I am healthy, have had several vaccinations in the past and have no known allergies. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I contacted my PCP the next day once they were open to describe my symptoms. She said that I should proceed with the second dose next month, but should take some precautions first.   I didn?t alert anyone immediately after the vaccination as I?ve never had this sort of reaction and wasn?t entirely sure of what it was. I was also in route to a doctor?s appointment and figured if necessary, could receive treatment there. My PCP advised me to take 2 Benadryl and a Zyrtec one hour before the next vaccination. She also advised that I wait for 30 minutes in the observation area following the next dose.   It is Monday evening and as of now I have had no other adverse effects. I have had minimal arm pain and no other effects at all.

                                                As the injection day wore on, my arm increased in soreness. By 9:00 pm on day of injection, I was unable to lift or move my arm, due to the pain. For 2 days after the injection, I was unable to perform many activities becuase I could not lift or move my arm. By 11:30 pm on Saturday 1/16, I started to be able to lift and move my arm, a tiny bit. On Sunday the 17th, I was able to lift my arm to shoulder height, but still had a great deal of pain. The pain started to lessen throughout the day on Sunday. When I woke up Monday morning, I was able to use my arm, but it felt &#34;dead&#34; (like when you sleep on a limb wrong). This feeling continued through Tuesday, and Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, into Wednesday the 20th, it feels like there is a tennis ball in my arm pit - when my arm is in normal position. When my axillary lymph nodes were felt, there is no swelling, but a greater amount of pain.

                                                The first 20 hours, I felt fine - just a little sore arm. 24 hours later - started getting chills, uncontrollable shakes; fever - 100.9; visual disturbances - seeing black dots; joint inflammation - SI joint flared - triggered it back to being an issue; body aches; felt fatigued and disoriented. I took 800 mg Ibuprofen and then I had to take 1000 mg Tylenol and was sent home from work and Tylenol kicked in and I dosed every 8 hours and did that for a few days to be safe. The 31st wasn&#39;t bad - mostly felt fatigued and was getting on and off headaches. 1st - Feeling some fatigue still is all and then SI joint has still not resolved.

Normal treatment that works for me( rizatroban) only slightly lessened. Advil Tylenol alternated for migraine and chills. Arm much less sore this time. I would say normal injection soreness.  But stayed in bed all day due to migraine, chills and fatigue. No way I could have worked. 36hrs- woke up feeling really foggy and some dizziness.  After drinking a few glasses of water feeling somewhat normal.  No fatigue today, arm feeling almost normal.

                                                After receiving the 1st Moderna vaccine @ around 12:30pm on January 6th. That afternoon I felt fatigue and felt sleepy. I went to bed that night as usual. I was tossing and turning and woke my self up because i could feel my heart racing. I then proceeded to check my pulse and time myself. I had gotten 120 heart rate. Which i thought it couldnt be but the i have the oxygen sat that check oxygen and heart rate. I checked and my heart rate went up to 125. My head was pounding, i had a fever, the left side of my body ached, and i felt a lot of tension and my hands as if they were swollen. I took some Tylenol throughout the day and i still felt completely exhausted and horrible. This lasted at least 2 days. I contacted the ER nurse hotline they proceeded to tell me that all the signs and symptoms I had were reactions to the vaccine and if my heart rate went over 135 to go to the ER.

I felt like I was going to pass out &amp; I felt very dizzy. I went to the Hospital the same day and they said that everything looked red inside my mouth and to follow up with my primary the next day. They gave me an IV. The dizziness continued for a few days &amp; then I got very shaky the next day it lasted for a week but the swelling came down the next day.

It felt like a fever with chills. My arm was hurting worse than before and I had a terrible headache. I couldn&#39;t sleep for the rest of the night. Around 7am, I got up and took 2 tablets of acetaminophen. It relieved my headache and some of the pain in my arm. I&#39;m very tired and moving slowly.

                                                About 3 hours after the injection, I was hit all of a sudden with extreme fatigue and dizziness. This lasted several hours until a took a 2-3 hour nap after lunch. I felt better enough after the nap to at least get through the rest of the day. However, by around 8 pm I had uncontrollable shaking chills. Could not get warm. Eventually fell asleep, and woke up 3 hours later with fever and severe body aches. My temperature was 101.5, but consider that my normal body temp is a full degree lower than average, so for me this was extremely hot. I felt like my body was radiating heat like a furnace. I was so hot and uncomfortable that I couldn&#39;t sleep, and gave up after an hour. I got up and had a Tylenol, tea, and snack (so as to not have the Tylenol on empty stomach). A little before 4 am I finally fell asleep again. When I woke up around 7 am, I didn&#39;t feel quite so hot anymore but there were still the body aches. As the morning went on, the aches reduced to just my upper body, neck, and the sore injection arm. I had a headache through the morning and early afternoon, but by late afternoon I was feeling more normal again.

My fever peaked at 101.2 at 2am. Pain relievers and fever reducers did not help. I had cold sweats throughout the night, not able to sleep consistently through the night due to body aches, headache and nausea. Left arm became swollen, hot and hard to the touch, this lasted through 2/17/21. The arm was itchy from 2/18-2/20/21.

                                                pt stated that instantaneously after getting the covid vax she got a metal taste in side of her mouth and her tongue felt funny.  She had a tingling inside her mouth behind her teeth.  She was administered Benadryl.  She then got a tingling inside of the throat that moved down into her chest.  First Response team  was called.  She was having SOB.  She was moved to the ER where she was given more Benadryl and prednisone.  After that she had tingling in her lips as they were warm and puffy.  She was released around noon.  About 1:00 PM the same day pt started having SOB and the same bad taste in her mouth along with all of the other symptoms.  She took another Benadryl at 1:54 PM.   At 3PM she was sleeping and woke with tingling and hotness in her lips.  She started coughing and having trouble catching her breath.  This symptoms went away and came back at 3:46 pm.  She then again developed the same symptoms all over again but this also included swelling in the back of the tongue.   She took another Benadryl at 6:28 PM and then again at 10:28. About 11PM she got these mouth symptoms again along w/ really itchy feet and back.  She woke up at 5:50 AM she felt fine. At 8:00 AM she woke up and had the strange metal taste in her mouth along with a strange feeling in it.   At 11AM she had mild episode of the SOB and coughing.  At 3:15 she still has this taste in her mouth along with the strange feeling.  Pt is waiting on a CB from her PCP.

After the second dose, 23 hours in, I had fever, chills, cold sweats, L sided neck pain and stiffness, Left sided headache, brain fogginess, insomnia, muscle aches in my legs, exhaustion.  I was unable to get out of bed for 24 hours.  After 24 hours of this, my headache lingered for 2 days as well as my neck stiffness and malaise.  I would likely not get a 2nd dose ever again because the symptoms were so awful.  I am a Registered Nurse.

As I was driving home at 3:50 pm I suddenly started to feel tingling in my lips and my throat felt swollen and my chest tight. I was halfway home and panicked so I went home and stayed put. My throat started to relax but my chest felt tight and I was dizzy and light headed till about 9pm. My lips ended up getting a little swollen and I?m still having a burning sensation in my cheeks and chin and my lips are still itchy.  I am a nurse and my husband is a physician and we had an epi pen on hand so I didn?t feel the need to go to the hospital as I was in good care but it was terrifying.

                                                On the 1/23  I started to have a rash at the area of the injection site. It was very uncomfortable. Very itchy and felt very hot.  I had to ice pack it and put calamine lotion to help with the symptoms. I did not take anything orally as I was not sure if it was safe to take anti histamines being that I am pregnant. The next day I went to work however I was still having a lot of itchiness in the area of injection.  I took a benadryl table at around 9 am.  At around 10 o&#39;clock I started feeling dizzy and not myself.  I felt that I could not think clearly and I was worried about passing out.  Specially due to my pregnancy ( 13 weeks at that time)  I decided to seek medical attention and went to urgent care.

Woke up and took two Extra strength Tylenol to relieve the pain and they worked.  Second shot: similar experience except, two Tylenol at 3am the next morning helped with my fever. My fever broke around 4am and came back around 9am. Severe body and head pain that lasted all day until around 330 pm. I laid in bed all day because I could not function normally. Woke up Sunday morning fatigued feeling but no head or body pain.

She also reported feeling &#34;achy joints&#34;. She took ibuprofen for the achy joints and those symptoms went away after 2 days.  She had not had any changes in her diet prior to vaccination. Patient called on 3/8/21 to talk to me (the pharmacist) about her symptoms. She informed me that she sent a message to her primary care doctor to inform them of her symptoms. I suggested that she go to an urgent care since her symptoms had not gone away and that she should schedule an appointment with her primary care doctor. I called the patient on 3/9/21 to follow up, but she did not answer her phone.

                                                Dizziness started around 230pm in the afternoon on Saturday, 3 days after the first does (i also felt a brief wave, Friday around the same time,  2:30pm only 2 days after my shot). Sunday morning when I woke up I felt full on vertigo (forward and back) and a disoriented feeling due to feeling a really strong pulse consistently in my head and whole body. This dizziness and vertigo caused naseua. I treated it with meclizine and ondansetron but it only mildly helped symptoms. I went to urgent care and got a steroid shot. They also measured that my blood pressure was high. The steroid shot also did not do much to change the dizziness. Today is Wednesday, a full week after my first shot, and I am still feeling dizzy, with pulsing pressure in my head and full body causing vertigo. I went to an ent today and was started on a z pack. I&#39;m not sure what else to try or how long to expect this or if this is considered an allergic reaction and I should skip my second dose?

                                                I had a low-grade fever, a painful arm, and fatigue within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine. On 3/7/2021, I felt this weird burning/sensitivity/tingling sensation around the trunk of my body. I also experience nervousness. On 3/10/2021 the area around my trunk started to have patches of bumpy red rashes.

Fever always maintained predominantly above 102, dropped to 101 before it broke and went down.

                                                5 days after original shot I began having joint pain in my hands. This then moved to my elbows. Then to my feet and knees. After the second shot, I began having extreme fatigue, continuing joint pain, which has progressed to a burning pain in my rib cage.  I am also having numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. This has caused extreme anxiety and difficulty working. I have gone from exercising very vigorously 6 days a week to light walking with extreme fatigue.

I kept misplacing my box cutter (very uncharacteristic of me)  had the shot Wednesday... that night light nausea.. but Thursday night nausea was so bad I wanted to puke and almost did but it came on when I was doing bedtime with my kids so I fought back the urge  Nausea was a nightly occurrence in varying degrees for almost a week and was fairly prevalent fatigue that whole week

                                                Effects of vaccine were all normal during the first few days and through the first week.  Had a bit of heart palpitations and fever after dose #2 - but it subsided by day 2 and i was back to normal mostly, no real issues.  A week later i experienced an episode of almost-syncope in which i start falling forward in my seat and almost hit the wall in front of me and couldn&#39;t hold my head up.  This has NEVER happened to me before.  I did have a panic attack AFTER this because of how scared i had become of that feeling, but i recognize that and know the difference.  After that i continued to experience bouts of dizziness and disequilibrium.  I have almost fallen reaching for things, opening my car door, walking, etc.  Several weeks later i experienced another flare up of the syncope feeling while at work where i almost fainted again and was able to regain composure and the disequilibrium sensation lasted for several days to which i sought medical help.  I have been visiting a chiropractor and a physical therapist for over a month now with minor improvement.  I still experience unexplained episodes that prevent me from being able to work properly or leave my home as it would be unsafe to drive or be out in case i need medical assistance.  I have never experienced ANYTHING like this until i was vaccinated and three months later it is still affecting my quality of life.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after injection I started driving home. I began to feel like my mind was foggy and some fatigue, then my lower lip and tongue started to tingle. I stopped driving and waited to see if anything further developed. I then felt flush and my hands became clammy. After maybe 2 minutes these symptoms resolved, I never had any trouble breathing so I continued home and did not seek any medical attention. The whole time frame was about 5 to 10 minutes.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

                                                Approximately around 8:00 pm the same day as my injection I started to be in a fair amount of pain at the injection site (right shoulder) I took a bath still was in pain took Tylenol hoping it would take the edge off around 11:30 the pain started to increase so I put a heating pad on my arm . As the night progressed my shoulder pain intensified and then  I started to feel pain all over my by body mainly in the joints. It was very severe joint pain all over and especially in my right shoulder that I took another bath.  I couldn?t lay down or sleep I could barely walk around my bedroom but even that hurt so bad in my hips and knees. This feeling was very similar as if I were to having an lupus episode in my joints. Around 4 am on January 14th I finally took ibuprofen and eventually I was able to fall asleep. I later woke up around 9 am and thankfully pain free other than a mild shoulder pain where I got my vaccine.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins sitting after infection. I left and was driving and started feeling disoriented, dizzy, shaking and throbbing headache. I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

                                                Since receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 12/30/2020 I have been experiencing what almost feels like brain fog. I have had some trouble staying on task at work, trouble finding words, remembering common last names, etc. Oftentimes I will have this temporarily as a migraine aura, but it typically goes away once the migraine comes and goes. This seems to have come to stay since receiving the vaccine. I did have fatigue for approximately 3 days after the vaccine administration - 2-3 hour naps daily. This has improved some. I also had a dull headache that seemed to be there daily for approximately 2.5 weeks post vaccine- nothing I could not tolerate but it just did not want to go away even with my usual treatment - Excedrin Headache and ice.  The best way I can describe it is a dull pain all over the top of my head and forehead. I did have one headache that occurred approximately 5 days after the vaccine, that I would consider a &#34;bad migraine&#34; (Migraine that rendered me incapable of completing my daily routine - having to stay in bed, dizziness, etc). My face on the side with the weakness as a result of my brain tumor has also been a bit more &#34;tired&#34; than usual - facial palsy more pronounced. There have been times in my brain tumor journey where this happens for sometimes a couple of weeks at a time usually due to stress or an impending &#34;bad migraine&#34; coming on or if I have been exposed to or end up developing an illness later - but I never developed an illness an no additional stress. Facial symptoms include smile not as symmetrical (basically more assymetrical than usual - not wanting to move at all so much on the affected side) and more eye watering on the affected side. I do still feel a little lightheaded at times, but otherwise no other neurological symptoms. No upper respiratory symptoms or any other &#34;COVID-like&#34; symptoms. No nausea, vomiting, numbness, or tingling. Symptoms do seem to be improving this week.

                                                About a week after my first does, the injection site swelled more and was hard and warm to the touch and itchy. The next day the affected area was much larger and still hard and warm to the touch. That evening there was a dull, throbbing pain that radiated to my elbow joint and behind my shoulder. The discomfort made it a little difficult to sleep, but pain level about 4/10. I iced it that night and took some Tylenol. Today the pain isn&#39;t as bad 3/10 but the area is still swollen. The appearance reminds me of my allergic reaction to mosquito bites. I had a headache and took some generic Migraine medication.

Thought I was starting to feel myself by Sunday midday but then suddenly on Sunday afternoon almost exactly 48 hours after the shot I started to feel extreme confusion and short term memory loss. My body started shaking, I felt very hot and then very cold (back and forth) and began experiencing shortness of breath. It was all very scary and I ended up in the ER.

I was unable to tolerate sleeping on my left side that night and I had a bad headache. My arm is still sore now but I can tolerate pressure on it better. Yesterday around 1:00 pm, the day after the shot, I began having some itching along the back of my neck near my hair line. By around 7:00 that night my neck continued to itch, I was not scratching however, but also my upper posterior neck into my hair line became red, hot, swollen, and painful. It spread equally across my posterior cervical spine from the base of my head to about C7 level (pics taken). My headache worsened and pain spread all the way down my spine to my lumbosacral region. I still have these symptoms now but to a lesser degree. I feel nauseated today as well and had to stay home from work and contact my doctor because of these symptoms.

I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

                                                (Starting at about 12 hours post vaccine) at Midnight woke up with fever 100.7, severe chills, joint and muscle aches and an intense migraine. By 3 am was up again vomiting. That lasted a few hours. Temp hovered around 101-102 all day (alternating Tylenol 1000mg and Motrin 600 mg q 3 -4 hours). Could not get out of bed all day.  It was pretty intense. By evening the N/V subsided but the other symptoms remained. Temp broke by 10 pm.  The next morning temp was normal, chills were gone, still had the migraine (which migraines are not unusual).  Felt fatigue and body aches, but was functional. By the evening joints hurt so bad could barely walk again. Cont. next page....

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

Pt had taken Benadryl 25 and prednisone prior to making room attendant RN aware. Upon auscultation, no wheezing noted. Pt blood pressure was 158/100, HR 128, o2 sat was 98%. Pt verbalized that her baseline HR was around 118 and that she had anxiety. Pt was diaphoretic upon exam and asked for a bottle of water. Pt&#39;s request was honored. Pt walked around the room to relieve her anxiety and said she felt better.   Her HR went down to 90 after walking around the room. Pt was offered IM diphenhydramine and refused. Pt also refused Ambulance to transfer her to ER. At 4:30 pm patient took another Benadryl PO without medical advice. Pt is a registered nurse and wanted to be transferred to ER, where she works, by another RN.  Pt left facility against medical advice and declined EMS at 4:40 pm. BP was 190/140 and HR 104 when she left facility to go to ER, transported in private vehicle by coworker who is an RN. Called ER to check on pt and physician said she had recovered and that she did not require any further medical attention, the event was believed to have been anxiety related.

Couldn&#39;t have a full visit to dr on the 4th.Tested for COVID on 4th; Negative result. Couldn&#39;t go back to work until the 7th. I was completely exhausted, no appetite; muscles aches; had a bit of a headache, too, but the fatigue was so overwhelming that I just slept for those three days 5th, 6th, 7th. I went back to work on the 7th - it was rough but over the weekend I started doing better and the following week was better for me.

After consulting with a nurse over the phone, it was recommended to see a doctor, but no appointments available, so I ended up going to the ER. No cellulitis, but it was recommended to monitor and ice my arm. On day 10, it is still swollen, but not as much, and not bright red. Lump in throat disappeared on day 9 in the afternoon.

I kept on waking up in the middle of the night still feeling pressure pain in my head and like a tightness sensation with a slight pain on my chest.   I woke up at 5am to get ready to work and I was still not feeling well. I got out of the house and stoped at a gas station and when I got out of the car, I started to feel extremely dizzy while walking. Got to my work place and took my temperature and it was 99.1. After a while dizziness and pressure on chest kept on getting worst.   I had someone at work take my vitals and my temperature was 101.0,  BP was 144/95, BPM was 120,  SpO2 was 98%.

The following day hives increased to chest, armpits and abdomen - went to be evaluated., was having allergic reaction.  Was given Solumedrol IM injection and Rx for prednisone dose pack and Claritin, also told to take Benadryl.   The following evening hives  increased to chest, abdomen, back, arms neck and hairline.  Called in to work the next day and instructed to continue Rx treatment of prednisone, Claritin and to take Benadryl every 6 hours and advised to not get second injection.  Took mediations as prescribed at home but hives continued to spread with some mild swelling to eyes, face and lips.  By Sunday hives had improved to my chest, and and legs but started moving to my feet. Monday hives had improved by  about 50 percent, did call in to work and continue take Rx?s with Benadryl every 6 hours.  On Tuesday, most all hives had disappeared, except to lower legs and feet. Hives completely gone on Thursday.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the 2nd shot of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine around 9:25 am on 2/5/2021, after about 10 minutes I became hot and lightheaded.  Immediately after that I started getting tingling and numbness bilaterally in my hands and fingers with a heavy sensation.  My heart also started racing.  The nurses put me in a wheelchair and escorted me upstairs to the ER.  In transit my face and throat/neck started getting tingling as well.  By the time we reached the ER waiting room (9:42 am) I got the shakes/chills and was very cold.  I continued having the shakes for several minutes.  By the time I was brought back into the triage area (9:50 am) my legs from the shin to feet bilaterally started going numb/tingly as well.  I started having a cyclical reaction.  I would shake/have the chills for about 5 minutes (without any tingling/numbness in extremities), after that I would get a full body flushing sensation with feeling of lightheadedness and nausea, followed by numbness/tingling in both hands and feet. Then the cycle would repeat itself for several hours.  I continued to have a heavy sensation of my hands and feet until about 10:15 am.  After that the heaviness sensation did not accompany the tingling/numbness that persisted.  I was hooked up to IV fluids and IV benadryl at 10:45 am.  By 12:30 I finally stopped getting the chills/shaking sensation but I had a consistent body flushing followed by tingling/numbness in my hands and feet (mostly hands/arms) about every 5 minutes.  Around 1 pm I all symptoms had stopped.  The doctor said all my tests and blood work looked good.   I was discharged from the hospital around 2:45 pm with instrustions to followup with primary doc or return to the ER if symptoms got worse.   At 5:30 pm that evening all my symptoms came back, started with chills and then full body flushing sensation followed by tingling/numbness in both arms/hands bilaterally. I also had a hot sensation up the entire side of my left arm (injection site arm) up to my ear.     I took 2 500 mg tablets of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl at 6:20.  By 6:40 I was starting to feel a little better with less shaking and less body flushing/tingling.  Symptoms seemed gone by 7 pm.  I went to bed at 9 pm and woke up around 10:30 pm to my body flushing and my hands going tingling/numb.  I tried to sleep, but could not.  Around 11:30 pm I took 1 500 mg tablet of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl.  I woke up the next morning (2/6/2021) with no numbness/tingling shaking or body flushing.  I felt extremely exhausted and sore.  That day my symptoms did not return.   I woke up on Sunday 2/7/2021 with no symptoms, but around 8:30 am I had a lightheaded episode and hot sensation with a feeling of nausea.  I then started to get tingling in my face, mouth and lips.  It persisted for 2.5 hours until I decided to take Benadryl (2 25 mg tablets).  about 30 minutes after taking medication the tingling stopped.  It did not return.

I feel like I have gone through a significant altitude change and there has been no way to &#34;pop&#34; my ears, through yawning, blowing out with nose plugged/mouth closed etc.  It&#39;s disorienting,  I had the typical fever/chills/general sick feeling for 2 days following vaccine. Not a huge deal in the scope of things but I figured I might as well report it.

                                                I have started to have uncontrolled hand tremors, It gets increasingly worse when actually using my motor skills. As a nurse this is very scary and effecting my job. For patients they do not want a nurse coming at them with a needle when I look like I have Parkinson&#39;s, or I am withdrawing . I have never in my life had this issue. I am starting to become very concerned as it is getting worse and not better. I didn&#39;t even think of connecting it to the vaccine until my doc and I started going over all the possible new things and I wrote every thing down. They pulled my vaccine record and it triggered me. I have no noting new no foods no meds, no health issues that happened prior to this.  I cannot do my job with my hands like this. I am very much pro vaccines, this is very scary for me.

                                                3 hours post vaccine, extreme arm pain. Couldn?t lift my arm to get my sweater off. By 10pm I had extreme chills (shaking so hard my jaw locked from being so tense). Sharp shooting pain in my right leg started (still sore today). I then had extreme muscle aches, I could hardly walk to the bathroom. Finally at 12:15 am I took Tylenol.  Was able to sleep until 4 am and woke up with all the same symptoms... still extreme. Kidney pain started around 6am.  I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep until 10am. Woke up feeling just as bad- couldn?t eat. Went back to sleep. Woke up at noon with a headache on top of the rest and had to take ibuprofen (I didn?t want to exceed the allowed amount of acetaminophen in 24 hrs). Kidney pain continued, muscle aches as well. Chills went away around 4pm.  Woke up today feeling pretty good except the headache and kidney pain. Headache subsided around noon. Noticed a giant, raised, hot spot about an inch below vaccine sore tonight... assuming it?s ?Covid arm? . Super strange! Thankful for the vaccine, but dang- I?ve never had any kind of reaction from any vaccine, ever. I get my flu shot yearly.

                                                Received the vaccine in the morning (Wednesday). While a sore arm developed throughout the day about 12 hours later started getting severe chills. Was awake all night alternating between freezing chills and a hot fever. Extreme body aches and could not get comfortable. Felt extremely  bad the entire next day (Thursday) with the same symptoms and could not work but towards the evening symptoms subsided. That following day (Friday) I felt better but started getting a headache before bed and that night after going to bed woke up at 2am with a migraine. Worst headache of my life. Felt so bad thought I was going to throw up. Pain subsided with Tylenol. Went back to bed and woke up the next morning nauseous (Saturday). Felt very nauseous through the morning and in the afternoon evening it was less extreme but still present. Felt fine when I woke up the next day (Sunday).

Beyond a week, any extra use of that arm would trigger discomfort in the shoulder that I haven&#39;t had before. This seems to have resolved as of 6 weeks post-vaccination.

                                                About six hours after receiving the vaccine I felt fatigued. Two days after receiving the shot I began having symptoms in addition to extreme fatigue, including nausea, low fever, headache, and muscle aches. Now it is 11 full days after the vaccine and symptoms have not abated at all. The doctor ordered a Covid test and blood work. They also prescribed zofran and meclazine which have not helped. It has been difficult trying to advocate for myself without coming across as an anti-vaxxer or conspiracy theorist. I wish doctors would believe me when I say this is caused by the vaccine. I am not an anti-vaxxer and was enthusiastic about getting the vaccine, but now I am frightened by my body&#39;s reaction to it.

                                                I had very extreme side effects, which lasted for several days. They included pain in the injection site, chills, headache, dehydration, fatigue, nausua, it was debilitating for the first several days. After about 3 days, the more intense symptoms subsided, but I am now experiencing life altering neurological complications. I am very fatigued, both physically and mentally. I have trouble concentrating, remembers words, or I stumble on my words. I will forget what I am saying mid conversation. I find it very difficult to focus and am experiencing memory loss. I feel my cognitive abilities have become impared. A week after the vaccine, I caused a major car accident. I believe the side effects of the vaccine to my brain were a major contributing factor to the crash. The side effects have been impacting me at work and in my personal life in many ways. I am worried I have suffered some sort of brain damage as a result of the vaccine.

A few hours later was running fever, body aches, and exhaustion. Symptoms heavily mimic a severe  flu. Throughout the evening could not sleep for more than a hour or two at a time  due to feeling so ill. Woke up at 4:30am with entire body shivering/shaking.  Roughly two hours later woke back up and had sweat through all my clothes. Flu like symptoms continued till around 10am and by 5pm (day after shot) i felt fine. Was on Tylenol entire time and still felt extremely ill.

                                                On 3/1/2021, received second dose at 3:15pm and at 3:45pm driving home from work I developed chest pains and went to urgent care. I got there by 5:30pm and they ran an EKG; results were normal. On 3/2/2021, I left work at 2:30pm feeling ill and when I got home by 3:30pm I had flu symptoms. Symptoms were body aches, headache, fever, chills, nausea. This lasted for 24 hours. When I woke up on 3/4/2021, I was just tired with chest pains. I went to work and on my way home at 3:45pm shortness of breath started with increased chest pains. I went to urgent care and they told me to head to the ER. I got to the ER by 6pm. They ran blood work, EKG and Chest X-ray; results all normal. I followed up with PCP. I was out of work from 3/5/2021 to 3/12/2021. PCP thought I might have COVID. Took PCP test on 3/9 and results were negative. I was able to return to work on 3/15/2020 but still had shortness of breath and chest pains as well as feeling exhausted all the time. Due to no change, PCP provided me with script for Echocardiogram, Exercise Stress Test, inhaler as needed and to see Pulmologist.  Waiting on insurance company to approve echocardiogram and pulmologist appointment is 3/29/2021. It has been challenging to complete daily living activities like washing dishes, showering, climbing 20 stairs to my apartment, laundry, walking to the postal mailbox, etc. I get easily tired and winded. Prior to 3/1, I was healthy and exercising 3x&#39;s a week, walking 4 miles and hiked with no issues for the past year ranging 3.5-7 miles with incline.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

                                                I received the vaccine on 12/29 at about 2:15pm. I had a sore left arm after shot which awoke me at 2am. I also work up due to fever (temp 100.1 ), chills, and myalgia. I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night and got very little rest as unable to get comfortable. The next day I still had fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, joint pain, low back pain, fatigue and headache (felt similar to prior bad flu symptoms). I was sent home from work early as symptoms continued throughout the day with a little relief from a 500mg of acetaminophen. The following day 12/31 symptoms were gone except for the left sore arm which was improving and now completely done on 1/3.

I went to bed and slept much longer than normal and woke up the next morning without chills or body aches. My arm still hurt quite a bit and I started to have elbow joint and hip pain. The following day I started to have sciatica from my hip to my foot on my injection side, the left side. My elbow joint was sore for about 3-4 days after the injection. I also had some numbness right at the injection site the night of the vaccine.

                                                &#34;I received the Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/29.  12 hours after the vaccine I had numbness and tingling in my feet.  The following morning (24 hours post vaccine) I still was having numbness and tingling in my feet and my legs from knees down felt weak and jelly like. I still was able to walk fine, but it was uncomfortable, not able to work out etc.  12/31 (48 hours post) I worked for 10 hours this day and symptoms were the same, that evening I continued to have same symptoms and my knees and ankles ached intermittently. 1/1- Same symptoms as previous days. 1/2- Same symptoms and started having tingling down back of upper leg from butt to back of knee, still tingling in feet.  1/2- Went to ER waited 8 hours and left. 1/3- Went to Emory ER and they ruled out GBS and said they have not seen this particular reaction to the vaccine but due to presentation they believe it is a vaccine reaction&#34;.

                                                At minute 12 after injection (8:31am on 1/5/20), the pruritis started on my scalp and my back. I informed the volunteer at the end of the drive line. She offered to have EMS evaluate me, however I declined as I thought the reaction was mild. Over the next 10 minutes, after being released from the driveline, I was so itchy I wanted to literally rip all of my skin off. The back of my throat started to itch, but never felt tight or swollen. No SOB or chest tightness. I checked my temp at 8:45 and I was at 101.0 and HR was 110bpm. I am a PA working in dermatology and got to work and took 50mg of diphenhydramine PO but was not improving. One of the doctors I work with and I decided it was best for me to get checked out in urgent care. I had my MA drive me there and was seen immediately. I had a blotchy rash over my entire body, but not raised or hived. Temp was 100.6, HR 86 and BP 127/78, respirations 16/min O2 sat 98% and the itchiness was still severe but I could tell the diphenhydramine was kicking in. I was then given 40mg of famotidine PO and 10mg Dexamethasone IM in the right buttocks while in urgent care. After about 15 minutes, my symptoms were improving, but not resolved. I was released and went home to rest. Throughout the day yesterday (1/5/20) my heart rate would spike as high as 130bmp (my normal is 60-70bpm). Then it would come down within a few seconds to about 100bpm and steadily stay between 90-100bpm all day. Last night I was woken up at 3:30am (1/6/20) with a HR of 132bpm and O2 at 97%. I took a few deep breaths, and it slowly started to drop to 100bpm. Since 6:00am, I am steady at 70-80bpm with occasional spikes of 96-100bpm and I can feel when my heart is starting to race. I have my pulse ox on for the day and will continue to monitor my symptoms. I still have occasional pruritis, but it&#39;s tolerable. I was discharged from urgent care with PO Prednisone tapered dose, however, I am very shaky already and do not want to make it worse, so have not started it yet. Not sure if I should? And I would like to know if I should receive the second dose? If so, should I pre-medicate? Please let me know if you have any further questions about my event. Thanks.

                                                While waiting the 15 minutes after the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy, I thought it was just because I was nervous.  After the 15 minutes, I went outside and tood off my mask to get some fresh air.  I went back to work and was still feeling dizzy.  I drank water, ate some food and sat for a bit.  At about 1pm, I was still feeling dizzy but also started feeling off, as if I were intoxicated or like how you feel when you just wake up from having anesthesia, sluggish.  I then went home and slept for about 5 hours and now I feel much better.  Will someone let me know if it is recommended I still get the second dose next month?

Side affects started the following morning after my vaccine with arm pain and stiffness. After about 24 hours I had fatigue and chills with body aches. I slept for about 14 hours that evening then woke up the next morning without chills, body aches, and less arm pain. I then developed joint pain in my elbow and hip, as well as sciatica down my whole leg, that lasted for 2 more days. I also had numbness at the injection site for about 1 day.

                                                Two hours after the injection I experienced increasing soreness in my left shoulder up through the left side of my neck and down through the forearm. I became slightly nauseous through that evening. The pain and tightness got to the point I could not perform regular functions with the left arm. It felt as if my muscles were tearing and prevented me from sleeping. I took ibuprofen in addition to alternating ice and heat to no avail. It hurt to lift my arm, grip to pull or push even a blanket. This continued for 48 hours before there was slight relief. Full range of motion returned four days after the injection. For brief periods throughout the days following, I also experienced occasional slight heart palpitations.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

Large oblong welt about 2 inches across at injection site. Symptoms started within a few hours of getting the injection and became steadily very significant by the next day. It took about 7 days to recover from the most significant symptoms and was still recovering from mild bruise and occasional itching but no redness. Today (1/26/2021) my arm started itching again, and I see that I have a large flat circular (about 2 inches across) red spot right where I had the welt a week ago.

                                                The HCW noted w/i 1 hr of vaccination a constellation of symptoms including dizziness, disorientation, and fatigue; and by 4 hrs she developed swelling LUE with pain and some swelling extending to the L neck.  Over the next several days she reported marked swelling and tenderness over the triceps upper arm area; persistent swelling and pain in the neck that required cold packs for a couple days.  The reaction appeared to be more pronounced and extensive akin to the Humira local reaction she would ordinarily get; the last dose of that was 4 months prior.  By history, it sounds like extensive angioedema.  At no point was there any pruritus, erythema, or hive or rash on any other part of the body; no respiratory compromise, stridor or wheeze; and no fever.  Symptoms subsided over several days and she was well on day of her presenting for her second vaccination.  The vaccinator (who is a pediatrician), an on-call allergist; and this reporter (a medical oncologist) all consulted on best approach.  The allergist recommends skin testing; Humira may have a polysorbate component; and we collectively thought a contraindication to proceeding.  Given the deliberation the HCW actually elected also not to proceed.  We informed her that early data suggests one dose of the Moderna vaccine may confer an approximate 80% protection.  She will present to EHS for further evaluation.

No relevant medical history and concomitant medications were reported.  On 08-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number: 011L20A) in the left non-dominant arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 08-Jan-2020, the patient received vaccine, which was of lack of correct administration as it was injected in the fat and not in the muscle and injection which was appears to be lower than where normally given. On the same date, after administration of vaccine, the patient had experienced swollen arm (swelling), hives on the back, 2.5in red circle, didn&#39;t feel good, was tired and couldn&#39;t process things well. On 18-Jan-2021, 10 days after the administration of vaccine, the patient had developed very large-red allergic reaction at the injection site with perfect circle and was hot to the touch.

                                                After 2 hours after getting vaccine on my left arm. It started to get more sore then usually after getting a shot on your arm.  I started to think maybe the nurse gave me a shot to close to my shoulder bone. But that was not the case. By the following hours I could bearly move my left arm. I could not raise my arm above my chest with out sharp pain on left shoulder.. I left work early to work from home and it was hard to drive with the pain. By 7:00pm 1/27/2021 The pain was unbearable I had to take 2 ibuprofen 800 mg and a muscle relaxer.  I could not sleep all night the next day I called out from work. I woke up with still sharp arm pain and muscle soreness all over my body, tight muscles on both back shoulders and my back.  felt body aches.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills and body aches. I then went to bed. I was awoke shaking from being in such significant chills my body hurt all over through the bones something I have an experienced in a long time. I continue to try to sleep and rest the best I could but I stood up in the morning I felt tunnel vision and thought I was going to pass out I laid on the ground at a safety and collected myself over the course of five minutes. When I stood up I am mediately thought I was going to vomit Splash cold water on my face I force myself to eat and drink and take Tylenol and symptoms lessened but remained over the entire course of the following day another 24 hours. I?m about to go to bed and I will not know how I feel in the morning but this is definitely something I did not expect. My entire doctors office received vaccination on the same day out of a group of 15 people two of us had severe reaction similar to what I described and the other female that felt sick like me had worse symptoms and high fevers with the stores as well she has remained out of work as a result of her symptoms. We are both nurse practitioners so it?s not easy to cancel our schedule. I ended up tapping out today despite my leftover post vaccine side effects.

No fever.  Took Excedrin migraine and ibuprofen (no tylenol alone on hand). Suddenly had hot followed by cold flash and severe nausea. Then neurological panic attack (i have had this ONCE before approx. 10 years ago during a severe Migraine that was treated at ER). The anxiety attack did not affect breathing, but instead nausea and all over flashes of heat followed by BOTH arms from elbow to pinky and ring finger (ONLY) going numb. Called my primary care office and spoke to on call dr. While on phone with Dr. numbness and nausea resolved - less than 10 mins total. Agreed that was anxiety attack and all symptoms were within expected for vaccination. Returned to be to try and sleep.  Wednesday - 8 am to 10pm - severe body aches, slight elevated temp. 99.8, headache, and around 5pm started experiencing vertigo. Took maximum daily ibuprofen for body aches  and had some relief. No work or any productive activities were able to be completed.   Thursday (1/28): woke up less fatigued and less body aches. significant vertigo is still present. Headache is still present. No fever. Left arm pit still sore - no swollen lymph nodes that I can feel.

                                                Injection site started to be painful around 3 PM same day of injection, around 6 PM that same evening of January 28 I began to feel really cool.... went to bed around 730 and throughout the evening I woke up about every 1 to 2 hours sweating but feeling cold. My body hurt to touch. Left work early January 29 because I did not feel good. Afternoon of January 29 around 4 PM I noticed some redness approximately an inch and a half below the injection site. Looked like a lump under my skin and it was painful to the touch. I took Benadryl the evening of January 29 and the morning of January 30.,Not sure if the Benadryl is helping. I am keeping an eye on the redness and the lump, if it does not go away I will contact my provider. I do not feel the chills or feverish anymore and I was able to sleep through the night on January 29

                                                Was warned but for tracking purposes did want to report flu like symptoms after the vaccination. Fever of 101, chills, aches, some nausea, and feeling like my body was on fire at times. I did have to leave early from work due to Advil and Tylenol not improving symptoms. I am however feeling a little better now over 48 hours post vaccine but still have some aches in legs and joints.

                                                At approximately 11:45 pm the same day I received my second Moderna injection for Covid, I woke up from sleep shivering uncontrollably. I felt like I was chilled to the bone and was shivering so hard my muscles all felt contracted. I did not have a fever at this time. I got extra blankets and tuned heat up and over next 45 minutes managed to decrease shivering. Around this time, I rechecked my temperature and had a fever of 101.7. I used tylenol and later motrin as the fever kept rising. I was in and out of sleep with severe body aches, arm pain at site of injection, and increasing fever even after taking ibuprofen an hour later. My temp eventually reached a max of 104.5 at which point I uncovered myself and got ice packs for my head and neck. I managed to get my fever down to about 102.6 and it stayed in that range until about 445am the next morning. I was finally able to get a little rest. When I woke at 815am, my fever was 100.5. From there, the more notable issues were the intense body and joint pains and skin sensitivity along with increasing arm pain at site of injection. My fever managed to stay low grade around 99.5 throughout the day but then started increasing again in the evening. At about 500pm, it was at 100.8. I took more medication to reduce it and was unable to sleep until about 2am still from the pain. I then slept for approx 6 hours into Sunday morning,  today, and have had no fever. I am improving with pains, but have noticed red blotchy areas near my injection site which still hurts immensely but is tolerable.

                                                The first night after receiving the shot I had pain in my arm, this was not severe, but enough that it woke me up in the night on the night that I had the injection (Friday).  The pain went away after about 2 days.  Today, (eight days later) I woke up with a horrible itch at the injection site.  I started to scratch the area (still half asleep) and could feel it swelling with every scratch.  When I got up and looked in the mirror, it was hard as a rock, swollen, and about the size of a baseball.  The swelling in the center was white and looked almost like cottage cheese bumps under the skin.  I drew a circle around the swelling and went to see clients for the rest of the day.  Tonight, when I got home I drew another circle to see how much the swelling had increased.  It had increased quite significantly.  The area (that is rock hard) is about 8 inches from top to bottom and four inch width.  It is rock hard still, itchy, and hot to the touch.  The area is red, but the white cottage cheese bumps are down a bit.  I have also had a headache for two days prior to the swelling.  I thought this was unrelated, but I don&#39;t think that anymore.  I normally do not get headaches.  If the swelling has increased by tomorrow, I will seek medical attention.

In those 10 days I had multiple unexplained ringing of the ears with same funny feeling and checked my BP which was low 105/56.

                                                Received the Moderna Vaccine (Lot# 025L20A) on 1/11/21. 1/13/2021 had swelling and pain to my left upper arm near and around site of injection. The swelled area was the the whole with of my arm. The injection site was also warm to the touch with some itching associated. On 1/14-16/2021 I had extreme exhaustion including irritability. On 1/17/2021 woke up feeling good, the arm pain went away and had no other symptoms. On 1/18/2021 at night I noticed a bump feeling like a cyst at the cite of injection and the itch reappeared. 1/19/2021 around 11am I visited a health clinic to show them my arm after asking fellow colleagues if any of them had the same reaction. At the health clinic we looked at the injection site and there was a red rash covering part of my upper arm and the nurse looked closer and said she saw puss granulars.&#39;

Symptoms lasted 6 days post injection diminishing on day 5 to include only moderate fatigue. On day 7 post injection, the first phyical activity (skiing) immediatly resulted in heart pain (angina) and inability to take a deep breath. Assessment at the ER for a heart attack showed higher than normal range of troponin (.031)but a clear x-ray and EKG. Tests were repeated 4 hours after initial tests and troponin was within normal limits (.020). I was discharged with a 2/100 risk of heart attack in the next 30 days and a follow up stress test. I believe this was a direct result of the Covid-19 Maderna shot. I believe is reduced my hearts ability to work at a normal capacity and respond to physical activity.

                                                Arm started to be painful about 2 hours after injection. By evening I could barely move my arm. Around 10pm pain was so bad I was crying.  Could not lift arm. Could still move my hand. Woke up multiple times in pain.  By morning arm pain had decreased but felt lethargic and weak. By noon I had taken a nap. My 15 year old daughter said she came to check on me and I woke up but my eyes were rolling on the back of my head. I slept for over 3 hours. Woke up sweating  achy. Still felt tired and lethargic. Arm was still sore but was able to move it around. Went to bed again around midnight- woke up today (Thursday) and felt much better.

She was pretty much herself on morning of 2/13/2021 - got up, had shower.  caregivers noted her extremities were cool and face was red.  temp was 97.4.  She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.  CPR was continued until family could be reached and decision was made to stop resuscitation.

                                                I am currently a nursing mother and 24 hours following the vaccine my infant son, born 1/22/2020 (approximately 13 months old) presented with a rash (trunk), nausea and vomiting, lethargy, decreased mobility, and irritability.  Approximately 48 hours following my vaccine he presented with a rash on the backs of his shoulders as well as on each of his cheeks as well as a fever of 101.5 degrees. The fever was treated easily with Tylenol and did not return after the 6 hour mark.  At 60 hours post vaccine, he was evaluated by his pediatrician in person and evaluated. He was specifically checked for ear infection (negative), strep (negative), and COVID-19 (results not in yet). After the care provider&#39;s assessment it was determined that a report should be made regarding the incident and that I should contact the CDC regarding his reaction.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine I started to have an increased heart rate and blood pressure.  I was watched for close to an hour, and let go.  I experienced muscle and joint pain, which was to be expected.  Approximately 2 days afterwards, I started to experience dizziness, low blood pressure, and pressure in the middle of the back of my head.  The pressure became worse and worse, while continuing to experience the above side effects.  Since that time, I have been to the emergency room for pain all over, pressure in the back of the head, memory issues, blood in the stool, and extremely cold hands and feet without explanation.

Zaleplon insufficient duration so switched to Zolpidem PRN. She has not required more than a few doses of zolpidem but now we have uptitrated her to gabapentin 600mg nightly. She feels significant improvement in her sleep and work product, but continues to have intermittent cognitive errors and some decrease in work performance, that remain concerning to her.

I received my 1st dose of Moderna COVID vaccine around 5/45pm on Thursday 2/25 by a woman at the High School.  The shot felt fine at the time but I did notice she went a bit higher up on my shoulder.  However, the morning after, I was experiencing extreme shoulder pain with limited range of motion as the day progressed on 2/26. By night time of 2/26, I couldn?t remove my bra and had to ask my husband for assistance. I?m scared and terrified that I won?t be able to hold my newborn baby when he?s born. This is all I can think about. I don?t even care that I?m in severe pain. All I can think about is how this is going to ruin my experience caring for my child without full range in one of my arms. It?s 2:37am where I am and I can?t sleep because of the shoulder pain.

                                                This is a 37 year old female.  Within 10 minutes of her 1st dose Moderna, the patient developed a mild rash (location not specified).  She took a dose of diphenhydramine with some relief.  She went home.  2.5 hours later, she developed a facial twitching and reported to the ED.  She reported involuntary facial muscle twitching, like spasms, that were painful.  On ED presentation, BP=121/86, HR=93, RR=16, SpO2=98%.  ED noted no swelling, itching, SOB, chest pain, N/V/D, or rash.  The ED notes describe the symptoms as &#34;Numerous and varying facial movements including contraction of the lower cheek muscles on the left and then the right along with movement of the tongue from side to side at which point she bites or gets the tongue in the way while trying to speak.  Speech is therefore slurred however at times clear. Oropharynx is clear with mildly dry mucous membranes.  No oral or pharyngeal swelling, difficulty swallowing, or stridor.  Neck is supple and nontender without adenopathy. Differential diagnosis includes: allergic reaction, dystonic drug reaction (unusual to be varying from the left to the right), dyskinesia, anxiety, somatization or conversion disorder, among others.  Her symptoms are not consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy, stroke, or clearly tardive dyskinesia. Subsequently given diazepam, fentanyl, and 500mL IV fluids.&#34;  She was discharged home.  Patient returned to the ED on 12/31 (within 24hrs) with ongoing symptoms.  Patient was monitored and discharged home again.   One month later, on 1/28/21, chart notes indicate that she has continued to have intermittent symptoms continue.  A trial of steroids reportedly made symptoms worse.  She reports that she also feels fatigued and with &#39;brain fog.&#39;  She currently has a neurology consult pending.

This continued for 2 full days with fever breaking then coming right back, repeatedly, even with taking Tylenol every 6 hours. The headache was unbearable day 1 but mild day 2.  Fever got up to 102.4 at one point but was between 100-101 most of the time during those two days. I was not able to function or get off the couch at all day 1 and at about 50% day 2. By day 3 post vaccination I felt completely back to normal besides a very sore and swollen arm still. This continued for about 6 days post shot.

                                                The night after I received the vaccination, I had trouble sleeping. I would never get fully to sleep, just doze in and out of consciousness. The next night (Sunday), I was unable to sleep at all. This has never happened to me before, even when I would have a manic episode (and I did not have any symptoms of mania, other than sleeplessness). The next day I alternated between being so tired that I couldn&#39;t concentrate and feeling awake. That night, I went to sleep at around 11:30 and awoke the next morning as usual. The following night (Tuesday), I had a bit of trouble sleeping, but not anything unusual. I took antihistamine and melatonin and fell asleep as per usual. At this point, I still do not know if I will continue to have trouble sleeping in the future, but if I do, I will resubmit this form.

                                                Here is my story. Part 1: I had my second Moderna vaccine on 2/16. 36 hours later I was laying In bed when I all of a sudden felt very strange- sort of faint - like I was going to pass out. Then I started feeling like my Body was going numb. We called 911. I was taken to the ER. What followed was about 15-20 ?neurological? episodes (every ten minutes or so) where my entire body from head to toe became paralyzed- I couldn?t move any of my limbs. I also had no sight. I was not blacked out Bc I could hear everything that was happening. It was also accompanied by extreme chest pain, numbness, contratcing of muscles in chest cavity that felt almost like a heart attack. Each individual episode lasted about 3-5 minutes and then slowly the paralysis would undo and I?d regain feeling. And then the full episodes would start over a few minutes later. This went on for a few hours repeatedly while in the ER.  I was admitted for testing  and monitoring for two days (EEG, EKG, MRI, Catscan) all clear. Once discharged I had lingering neurological symptoms but not the full paralysis episodes. Lingering symptoms included severe chest pain, numbness/weaknesses predominant on the left side as well as other random areas. I was very weak and tired. I started to improve very slowly - by day 10 post hospitalization I was starting to feel like things were turning the corner and maybe I was on my way to recovery. Part 2: I started to finally feel more improved from the lingering neurological issues and then all of a sudden around 5:30PM I was in the kitchen making dinner for my kids on 3/2 and the episodes started again. Called 911. Again, every ten minutes or so they came on (maybe 15-18 episodes) of complete paralysis- this time accompanied by seizure like rapid eye movement from side to side and fluttering of the eyes. I was readmitted to the hospital where the episodes repeated to happen again, maybe 15-20 times. I was admitted. They did a 24 hour video EEG which ?caught? the episodes on video and sound but did not appear negatively on the EEG in terms of abnormal brain activity. I?ve been released as they say there is nothing to do. I have lingering muscle weakness in my eyes- I can?t focus my eyeballs or ?track? on an eye exam and continued muscular chest pain. I also have a lot of PTSD from the trauma of the events.

Most of those symptoms lasted for 36 hours, however the headache and the chills remained. The following Tuesday (2/16) I starting having severe difficulty breathing and was gasping often. I tried my inhaler and that did nothing. This persisted. On 3pm Thurs (2/18) I started feeling dizzy and by 4:30pm I could not stand. Went to the doctor on Friday (2/19) with a fever of about 100, inability to walk without assistance. I&#39;ve also been having memory problems. I went to a balance center EMT on 3/10 for a repositioning procedure and I still Additional information for Item 18: feel dizzy, so there were no results to date.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

I got under the covers. It hit 99.9 (fever). I slept hard for most of weekend. Arm was really itchy - I had swelling again. I didn&#39;t see a doctor. A couple of days after I got my shot - stomach issues, diarrhea, flu, body aches - those lasted a couple of days by Tuesday. Except the stomach pain lasted about a week. High blood pressure and migraines was having these too. Have struggled with heart palpitations and insomnia at night because blood oxygen level at night is in the low 90&#39;s. Doctor has said to wait a little longer to see if goes away. Metropole - or Toprol was added either right before the second dose or right after second dose of vaccine. Migraines and sleep issues are still an issue - as well as the low blood oxygen level. The symptoms that are typical vaccine related side affects have resolved.

                                                Minutes after receiving the shot on Monday, 3/22/2021 at approximately 11:15am, I (F/37yo) felt a very small, but acute tightness/pressure in my upper right chest area. I didn&#39;t initially report it as it was not one of the listed reactions I had read about in the information given to me -- I assumed I was very anxious, maybe breathing nervously, and that it would go away. The next day I felt very fatigued, light-headed, had extreme muscle and joint pain throughout my body, slight nausea, and the injection site (my left arm) was very sore. I took Tylenol and slept.  I felt weak and &#34;off&#34; the whole day. The acute chest pain I felt after the shot had now become less &#34;acute&#34; and turned into a wider and duller general pressure. The next day, Tuesday, I also began feeling intermittent flashes of hot or cold-like patches in my head, which I also consider a part of a general inflammation my body might be having. It is now Thursday, 3/25/2021 and the chest pressure has increased even more, having now spread from the upper right side to include the center of my chest. My headache is still lingering, I still don&#39;t feel like my normal self and feel &#34;off&#34; somehow, and the chest pressure is worrying me because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on internally. I reported the chest pain to my doctor and was told that my exact reactions don&#39;t make any sense in relation to the known adverse reactions to the Moderna COVID vaccine. I was advised to report this here and to also go to an urgent care clinic or emergency room if my symptoms worsen.

                                                Itching started 2 hours after injection. Chest, then back. Got worse in the middle of the night- groin and ankles very itchy.  1 week later (today) itchiness periodically continues - ankles, wrists, chest, scalp, groin. 24 hours after injection I had the most severe headache I?ve ever experienced, that strangely was worse when lying down. 2 Advil and propping myself in a sitting position to sleep helped it go away, and it hasn?t returned. It was so sudden (woke me up) and so severe that I had considered going to the ER since I already had experienced one adverse reaction to the vaccination. The headache was bilateral and felt like swelling at the top of my cervical spine and bottom of my occipital bone. Standing and moving my head temporarily decreased the pain and nausea, but I think Advil really helped the most.

                                                Shot given at 3:47- approximately 3-5 minutes later started to experience blurred vision, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.   Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

I thought that the breast on the same side (left) that I received the vaccine was more sore than the other breast (right).  One day I thought that I had put my sports bra on wrong it was so sore.  Another day I woke up from sleeping on my side because my breast was sore.  I also had some menstrual cramps.

                                                1/2/2021: In the evening, I  started experiencing swelling (felt like a hard knot under the skin), itching, redness, and heat at the injection site. Earlier in the day I noticed a little pain discomfort in my right arm pit. As the day wore on, I noticed swelling in my lymph nodes and the level of discomfort increased to the point that it disturbed my sleep. 1/3/2021: The pain and swelling at the injection site and armpit continued to be the same. I took ibuprofen to try and alleviate the level of discomfort. That evening before bed also took Benadryl to see if it would help with the injection site reaction. I also started experiencing a dull shooting pain and tingling from my armpit down to my wrist on my right arm. 1/4/2021: The injection site improved, no more knot, heat, or itching. It still remained a little swollen. Lymph nodes were still swollen throughout the day, but manageable with ibuprofen. Shooting pain and tingling still occurring sporadically throughout the day. 1/5/2021: Still a little discomfort in the armpit, but seems to be improving.

                                                Employee Recollection: Wednesday and Thursday  felt kind of weak and more tired than normal, but thought nothing of it.  In the early afternoon on Friday the symptoms got worse.   Tired and confused.  I slept through my alarm and woke up to my mom, who was watching my daughter for me, trying to wake me up.  I was very confused, dizzy and weak.  My mom said I was really out of it, and that I had a really hard time focusing on what she was trying to say to me.    When I checked in for work my O2 stats were in the upper 80&#39;s lower 90&#39;s.  My temp was also in the lower 90&#39;s.  That was after numerous attempts at taking my o2 stats and temps.  Co-worker said I was very confused, tired, dizzy and weak.  She said there were times when I was walking that I would reaching for walls and railings to regain my balance.  I left work at 6am Saturday morning.  I went home and went straight to bed.  Slept all day long until a few hours before my shift started at 9:30 P.M.   since then I&#39;ve been feeling better, but my temp and 02 stats are still low.  But I&#39;m continuing to monitor symptoms.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if anything changes.

Tuesday I woke up within 20mins I was nauseous and threw up multiple times. My body was achy and just felt &#34;blah&#34;. Was weak and dizzy when I stood up. I felt like my insides were on fire (like the worst temperature you&#39;ve ever had) but didn&#39;t have a fever. Felt like my brain was going to swell out of my head and it was the worst headache. I slept all day. Woke up long enough to call the dr and fell back asleep. Halfway through the day I ended up with a fever of 102 (it went down after a few hrs). Today I woke up still feeling weak and somewhat dizzy, spacey.

I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

                                                I  got it at 2pm Friday.  About 2 hours later my arm started feeling sore but not too bad. I did some light yoga and walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.  Otherwise took it easy that day. Satu I woke up with a slight headache which isn&#39;t unusual for me.  I still had mild soreness in my arm. I did a more difficult yoga workout and then walked 5 miles outside.  Took a shower after and relaxed for a bit. Then had dinner around 5 and within the hour started having diarrhea.  This lasted a few hours during which my arm started gradually hurting more, it was pretty bad. Could barely move it and hurt to the touch even. Shivering started soon after.  I never had a fever or fatigue during all of this. Highest temp was 98.4 with forehead thermometer. I talked to a doctor to put my mind at ease and he said I was having a big immune response to the vaccine, apparently younger adults between 20 to 40 are having bigger immune responses. The second dose is stronger so most are  having these symptoms after that one, but some are having it after the first as well. He also told me I should have taken it easy these past 2 days and that I likely overdid it. He advised that I take motrin or Tylenol, get under blankets to stay warm, and rest. That&#39;s exactly what I did and a little over an hour later I was feeling much better.   I&#39;m a bit freaked out by what the second dose is going to do to me since it is supposed to be worse. Is it safe for me to get second dose?

                                                About 24 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced extreme breast tenderness in both breasts. They felt sore to the touch all over, had the sensation of being full and heavy, and had to be supported in a bra in order to be tolerable. I liken it to postpartum pain associated with breast feeding and milk engorgement. I would list the symptoms the first night as moderate to severe. It limited my ability to do certain tasks because of the pain and discomfort. The breast tenderness has decreased in severity since then but it is now 1/11/2021 and both breasts are still tender. The severity is now mild. It&#39;s uncomfortable but does not limit my daily activity. Of note, I have had a tubal ligation and ablation and am not pregnant but I cannot track the timing of my cycle to know if the vaccine affected my cycle or caused hormonal changes that could explain the breast sensitivity.   I had arm soreness at the injection site for the first 48 hours but that has gone away. No other symptoms to report.

                                                I had the vaccine Sunday night and experienced fatigue that night, and then developed arm soreness that lasted for a little over 24 hours. I also developed minor body aches and felt crummy Monday and Tuesday. I was then fine for the rest of that week. Monday, January 4th at 7:30 PM, I felt something tingly, burning, and hot on my left arm. When I looked at it, I had a large round red rash that had a knot and was hot to the touch and itchy. At 3:30 AM on Tuesday morning, I woke up in pain and crying. I went to Urgent Care to have it assessed. The doctor diagnosed it as cellulitis in relation to an infection at the injection site and gave me an antibiotic and drew around it with a surgical marker. He told me to go to my PCP if it grew outside of the line or to the ER if I developed severe symptoms. On Wednesday, it had grown and was not getting any better and had started forming blisters. I called my PCP and he told me to take 2 Loratadine every 24 hours and to come in if it was not better by Friday. It appeared to be getting better and I was fine on Thursday. Friday morning, I woke up in pain again. The rash had spread across the majority of my upper arm. It was red and painful and itching with heat. I went in to see my PCP and he diagnosed it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He gave me a steroid, which seems to be suppressing the rash and symptoms. I still have a rash and itchiness, but my physician said it could last for another week or two until it goes away.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

                                                Vaccine given at 2pm. By 9pm that same night I could not move my arm without crying from the pain.  I woke upbat 5am and the pain was still just as bad. Any little movement was excruciating. I could not change my clothes, brush my hair, wash my face. The only reason I waa still able to work is because I am a teacher and we are remote so I was able to sign on from home and sit at my desk with my arm in an imaginary swing because that was the only time it did not hurt. Later that night I could begin to move my arm a little before pain started but still needed help getting dressed, etc. The next two days I was able to move it little more before pain started.  It is now 5 days later and I can lift my arm up. I still feel pain but it ia tolerable.

Little out of it feeling.  This was pretty much done by 1/1/21. 1/7/21 one week and a day after injection, injection site became raised, hard, inflamed looking  and was itchy. Site was visibly red and raised and had approximate 3 in diameter.  Previously mentioned symptoms began again (waves of hot flashes, nausea, aches).  This lasted at least until bedtime.  Next day, 1/8/21 felt better and injection site, though still hard and red, reduced down to size of quarter.  No further symptoms BUT injection site now as of 1/20/21 still looks like a quarter sized bruise.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

                                                Around 6pm my arm starting getting sore. All night it hurt really badly and kept me awake. I took Tylenol around 3am and that helped. When I woke up the day after I had a HUGE lump on my arm at the injection site. It looked like a golf ball. It was red and hot. It stayed this way for about 3 more days and finally started to go down. The red mark at the injection spot remained though and continued hurting until about day 9 after the shot. Then it started getting itchy but remained red. I am now over 2 weeks post shot and the red mark is still slightly there but not very visible and the pain and itchiness has gone away.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

Since then, the nausea has resolved but I still continue to have body aches, weakness and fatigue. I also have a rash on my right arm ~2 in below the vaccine injection site. It is hot and tender to touch. And very red.

                                                Left arm pain began on Thurs. 1/7/21, approximately 30 minutes after vaccine.  Severe headache and pain radiating to left side of neck began approximately 22 hours after vaccine (around 2pm on 1/8/21) and left arm pain worsened.  On 1/9/21, unable to get out of bed-felt like I had been drugged- severe HA, fatigue, and left side of neck soreness.  Felt slightly better on 1/10/21 and 1/11/21, however stil unable to get out of bed due to severe HA and fatigue.  On morning of 1/12/21, fatigue relieved and severe HA relieved around 1pm.  Since 1/12/21, Severe HA, left arm tightness and left neck soreness has continued intermittently.  This is a HA I have never experienced before.  Yesterday, on 1/21/21, I had a severe HA all day at work and when I went home, I had to lie down the rest of the day/evening d/t severe HA, fatigue and left neck tightness.  I was unable to do daily chores and help my children with their homework.  I also woke up this morning with the same severe HA and left neck soreness/tightness.  I do feel this HA is from the vaccine as I have never experienced this type of HA prior to receiving the vaccine and I am not someone who gets HA&#39;s often.    I know the vaccine was given too high, as I give vaccines often for my career, and I am wondering if that has anything to do with my neck pain.  I did bleed a lot with the injection (do not think it went into my muscle) and am wondering if that has anything to do with my adverse reaction.  I am fearful these severe HA&#39;s will continue and I am extremely hesitant to receive my second dose!

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was dizzy. I sat down where they had us wait and the dizziness wouldn&#39;t go away. Became difficult to swallow - felt like a lump in my throat. More difficult to breathe then normal. Vitals taken. BP taken. Feeling like I had an epidural. Legs had a sensation like they were going numb and then they went numb. Benadryl injection given. Legs felt like they fell asleep. Waited and within second 30 min timeframe I was feeling a lot better so I left. 2:30 in the morning, my legs were asleep again and the lump came back in my throat and took Benadryl and it went away and I felt fine. I went to work the next day. At 7:00 that evening felt chilled and it came and went. I came up and took more Benadryl and rested.I went to work the next day and I sent a message to my Primary Care DR. - but leg was fine and the lump in throat wasn&#39;t there. On Saturday morning - after 10 days - had a headache that would not go away  (Very severe headache)- took Tylenol 1000 mg it didn&#39;t work. It was very bad Saturday night I took another Tylenol 1000 and Sunday morning it - headache still wasn&#39;t gone. Leg was numb again. This time the leg  numbness was worse than ever had felt. Left axilla - there was a lump/nodule and it was painful. Tried TeleHealth Med and they recommended I go to ER but I didn&#39;t feel good enough to do it. Dr.  I reached out to her and she took the history and she prescribed Prednisone; but wanted me to do a COVID test and Urine sample to see how I was doing before I took the medication so I did it next the day. Urine sample was clean. Prednisone 60 for four days 40 for four days and 20 for four days - On day Prednisone my legs feel fine, but the headache just lingers. On day two of Prednisone she told me to stop the Benadryl. Three days after Prednisone the lump under axilla resolved. I am taking coffee. Headache is still there but not as severe.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart started racing and I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

                                                The following day I had redness at the injection site about 2/12 inches long and wide with itching and minor swelling/bump. The day following also was tired achy and felt off/headache. On Thursday symptoms went away other than the arm and a slight headache. On Saturday the redness and I ring was gone, but I started having pain in my armpit and when I moved my arm in different positions. Hand was tingling with certain positions suggesting nerve pain. Lasted 2 to 3 days and got worse before better. Was mostly gone by Tuesday. Wednesday 8 days after injections the redness, itching, and swelling in my arm returned. Same size as the day after my injection. Called the doctor to see if I need to be concerned that the redness, itchyness, and swelling returned after completely going away 4 days earlier. Also feeling tired for the past 3 to 4 days but otherwise good. Some minor discomfort/pain in collar bone around and lump node in neck but is not consistent. Comes and goes. Not sure if the nerve pain in arm was related to the vaccine, but since the redness returned it may all be related.

Basically it feels like a bruise when I flex my bicep it hurts there or when my arm is relaxed at my side the pressure hurts in the armpit. It is not superficial .

My brain was telling me to walk forward and my legs were stumbling all over as I tried to walk. I went back to sleep and woke up hours later more stable but still with my head feeling very light(not quite dizzy). I was slightly nauseous and just blah most of the next day. I?d get slightly out of breath when talking for awhile. I was in a deep fog. To the point it took a few minute to process the sound my dog made with it coming from him. Overall, I felt like I was drugged or really intoxicated. I worry about my 2nd dose!

The next morning, I woke with minor side effects body aches, chills, slight fever and arm sore from injection. As the day progressed, my symptoms got worse. By body aches were so severe that it hurt to stand, sit, bend and curl my toes. My head was so full of congestion by the end of the night. I was meeting with a small group of family for New Year&#39;s and thought that I would get checked to make sure that it was nothing. I was tested for COVID and for Influenza. I came back positive for Influenza A. I was sent home with a sample of Xofluza. I was in bed for 2 days and symptoms started subsiding. I went back to work the following week.

It was sensitive to the touch to the point that I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body.  It also hurt to raise my arm any higher than shoulder height.  It went away on its own after about 36 hours.  One week later, on January 7th, my husband noticed that I had a large red patch on my arm where I had gotten the vaccination.  It was about 1.5-2&#34; across, raised, red and warm to the touch.  It was slightly itchy, but didn&#39;t hurt.  My husband noticed this in the evening, but I am not sure how long it had been that way since I had had long sleeves on all day.  By the morning, it had gone away.  I didn&#39;t treat it in any way.

                                                7 days after (Wednesday, January 27) receiving the vaccine, I developed a small itchy hive at the injection site. Considered it was a mosquito bite but woke up the following day (Thursday) with the area swollen, red, and hot to the touch.  I also had a stomach ache so I took Tylenol which did not help.  Friday, I took ibuprofen  and the redness and swelling subsided but the heat remained until the evening of Sunday, January 21 when I started having an anxiety attack and noticed a red ring/rash around the injection site.  I took benadryl but it&#39;s still there.  I read that people are calling it &#34;Covid arm.&#34;  It&#39;s not itchy, just a raised red circle/square about 5 inches in diameter around the injection site.  It is still very hot to the touch.  Besides this and severe anxiety brought on by it, I&#39;ve had no other symptoms.

                                                About 5 hours after the vaccine, I started feeling really hot especially in head and face. From there, I had fever and it started going up. Body aches; joint pain; headache; and this went on all throughout that night (Jan 2 and morning of the 3rd). The 3rd, my fever wasn&#39;t as high but I still had fever and felt really really tired and body aches/joint pain. On the 4th, when I woke up I noticed that I didn&#39;t have any taste and smell and so I went in and got tested for COVID 19 (the 4th) - positive for COVID-19.  I went to a clinic that could do a Rapid test. Doctor there gave me Azithromyocin - 2 the first day and one every day after; Dexamethasone once  a day for 10 days.  I could  Tylenol and Motrin (alternating because my fever wouldn&#39;t go down). The highest my fever got was that Saturday night got up to 103 degrees. The last day I had fever was the 5th of January and that was 99.8. Jan 7, 8, and 9th -  I continued to have other symptoms like really severe headache; no appetite; felt super tired and could hardly get out of bed. Those symptoms resolved about the 10th of Jan -  headache almost went away and fatigue was still there and it is still there. I got out of quarantine on the 15th and I went back to work on the 18th - I had no fever. I just felt tired. I couldn&#39;t sleep - throughout. I finally started being able to sleep just a couple of days ago. I had the second dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 30th - I had fever again; body aches; joint pain.

After about an hour, my arm was swollen and very painful to move and touch. I put an ice pack on and took Tylenol but the pain and swelling didn?t completely subside. I went to bed with Tylenol PM to help me sleep and woke up several times from the pain. Throughout the day today (2nd day), the pain has steadily gotten worse. I can barely move my arm due to the immense pain. The swelling is still there. I have been icing it and taking Tylenol but the pain has only gotten worse. I feel achy in my neck and the pain is radiating down my arm to my forearm, wrist, and fingers.

At 10:15 that evening I started to become chilled.  By 11 p.m. I had uncontrollable shaking chills, accompanied by a fever of 101 and body aches.  By 1 a.m. I was still having uncontrollable shaking chills and severe body aches and  Body sweats.  I had a sweatshirt on over a tee shirt and a heating pad on between the two with two comforters on. At 3 a.m. I had to take ibuprofen (800 mg) because my body hurt too bad to even touch my skin.  My eyelids hurt.  My toes hurt. My ears hurt.  My fever was up to 103.  I fell asleep finally and woke up at 730 a.m. feeling much improved besides some mild chills.  I made the wrong decision to go to work.  I arrived at work at 830 and by 10 a.m. I started to get chilled again, achy and feeling like I was going downhill again.  I decided to go home.  By the time I got home at 11 I had chills again, fever of 101 and body hurt.  I slept until 3 p.m. at which time I woke up chilled and wanted to take a hot shower.  My other half noticed I had hives on my face (which I documented in photos).  I took a benadryl and went back to sleep.  Woke up again at 7 p.m. tried to eat something but had no interest and just wanted to sleep.  Throughout the night I would get the sweats that would drench through my t shirt.  The following day, 2 days post 2nd dose I slept all day.  Not as chilled but very tired.  Noticed injection site was now red and swollen, again documented in pictures.  Slept all day.  Today injection site has gotten slightly larger based on markers I marked on my skin, but not as red.  Not too energetic but much improved.

                                                Moderna shot #2: About 6-8 hours in, I got the expected serious joint aches, chills, headache, and fever (101F). This lasted for about 2 days, managed well by alternating Motrin and Tylenol. A mild rash occurred a few days after shot #2.   Thought I was done since most of my colleagues bounced back after 2-3 days. Then 48 hours in, I developed a racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools. No position or relaxation method would resolve these symptoms. All I could do was lie down perfectly still with an ice pack on my forehead and hope this was short-lived and would pass. I could not sleep. I had no appetite. Over the 8 days this has been occurring, I lost 3 pounds.  I could not find any literature of anyone else having any cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. It scared me. I have no prior cardiac history and no history of anxiety. I went to the ER. Labwork showed an elevated D-dimer (luckily the CT scan showed NO blood clots), elevated WBC/neutrophils, and low potassium. Thyroid labs (which I had tested a few days later) were normal. The ER assumed the abnormal labs were due to the immune response to the vaccine and referred me to a cardiologist.   I did a virtual visit with the cardiologist the next day. He suggested a heart monitor and scheduling an echo. The heart monitor was mailed to me. I started wearing it on 2/4/21 (3 days ago). I am supposed to wear it for 7 days and then mail it back. My echo is scheduled for 3/4/21. Again, I have had no previous cardiac history. I am an active, healthy 38 y/o F.   These symptoms (racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools) have continued to last for another 8 days and are debilitating. I have not been able to work.   On day 7 of these symptoms, I called my PCP?s emergency line. They suggested calling the cardiologist to see if they would consider prescribing a beta blocker for symptomatic relief. I called the cardiologist last night. They prescribed Metoprolol. I haven?t taken it yet. It?s officially day 8. I thought I was in the clear and had not had symptoms since last night, but then just now another episode of these cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms have occurred but less intense than previously.   At this point, I have had had 10 days of symptoms post Moderna vaccine #2 but 8 of those days are specifally the cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. Although a little better, these symptoms have NOT resolved and continue.  I realize I am probably an outlier in terms of how I have reacted to this vaccine. I would love a call back to know if other people have had a similar experience, so I can understand if this is ?normal.? I understand 7% of patients in the Moderna vaccine trial had ?symptoms? lasting longer than 7 days. Were they symptoms similar to mine? Will this go away completely? Any help is appreciated.   Of note, I did develop a nice rash below my injection site on Moderna shot #1. Does that mean I?m more ?reactogenic? and would potentially have a harder time with shot #2? Does size matter in how you will react? Moderna is 100 mcg (instead of Pfizer?s 30 mcg) I am petite (5?2? and am now 106 lbs since I?ve lost weight).

                                                Patient received Covid Vaccine Dose 1 (Moderna) on 1/14/2021.  1/15/21 I experienced arm soreness, lethargy, body aches, achy joints, and felt like crap.  1/16/21 I developed two red swollen spots on my left arm (injection arm).  The red areas were swollen, hot to touch, and each were a hard lump a little larger than a marble.  These two spots were about 3 inches below the injection site and an inch closer to the body midline.  These red spots worsened and joined together.  1/28/21 I was still experiencing the red raised area that had grown in size, still hot to the touch and now red and rashy around the outer edge.  Redness diminished over the weekend and resolved by 2/3/21.  Arm and shoulder still are achy and sore.

                                                5 mins after the shot I felt light headed, nauseated, weak in the knees. I drank water and tried to eat a small snack. I started getting really cold and began shivering and had GI discomfort. At the 20&#43; minute mark I went to get the nurse. She returned with BP cuff and pulse ox, BP was elevated as was pulse. I continued to have waves of feeling weak, shaky and sick but nurse said I should go home an lie down at the hour mark. Once home my throat felt really dry and strange, I had a BM, laid in bed about 20 more minutes and decide decided I wanted to get check out. Went to ER and was seen ~3 hours after vaccine. BP and heart rate were still both up. I still felt nauseated, dizzy and cold. I was given Meclizine and Zofran. BP retuned closer to normal after about 40 mins and I was released, feeling better but fatigued.

After the injection, she felt dizzy, &#34;the room was spinning&#34; and she was not able to focus on what the vaccinator was saying.  She reported feeling dizzy to the vaccinator who kept her seated and provided bottled water.  Clinic Manager and Vaccine Group Supervisor took initial vital signs.

                                                Towards the evening of the day of the vaccine, I got headache and body aches. Next day, it was like full blown Covid all over again - joint aches; fever - 101.6; sweats; body aches; rash around the injection site; headache; redness and warmness around injection site, too. I had extreme fatigue.I had a terrible cough. I didn&#39;t have a sore throat. I had a lot of shortness of breath. My shortness of breath and my cough was still lingering (from when I had COVID before the vaccine). Went to URGENT Care on Friday, 8th; They Took chest x-ray - COVID pneumonia -was what DR called - antibiotics  - took one course but didn&#39;t finish the second and prednisone - did finish the course of the asteroids. Next day they said the radiologist said it wasn&#39;t pneumonia.  I still felt pretty crappy the following week and then I was fine. I didn&#39;t work 11th or 12th but as the week went on I started feeling better. Symptoms have resolved. I had the second vaccine on February 2nd, 2021. It went better then first - but I had joint aches; fatigue; headache;chills on the day after and then they slowly tapered off the next two days and then I felt fine.

                                                I began with having tremors/chills a few hours after receiving the vaccine.  I then developed a fever and pain, redness, swelling and warmth at the injection site.  Second day fever was up to 103.6, worsening symptoms.  Today (day 3), continued fever, very severe headache (can hardly open eyes or stand up), aches all over, appetite loss, shaky, chills, nauseous, hard to get out of bed.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:25 pm on Saturday Feb 13th. I woke up early Sunday unable to sleep due to all over body aches and joint pain. I did not have a fever at any point. I had chills off and on, but mostly horrible body aches everywhere. My left arm was also extremely sore. I knew this was all normal so I was not at all worried. Then Sunday evening my right knee started aching more than the rest of my body and started swelling. I took ibuprofen and went to bed. When I woke up Monday morning it was severely swollen and bright red and heat was radiating  from it.  I had to take a day off of work because I stand at work and it was making it much worse. So I iced it and elevated it and took ibuprofen, but it remained swollen and red and very painful. I was unable to bend the knee and couldn&#39;t crouch down or bend the knee to sit.  On Wednesday morning I went to my doctor at the clinic on the advice or a friend that is a nurse and a friend that is a pharmacist. See below (item 19) for what was prescribed. This took away the severe swelling within about a day and a half, but it&#39;s still painful and achy and hurts to bend. There is also still a bump on the top of my knee.  The all over body aches and joint pain lasted until about Friday the 19th . I have photos of my knee if you would like them.

Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

Fever and pain subsided a bit by the next morning at 8am but not fully. I stayed in bed and was in and out of sleep until 1 or 2pm. Headache and bodyaches stayed with me throughout the day and fever stayed at or above 101. Around 3 o?clock I took pain medication and was able to go about my day almost as normal but with fatigue.

Around 6:30 that evening I got very dizzy and shaky and needed to sit down. The next day I was very tired, had a headache, very foggy minded, an upset stomach, and the injection site hurt bad. I slept a lot that day. On the 1st of March I am feeling tired and have an even worse headache and have had an upset stomach and am tired.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

                                                Patient received a COVID vaccination for her second dose on 3/3/21 at 1538.  She had informed the staff of the clinic that she did have a local reaction following her first dose (9days later) that she saw her PCP for. This was just treated with Zyrtec and no further intervention.  At 25 minutes following her second dose PA noticed that the patient appeared flushed.  He checked with the patient and she said she was ok.  A few minutes later noticed the patient was even more flushed.  At that time went and evaluated the patient - her BP was elevated 150/94 HR of 112 ad Pulse ox of 96%.  The patient reported feeling different than how she felt after her previous injection.  Clinic team offered for patient to be transferred to ER for further evaluation if she would like which the patient accepted.  She was transferred to ER via wheelchair in less than 5 minutes in stable condition with mild nausea.  She was cared for in ER by Dr.  Patient reported feeling tired and &#39;heavy&#39; in the ER.  Dr evaluation found a generally healthy patient with a non-toxic appearance  Lungs were clear and no obvious signs of swelling or other signs of an immediate allergic reaction.  Patient was given oral diphenhydramine and observed until she felt comfortable going home.  Discharged from ER at 1733

Started 3/3 around lunch and ended 3/4. I noticed that my arm has a huge red hot swollen hard swollen knot in it and it is itchy. 3/5 my arm is still itchy, swollen, hot and red.

                                                Felt migrating heat/burning sensations off an on to the left arm after first vaccination which would come and go. After the first vaccine my heart rate elevated for about a minute with pounding, which I was evaluated for and then it subsided.  Two weeks after vaccination, a burning sensation returned to my left arm (where I had been vaccinated) and the sensation would come and go for the following two weeks. After my menses, I noticed that I started to feel hot sensations to both of my upper arms, which I then noticed to my upper back and neck. I questioned whether I should get the second vaccine and was not sure where the symptoms were coming from. I have never experienced anything like this before. I questioned if it was an anxiety symptom. I had the second vaccine and my right index finger and thumb briefly went numb, my heart rate elevated for a couple of minutes and then subsided.  The burning sensations  then became worse and the burning became so intense that it kept me up at night. Sensations have since also been felt to my low back, sides of hips and down the legs. I had an acupuncture treatment and was started on herbs which helped significantly so I could sleep. I also established a visit with an MD to explain my symptoms and was told to come back in a few days to have labs drawn.  The symptoms have not gone away. These sensations affect my work as I am a healthcare provider and need the use of my hands.  It has now been over two weeks and my symptoms have not gone away. Now I have migrating sensations that move all over my body which elicit a feeling of burning.  It seems that the sensations become worse as the day goes on and that they are not as prominent in the morning.

She has a history of anaphylaxis to foods so she was observed for 30 minutes without any issues. As she went to her car to leave, she began feeling some throat itchiness and returned to let us know. We went to our first aid room and observed her further. Vital signs were taken and she had a slightly elevated blood pressure but good oxygenation and no change in voice character or breathing.  She was very anxious at this point and began saying she felt like her throat was going to swell .  It was decided to administer Epi and as soon as the needle inserted, she expressed immediate relief of her symptoms. An ambulance was summoned and she was brought to the ER.

Two days later, I developed a painful rash on my torso (under my breast on the right hand side). On  3/5 the rash spread to my back (if you drew a line from the rash on my torso to the rash on my back they would be in around the same spot on the right hand side).  The pain and itching intensified. I was able to get a Teladoc appointment. I participated in a video  appointment and had to send pictures of my rash. I was diagnosed with Shingles. I have never had Shingles prior to this. I?m only 38 years old.  The symptoms are still present with the same intensity and I am not able to work.

                                                Mar 5-2:30pm: arm began to feel sore. Mar6-12:00am  I can barely lift my left arm above chest level. The soreness has traveled from the injection site down to my wrist and fingers. The injection site is slightly pink, not really noticeable, and warm to the touch. I start to feel a little nauseous and also starting to get body aches and chills. From 12:00am-4:00am i constantly wake up because of arm soreness and body aches. At 4:00am, I woke up  to use the restroom and realized even the bottom of my feet hurt with every step I took. Took my temperature and it was at 101.5.  I went back to bed and fell asleep even though I kept waking. At 7:00am, the migraine started. I was trying to avoid taking meds just to be able to get a clear picture of how my body responds to the vaccine, But by 9:30am (22hrs post vaccine) I ended up taking Tylenol for severe migraine. It feels like someone is stabbing my temples with a very sharp object. Turning or even slightly moving my head strengthens the migraine. My arm is still so sore that I can barely move it!  Tylenol brings temperature down to 100.7°. 10:30am I began with extreme fatigue. By 12:30pm I went back to bed because I couldn?t stand my body aches and migraine. I slept until 4:00pm woke up feeling a little better. Migraine was still there but not as bad. At 8:00pm I began to feel pressure on my chest. That pressure slowly turned into pain. By 9:20pm I was in excruciating pain, I was in tears and I literally thought I was going to die. It hurt to breath. I checked into the ER by 9:30pm the pain was sharp and it would come, last a few minutes, then slowly ease off a bit. On a scale of 1-10 if was definitely a TEN!!!! The ER said it wasn?t cardiac so they sent me home. The DR did say that the chest pain could have possibly been caused by the vaccine, as many have seen different symptoms and everyone has reacted differently. I was home by 1:15am. The pains continued until 3:00am. By 8:30am on Sunday Mar 7, the only thing I was suffering from was soreness in the arm and my chest was sore from the pain. The pain in my chest was a 1 or 2 compared to the 10 that it was when I went to the ER, And that pain/discomfort has lingered all day.  I?m currently 22weeks 4days pregnant with a boy and expected to deliver July 7th. I?ve been pregnant 19 times have 4 living children and suffered 14miscarriages.

Approximately 4.5 hours later on January 6, 2021, I went outside in the cold temperatures. Upon returning inside to warmer air, the bilateral fingertips of both hands were pale white, numb, and painful. The time was 06:30 pm on January 6, 2021. At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.  January 6, 2021 at 06:32 pm was the first time I have ever had my hands respond in this manner to cold temperatures. I have felt one fingertip go numb and turn white for a split second, only one time in my life but it was not a repeat occurrence, and it only lasted for about a second when it occurred. This experience and reaction I currently have lasts from 15-30 minutes of bilateral fingertip numbness and discoloration with pain. The bilateral fingertips of both hands now respond in this manner every time they are exposed to cold temperatures. I signed up for V-Safe and did state that I was having this symptom through the Vaccine reporting system on V-Safe under other&#39;&#39; multiple times. Treatment I received from a health provider are as follows; I had a telemedicine visit on January 14, 2021 at 12:51 pm to address my concern of ?reaction to Covid vaccine, fingertips were numb, lasting 30 mins?. On 1/14/2021, I received a primary diagnosis of Raynaud&#39;s Syndrome by my Primary Care Provider.  On 1/28/2021, I was seen in person by my Primary Care Provider for a Well Visit to complete a physical with my primary care provider. I was provided with a referral to a Rheumatologist for further advice about receiving the additional second Covid vaccination in the series. I also was ordered to do lab work. On 2/2/2021, I was seen by a Rheumatologist for new diagnosis of Raynaud?s Syndrome, and advised that risk outweighed the benefits in regards to receiving the second vaccination in the Moderna Covid-19 series. On 2/3/2021 at approximately 1:45 pm, I received the second Moderna Covid-19 vaccination.  On 2//10/2021, small red, itchy bumps started to appear on both sides of my neck. On 2/15/2021, a bump appeared above my right eyebrow with what felt like a pimple. On 2/21/2021, the pimple had spread towards my inner eye and above my right eyebrow making my right eyelid swell. I received telemedicine care via an e-visit over telehealth with an urgent care and was provided an antibiotic for facial cellulitis. On 2/22/2021, I had one episode of emesis, and went in person to an urgent care. I received a different prescription of an antibiotic, and was provided with instructions of signs and symptoms of what to look for when to report to the emergency room. On 2/25/2021, my right eye started tearing up and the pain began to intensify. I was seen in an outpatient Ophthalmology Clinic and diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus and postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia. I was placed on a leave of absence from work as of 2/26/2021. 3/1/2021, I was seen in-person appointment with my primary care provider hoping to provide a work note, further assessment of shingles that have spread over neck and back of neck. Primary Care Provider noted diminished bilateral lower extremity muscle weakness and absent deep tendon reflexes.  Primary Care Provider referred me to the Emergency room ASAP to rule out Guillain Barre and herpes zoster meningitis.  Evaluated by the Neurology Consult team in the Emergency Room. Discharged with diagnosis of disseminated shingles and muscle weakness. Appointment made to Neurologist follow up on March 16, 2021 and for EMG/NCS.  On 3/5/2021, seen in-person by Primary Care Provider for hospital follow up. I was feeling diminished sensation increasing in feet, muscle weakness and pain radiating up my back along my spine at times, and near my shoulder/neck. Primary Care Provider was unable to do anything for me.  3/5/2021, followed up with Neurology in person. An order placed for MRI with IV Contrast of Brain and Spine. 3/9/2021, MRI of brain and Spine with IV Contrast completed. 3/9/2021, a re-eruption of shingles started to appear on bilateral areas of my chin and middle of my forehead close to my eye where the nearly resolved shingles were on my eye. 3/10/2021- Order placed for lesions to be swabbed for HSV and VSV and Dermatology Consult placed for 3/15/2021.

                                                Around 5 pm I had diarrhea, like how you poop from the colonoscopy prep medicine. It didn?t stop until my system was on empty. I tried my best to stay hydrated, but I?d have the diarrhea again if I drank enough to feel hydrated. I went to sleep around 9-10 pm with a sore arm &amp;  bad headache, feeling nauseous. I slept until about 4 am. When my husband woke up for work at 4 am, I was starting to feel pretty bad. I was anxious, felt like my heart was racing, couldn?t stop yawning (every 5 minutes for hours), was having severe leg and feet cramps (lasted as long as the yawning), fever of 102, headache, decided to take Tylenol. I kept falling asleep and waking up. At about 8-9 am the severe cramping and yawning stopped. I still had a fever. It was about 101.5, even with Tylenol in me. I continued to take Tylenol. My body was very tired at this point. I slept on &amp; off all day. My temperature went back and forth from about 101-102 the day after the vaccine. I went to sleep that night with a fever, although a little lower. I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours, it was helping but wasn?t making my fever go away. Day two I was weak and had a low grade temperature 99.5-100.5.  Day three I was finally starting to feel like I was getting a bit better. On and off my temperature was going up to 99.5-99.9, but no Tylenol anymore. It was the worst reaction I?ve ever had to a vaccine. I?m still not 100% myself, I still have a nasty headache. If there was a third dose in another month, I don?t think I?d go back for it. I?d be afraid it would get worse.

                                                The day after the vaccine all day I had a weird scary feeling in my chest which was the same feeling I got right when a nurse in 2017 pushed Ancef into my IV and then seconds later I had an anaphylactic reaction.  That day after the vaccine I was very lethargic, lightheaded and nauseous that whole day, but then felt fine the following day.  13 days after my 2nd dose of the vaccine I woke up with urticaria all over my body.  Every day since then I have urticaria that gets worse at night and early morning.  Last night I developed angioedema of my upper lip along with severe urticaria covering my whole body.  I took 50 mg of Benadryl and a Zyrtec and when woke up this morning, the urticaria was mostly gone, but I still have the angioedema, which has lasted all day today.  I have no other symptoms currently.

I could not go to work that day because I felt so ill. At 7 days after vaccine I developed a small rash on right arm. It is around and to the side of vaccine site. Over the last few days it has grown bigger. It is hot to the touch and is painful. I also have lymph nodes that are enlarged under armpit.

                                                About 2 to 3 hours after the shot I was hit with severe fatigue and in both legs on the back of my thighs they hurt and I felt like I was about to fall because I was walking at the time. I had some chills and arm pain the day after the 2nd shot and where I got the shot it was hard, raised, Red and hot to the touch. And a slight headache. I woke up today 3/21/21 and my arm still hurts and it seems like the knot is even bigger with redness and still hot to the touch.

                                                got her first Moderna COVID19 vaccination on Wednesday 03/10/2021. She had no immediate problems with the shot such as arm pain or any other concerns, but by the next day 03/11/2021 she woke feeling very exhausted. They were having tests, and she is one of the main people in charge of this, so she just wrote it off as a reaction to stress. However as the day went on she was feeling worse including low-grade chronic headache, nausea, intermittent palpitations and waves of dizziness. She even had a little anxiety attack, thus she went home Thursday afternoon. She forced herself to go back to school the next day, knowing that if she could get through that day, she&#39;d have a whole week off for spring break. Unfortunately, despite decreased stress, she continued to feel poorly. She has a feeling of profound fatigue, constant headache at the base of the skull that Tylenol really doesn&#39;t touch, nausea, stomach rumbling, intermittent dizziness, and intermittent palpitations.  Not surprisingly, her anxiety has increased, so she started sertraline 25 mg one half tab on Tuesday 03/16/2021, and on Saturday 03/20/2021 she increased it to a full tab. Now taking PharmaGABA at night to keep the anxiety and heart racing down.

It seemed to be going away but the next night I was woken up in the middle of the night with extreme throbbing pain in my right knee. It was swollen but no injury had occurred. I couldn?t put any weight on it. I went to health. They diagnosed it as patellar bursitis with unknown cause. They checked my blood and ruled out gout and or trauma as a cause. My blood showed signs of an immune reaction (possible infection) but it was 2 days after vaccination. To be safe they put me on a 10 day course of antibiotics because of the rapid onset they were afraid it might be a localized infection that could spread (but couldn?t determine a cause as there was no injury or broken skin in the area).  I couldn?t put any weight on my knee and dr advised 3 days off work to elevate, compress, and ice. I am still using a knee brace at work and it is still mildly swollen. No known cause or signs of trauma.

Around 4:45 am, I started to have severe chills and body aches were getting worse even when I took 800mg Ibuprofen. I left work and felt really cold and my body would not stop shaking and crying due to the body aches. My fever reached 103 degrees and when I took Ibuprofen the fever went down to 100 degrees and I had a sore throat.

                                                About 11 hours after my vaccine shot (1st dose) I experienced constant racing rapid heart palpitations, a dull but constant stomach pain, overall dizziness and disorientation, and a feeling of being &#34;hot&#34; but no fever (temperature was just 98.4 degrees).   The stomach pain and dizziness and feeling hot subsided but the rapid heartbeat continued into the morning 19-20 hours later after the vaccine. I am submitting this 19-20 hours after the vaccine still experiencing heart palpitations and reporting on my over-night complications.

Then after that the fatigue stayed with some low grade temperature spikes off and on but never above 100.4. Took Tylenol. Then about a week after the vaccine I started feeling very fatigued. Hot all over like my skin was burning, and fatigued and weakness progressed. These symptoms were are first sporadic then progressed to daily. Eventually experience limb numbness, started having difficulty speaking. So fatigued I could barely get out of bed. Finally I got in to see the doctor after calling off from work for being to ill. Medical leave started 3/3/21 officially. I was hospitalized on 3/9/21 after symptoms progressed even worse to right sided facial weakness and body weakness with some left sided involvement. I stayed the night. All lab work and MRInwas conducted. All were pretty much. Normal. Neurologist hyppothisixed it was a combination of the vaccine causing a POtS flare with my system and the trialing of metoprolol for almost two weeks after my second shot, but the medication is hard to say. He said it was more likely due to my bodies reaction to the vaccine. My cytokine levels was not drawn until over a month later and it high. Currently I can still barely function 1-2 hours a day in intervals.

I?m coughing so hard that I tore my throat. I?ve had extreme flu symptoms for a week. My fever never surpasses 99.1 but I have mucus, sneezing, severe fatigue, severe cough. I?ve had to take off work, quarantine because think I have covid. It?s terrible and no one else I?ve talked to has had it this bad.

She looked at her arm and noticed below the injection site was a reddened area approx 2.5 inches long by 2.0 inches wide.  The &#34;bee sting sensation&#34; has gone away shortly after noticing the reddened are and now is just tender to the touch.  Encouraged patient to put Ice on the reddened area and or Tylenol or Ibuprofen if needed for pain or swelling. Patient will report back to me tomorrow.  The health department will monitor this situation over the next couple of days. Encouraged patient to follow up with her primary care physician for worsening symptoms.

                                                6 days after vaccination, I started to feel ill. Throat slightly scratching, almost like I was getting a cold. Then it went away. 7 days after vaccination, same thing, started to feel a little ill. Developed an itch at injection site. Nothing could be visually seen at the injection site. Within a few hours, half dollar sized round res spot appeared, with knot under it. Warm to the touch. Felt like a sunburn, with a knot under it. Day 8 after vaccination, woke up with double the size of circle at injection site. By end of day, pounding headache on left side, felt nauseous and unwell. Injection site itchy, warm to touch and began to grow in size. Went to urgent care. Once there, injection site was about the size of a baseball. Dr stated it was a reaction and prescribed an antibiotic and oral steroids. He noted how hard the knot was and was worried about cellulitis and infection. He told me to report this delayed reaction and advised me to not get a second dose. Since being there, about an hour ago, I feel worse. Ears are ringing loudly, increased headache, and almost a wet feeling at swollen injection site.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 EUA Received shot at hospital at 2:30 pm on Jan. 5th.  Had a mildly sore arm that evening and next day at work.  I did notice I had a hard, reddened welt area around injection site, about an inch and half in diameter.  At 8:15 pm on Jan. 6th, I became increasingly achy, and by 9 pm, I could barely stand without my entire body aching.  I took 600 mg of Ibuprofen along with my usual nightly meds of Ambien, Trazodone, and 50 mg benadryl.  It was very hard to sleep that night, as no position was comfortable, and even the weight of the blanket hurt my skin all throughout my body.  I called in sick to work Jan 7th.  I continued to take Ibuprofen and benadryl as directed on the label throughout the day.  Around 4 pm on the 7th, I finally started to feel some relief from the body aches.  My upper left arm remains slightly itchy and has an even larger reddened area now, that measures 3 inches as of today, Jan. 16th.  It remains warm to the touch, and slightly hardened under the skin.  I do have pictures of my arm from January 6th, the day after receiving the injection, but prior to becoming achy, and from today, January 16th, that I would be willing to share.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccination around 10:00am. It was confirmed that it was okay to get the vaccine being that I tested positive for Covid on 12/23/20. Around 19:00 I started to get cold and by midnight I was shivering uncontrollably, I had a fever and had a massive headache. I alternated ibuprofren and Tylenol which did not work. I was only able to sleep from midnight to about 3:00am. The entire day I was shivering with a massive headache. It hurt so bad that I wanted to cry but it hurt worse when I did cry. My highest fever was 101 degrees. My fever broke around 19:00 on 01/05/2021 but the massive headache and body aches lasted the entire week. I felt like I was &#34;hit by a bus&#34; and my entire top part of my arm was in pain . I was seen by a doctor  at HS on Thursday the 7th to have my medical condition documented. My arm felt better by then. She had me take off the rest of the week and to return to work on the 11th. I finally started to feel somewhat better by the 9th

                                                Got my 1st covid vaccine around 9:30 am 1-18-21. Shot was administered with no issue, waited my 15 minutes and went home. Was feeling a little tired throughout the day and around 9 pm noticed I was starting to notice some mild flu skin, body aches and headache.  Went to bed around 10 and had slight shivering but figured it was maybe just a low grade fever and covered up with another blanket.  Within 20 minutes I had full blown rigors. My husband had me take a hot shower thinking it might help but it did not. I had uncontrollable shaking for a couple hours then finally fell asleep (I did wake myself up once from shaking). I woke up at 4 am no longer shaking but I had a terrible headache,  my whole body ached and I was wet with sweat. My muscles and joints were so sore I barely was able to walk to the bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up around 6 (had to get kids up for achool) but I couldn&#39;t so had my husband get them ready. He brought me some acetaminophen and I slept until 11am. Got up and still had body aches and headache but not as bad as in the night. Slept on and off all through the day 1-19-21 taking acetaminophen 2 more times for headache and sore body. Went to bed around 10 pm and woke up back to normal 1-20-21

                                                I had burning at the injection site immediately after receiving the vaccine. As I was leaving after 15 minutes I mentioned it to the person checking me out. At this time we noticed redness and hives starting at the injection site. I was told to sit for another 15 minutes but as soon as I sat down again the hives spread rapidly and I began to have dizziness and confusion. At this point I was taken to the ER and on the way I started having nausea and my throat started burning and felt tight. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and solumedrol and IM epinephrine. Since discharge I had one instance of hive and facial swelling and continued to take Benadryl for two days. I am now having episodes of shortness of breath and tachycardia.

                                                Legs extremely weak and felt like muscles were not functioning well. Knees were buckling while standing. Started about 4 hours after vaccination. Resolved by morning but fatigue continued. It was the exact same sensation felt last March and led to me not being able to get off couch for three weeks. Couldn&#39;t get covid testing until weeks after symptoms started and tested negative in March.   Numbness in lips. Lower lip&gt;upper. Started 2 days later. Resolved after gradually improving after 10 days. Fyi had lip injection/filler within the last 2 years. Moderate burning in Rt leg that started the Friday after the vaccine. No redness or edema. Resolved after 10 days.   Severe brain fog and fatigue and buzzing sensation in head. Much worse than baseline. Buzzing sensation was new. Slept all weekend. Improved to baseline after 14 or so days. Had sharp stabbing pains in the back of my head 7 days after the vaccine. Resolved after 3 to 5 days. Never had these sensations before. No history of headaches.  Went to PCP regarding leg pain, worsening brain fog and fatigue from baseline and unequal pupils that had previously resolved about 2 years prior. Pupils were unequal sizes when I woke up on 1/2.  Pupils now back to frequently being different sizes. No diagnosis made with previous episodes that had resolved. Maybe it was reactivated?  Also had visual distortions in left eye that were new on 1/3 that lasted two minutes. No pain associated with this.  Resolved.   Feel close to baseline now but hesitant to get second dose for these reasons.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

In the next 6 hours, I threw up 2-3 more times, the headache also became worse (7 on a 0-10 scale), I got chills and was sweating, and could not get out of bed. My arm was sore, but the other sx were so bad, I did not notice. By midnight I was a little better. I slept on and off for 18 hours, then by 2pm, I was good enough to get out of bed and take a shower. I slowly became better and better and today (Monday - 3 days later), I am fine and was able to run a few miles.

                                                Night of the vaccine, arm hurt at the injection site, very slight raised area about the size of my palm. I woke up with my left pointer finger and thumb side of my hand starting to swell.  Pain at the injection site (slight) when my arm is not in motion and when my arm is in motion. 9:45 am the swelling was continuing and I felt strange all over, head felt cloudy, so I took Benadryl. 10:27 am hand swelling is reduced, but head and body still feel strange. Some acid-reflux type feeling happening Generally feeling off today.

                                                A few seconds of the injection I experienced moderate light headedness which resolved quickly.  The following morning I began experiencing moderate aches and pains, generalized malaise which resolved quickly with Tylenol.  As the progressed, the achiness and increased and did not resolve quickly with Tylenol.  By 2:30 pm that day, I experienced chills that did not stop, and pain in the bones of my legs that felt like flashes of extreme heat, especially on the femur.  I began experiencing nausea. That night I was unable to sleep more than 3 hours.  Around 1 am of January 27th I began feeling chills, and pain once again.  I took Tylenol, and after a short while I began sweating.  Generally, the pain, chills, and burning sensation stopped that morning, however the nausea continued through the day, especially after trying to eat.

                                                around 3 in the morning  I was awakened by the pain and discomfort  I was feeling throughout my whole body. I couldn&#39;t even turn over due to the pain I was feeling. I felt like my body had been hit by a truck, it brought me to tears several times. It continued for about 13 hours and then it was gone, just like that. I took 400mg ibuprofen and benadryl every 4 hours from 6am - 4pm that day and by 5pm I felt no more medication was needed and just like that it was over.

                                                The next two days I had a sore arm. But a week later, the following Monday and Tuesday, I had fatigue and headaches. I put the date as Wednesday because that is when the concerning possible reactions began. I woke with clogged ears feeling very sick. I took Advil Cold and Sinus and arranged to miss work. It felt like a possible ear infection in my left ear. Also my forearms were painfully sore. I had lifted a heavy box up the stairs the afternoon before but the pain in my arms was immeasurably more than ever expected. My ankles were also very tender as I had done a little jogging the day before and I normally walk. As the day progressed I was barely able to get out of bed. Sleeping and just laying there. My highest temperature was 101.25 at 2:45 pm. I had severe chills on and off. I reported these afflictions and was mailed a covid test by Thursday. The test came back negative by Friday evening. Wednesday night my whole body was tender and I had no appetite. I took tons of vitamins and drank tonic tea and took advil and nasal allergy medication. I am still using all of those. Thursday I woke drenched in sweat. My head was mostly cleared just a wet ear and I had a low grade fever on and off through the day. Just touching my body against a surface was painful. Or putting my hand on my hip. My forearms and ankles were no longer worse than the rest. I received my covid kit and taking it to be mailed was the only time I left my house. I was surprised to find extreme difficulty walking down the stairs with muscle strain and pain in my joints. I was not nauseous but had no appetite. Friday I woke up hungry and felt better. No fever. Fatigue and body tenderness but it was better. Saturday my body is only sore on my glands and jaw and back of head. And my muscle is sore in my left arm. The oddness of that being where my shot was given is what makes me wonder if it was an extreme reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it is a flu. I have never had the body pains I try to describe before.

                                                In the evening of receiving the vaccine, I started to feel brief sharp pains in my chest/ back.  Overnight, I was awoken by continued shooting  pains all over my body, and also fine shaking.  Around 2AM a headache started and progressed to be the worst headache of my life.  It was received in the morning by tylenol.  In the morning, I experienced extreme exhaustion and dizziness after climbing stairs I almost passed out, had to rest on the floor.  Later in the day I experienced hours of chills, a temp to 103, which came down with tylenol. By the evening I was feeling well but tired.  Today, 2 days after vaccination, I have neck soreness and am a little tired but well.

Went to bed and was restless throughout the night.  Woke up in the morning and had body aches, exhaustion, intense joint pain, and sore arm.  Join pain increased throughout the morning. Was feeling too poorly to go to work. Was able to subdue pain with ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 3:30pm, 26 hours post vaccination,  symptoms had all subsided except injection site still sore to the touch.   42 hours post vaccination, feeling back to normal, went to work, all symptoms gone.

Over the next 3 weeks, my headache increased in nature, and accompanied with stiff neck, stiff hips and I could only lay on my back to sleep. The headache was mainly on my right side behind my eye.  I tried a high dose of naproxen, as well as massage, chiropractic and got no relief.  Finally on  February 2nd,  I went to the urgent care associated with my primary care provider because my primary care provider was not available.

                                                Day 1: 7 hours after the vaccine shot, I experienced mild fatigue and chills. Overnight, I had night sweats and insomnia. (Night sweats are a symptom that started after the first vaccine shot, and had dwindled until the second brought them up again).   Day 2: The next morning, I experienced intense fatigue, dizziness, chills, fever, headache with light and sound sensitivity, nausea, and intense fatigue. I was unable to get out of bed most of the day. I could not sit up without intense effort to even drink water. At approximately 11am, I took 600mg Tylenol, then was able to sleep for 3 hours. When I woke up my symptoms were much better, though I still had mild fatigue and achiness.   Day 3:  I was mildly fatigued but otherwise felt good.   Day 4: I awoke with a series of small rashes on my torso (front, back, and sides), as well as my inner arm. They were red, flat, not raised, and mildly itchy, One was around my umbilicus, a few under my breasts, and other splotched in random other places on my torso. My inner ears were also mildly itchy. I put generic rash cream on the rashes on my torso and arms, and the itchiness subsided. The redness decreased throughout the day, though they were all still visible by evening.    Day 5: I awoke and my entire torso was bright red *except* the places where the rashes had been the day before, which were normal skin color. Ears are itchy again, and skin is very mildly itchy. Other than that, no other symptoms. No trouble breathing, good energy.   I have never had rashes or an allergic reaction like this before. I assume it&#39;s an allergic reaction, due to the itchy inner ears and skin.

Upon sitting down, sudden onset of extreme chills, to the point of shaking so terribly that my muscles hurt.  I sat with 4 or 5 blankets on me and tried to rest until the shaking subsided.  I asked a family member to sit and monitor me, as I was unable to do anything due to the shaking.  This lasted approximately 2.5 hours, then stopped, leaving my muscles feeling sore and overworked. It was exhausting.

                                                She had pain in the injection site Tuesday night and then during Tuesday she got worse with nausea and some fever.  By Wednesday she was complaining that she could not pee even though she was drinking a lot of fluids.  She continued to complain it was the worst she ever felt and then at 0600 Thursday morning she woke us up and said she needed to go to the hospital.  We arrived at the hospital just before 0700 and she immediately threw up in the trash can.  We went into a treatment room and they took blood and started fluids as she became incoherent.  She said she had taken Tylenol so they started a drug to counter that but her liver function was all wrong and they started to look for a hospital that could transplant a liver.  She was air evade about 0930 to Medical center and just over 30 hours latter she was dead.  There is a pending autopsy.  She was a healthy 39 year old mother who got the shots because she worked as a surgical tech and she was the single mother of a 9 year old little girl.

Pt denies heart disease, strokes, diabetes, increased bleeding tendency. No early heart disease in family. LMP in the last week. Pt notes she was supposed to see allergist in past, but has not. Pt was feeling well this morning before she came to COVID vaccine clinic. Pt had received first Moderna Vaccine shortly before 0918am here. At 0938 Pt noted feeling &#34;heaviness&#34; in head and &#34;lump in throat.&#34; Pt denied itching/swelling to mouth, itching/hives to body, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea. No lightheadedness/dizziness. Pt walked to stretcher. BP at right forearm was 223/151 and then 221/132 on repeat. Heartrate in 90s. Sao2 on RA 100%. RR 18. Pt notes having high BPs at times, but not often as high here. Pt speaking is slightly hoarse voice. No strider. Pt speaking in full sentences. No oropharyngeal edema. No urticaria. No tachypnea or wheeze. HRT RRR. 2&#43; left rad pulse.  A/P: given Pt&#39;s h/o severe allergies and now new Globus sensation and change to voice I discussed with Pt that she was likely having allergic reaction. Given involvement of airway I recommended epi administration to neutralize reaction and transfer to ED for observation. I advised Pt that epi would increase heartrate and blood pressure. I determined benefit of treating anaphylaxis outweighed risk of elevating BP, even though she has hypertensive urgency BP values. Pt has some headache; she could be bordering on hypertensive emergency. I asked pharmacist to call 911 indicating early anaphylaxis and request of paramedic.  ~5 minutes after Epi (given at 0942) Pt notes lump sensation and voice improved. I had RN place IV to left AC and gave verbal order for benadryl 25mg IV. Pt notes some nausea and dizziness. Lump sensation continues to improve. EMS arrived ~0950. I gave report to paramedic.  I discussed with Pt that I would place referral to Allergy and Immunology; they will determine if and when Pt could receive second moderna vaccine.

                                                Woke up really fatigued. Within one hour  January 6  - 10:00 and 10:45 here are all the symptoms that showed up in that 45 minutes. I was in the middle of treating a PT. Scratchy throat; mild cough; persistent moderate headache; runny nose; diarrhea; very pale. Never had a fever. I had weird neurological side affects (didn&#39;t lose taste or smell  ) issues with facial recognition - didn&#39;t recognize my own face and finding words for every day objects and making sentences was difficult . I was easily winded and had tightness in my lungs. I called Public Health office - and asked them what to do. She told me to go home. Dr  (telehealth visit) told me to take a test in the parking lot that day for COVID January 6. Treatment  - none. All o f my symptoms lasted until Friday January 8 except being winded and fatigued. Those last two symptoms lasted until January 19.  Verbal issues also lasted until the 19th of January. Facial recognition came back around January 12.  On January 27 I had second dose.

She then approached me and stated she had mild SOB but was not sure if it was due to her anxiety about the vaccine or if it was a reaction.  She had no other complaints of dizziness, throat swelling, hives, sweating, etc.  She was able to speak without hesitation or difficulty, but I asked her to remain in the store a little longer to be monitored and not to drive home.  Her BP was 123/68 and HR was 66.  She decided to take a alprazolam tablet which she uses for her anxiety.  About 15 minutes later, she did not feel any improvement in breathing, but was still able to speak.  Her BP was 122/68 and HR was 70.  I decided to call paramedics to be safe and evaluate the patient.  The paramedics arrived in about 5 minutes and assessed her.  They stated all her vitals were stable and felt she did not need further intervention unless her symptoms worsened.    She was advised to follow up with her physician.

                                                3/8/21 - received #1 Moderna vaccine in upper left arm.  It immediately caused intense pain throughout my upper arm.  By 5:30 pm, my arm felt like I was carrying a 15 pound dumbell in it.  I could barely move my arm.   3/9/21 - immediately noticed the whole upper arm was swollen with a lump.  I felt very fatigued throughout my whole body and my legs felt very heavy (could not go to work) 3/10/21 - very fatigued and my legs continued to feel heavy and lethargic.  I went to work but could not dance and sing like I typically do in class with my students.  I also noticed I could not lift up my left arm.  I also felt like my brain was very foggy.  I felt that I could have fallen asleep while driving to work and while driving home from work.  That evening I fell asleep at 7:00 pm standing up, leaning on a counter while waiting for my son to brush his teeth.  I have NEVER fallen asleep standing up in my life.  I had to go to bed at 7:30 pm due to extreme exhaustion. 3/11/21 - very fatigued and extreme leg pain.  My calves feel like there are knots twisting inside of them and as if they might explode from the inside out.  Still could not lift my arm high for more than a few seconds.  Could not sleep that night due to the severity of the leg pain. 3/12/21 - very fatigued and extreme leg pain continued and pain in both arms down into my forearms.   My calves feel like there are knots twisting inside of them and as if they might explode from the inside out.  Still could not lift my arm high for more than a few seconds.  I went to bed at 6:30 pm (not normal for me) due to extreme exhaustion and pain throughout my body.    I laid in bed for hours crying in pain until I got up to take Advil PM and finally fell asleep sometime after 11:00 pm. 3/13/21 - had to cancel my weekly class at the gym due to continued fatigue, pain throughout both arms and legs.  Unable to lift my arm long enough to brush hair and do a ponytail for my daughter.  My forearms had so much pain at night.   3/14/21 - could not go to the gym due to continued fatigue and pain throughout my muscles.  I can&#39;t lift my left arm to use a hair dryer.  My left arm has severe pain if I try to even hold my macbook in my left arm. This is horrific.  I am miserable and cannot yet function normally.

She was transported to the local emergency room via ambulance and said at that point she felt like her throat was starting to close.

Around 5PM I started having chills, cold sweats, muscle soreness, nausea, and vomiting. My arm was so sore i could not lift it al all. At some point around 9PM I passed out on my bathroom floor. My 6 year old found me and thought I had died and called her father crying hysterically. I think I was passed out for a few hours before I came too, as my child had the phone on speaker and her and my husband were both yelling at me to wake up. I crawled back to bed and went to sleep.  The next morning 2/4/21, I could hardly move to get my daughter ready for school, I had to call out of work. I was still having  chills, cold sweats, muscle soreness, nausea, and vomiting, headache, and I could hardly move my left arm.  on 2/5/21 I was still very tired, still had nausea, and a headache. 2/6/21 - 2/7/21 I still had a slight headache.  on 2/8/21 I felt better and went to work.

I felt off very quickly post vax and like I was drunk or something after my injection. I have had a high pulse, palpitations, bad headache, jitters, lightheaded/ dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling like I have to constantly swallow (and do), and other post vax issues. I have felt very out of it and overall very cruddy.    I hope you&#39;ll respond to this email so that I know it gets reported.  I have taken a lot benadryl and have an EpiPen handy if I ended up needing it. My mouth has been fine, but not my throat.. but it isn&#39;t closing up so I think it&#39;s okay for it to just be swollen. I have had so much going on post vax that I&#39;ve literally just been laying in bed hoping I&#39;ll feel better.   03/12/2021 The hives have come back and the itching hasn&#39;t ever stopped, my tongue is still super swollen and sore from me constantly accidentally biting it, my throat is still red, swollen, and sore, and I generally feel like crap. I&#39;m taking a ton of antihistamines to combat this and they&#39;re not touching it. I am probably going to need more steroids and a visit to urgent care tomorrow.  :(  03/13/2021  The email is too large with the new pics and it got kicked back...trying again minus the body hive pics.   The hives just keep spreading  :( . I know you can&#39;t see them all because the lighting isn&#39;t great, but you can make out the outlines of the welts like on my forehead. I have hives all over my face, throat, neck, chest, arms, and more every day. My whole body is very itchy even in areas without hives.    I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist&#39;s office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I&#39;ve never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I&#39;m going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can&#39;t take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that&#39;s if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I&#39;m already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t update.  I&#39;m still dealing with hives, but they&#39;re getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called (like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a PAC, PVT, but I do know I&#39;ve had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I&#39;m so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I&#39;ve been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she&#39;s having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I&#39;m passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the &#34;moderna arm.&#34;  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it&#39;s coming back in full force! I&#39;m still taking allergy meds too! This is just crazy!

                                                I received my vaccine in the left arm in the mid-afternoon on Sunday and experienced little discomfort the rest of the day with some soreness in the arm before bed.  The following morning i felt unwell and my arm was extremely sore.  It took some focus and energy to move.  I took 500 mg acetaminophen 3x  and Ondansetron 1x over the day due to feeling nauseous, low-grade headache, tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell.  I felt noticeably irritable.  My arm was sore to the touch and in the late afternoon i noticed i had a mild rash across the back of my arm  starting below my deltoid muscle and spread out and down close to my elbow.  It was not a bright red but the area was remarkably sensitive, so much so that i felt i should report the reaction because ive never had a noticeable reaction to a vaccine so i became mildly alarmed.   I put no creams on the rash nor did i take additional meds.  The following day (today) it has decreased significantly in sensitivity and has faded so much so that if you don&#39;t look for it, you cant easily see it.
