                                                Injection site pain began about 5 hours after getting vaccine and progressively worsened. Unable to lift arm above shoulder without significant pain at about 12 hours post injection. About 13-14 hours post vaccine, began having myalgias, chills. Took ibuprofen with some improvement of symptoms, but unable to sleep due to the combination of arm pain, chills and aches. Body aches and chills were gone by the morning but the arm pain lingered, less than the night before and improving each day, still there today, but much more tolerable.

                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

Woke up in the morning with extreme headache and neck pain as well as pain in injection site. Took tylenol which did not help the pain or headache. Headache worsened until about noon, at which point I could not move due to neck/arm pain and headache. Symptoms dissipated quickly away pretty quickly around 1 PM

Even with water, the fluid only came out from my rectum with some wet and loose stools, the stool coming out as if liquid and not a solid. Even woke me up early morning to go to the bathroom.

                                                On Dec 28 - three hours after vaccine - started getting pain near injection site. It ached. 8:30PM that night I started getting itching from the midback to top of head on left side. Not left arm just the back, neck and face of left side. No rashes but a little red because I scratched. Then I noticed some bumps on my left side of my face and one hive on each knee and one hive on left shoulder. Telemed visit with dr. - took Benadryl - 25 mg. - within one hour of symptoms - at 9:00 pm per dr. Woke up next morning and had intense fatigue; muscles and back were really achy. Couldn&#39;t move my muscles very well. Felt like the wind had been knocked out of me. Bouts of itchiness. Slept throughout the day. That helped. But then had headache start - felt like a circle where my temples are to the back of my head and that is where is stayed. Next day - no fever and  but my symptoms improved except still had the symptoms but they had improved. Went to work on Wednesday because it started to go away - on and off headache - felt foggy. Bouts of itchiness and felt physically weak because my muscles had gotten so so tight. Felt a physical weakness for five more days. Headache went away by Wednesday night (Dec 30th). Itchiness went away. Three days symptoms went away although the physical weakness lingered until 5th  day. Used a heating pad for my muscles to help relax them.

I was talking to people that were not there. I felt completely out of control. The only thing that helped was forcing myself to focus on the TV, which was extremely difficult. Symptoms started to die down around 3 AM, but did not go away. I slept for 4 hours.  1/20 8 AM- felt like and still feel like I am not in reality, I feel disassociated with my body (like its not mine), slightly out of control of my thoughts, I see subtle black and white flashing like last night but not as intense, paranoia like last night/not as intense, cant concentrate.

                                                I had slight dizziness for 20 minutes a half hour after the injection. But that&#39;s not the issue. When the lady gave me the injection, it felt like she wiggled it around in my arm. The injection itself was surprisingly painful. My arm hurt at first like I was punched in the arm on the first day (much like a flu vaccine). But then it got SIGNIFICANTLY worse the next day. I was in excruciating pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine. I had limited arm mobility and any movement caused agony. I couldn&#39;t sleep from the pain. I wasn&#39;t able to do my normal activities. The pain started to subside after 4 days, but had since started to get worse again. I&#39;m in a constant state of pain. It&#39;s now impacting my mental health. I can move my arm, but not without a lot of pain.

                                                I am not sure if the event that happened Sunday was directly related to the vaccine at all since it happened two days later, or if it was just a coincidence, or if the vaccine was just a physical stimulus trigger. I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

Moved to a dark quiet room and had her lay down. Per her report she has only gotten 3hrs of sleep the last two nights. Vitals stable at BP 126/88 (102), HR-65, 97%, and 36.8. Rechecked vitals throughout stay remained stable. Laid down for 15mins and then sat up. After feeling good sitting up she had water, juice and crackers.

Tingling, numbness, and coldness later expanded to the entire left side of my body, which persisted for more than 8 hours. It felt like the left side of my body was somewhat disassociated from the other side.

As soon as I felt queezy I passed out. I woke up they said within about 30 seconds and had full body sweats. Stomach ache, dizzy and head was tingly like I would pass out again. My calfs hurt like they had previously had muscle cramps. I went to ER, blood and urine tests were fine, heart and blood pressure was fine. Dr said he did not believe it was an allergic reaction, and that it was a stress response. I am not sure if it is because I had COVID in December.

Was able to sleep off and on every time I turned over onto my vaccine arm I woke because of the pain. Next morning I spent the day in bed with lingering chills, muscle aches, headache, and spasms, but less than night before. High Fever persisted (101.4) and a cough with mild shortness of breath developed. The night of 2/28 I took ibuprofen (same dose as before) and Benadryl which allowed me to sleep all night. This morning (3/1) I feel better, with fatigue, lightheaded, a mild fever of  99.3, and minimal muscle aches. Cough persists.

At this time I took Tylenol. With the fever came a head ache. My injection sight is very painful. I did not sleep very well. When I woke up at 7:00AM my fever was 100 degrees. It has stayed at 100 degrees until this point (1:30 PM). My headache became painful enough that I took 2 excedrin that have relieved most of the headache. My symptoms are improving as the day progresses. My injection site is still very painful. With the normal flu vaccine I get yearly I have never had any problems.

                                                12/29/2020- Received the Moderna Vaccine - no pain or problems until 01/04/2021 01/04/2021- Before bedtime my injection site from the Moderna Vaccine became itchy.  01/05/2020- Woke up to a swollen arm (about 3 times the size of my right arm) and the start of a rash (the size of a softball) Was in significant pain and unable to lift my arm. I called the nurse hotline where I received the vaccine. I was told to go to the ER immediately. The ER doctor informed me that they had been seeing this and that their personal vaccine location swelled up as well but went away a few days later. ER doctor gave me Benadryl cream (I can not ingest Benadryl due to an opposite reaction, I become extremely anxious.) The ER doctor informed me that the Benadryl cream wouldn&#39;t cause the same reaction. I was sent home with the cream and a wrap. Upon arriving home my rash grew exponentially over the following days. The site became hot (even after icing it) It remained itchy and painful.  01/11/2021- Went to primary care doctor. The rash and swelling had decreased although you could still see the ring of the rash. At this point, my hand was becoming numb after doing daily activities including typing. My palm and thumb area started to turn purplish/blueish when I would type for less than 20 seconds. The doctor told me they would start to reach out to other providers and figure out how to best move forward. In the meantime, there wasn&#39;t much to do besides wait and see what happens.  01/13/2021- Woke up throughout the night due to continued pain at the injection site. Called the primary care doctor who wasn&#39;t in the office, waited for a call back from their nurse but due delayed call back and  increased pain and numbness went to urgent care (which is under the same practice as primary care). The urgent care doctor performed tests regarding pinched nerve shoulder (as they believed I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder) and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed tissue damage but nothing else. I was not experiencing shoulder pain, although during one of the shoulder tests I found more discomfort in my left should (injection arm) than my right arm. Therefore, the primary care doctor thought I was experiencing a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  01/14/2021 - Primary care doctor called and informed me they had spoken with the infectious disease doctor in the area who informed them that they have been seeing a similar reaction amongst other people. (7 days after inject, swelling and rash) The infectious disease doctor reported they hadn&#39;t seen numbness. The primary care doctor advised me to wait 2 weeks to see how symptoms change before performing additional tests. The primary care doctor also advised me after speaking with the infectious disease doctor to not take the second shot.  01/16/2021- still experiencing issues with daily functioning. Still experiencing numbness in hand and arm. Still experiencing redness around the injection site (although much better still flairs up at moments)   Side note: 01/03/2021 - Went cross country skiing, did fall backwards but did NOT fall on arm.  Also confusion remains if  I was supposed to report this or if the primary care doctor/ER doctor reported this, therefore, urgent care doctor told me to report this reaction.

Had a very restless sleep and woke up with severe sweating around 3 AM. Woke up at 9:30 AM with severe, pounding headache. Attempted to walk around at 10 AM, pounding headache was a 10/10 pain scale when upright. Nausea set in as soon as I was standing, ran to lay down to avoid vomiting. At 10:30 AM I sat up attempted to drink water and the vomiting began. Severe vomiting for about 30 minutes, then intermittent vomiting throughout the day until 6 PM. Headache did not let up all day, no response to medication (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, rizatriptan, magnesium). Headache subsided around 8 PM and  I was able to sleep. No symptoms today 1/22/21.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

                                                My arm is very sore at the injection site to the point where I am having trouble lifting it or applying pressure on it. I also had a very mild headache shortly after receiving the shot. This has come and gone within the last 12-15hours (since I received the shot). I also started experiencing mild chills at about hour 15 after receiving the shot. I?m having a very difficult time sleeping due to the discomfort.

                                                I received the second dose of my Moderna covid vaccine at 10 am on Wednesday February 3rd. Around 8:30 pm I experienced extreme chills and had a 100-101 F fever all night. I woke in the morning still feeling weak because I spent the whole night uncomfortable from the fever and flushed  face I had. I walked towards another part of my house and fell down and fainted. I was unconscious for a few seconds before a family member was able to shake me and wake me up. I take no medications and am a generally healthy individual with no prior medical history or underlying Heath conditions. I also do not have a history of falls or issues from taking any past vaccines. I also am not allergic to anything or have experienced any allergic reactions in my life. It?s the second day now and I am still experiencing a 100 Degree fever and face flushing. I am currently self medicating at home with Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not gone to see a health care professional yet.

                                                Received my first vaccine 1/6/2021. I was very nervous about the vaccine, so I brought 4 epi-pens with me. My PCP and allergist advised me to sit x30 minutes after the shot. 25 minutes after receiving the shot, I felt very warm.  I looked at my hands and they were fire-cracker red in color. I began doffing my sweatshirt and my arms/neck/stomach and back were had a spotty rash. There was no hives/areas of elevation.  Nurses took my BP.  40 minutes without medication, rash and warmth resolved. A few hours later, I had a terrible headache and then around 8pm, I started with bad aches, chills, fever of 101. I took tylenol and did not resolved. The next AM, symptoms continued. I took advil and this had a better effect with sx resolving. My second dose, I received on 2/5/2021. I had a similar response about 10 minutes after the shot but warmth/reddness did not last as long, ~5-10 minutes. Had my BP taken, which was elevated (probably from my own anxiety). a few hours after the shot, I began with the headache, chills and fever--- though all mild. fever was 99 degrees the next day. 2/8/2021, I felt very fatigued and weird for a few hours. this seem to pass and I have felt normal since; just very tired. *** additionally, I did have COVID-19, testing positive 11/11/2020. my sx were mild compared to others.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

The following day 1/12/21 Tuesday I started having itchy rashes on my left ear, along with right arm soreness. The rash on my left ear gradually progressed and spread as days go by until 1/15/21 Friday. I woke up with swollen ears, hives on my face, neck, chest, and upper body. On Saturday morning 1/16/21, my symptoms worsen with more itchy red rashes. On top of the rashes, my lymph node on my left neck felt swollen and tender. Also, I had a weird sensation in my throat that was not going away like something was stuck. After a TeleVisit, I went to the ER that day and got medical treatment. I was given Benadryl, Pepcid, Dexamethasone and IV fluids. Then I was sent home with Cephalexin, Prednisone, Benadryl, and Epi Pen. Right now, I still have symptoms of rashes on my face, ears, and chest but they wax and wane. I can feel it itching beneath my skin even if they are not showing. With my ears, I can say that they are not swollen and are less red now. I have no other known exposure but the Moderna vaccine. I do not have any known allergy either but to bee stings.

                                                I am a MD student who got the first dose of the moderna vaccine on 1/4/2021. I had no immediate reaction other than arm soreness. A couple weeks after my first vaccine, I had a reaction when drinking miralax. Within ~5 minutes of having a few sips of a 17g solution, I had throat tingling/tightening, sense of impending doom, cough, dyspnea, nausea, fecal urgency, and intense chills with shivering. I stopped drinking the solution and my symptoms eventually resolved on their own (the chills and nausea took the longest, about 1.5 hours) - I didn&#39;t even think to take benadryl because it wasn&#39;t clear to me at the time if I was really having an allergic reaction (no hives, no vomiting - but in retrospect I&#39;m concerned). I&#39;ve had miralax in the past without any issues. I&#39;ve never had a vaccine adverse reaction. I have no history of atopy.

                                                Very painful in the area where I got the shot. I usually have a little pain at the site of the injection but this was WAY worse which resulted in me icing the area and taking Ibuprofen. I also could not apply any pressure on the site so I had to make sure I only slept on my right side overnight. The intensity of the pain was MUCH better the next day, and today (2 days later) it is very bearable.  I also experienced lethargy the first evening after receiving the vaccine, but that went away the next day.  On the second evening since receiving the vaccine, I started to experience body chills and some minor body aches. I felt a sense of general malaise that I often experience when sick.

                                                that night I kept waking up because of intense muscle/joint pain in my legs. I also felt hot and cold, almost feverish. I did not take my temperature. That next morning I woke up and took a hot bath, which helped with the pain. I continued to have pain throughout the day, as well as fatigue. The second day after the shot the pain was gone, but I noticed I had a rash around the injection site, about 2 inches wide by 3 inches long.

                                                About 15 minutes after receiving vaccine, she got in her car and noticed a rash, started having light headed.  Thought she needed food, then got the headache and chills.  For the entire night she did have the cold chills.  She went to work the following day and her skin started feeling tingly.  By the time she got home on 2/3/21 she felt nauseous, had temp of 101.8.  The whole night she pretty much swim in sweat.  She went to work and was sent home due to the fever, nonstop sweating, and fatigue feeling like she was going to pass out.  Around 12:00 PM on 2/4/21 she couldn&#39;t keep anything down, she lost 5# since this vaccine.   She took an Ibuprofen 800 which didn&#39;t do much.  She took Pepto-Bismol, Advil and could not hold anything down.   The brain pounding headache that didn&#39;t want to go away yesterday.  She is still having a headache, she feels like every step she takes she has to use the restroom due to diarrhea episodes.  She has been at home trying to sleep through the symptoms and has not seen a doctor as when she called with her first vaccine reactions they did not have any information to tell her since the side effects are so new.  She only gets up today only when she has to use the restroom.  She has been in the bed since she went home on 2/3/21.

The following day, 1/6/21, saw a PA for the blisters and hives due to the itchiness and hydrocortisone was not helping.  Then had a headache, body aches and flushes for at least a week.  She did have shortness of breath and by the weekend she was feeling confused like the feeling of waking up from anesthesia.  She started loosing her balance, could not go up the stairs, trip and fall.  They did lab work, told her that she was fine.  She was having confusion and forgetful and let it run it&#39;s course.  She did have the 2nd vaccine, but is still having hot flushes from it.

                                                Arm pain (normal arm soreness) within first 24 hours. Swollen lymph nodes, especially in the arm pits and neck. I am a fitness trainer and RDN, no weight issue, and very high muscle composition, lungs are in excellent health.   Around mid afternoon next day, several hours after teaching an exercise class, I developed a fever and flu like symptoms. That Saturday night, I developed extreme nausea, along with sleep in and out the entire night due to nausea and fever.   This continued until Monday afternoon, over 2 days later. Then the symptoms disappeared in the blink of an eye, indicated it was definitely vaccination related.

All of my skin, back and spine hurt, in the way that your body is sensitive and extra painful when you have a fever but I checked and I haven&#39;t had a fever yet. All of the day on 02/28/2021 I experienced skin and back pain, headache, fatigue, and brain fog (difficulty focusing and making decisions) as well as swollen and tender lymph nodes in my left armpit and under the left side of my jaw. On 03/01/2021 I woke up and felt better in the morning, I went for a walk around 3 pm and around 4 pm when I got back and sat down I started to experience headache, severe nausea which turned into chest pain and chest tightness and I still have swollen lymph nodes.

Arm was sore but nothing compared to joints (especially hips). Temperature was only slight at 98.7. Headache and body aches, joint pain were severe enough that I was forced to rest and unable to continue daily activities. Ache symptoms quickly dissipated after 48 hours, but a 2 inch diameter welt appeared, slightly raised and itching mildly like a mosquito bite. Welt is still present now, 5 days post-injection.

Warm to the touch and slightly itchy like sunburn.  6 PM - Area  is doubled in size (about the size /shape of a thumb), much redder, and in a well-defined elongated oval shape.  Hot to the touch, firm and painful swelling that made sleeping difficult. Took Aleve and iced it. 1/6/20 7 AM -  Red area has spread out into a less defined circle about 2in in diameter.  Less swollen and painful but still hot to the touch. 6 PM - Area has spread into tear-drop shape about the size of my palm. Drew a line around the area. Still causes some difficulty sleeping. 1/7/20 - Area is less red and not as painful but I can still feel the original area swollen under the skin and hot to the touch. Spread slowed significantly and mostly stayed in the lines.

                                                This is my second pregnancy and at the time of my vaccination, I was 32 weeks 6 days gestation with an estimated delivery date of 2/15/21.  I tolerated the vaccine well initially with only a very minor sore arm the day after the vaccine. On 12/31/2020 (4 days after vaccination), I felt muscle fatigue around my hips and buttocks as well as significant fatigue. It seemed to improve over the course of the day and was not very noticeable for the next few days. On 1/4/21 (8 days after vaccination), my muscle fatigue in my hips, buttocks, thighs, and hamstrings bilaterally became very significant, preventing me from doing some activities that I had planned. I also had generalized fatigue. On 1/5/21, I had similar symptoms, but the muscle fatigue also began to include my shoulders bilaterally. 1/6/21, the muscle fatigue also included my neck and I was physically exhausted. 1/7/21 I started to note some improvement, and I also saw my OB who did bloodwork but also did suspect a possibly delayed reaction to my vaccine. Today (1/9/21) I am still experiencing muscle fatigue, but it does seem to be improved from several days ago.

On 1/7/2021 I started to feel short of breath and run down. Sinus infection symptoms. I was sent home from work to get a COVID swab. That evening I lost my taste and began to feel achey. Negative test on 1/10/21. Saw urgent care on 1/9/21 for Covid swab and visit. He diagnosed viral and was sure I was positive. On 1/11/21 my energy returned and I wasn?t achey. Congestion and cough. By 1/13/21 felt fine other than lingering wet cough. This morning, 1/14/21 I noticed my arm itched and looked at it and I?ve got a small red rash around the injection sight and tenderness on palpation.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine on 01/06/2021. Normal pain at the injection site occured with little concern. Pain in armpit began 01/08/2021. I did not think anything of it, believing the pain to be from an ingrown hair caused by shaving or just something with the vaccine. I ignored it to spend time with family. On 01/12/2021 I noticed the pain had not subsided and deepened into the armpit causing pain to radiate from the area when lifting or moving heavy items.  I palpated the area and felt a pea sized lump. It moved freely. I could not locate it again. I continued to palpate into the top of my shoulder and discovered a large lump in the clavicle area. It is painful to apply pressure. I knew these areas to be part of the lymphatic system. I also did research on side effects of the Moderna vaccine but observed most people to have lymph node symptoms for only 24-48 hours within three days of receiving the vaccine then they subside.  I made an appointment that same day, 01/12/2021, with Dr. at clinic to be examined. At first, Dr was dismissive of my symptoms. Dr did physically examine my areas of complaint and scheduled an ultrasound for 01/15/2021 at  Hospital. On 01/13/2021 I noticed the injection site began to ache again. On 01/14/2021 I awoke from a nap at 6pm. I began showering for work when I felt a burning, itchy sensation on my inner left bicep. I observed two red spots on my inner left bicep close to my armpit with a red rash below the two red spots. I palpated the red spots to find a large and slightly smaller lump under the skin corresponding with the red spots. The rash itches. As of 01/15/2021, the ultrasound had to be rescheduled by the hospital as their ultrasound technician cannot make it into work because of a blizzard. I now have two lumps in the clavicle area that alternate swelling and reducing in size. I&#39;ve been taking tylenol every four hours when I&#39;m awake to control the pain. The ones in my clavicle now cause tension in the left side of my neck. I&#39;ve also applied warm compresses on the affected sites. It helps lessen the swelling for a bit but does come back.

No rotation. It started a few hours after receiving the vaccine. By 5pm it was at it&#39;s sorest and locked in position . Not warm to touch. Just painful.  This lasted a total of 3 days until all soreness and full normal movements without discomfort could resume.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

This continued 3 more times in the am, at times having incontinence. (This has never occurred before.) By 10 am, those symptoms had stopped. Only residual side effects were a headache and sore arm. On 12/31, it was noticed that I had hives on my abdomen and back. They were not itchy and I am unsure how long they had been there for; referred to allergy

Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

                                                Beginning when I woke up the following morning, I had a very severe headache. It lasted all day until I went to sleep. Figured it was from the vaccine and would be gone the next day. It was still there when I woke up again... and the severe headache and extreme light sensitivity in my eyes lasted for 20 straight days. It kept me from being able to work fully and had to cancel many of my client bookings. I had 2 days of no headaches- felt great- Jan 21st and 22nd. Then again through today it has been there. I can?t describe it very well as it feels like it?s all over and the pain is almost unbearable at times. Even when the headache is lessened/subdued by darkness or ibuprofen, I still feel it strongly in my left temple/behind left eye at all times. I haven?t experienced headaches like this ever before in my life, even though I?ve had random headaches here and there in the past. They have never been there when I wake up in the AM though and sleep has always made them go away previously. Although I can?t imagine this is specifically from the vaccine, it also seems like the timing is so related that I was advised to file a report here.

                                                I received the vaccine in my right arm, the placement of the vaccine was more towards the front of my arm, rather then the middle of my deltoid. My right arm was sore the next day (12-30-2020) , which is predicted, but the pain hasn&#39;t gone away. I cannot sleep on my right side, if I do, I cannot lift my arm, it takes a few hours for my arm to &#34;warm up&#34; before I can use it again with minimal pain. The pain is right in the middle of my deltoid, I can palpitate the exact location of the pain.

Soreness and warmth at injection site continued for 10 days.  24 hours after injection, numbness and tingling started and still hasn&#39;t resolved 2 weeks after injection. Decreased strength in right arm, pain and discomfort comes and goes through day and night. Arm will go numb for up to an hour  making it hard to grasp items, write, type, ect. Took Tylenol and Benadryl every evening, applied ice , stretching and movement to work muscle.   Appears that vaccine was given too low instead of 2 in from shoulder, given  6 in from shoulder by pharmacist

My left arm was sore, and I started to feel fatigued  After 10 hours I was extremely fatigued, could barely get out of bed. Body aches, my left shoulder blade was very sore. I had chills, but the flushed skin had gone away.   After 16 hours I had a headache, body aches, fatigue, fever of 101.  Tossed and turned all night, couldn&#39;t sleep   After 20 hours The fever had gone, but occasionally felt chills. I had headache, body aches, fatigue, and left arm soreness. Took 1000mg of tylenol which helped some. And these symptoms have stayed consistent. (Currently 28 hours post vaccine).

Symptoms include severe myalgia, arthralgia, and constant chills but no fever. Moderate headache and tachycardia (100-130, most likely due to pain level). I had to leave work after about 2 hours d/t symptom severity. Symptoms were only slightly improved with 1gram of Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not history of adverse vaccine reactions. Symptoms resolved about 24 hours after onset.

                                                32 weeks pregnant and second dose of Covid vaccine received on 1/21 at 11:00. Flu like symptoms (fever, chills, headache) began 0100 on 1/22 and lasted until about 1300 on 1/23. I had to call out sick from work on 1/22. Worked a 7L shift on 1/24 and at about 2000 noticed a petechial rash on bilateral lower extremities that spread up to lower abdomen. Called on-call L&amp;D Doctor and she advised for me to be assessed at L&amp;D triage. I was then admitted for 4 hours due to my rash and further workup concerning for DIC, thrombocytopenia and/or other possibilities. My petechial rash was very concerning for coagulation disorders and prompted many lab draws to be obtained. My labs showed elevated AST &amp; ALT that were previously normal, low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), protein in urine, elevated alk phos. I was discharged around 0100 for further workup the following day.  On 1/25 I went to clinic to have more labs done per Doctor. 1/26 at about 0830 I was called by my OB Docotor to immediately go back to Labor &amp; Delivery triage to be admitted for what she thought was preeclampsia based on my labs from 1/25 and 1/24. I was again admitted for about 4 hours for monitoring of baby, and myself for preeclampsia. My labs were still elevated and out of range mirroring preeclampsia, but my blood pressure was stable, so I was discharged around 1300. I followed up with labs at clinic on 1/28 and again on 2/2 as well as with home blood pressure monitoring.  My labs on 2/2 showed everything back to normal, causing the doctors involved in my care to believe this was an adverse event due to the moderna covid vaccine.  As a result I missed one day of work, was admitted to the hospital twice, and had 4 days of lab draws which will result in an excess of medical bills.

                                                The first day was fine. I had a huge gulf ball size knot at the injection site  by the next morning, sore and warm to touch (not too unusual). The second night, and since, I can?t sleep. I have severe restless leg syndrome. My limbs feel heavy, but my legs literally ache to the point into painful when trying to sleep. I felt a bit sluggish the day after, but that has since passed. The restless legs is not letting up.

The dizziness worsened after about 30 minutes but the nausea went away. About 30-40 minutes after the shot, my head got very foggy feeling, my limbs felt heavy and weak, and I suddenly became very tired. I don&#39;t have any trouble breathing and my heart rate is fine. I&#39;m just going to sleep it off and drink lots of water.

The building where vaccines were given was 75 degrees that morning the client was bundled up with a winter hat, coat, sweatshirt, and gloves.  When she first stated she wasn&#39;t feeling good we had her remove all her outwear so she could cool off, she immediately began trembling uncontrollably. Vitals were taken 144/78, pulse 125,  4 minutes later 136/74 pulse 100,  5 minutes later 130/82 pulse 80. During this time client continued to tremble. She voiced her anxiety for getting shots and also states she hadn&#39;t even anything yet that day.  She was given 2 large glasses of water which she drank both of them . By 11:00 am she was no longer having any symptoms.

                                                Around 10 minutes after the dose, I started feeling my throat close up, I could not concentrate and felt very dizzy. 20 minutes later I felt a sharp stabbing pain in right side of my throat and my chest/lung area. I started feeling itchy in that area as well. I started getting bumps all over. I took 2 puffs of my Symbicort, Benadryl, and Loratadine. I continued taking the Symbicort and Benadryl. I fell asleep siting up. By 12/24 I could not swallow and it would hurt my chest to breath so I decided to go to the ER.

The patient felt like something was poking her face almost like her face was paralyzed and felt nauseous. The event facial paralysis was considered medically significant and serious.  The patient tried acetaminophen which did not work and then took ibuprofen which was effective.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events confusion, disorientation, could not drive herself/impaired driving ability, nausea, fever/pyrexia, body aches/general body pain, sensitive teeth/hyperaesthesia teeth, poking in face/facial paralysis were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Nausea and fever are consistent with the vaccine safety profile.

                                                Pt had typical first 48 hour side effects. Day 8 post injection pt began to have latent side effects including; itchiness at injection site and beyond, redness with heat, swelling at injection site with spreading for 36 hours, headache with no relief after PO OTC&#39;s, fatigue, muscle ache not relieved with OTC anti- inflammatory.  Pt reports to staff started on day eight with itchiness and redness in one area, a couple of hours later noticed a second reddened area then lumps by the end of the day. Documentation reported by pt to have swelling at site and near site to be more than a golf ball size below injection site (vs at injection site). Pt reported having latent side effects begin on day eight and continue past day 13 (the time of this report). Pt reports not being able to keep up with housework, children, job duties and school work due to side effects. Pt relied on older daughter (under age 13), and parents to assist so that pt did not miss work.

Next day it was on/off pain, with very intense pain when it came on to the point that I was unable to lift or do things. On Sunday (next day), pain seemed to radiate from the shoulder up through my left neck to the cranium area. Monday (today) this evening - pain so intense that I was screaming and sobbing. Husband (also MD) had to medicate me as I was laying on bed screaming unable to move or roll over. He had to manually lift me. Significant pain in left neck (trapezius) area on inhales, near injection site. Pain has been getting worse each night.

As time past I started to get cold and began to get the chills. At this time I started taking my temperature which was running about 99-100F.  The chills became worse and I felt colder and sicker. My temperature climbed to 102.1 at which time I took some tylenol. My fever continued to climb to 103.1 within the next hour. The chills and fever lasted about 6-8 hours and then went away and I became very hot. I went to sleep that night after taking more tylenol just in case. The next morning I had severe fatigue, mild nausea  and a headache that stayed with me the rest of the day. I ended up going home from work due to the nausea and migraine type headache as well as intermittent chills that would come and go. By the next day 1/22 I was feeling much better over all. However a mildly painful red spot that was warm to touch appeared on my arm where the injection site was that stayed for the next 48 hours before disappearing.

About 1am I got a fever but was already taking started tylenol and motrin because I developed a headache also.  The fever went as high as 101.2.  On Tuesday I woke at 2am soaked in sweat and the fever had broke.  Later that day the fever returned at 100.5 but broke on its on.  By Saturday I woke up again with SOB and super cold.  Fever had returned at 101 so I went to Urgent Care  because the fever just kept returning.  A chest xray was done and it showed my lungs were really inflammed.  The fever returned later but went away.  The SOB is still here.  And on  1/19 I got the same feeling with SOB, 101.1 fever and felt awful all over again. So I visited with my PCP and another chest Xray and blood work was done again.  The chest xray showed normal but was started on a Flovent enhaler to help with the breathing and SOB.

I started to itch and thought it was just dry skin. Then about 20 minutes later I started to get mild hives. I took Benadryl and that calmed it down. When I woke up the next day the itching went away and I just felt pretty fatigued throughout the day.

                                                The chills began about 8pm. I had a fever which went to like 101 so I took tylenol but the fever went up a little higher.  I fell asleep and woke up about 11:30pm with a 103.4 fever so I stayed awake a little and took ibuprofen and tylenol throughout the night.  When I woke the next morning the fever was 101 but went down to like 99 later that evening.  The fever finally broke about 11am the next day but returned later  that day for a little while.   I was so tired  I slept like a solid day and woke up yesterday feeling sluggish and developed another 100.3 fever last night, took motrin and I feel better today.

I had to take the day off work and slept most of the day.  I also had terrible muscular pain at the sight of the injection (L deltoid).  Tylenol helped with the arm pain. I had absolutely no side effects with the first dose.

                                                First vaccine dose was given on 12/29/2020. Patient had moderate swelling to injection site on first dose and was treated with prednisone. Patient was placed on prednisone as pretreatment for second dose. She took the first dose of prednisone on 1/28/2021. Received the second vaccination on 12/29/2021. Patient called ED nursing station one day after (1/30/21) receiving the second vaccine dose stating she had a fever of 102 and did not feel well. She treated it at home with ibuprofen and Tylenol. Her last dose of prednisone was on 01/30/2021. She went to work on 02/01/2021. Staff said they tried talking to her but it was like she was not hearing them. Shortly after she was found unresponsive in the bathroom. She was brought to the ED. She was responsive to voice but was aphasic and had left sided deficits. In  past records, she has had episodes of neurological symptoms that were unexplainable. Unable to obtain an accurate history on her due to aphasia so it is unknown what this could have actually started from. Reporting due to previous reaction to vaccine and recentness of second dose in relation to this incident. Did try Keppra to cover for possible seizure. Consulted with transferring physician and she is not a candidate for TPA.  She was transferred out to a facility with higher level of care.  During time in this ED, neurological symptoms did not improve.

At approximately 12:30 at night, I woke up due to the pain I was feeling all over my body (in particular in my joints and lower back). I also have a severe headache. At approximately 2:30am I experienced nausea and some vomiting followed by chills without fever. The headache, body aches, and extreme exhaustion continued until approximately 9pm the day after the shot. Two days later, almost all symptoms were gone (I still felt tired). I had a small red spot at the injection site that lasted 2 days but the injection site pain was way worse for the first shot than the second one.

I took a nap and woke up around 6pm soaked in sweat, with muscle aches, and a fever of 99. My fever never got above 100.8. The body aches were the worst part. It was extremely difficult to get comfortable. I did take Tylenol and Ibuprofen and it didn?t seem to help the body aches. It did however help keep the fever at bay.  I went to sleep that evening at 11:00pm. I woke up in the middle of the night around 2am, and all symptoms have resolved except for feeling extremely hot. The rash has gotten better but has not fully resolved.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Within 8 hours of receiving the 2nd Moderna dose in right upper arm, I was experiencing 9/10 sharp upper arm pain (00:30 2/10/2021). The pain was so intense I almost vomited and was not able to sleep. My range of motion was severely limited, and I had to use my left arm to help move my right arm.  This continued through 2/10/2021. At 1300 took 1000 mg Tylenol and had minor relief for an hour. Tried to stay hydrated and move my right arm as I could, which was still very limited. Woke up at 01:30 early morning 2/11/2021 with intense pain in right upper arm still, not able to sleep. Range of motion continues to be severely limited due to pain. Made an appointment with PCP office first thing. I was concerned I could have SIRVA and wanted to get a medical professional?s opinion. She said it is probably a combination of the Moderna vaccine and a ?bad injection,? meaning the nurse administering my vaccine at facility was very high on my deltoid (almost to my joint). I was told to call back if my arm pain or range of motion worsens.

Had I been in the office I would have had to go home ill, and I could not do much but try to rest during this time. The headache through the following day was light and I felt mostly normal by evening.

                                                I had hives despite having taken my daily dose of Claritin that seemed to get worse as the day continued. I reached out to my Healthcare clinic and they were unsure if there was a simple treatment and almost required me to go the emergency room for this. I conducted a telehealth consultation with a doc who was not my primary care physician and was unfamiliar with my preexisting exercise urticaria condition that occasionally results in light hives but never anaphylaxis for me without Claritin. I declined going to the emergency room since this did not seem that serious and instead took another Claritin to try to get the somewhat worsening hives with no apparent cause to stop without an unnecessarily escalated situation. My throat was slightly itchy but I never became anaphylactic likely due to taking an additional Claritin and not doing anything requiring physical effort for the day beyond telecons from home because I left the office to telework mid morning after I started getting continually slightly worse hives. By evening I was ok and the next day just had a slightly sore throat but was able to work and just started the day with 2 Claritin without any further instance of hives appearing. The day after that I returned to my standard 1 Claritin dose with no ill effects. From this event, it seems clear that a 72 hour downing period from dose 1 is insufficient and should be upped to 96 hours. Prior to this more severe event, I had, on days 2 and 3, a sore left arm at injection site that prevented me from even reasonably lifting my arm to a height sufficient to grab my cell phone off it&#39;s charger while lying in bed without serious discomfort. That level of arm discomfort prevented me from working out or would have prevented me from anything other than light office work involving my vaccine arm. My level of tiredness for the couple days following this dose also required that I take an hour long nap days 1 and 2, and no nap at all is usually the norm for me.

I experienced headache and fatigue yesterday afternoon and developed back aches at 2030At 2330, I developed fever (100.5) with chills, nausea, diarrhea and faint feeling. I started blacking out while walking to get water and had to kneel down to the floor to prevent myself from passing out. I had tingling in my hands and feet for an hour after. I took ibuprofen at 0145, and fell asleep around 0230. As of now, I feel back to normal, other than sore arm and lingering fatigue. My fever is gone and temp back down to 98.3. I had COVID back in early December, so I expected this type of immune response with the first vaccine dose.

                                                after the shot, back pain intensified.  Throughout the day, the back pain turned into severe stomach issues.  Took stomach meds (pepto bismol) with no effect.  Went to sleep and woke up in the middle of night with stabbing pain in my stomach. used a heating pad to help me go back to sleep.  the 2nd day my stomach felt as if it was a balloon- extremely bloated and it hurt to breath deep, and stand straight. Took pepto, gas x, and also tried tums- nothing helped.  Today is day 3, and I am back to feeling normal aside from still being very tired, and hazy.  No more stomach issues.  Called doctor to see what I should do today, and was advised to not take the second dose.  Would like a second opinion.

On 17-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml). On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 17-Mar-2021 to 18-Mar-2021 due to ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION. In March 2021, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) had resolved. On 17-Mar-2021, ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml) had resolved. At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinations), SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient did not have any psychological history; this was the first time she experienced hallucinations.  Treatment for the severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis included intravenous steroids and hydrocortisone.  Treatment for hallucinations included droperidol and lorazepam.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event (anaphylactic reaction), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding the events (Hallucination, anaphylactic reaction, sleep terror, fear of death, delusion, and formication) has been provided at this time. This report refers to a case of (accidental overdose) for mRNA-1273, lot # 031A21A. Further information has been requested.

After the migraine resolved, patient experienced extreme anxiety (likely panic attack) accompanying by uncontrollable shaking of both legs and loud crying producing tears. Prescription medications were taken on schedule, but the vaccination event may have triggered breakthrough anxiety and/or feeling of helplessness ~36 hours after vaccine received.

The area around the injection site was swollen, red, and painful to touch. I fell over on my way to the toilet due to extreme dizziness. I had three hours of diarrhea, and then took pepto bismal and bennydryl. Those remedies worked and my symptoms subsided and I was able to fall back asleep by 4am. In the morning I felt normal, besides some remaining pain and redness surrounding the injection site.

                                                Presumed right arm muscle injury.  Several hours after the injection my arm was extremely sore and painful. The joint was painful as well. No redness or swelling. It was tender to touch. I was having difficulty reaching my arm up or moving it upward. Ex: it hurt to lift my hand to touch my face.  I also couldn?t let it fall. If I got my arm above my head I would have to assist it down. I couldn?t sleep that night because of the pain. I was having trouble with pushing movements in that arm. And also letting it hang dependently (like letting my arm hang when I hinged forward). I started taking Motrin 24 hours after the injection. Motrin helped, so I took it Friday and Saturday. Sunday, my arm felt 99% back to normal.  Monday and Tuesday I didn?t notice anything.   Wednesday  morning I woke up with the same pain again and difficulty moving my arm. Wednesday night, I couldn?t sleep again because of the pain/couldn?t get my arm in a comfortable position. I?m taking Motrin, with not as much relief as before. I?ve applied heat and I?ve tried to stretch it as well.   The only way i really know how to describe it? is that it feels as if my deltoid was injured. And my other muscles are fine. It?s hindering my movement in that arm. It is again, tender to touch my deltoid area. The tightness has extended in to my shoulder and neck. It has now been 8 days since my vaccination.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the first dose of moderna vaccine on my right arm, my arm felt numb and tingly.  My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

                                                10:47a went into a room to wait for 15 minutes directly after the injection. Began to feel somewhat dizzy right afterwards. Continued back to my office. Informed my supervisor that I was feeling dizzy but informed him that I had a couple bites of oatmeal, and a few cups of coffee and was going to try and eat something and hydrate and I?m sure I would feel better. I went back to work for about an hour (I work at a desk). For about an hour I continued to feel dizzy and noticed I was cloudy and was staring off. After an hour I really became dizzy and walked to my supervisors office and informed him. It felt as though I was walking on the moon to get to his office. I also felt like I had a uti. I sat down in his office and informed him of what happened. As I was talking to him I began to pass out. I did not go out the whole way but he began speaking to me more. After feeling a little better I walked back over to my office. I felt waves of dizziness and being hot and cold. My husband came and picked me up around 1:30p from work. I felt better after getting in the car and going home. Once I was home I ate and had began to feel better. Around 6:00p I began to go through another wave and was experiencing body aches, hot and cold sweats, loss of appetite, tingling all over my body but mostly in my legs and feet. At that point I went in and laid down in bed for the rest of the night. Probably around 9:00p I began to feel better. I attempted to fall asleep around 11:00p but when I closed my eyes I felt like they were racing back and forth. So I got back up and watched something in tv until I fell asleep maybe about 30 minutes later. I woke up the next morning around 8:45a. I tossed and turned most of the night, however I felt better. It was like I had the flu for a few days and on the last day I felt better but was under the weather. At this point in the morning I was fatigued. I was able to perform some tasks around the house.  I then laid back down in bed for a few hours because I was beginning to feel dizzy and was experiencing hot and cold sweats. After a few hours I got up from bed and performed a few more tasks around the house. Then was able to sit down on the couch and watch some tv. At this point I?m still expediting tingling in my body at times. Still a little dizzy but able to focus and hot and cold sweats.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

                                                At about 0130 on 01/13/21, I woke up not feeling well (I had also not been sleeping well prior due to arm pain and minor aches). I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

                                                Developed severe itching starting on my forearms overnight on Thursday going into Friday that week after I received the vaccine. The itching progressed to my stomach/trunk and back. The more I itched, the itching worsened and pink bumps would immediately appear. The left side by my rib and over my left breast were the worst impacted. The bumps later appeared to join. I went to the ER that Saturday 1/9/21 after two doses of Benadryl didn?t help. I was prescribed oral antibiotics starting at 60mg a day for two days, then tapered down 10mg every 10 days. I?m currently on day 1 of 20mg. Also took Benadryl as the itching was keeping me from sleeping. I was also prescribed clobetasol cream to administer twice a day. Symptoms have markedly improved. The rash is now the same feeling as my skin, not bumpy. Hyperpigmentation remains. I?m being followed by my dermatologist whom I saw Monday 1/11/21. She performed a punch skin biopsy.

On the 10th day, I noticed it was getting worse and some of the spots were an itchy/burning feeling (it woke me up at night). On the 11th day, I went to the doctor and was prescribed oral prednisone (60 mg x 3 days, 40 mg x 3 days. 20 mg x 3 days, 10 mg x 4 days), hydroxyzine PRN for itching, and triamcinolone ointment. The rash started improving after 2 days on prednisone and I only used the ointment and hydroxyzine for 2 days.

Pt also mentioned to both intern and I that she is a hypochondriac. She got her IM vaccination and sat down for 15 minutes as we monitored her. After her 15 minutes of sitting down in pharmacy area and being monitored by our intern and pharmacist, they asked how she&#39;s doing. Pt expressed she felt fine but had a dry mouth, and the intern told her to call 911 immediately if any shortness of breath occurred, but patient felt fine and left. About 25 minutes later she returned and expressed that she had a metallic taste in her mouth and was anxious about the shot. We asked her to sit down so we can monitor her further and she did. Five minutes later she expressed tongue swollen a little and a little difficulty swallowing but had no trouble breathing. At that time pharmacy intern and I (pharmacist) decided to give the epipen injection and patient agreed. We had the patient sit down for another 30 minutes as we monitored her. Minutes later, pt started to feel better as we continuously monitored her. During this time patient requested water due to dry mouth. We handed her a bottle of water but asked her to please sip and not take big gulps. After 30 minutes patient felt better. No swollen tongue, no difficulty swallowing or breathing and anxiety had been relieved. Patient was notified by pharmacy to call MD to let him know of reaction and was also told to call 911 immediately if have any further reaction. PT felt comfortable to leave at this point.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 10:45a, I then went next door to be monitored for 15 minutes. Within a few minutes, I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I waited out the 15 minutes and went back to my office. When I got into my office I still felt lightheaded and I informed my supervisor. I explained to him that I was going to try and eat something and drink some water and I would feel better. I went into my office and continued to work for the next hour. After that hour, I began to feel very dizzy and &#34;out of it&#34; as I almost didn&#39;t know where I was at. I went to speak to my supervisor and I sat down in his office where I almost fainted. He took me back to my office where I sat with another co-worker. Duri time, I continued to feel light headed, although it came in waves. My husband drove me home, I showered, ate something and was feeling better. Around 6:00p, I began to feel lightheaded again and began to experience body aches, hot and cold flashes that would come in waves. Saturday morning, I woke up feeling better, but around 10:00a I began to experience the same symptoms. I laid down for a few hours that would get up and attempt tasks around the house, then I would  ended up back in bed at 6:00p with the same symptoms again. I did meet virtually with a doctor and she explained to me to wait it out. On Monday, I met with my pcp and she informed me of the same, that these symptoms would eventually go away. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the only symptom that remained was the dizziness. At times, I still will feel dizzy for instance Saturday morning I woke up and felt pretty dizzy throughout the day.

Pain, swelling, redness, and toughness began to dissipate around Day 5 and was markedly improved by Day 8 when I completely returned to normal activities.  Additionally, the first day after the vaccination, I experienced muscle aches/pains and severe generalized fatigue that almost made me call out from work. This fatigue and muscle pain was very strong for ~72 hours after the vaccination. However, I was still able to go to work, though my productivity was not the same given the amount of fatigue I experienced and the inability to utilize my right arm to the same degree I would during a normal work day.

                                                Was fine immediately post vaccine. Drove home and proceeded with a normal rest of the day at home. Went to sleep around 10 pm. Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

No relief with Excedrin. Fever broke 1/28 around 7AM All day today (1/28) I have alternated between chills and sweating. Aches are now mostly in my upper left back and hips/thighs.

I slowly laid down with feet above heart until it subsided and slowly went back to bed. My galaxy watch says pulse dropped to 40. Normally 60&#39;s. Later in the morning at 7am chills started and migraine with light aura (kind of like the pixels on an old tv). Took asa, tylenol, and drank water to help. Feeling hazy all day.

I noticed the tip and the right side of my tongue was tingly. I felt as if I had a lump in my throat. I looked in the mirror and my tongue was not red or swollen. I stayed in the parking lot and spoke with my husband incase I did have an anaphylactic reaction. My symptoms started getting better and fading around 9:45 AM, so I left the parking lot. I notified the vaccine clinic via text message of the reaction after I had already left the site. They offered me to see a provider, but the symptoms already started to go away, so he advised me to take benadryl when I got to my location.  Once I got to my location benadryl was no longer needed because the symptoms were gone. This was about 45 minutes to an hour after the vaccine was administered.

                                                Around 4 PM I started getting chills. I took Ibuprofen and it was much easier. It started coming back around 7:00 pm. I had super sensitive skin and chills that night and didn&#39;t sleep very much, if at all. I didn&#39;t go to work that day because I still had a fever in the morning. It broke mid-morning but I was nauseous all day and had a headache. I still had a headache the following day and I didn&#39;t want to eat the next day although I wasn&#39;t nauseous. Also on that third day- the redness and swelling started in my arm where the injection site was on the right arm. It was swollen, hot to touch. I called the Dr. again. I got a different doctor than the first dose. She thought it was an allergic reaction. She said to try antihistamines that day but if it didn&#39;t get better she did prescribe a different kind of antibiotic I took the antihistamines that day and it didn&#39;t get any better. So than I took the antibiotic and it got better. It was better by Friday evening.

                                                30 minutes after admin of IM, I developed tingling around the mouth and had a panic attack which I thought may be related to anxiety. However, I got the second shot and tingling around my mouth and tongue continued with some heighted anxiety but no panic attack. Two weeks after the last shot the tingling has continued on and off feeling like neuropathy of the tongue and mouth. It typically last thirty minutes or so and then subsides. This has happened 3 x since getting the second shot 3 weeks ago.

I also experienced cognitive function issues - memory gaps, brain fog, and could not walk a straight line. Those went away after the first week or so. I also had headache, body aches, fever, chills, dehydration, joint pain, and severe fatigue. This affected my daily life for about a week and half.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

                                                After the patient received the vaccination they were instructed to sit in the waiting room for 15 minutes. The vaccinating pharmacist checked the patient and she said her lips were tingling/numb. The vaccinating pharmacist came and got me in the pharmacy. I talked to patient, she said her breathing was fine but felt like she was floating. She began to become incoherent and at that point we got her on the floor and called 911. I did not talk to the EMTs. They transported the patient out of the waiting room.  We reached out to patient after she returned home she is feeling better and may of just had a panic attack. She is making an appointment with her primary care provider.

I had extreme fatigue to where I couldn&#39;t get off of the floor because I was so weak. My heart rate was super high. I felt overall really miserable for a long time and I was seen that morning. I slept like 18 hours the next day. The following day, 30th, missed work. I was tired. No more vomiting, fever and no more diarrhea, but still had body aches and chills and still very tired. Everything slowly started getting better and I was able to work on the 31st. I developed a headache and body aches for a while. My arm was also sore.

                                                Initially after vaccine within an hour I felt fatigue(drained within 1 hour of receiving vaccine). Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine I was having fever, chills, body aches, nausea, and vomiting, and diarrhea and dizziness and weakness and heart palpitations(probably related to dehydration). Symptoms remained for 3 days. Unable to hold down anything. Felt like I had covid all over again just without the respiratory issues and loss of taste and smell. Arm was very sore almost like a deep bone bruise. Brain fog developed again like after initially recovering from covid as did the fatigue. Still having lingering fatigue and now carpal tunnel like symptoms in both hands, slight weakness and numbness at times in right upper arm where vaccine was given. Reported event to Pharmacist to administered the vaccine and the CDC.

                                                Face swelling and redness with lip tingling and tongue tingling later after eating a few bites of a home prepared meal that has been eaten several times before. Started eating around 7 pm, have picture of red and swelling face at 7:11 pm. Contents of meal were shrimp, homemade egg noodles, chicken stock, pork, and romaine.  No breathing problems and felt fine besides face warm ness and some anxiety over possibly developing a new allergy, as these symptoms were similar to my adult onset allergies to oysters in 2011. Sought remote care at 7:41, spoke to RN over phone who recommended a video visit, then after video visit was recommended to go to urgent care. Arrived at Urgent Care around 8:50 PM.   Had a steroid shot of solumedrol 125 mg to IM the left arm around 9 pm, then took some Benadryl and famotidine at urgent care. Picked up prescriptions for famotidine 7 days, prednisone 4 days, and Benadryl as needed.  Taking medications now with careful watching of potentially allergic reaction provoking foods such as shrimp, fish, nuts, and wheat.

I was 27 weeks pregnant when i got the injection.

On Friday I started my period a week early and it was unusually heavy (this hasn?t happened much since I was a teenager) on Saturday I was bleeding so heavily and had lightheadedness, near syncope, headache, nausea, weakness, fatigue and brain fog. Usually menstrual cycle is not as heavy and doesn?t come early and I don?t experience these types of symptoms (usually just bad cramps and back pain with less heavy bleeding).

                                                Severe left deltoid restriction in complete range of motion. This gradually improved over the next day but 10 days post vaccine I  am still having left AC joint pain with internal rotation and full overhead extension. The pain often stops me from completing tasks such as taking off my shirt or extending my arm in front of me with any type of weight in it (even a water bottle).

Affected my daily activities and could not go to work.  I am a pharmacist, and this did really impact my job as my boss had to get other pharmacists from other cities to cover my shifts.   My work has a protocol related to covid, they will not let me back for a week.

                                                Pounding headache - increased in intensity over several hours.  Fever and chills - started about 9 hours post vaccine. It was manageable. Nausea and vomiting - nausea was on and off starting about 10 hours post vaccine. My body attempted to throw up twice but there was nothing in my body to bring up. The nausea and vomiting could have been from the intensity of the headache but I am unsure.  About 10.5 hours post vaccine I took 1000 mg Tylenol and then an hour after taking Tylenol, I tool 220 mg naproxen sodium. I was unable to fall asleep because the headache was so bad.   I woke up about 5 hours later and knew my fever had broken and the headache was mild. The headache continued on and off (most noticeable in the morning and at night) for about a week post vaccine.

By 11pm I had a horrible headache and my body was aching. At midnight I still was feeling horrible and my chest was hurting and I was having difficulty breathing. Checked my heart rate with a pulse ox and it was in the 150?s. I realized had not taken my clonidine pill yet for the evening so I  took it and waited about an hour to hour an a half and my heart rate was still not coming down below 125. I ended up going to the emergency room and getting there by 3am. They immediately started running tests. My heart rate was in the 138 and my blood pressure was 148/100

                                                I started feeling very weird and could not sleep well the first night - I kept waking up with a pounding headache, but a different type of headache than I had ever felt before. I have had a constant low-grade headache since that gets worse at night.   The first night and that next day, Excedrin Migraine helped. I have been taking Ibuprofen almost every evening since then.

Then around 9/10pm I had chills and low grade fever of 99 degrees F. I took tylenol and went to bed with extra blankets and a heating pad since my body could not get warm. I also felt very nauseous. I woke up around 12am with a fever of 101 and sweating. Took some ibprofen and fell back asleep. My fever broke in the night but when I woke up I felt achy and had a headache. I took ibprofen and my temperature was normal however about an hour or two later I started to get another low grade fever and too tyelnol again.  The fever went away and never came back but I had a slight headache for several hours and was very fatigued all day. The next day I woke up feeling fine.

                                                At the time of administration of the first does of Moderna vaccine, I was 6 weeks pregnant.  I had confirmed pregnancy with home positive test and missed period. I had an estimated due date of 9/24/2021.  This was my 4th pregnancy. I have had two uncomplicated pregnancies to term. In September 2020 experienced a chemical pregnancy with early pregnancy loss at 5 weeks.  The first 24 hours after 1st dose of vaccine I experienced extreme arm soreness in the arm that was vaccinated,  causing  headache and unable to sleep. After 24 hours I felt &#34;normal&#34;. 2 weeks and 3 days following the first dose of Moderna, I  had a miscarriage. On the night of 2/15/21 I lost the pregnancy with vaginal bleeding, bright red  blood, passing tissue, clots/ sac. I had an uneventful pregnancy up to that point, feeling well as I had with prior pregnancies.

It took up my entire upper arm - the redness day. It was painful to sleep on but I could use it. On the third day of it ( a Wednesday, 13th) - to check in with DR - Telehealth appt - employee health - recommended ibuprofen and ice packs for a few days. They advised if I got a fever etc to seek more treatment. It took about two weeks for it to go entirely away.

                                                Received the vaccine intramuscularly in right arm at 1:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and muscle soreness began approx. 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Fatigue and headache present by 3:00 PM on 3/3/21. Began hydrating with water and Gatorade at this time. Muscle pain and join soreness present from right shoulder to right hand by 4:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and stiffness in fingers of right hand by 5:00 PM on 3/3/21. Mild congestion, brain fog by 6:00 PM on 3/3/21. Any contact between right arm and other objects or surfaces caused significant pain by 8:00 PM on 3/3/21. Took 800 mg ibuprofin to alleviate pain (pre-existing tolerance to NSAIDs necessitates higher than normal dosages). Swelling of the right arm and hand identified by 9:00 PM on 3/3/21. Swelling was most significant in the hand, and accompanied worsening joint pain and stiffness in the fingers. Applied a cold pack to address swelling (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off). Could not identify these specific side effects in the information available online, took a Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Swelling decreased overnight and was gone by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21. Diarrhea began at 6:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Will continue to hydrate with water and Gatorade. At the time of this report, pain in right arm still present from shoulder to wrist and entire arm is tender to the touch, but pain level has lessened. Pain and stiffness in right side of neck present by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Lymph nodes in right underarm swollen by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and swelling is still present at the time of this report. Will continue with regimen of ibuprofin as needed.  * I am recovering fine at home, but I wanted to log these side effects for data collection purposes. I couldn&#39;t find any information about these side effects online and that really freaked me out, so I hope that writing this report will help people in a similar situation.

                                                8 days after the shot I had an episode of tingling and numbness bilaterally from my feet up to my thighs. I had difficulty walking, a lot of pain and a vibration sensation in my thighs with weakness. I was admitted to the hospital for 3 days and had abnormal neuro reflexes upon admission and severe brain fog, which I have never had before. MRIs and blood work were done in the hospital but they could not determine the cause and the hospital questioned it being from the COVID vaccination and has had me follow up further with specialists to see if there could be any other diagnostic causes. I have followed up with my PCP, 2 neurologists, a rheumatologist, allergist, dermatologist and will be seeing a hematologist.  (I now have joint pains, extreme fatigue, brain fog, peripheral neuropathy--none of which I had prior to the vaccination and thus far conditions outside of the vaccination have not been found. I also got a positive ANA after vaccination (I had negative in the past and my doctors are questioning if the covid vaccination triggered an autoimmune disorder now in me with the joint pain and swelling, fatigue, positive ANA, rashes and pain).  I have been out of work since February due to health impairments and am a healthcare provider myself.

The injection site had a red circle around it, growing from 2 Inch diameter from the night before to about 4.5 inch diameter. Checked temperature around 4pm, at 101.8 degrees. Around 7pm that night, injection site began to itch slightly. Symptoms subsided with medicine but never fully vanished. Temperature fell to 100 degrees. Woke up 6:00 am April 21 to same headache and injection site itch. Body aches and nausea gone but have now been replaced with vertigo, scale 7 out of 10. Temperature at 101 degrees.

I had no anxiety surrounding the receiving of the vaccine nor anxiety about potential side effects. I was standing still and upright at the time of the attack and it lasted appx 30-40 min, subsiding to feelings of heightened anxiety through the remainder of the night. While anxiety and panic attacks have occurred in the past, it is not on a regular basis, nor has either occurred in over 6 months.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

                                                Around 2 AM, roughly 14 hours after receiving Covid Modena vaccine (1st dose) I woke up in a violent shaking situation.  I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

Was unable to do most daily activities. Extreme fatigue and slept almost all day, also due to fever and pain from body aches/joint pain. Took Tylenol (700mg at 7:30am and 2:30pm) but fevers continued to register between 100.2 and 100.8. Fever was definitely higher at night but temperature unknown. Took Tylenol again at 7:30pm and at this point did not have fever, mostly did not have body aches/joint pain at this time. No symptoms besides tiredness the next morning (1/18/21)  Large red welt appeared at injection site, about 4 inches by 3 inches. Hot to touch, itchy at times, very sore. Still has welt as of 1/19/21.

When I went to turn on my right side I heard a popping noise in my neck and was no longer able to move my neck to my right. I got up scared and started to experience chills, nausea, and dizziness.

                                                At about 7:30 pm, I started getting cold chills. I was under 3 heavy blankets with warm clothing and heat packs still shivering.  By 9 pm, body aches had started.  I took a 500 mg tylenol.  The cold chills went away with the tylenol but did nothing for the body aches. At 11:30 pm, I took 200 mg of ibuprofen because my entire body hurt and I was unable to fall asleep or really move much due to the discomfort. The ibuprofen helped reduce the intensity of the body aches but I got very little sleep.  At 6:30 am, the body aches were intense again  and I started getting hot flashes and nausea. My husband called in sick to help care for our 3 young kids.  I took another 200 mg of  ibuprofen  and that reduced the symptoms again. I can now get around the house instead of laying in bed but would not be able to work.  I did not ever have a measurable fever.  I do have a pretty sore arm

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

The headache and sore arm worsened and then around 9pm I started with horrible chills and body aches. My symptoms continued onto the next day, including intermittent nausea and extreme fatigue. I had to leave work early on Wednesday 1/20/21, called out of work on 1/21/21. My symptoms were gone by mid day of 1/21/21 except my fatigue and headache lingered until 1/22/21. I took extra strength Tylenol throughout the days.

                                                About 8-10 minutes after the injection, my vision got blurry. It was very brief- only a couple minutes long. If it had lasted until the end of my 15 minute post-injection observation period, I would have reported it then, but it didn&#39;t. I decided to include it here, because later in the day, I had another reaction. About 12 hours after the dose -around 7PM- I started getting chills and body aches and abnormally fatigued. The chills were intense almost as soon as they come on. The body aches were mild for the first couple hours and progressed to intense. Both symptoms lasted continuously for about 12 hours, then around 7AM they started to wane. I&#39;m not sure if I should list insomnia as a reaction, but despite how exhausted I felt, I could not sleep. It could have also been just general discomfort that kept me from being able to sleep. Through most of the following day I had mild aches and waves of chills. By the time I went to bed that night (last night at the time of writing this), the symptoms had mostly  cleared and so far have not returned.

It happened one more time in the middle of the night, jolting me out of sleep. My period has not come since I took the shot.  It?s been two weeks. This is very unusual.

                                                Around dinner time I developed fatigue and significant arm pain. By 10pm I had a 101 degree fever, cold sweats, chills, full body aches, and nausea. My fever reduced to 99 degrees around 0730am and remained as such through the following day (1/28/21) as the chills, nausea, and cold sweats gradually faded away. I was deeply fatigued and unable to work.  Sometime mid afternoon I developed a crippling frontal headache That worsened in the light and standing. I have no history of headaches or migraines. I was still repulsed by the thought of eating. I took acetaminophen with a protein shake and it helped the headache And residual body aches enough for me to sleep. 1/29/21 I awoke still fatigued  with a minor headache.   I am a pro athlete with no underlying conditions. I have had my flu shot yearly with no side effects. I am extremely fit and eat a healthy balanced diet, maintain a healthy athletic weight, sleep 7-8 hours a night, do not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use recreational drugs. I was absolutely floored at how sick this shot made me.

                                                Severe muscle tension in cramping in right arm two hours after injection. In less than 24 hours the muscle cramping had extended up my neck into my face, specifically the masseter muscle of my jaw.  I also experienced some numbness on the right side of my face (unfortunately the locked masseter muscle was very noticeable). I was not able to sleep or eat when the pain built; hot and cold temperatures were highly reactive when trying to consume anything.   I saw my dentist for an emergency medical appointment on Monday 1/25/2021 with the dentist. I saw Dr. who prescribed a muscle relaxer and assisted me in identifying the masseter muscle as the source of pain and tension as well as exercises that could be done to treat the reaction. While there is no definitive evidence that the muscle cramping is directly related to the COVID vaccine, it is reasonable to suspect that it may have impacted the muscle tension and resulting locked masseter muscle that required clinical intervention. The muscle relaxer was somewhat helpful, however for my body and biochemistry, taking 400mg of ibruprofen every 6-8 hours was much more successful in treating the symptoms.

She also stated that she had insomnia and was up all night. She also stated that she had a low-grade fever 02/02/21-02/03/2021.  By 02/04/2021 she stated that she was feeling better and that her symptoms were more mild. Today (02/10/2021) she states that she feels better but that she has had some increased pain and insomnia; she estimates, though, that these symtoms that she mentioned today are due to recent medication changes.

                                                I was vaccinated on the 14th of January. Initially I just had a sore arm and fatigue on the 15th. The night of the 17th I was working out and had a vasovagal type episode (never had this before). By the morning of the 18th I was fatigued and had a cough that can be described as a bronchial spasm type cough, I assumed that it had to do with the work out and the episode the night before. I woke up on the 19th very sick. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea. Because I am a healthcare provider I was able to go strait to the hospital and get an expedited COVID Test. By that afternoon I had my test back with positive results. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed. I had extreme headache, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath if I moved around at all, cough, loss of taste and smell, nausea, abdominal px, diarrhea, lac of apatite, extrema &#34;brain fog&#34;. These symptoms continued for about a week. Most of the symptoms subsided after that time except for the fatigue off and on and a continuous cough that as of 2/11/2021 has still not gone away.

During 1st 24 hours of having the 2nd dose I had chills, fever, body aches, sleeplessness. Symptoms subsided within 24-48 hours with the arm soreness taking about a week to completely go away.   A week and a half after receiving the 2nd dose I noticed a lump on my neck, lower middle near the collarbone. It is significantly pronounced. I saw my primary doctor for an already scheduled physical and she said I was fighting off an infection and it was normal. I mentioned I had the COVID vaccine and she said it isn&#39;t uncommon to see the lymph node swell after vaccination and it should go away in a couple of weeks. I wanted to report this because it can freak people out to see a lump in their neck so long after being vaccinated without any other symptoms. We need to list this as a possible side effect on the vaccine information. I feel completely fine except my neck is a little tender/sore from the swollen lymph node.

Took symbicort (I have normally well controlled asthma). Called clinic and was advised that I was fine and could continue to work and to follow up with MD if symptoms got worse. Did virtual visit with Pulmonologist at 0945 and he advised me to get COVID swabbed and prescribed prednisone taper and albuterol MDI. COVID swabbed 2/9 at 5pm. Out of work 2/10 &amp; 2/11 awaiting test results. Returned to work 2/12 after negative COVID result- passed safepass- worked, still SOB, but manageable. 2/13-2/14 had increasing SOB- albuterol MDI 6x/day. Monday 2/15 returned to work- saw doctor in person- increased prednisone from 20mg (tapered down) to 40mg (original dose) and added Spiriva. 2/17- Went to ED for status asthmaticus after using albuterol MDI 5-6x/day without any relief. Admitted 2/17 for asthma exacerbation- discharged 2/20. Discharged home with nebulized albuterol, prednisone slow taper, symbicort, Spiriva, Singulair &amp; Claritin. 2/23-2/24 Albuterol nebs 5x/day, still SOB. Pulmonary visit 2/24 - added inhaled budesonide nebs. Out of work 2/25-2/26. Returned to work 3/1- finally feeling better!

Woke up with chills, severe body aches and bone pain, severe left arm pain, headache, nausea at 11pm. Felt worst I had ever felt in my life. Couldn?t get out of bed due to severe pain. Temp max 101.

Patient was then brought to a  back hallway 100ft  away  to be  further evaluated.  Patient blood pressure was 120/90, heart rate 80, spo2 99%. Patient was put on oxygen via nasal cannula  at 4lpm.  Patients said her breathing  started to improve.  Patient then started to say her throat was feeling dry and described a lump forming in her throat. Patient had sip of water to see if she could swallow.  Respiratory rate increased  to hyperventilating  40 breaths per minute.  Vitals were attempted to be reassessed, but then the patient began to experience nausea and dry heaving.  At this time  a paramedic  who is administering vaccinations  to patients stepped in  to help administer epinephrine 1:1,000 .3mg  intramuscular on the left thigh.

I DID NOT WAKE BACK UP FOR 17 HOURS.  1/1/2021, 9:00AM: WHEN I WOKE UP I HAD A LARGE RED RASH OVER MY FACE AND DOWN MY NECK- NO WHERE ELSE ON MY BODY BESIDES MY FACE. MY FACE HAD A BURNING SENSATION AS IF IT WERE ON FIRE.  1/2/2021: BY 48 HOURS MY ENTIRE FACE  (INCLUDING MY EYELIDS) HAD THE RED RASH. I TOOK BENADRYL AND THE BURNING SENSATION WENT AWAY BY THE MORNING.  1/3/2021: ON DAY #3 I USED A POISON IVY TYPE CREAM BEFORE BED, AS WELL AS BENADRYL. 1/4/2021, 05:00:  THE MORNING OF DAY#4 THE REDNESS AND RASH HAD SUBSIDED TREMENDOUSLY, HOWEVER STILL PRESENT. 1/4/2021, 1:30PM: VISITED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. I HAD A STEROID SHOT ADMINISTERED, AND WAS SENT A PRESCRIPTION FOR AN EPI PEN AND A &#34;PACK&#34; TO MY PHARMACY.  THE PHYSICIAN REACHED OUT TO OTHER COLLEGUES, ALL STATING THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF CASES ARISING WITH RED RASHES ON PEOPLES FACES, BUT NONE OF THEM HAD PERSONALLY SEEN IT YET. MY PHYSICIAN SAID I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO COME IN. I ASKED ABOUT MY DERMA- FILLERS, AND IF THEY HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RASH BUT NOTHING COULD BE CONFIRMED. MY TEMPERATURE WAS EXACTLY 98.5, HOWEVER THE DR STATED MY SKIN WAS HOT TO THE TOUCH.

                                                I developed severe hives all over my body hours about 19 hours after the shot.   Intense itching woke me up at 4:40am the day after receiving the vaccine.  The reaction worsened for the next 3 days and began to settle/decrease at the end of the 3rd day.   I also felt somewhat disoriented through  the allergic reaction period, and on the day after the vaccine I felt slight pain on my chest.  I did not experience shortness of breath or have trouble breathing at any point.

My right cheek felt a little numb and I felt like there was a bit of a lump in my throat. The cheek and throat sensation went away in just a few minutes after I noticed them at first, did not persist. The redness on my face and ears went away, but returned on a smaller area later in the afternoon, then went away and have not returned either in the 3 days since I&#39;ve had it.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post injection, I felt a burning sensation move from my left deltoid, up my shoulder, and across my chest. I experienced burning in my chest for about 10 mins, and then it subsided. About 8 mins after that, I experienced moderate to severe cramping in my lower back and thigh muscles; which completely subsided after 10-15 mins. Two days after the initial injection, the injection site began burning/aching again, with movement up to my shoulder joint. It was to a point where I was tearful and unable to sleep. The following morning it had subsided, and just remains slightly sore.

                                                The following day, 12/23/20, I kept feeling like I was having brief waves of anxiety, with nothing to be anxious about. The anxious feeling kept occuring, but it wasn&#39;t until a week later than I realized that each time I felt that anxiety, my heart was actually palpitating.  I had a 12 lead EKG done via local EMT to confirm that it was actually happening, then made an appt with a local cardiologist.  Stress test, cardio sonogram, and 24 hour heart monitor tests were completed on 1/13/21.  My follow up is on 2/3/21.  Fortunately, I have not felt a palpitation since 1/10/21.

When I woke up the next morning My upper body (arms, hands, face) were swollen. At around 10 am I saw my Dr. and she felt my upper body was hot to touch but no fever. Swelling and torso had hives starting to form. Dr. gave me an injection of Solumedrol and sent me home to rest ansd to take benadryl.

                                                Initially, I had severe arm and back pain that lasted 3-4 days.  On day 1-2, I was extremely exhausted, so exhausted that I actually wet the bed and I have NEVER wet the bed as an adult, which was extremely embarrassing.  The worst part is, since the shot, day 1, my eye has been twitching. I have been reporting it .  I do not think it is just a coincidence anymore like I originally thought.  I have had eye twitches in the past but they have never lasted this long!  It has been 3 weeks and there is no end in sight.  The time between twitches is sometimes less, but the severity of the twitching is getting more intense, sometimes causing my eye to blink (although usually its a lateral upper eyelid twitch) and I have had 1-2 instances of my upper lip twitching along with it (within the last couple of days).  The eye is driving me crazy.  I can&#39;t fall asleep at night because it keeps me awake and it twitches when I&#39;m trying to fall asleep.  There has been nothing that has changed in terms of increased stress, increased caffeine consumption, decreased sleep, etc. to have explained this persistent eye twitching.  I did have my annual eye exam on 1/15/2021 and talked to him about it and he said we will continue to watch it.  It was just annoying at first but it will not go away and like I said, the intensity and pulsating of the twitch is getting progressively worse.

Night of Jan3, I developed red, hive like rash around the injection - painful; swollen and my lymph nodes were swollen in my armpit as well. It progressively spread through my whole arm within 24 hours and looked like a &#34;poison oak&#34; rash. I took Benadryl. I emailed my doctor about (PCP). I missed a day of work on January 5th. The rash got three days progressively. The lymph node pain was gone about a week after. I did have the dr write a prescription for the second dose for an epi-pen but didn&#39;t have to use it.

                                                Currently pregnant, healthy singular pregnancy, 12 weeks at time of vaccination, due date 8/5/2021. Two previous pregnancies with healthy, live births (5/2015 and 2/2018). Received vaccination Tuesday 1/26 at 4 pm. Feeling tired by 9 pm. Had difficulty sleeping over night and bizarre dreams when I did fall asleep. Wednesday had moderate symptoms all day - fatigue, dizziness, body aches, joint pain, chills and hot flashes (no fever), nausea, and headache. Thursday morning (1/28), symptoms were more mild, but noticed urine was dark. By early afternoon, urine had gotten much more dark and looked to be blood in urine. Went to OB provider who confirmed blood in urine and urine sent out for culture, no infection found. Unknown cause of blood in urine. Headache has continued since 1/27, worse in the morning.

                                                The day of the injection I had a very sore arm, just like my first dose. Then around quarter after midnight, I got up to use the bathroom. I recall extremely vivid dreams, and a little bit of disorientation. On my way back to bed I thought I?d take another ibuprofen to help me sleep because my arm was so sore. I remember feeling very dizzy, I did take my pill, and then I woke up on the floor. I was extremely disoriented and there was a shrill ringing in my left ear. As I came to, I recall really finding relief in the cold tile, and being concerned that I may have hit my head. I did a mental scan of my body and nothing felt painful, though stiff and sore, as I had the flu. I got back in bed and looked at the time, about 20 minutes had elapsed. The rest of the night I tossed turned, and felt quite feverish. I attempted to find radial and carotid pulses, which were extremely weak. That night, I  never did get a temperature, because I was quite disoriented. This morning I?ve been quite stiff and low energy. I feel discomfort in my kidneys, and have taken care to stay hydrated. I have reduced appetite, and some achiness in my body. My temperature right now is 100 even. It?s almost 3 o?clock, so about 28 hours has elapsed. I did not seek further medical care, as I live alone and transportation i would be a hurdle. I also not super concerned, mostly I just want you all to document that I painted, as I have not found that to be listed as a common side effect for the Moderna vaccine. I did call up a friend who is a paramedic, and feel reassured by her two cents.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

Muscle aches, fatigue, just felt off.  Then arm was very sore.  Sunday night my arm pit really started hurting.  Hurst over my shoulder, clavicle, and down into the lateral side of my breast.  Bothered enough in the night that I didn&#39;t sleep well.  This morning 1-5-21 I have a red rash over the injection site, arm is swollen over deltoid and hot.  Arm pit and down into breast is still hurting significantly.  I took Ibuprofen yesterday and helped some with pain in arm pit.  Off an on SOB and chest feels tight.  No cough

Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

                                                The next morning following the vaccination, my right lower eyelid started severely twitching every 10-15 minutes for 4 days throughout the entire day, usually subsiding at bedtime. Each time it lasts from 30 seconds to 1 minute every single day. on the 5th day, the twitching stopped for approximately 15 hours but returned when I went to sleep and kept me up through the night. THis has really taken a toll on my livelihood and I am afraid of it progressing to Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never had this happen.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after first covid vaccine I was nauseous, muscle cramps in whole right arm (the side I was given the shot), migraine, dizzy, trouble lifting arm, redness swelling and pain at injection site.  Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

                                                Day of shot had pretty extreme pain in the arm a few hours later into the night. Was pretty extreme next day - couldn?t move arm above head, hard to change in and out of clothes, etc. Following day still pain but maybe 10%better. Over weekend slowly got better. This Monday and Tuesday woke up with very slight pain but nothing that I had to adjust my everyday routine for like a I had the first few days so I thought I was in the clear. Then last night extreme pain back again. Can?t move arm/shoulder without pain. Can?t engage muscle without a lot of pain.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes, but no more than 7 minutes after I received the vaccine I felt odd, like something was about to happen. I felt a bit detached from my body and my surroundings.  I then felt a flush of heat and my throat suddenly closed up. I felt frozen, as if I couldn?t have drawn in a breath if I had wanted to. I quickly removed my mask and sat up in my chair and leaned forward. After approximately 8-10 seconds my throat opened up and I could breathe.  At this time I felt my heart was racing; I could feel my pulse in my neck without putting my hand to my throat. I started to take my pulse at this time and I could feel that my heart rate was beating fast, but was slowing down back to a normal rate. It took approximately 2 minutes for my heart rate to normalize.  I could now breathe, but my throat still felt a little tight, but I wasn?t completely sure. My throat felt as though I had a lump in it and it felt a little difficult to swallow. I wasn?t completely sure it was the vaccination or that I may have been thirsty. I sat for 15 minutes and I felt fine, no other issues. I had to go to a doctor?s appointment where they took my blood pressure (approximately 1 hour after the vaccination) and said that my bp was normal.   I left the appointment at 4:00 pm and noticed that it was no longer difficult to swallow. I noticed that my throat felt different. The feeling of the ?lump? was gone and I could swallow much more easily. It was at this time that I realized my throat had still been swollen. It had taken almost 2 hours from the time of injection for my throat to feel normal again.  I am healthy, have had several vaccinations in the past and have no known allergies. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I contacted my PCP the next day once they were open to describe my symptoms. She said that I should proceed with the second dose next month, but should take some precautions first.   I didn?t alert anyone immediately after the vaccination as I?ve never had this sort of reaction and wasn?t entirely sure of what it was. I was also in route to a doctor?s appointment and figured if necessary, could receive treatment there. My PCP advised me to take 2 Benadryl and a Zyrtec one hour before the next vaccination. She also advised that I wait for 30 minutes in the observation area following the next dose.   It is Monday evening and as of now I have had no other adverse effects. I have had minimal arm pain and no other effects at all.

                                                As the injection day wore on, my arm increased in soreness. By 9:00 pm on day of injection, I was unable to lift or move my arm, due to the pain. For 2 days after the injection, I was unable to perform many activities becuase I could not lift or move my arm. By 11:30 pm on Saturday 1/16, I started to be able to lift and move my arm, a tiny bit. On Sunday the 17th, I was able to lift my arm to shoulder height, but still had a great deal of pain. The pain started to lessen throughout the day on Sunday. When I woke up Monday morning, I was able to use my arm, but it felt &#34;dead&#34; (like when you sleep on a limb wrong). This feeling continued through Tuesday, and Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, into Wednesday the 20th, it feels like there is a tennis ball in my arm pit - when my arm is in normal position. When my axillary lymph nodes were felt, there is no swelling, but a greater amount of pain.

I took 800 mg Ibuprofen and then I had to take 1000 mg Tylenol and was sent home from work and Tylenol kicked in and I dosed every 8 hours and did that for a few days to be safe. The 31st wasn&#39;t bad - mostly felt fatigued and was getting on and off headaches. 1st - Feeling some fatigue still is all and then SI joint has still not resolved.

Normal treatment that works for me( rizatroban) only slightly lessened. Advil Tylenol alternated for migraine and chills. Arm much less sore this time. I would say normal injection soreness.  But stayed in bed all day due to migraine, chills and fatigue. No way I could have worked. 36hrs- woke up feeling really foggy and some dizziness.  After drinking a few glasses of water feeling somewhat normal.  No fatigue today, arm feeling almost normal.

I went to bed that night as usual. I was tossing and turning and woke my self up because i could feel my heart racing. I then proceeded to check my pulse and time myself. I had gotten 120 heart rate. Which i thought it couldnt be but the i have the oxygen sat that check oxygen and heart rate. I checked and my heart rate went up to 125. My head was pounding, i had a fever, the left side of my body ached, and i felt a lot of tension and my hands as if they were swollen. I took some Tylenol throughout the day and i still felt completely exhausted and horrible. This lasted at least 2 days. I contacted the ER nurse hotline they proceeded to tell me that all the signs and symptoms I had were reactions to the vaccine and if my heart rate went over 135 to go to the ER.

It felt like a fever with chills. My arm was hurting worse than before and I had a terrible headache. I couldn&#39;t sleep for the rest of the night. Around 7am, I got up and took 2 tablets of acetaminophen. It relieved my headache and some of the pain in my arm. I&#39;m very tired and moving slowly.

                                                About 3 hours after the injection, I was hit all of a sudden with extreme fatigue and dizziness. This lasted several hours until a took a 2-3 hour nap after lunch. I felt better enough after the nap to at least get through the rest of the day. However, by around 8 pm I had uncontrollable shaking chills. Could not get warm. Eventually fell asleep, and woke up 3 hours later with fever and severe body aches. My temperature was 101.5, but consider that my normal body temp is a full degree lower than average, so for me this was extremely hot. I felt like my body was radiating heat like a furnace. I was so hot and uncomfortable that I couldn&#39;t sleep, and gave up after an hour. I got up and had a Tylenol, tea, and snack (so as to not have the Tylenol on empty stomach). A little before 4 am I finally fell asleep again. When I woke up around 7 am, I didn&#39;t feel quite so hot anymore but there were still the body aches. As the morning went on, the aches reduced to just my upper body, neck, and the sore injection arm. I had a headache through the morning and early afternoon, but by late afternoon I was feeling more normal again.

                                                pt stated that instantaneously after getting the covid vax she got a metal taste in side of her mouth and her tongue felt funny.  She had a tingling inside her mouth behind her teeth.  She was administered Benadryl.  She then got a tingling inside of the throat that moved down into her chest.  First Response team  was called.  She was having SOB.  She was moved to the ER where she was given more Benadryl and prednisone.  After that she had tingling in her lips as they were warm and puffy.  She was released around noon.  About 1:00 PM the same day pt started having SOB and the same bad taste in her mouth along with all of the other symptoms.  She took another Benadryl at 1:54 PM.   At 3PM she was sleeping and woke with tingling and hotness in her lips.  She started coughing and having trouble catching her breath.  This symptoms went away and came back at 3:46 pm.  She then again developed the same symptoms all over again but this also included swelling in the back of the tongue.   She took another Benadryl at 6:28 PM and then again at 10:28. About 11PM she got these mouth symptoms again along w/ really itchy feet and back.  She woke up at 5:50 AM she felt fine. At 8:00 AM she woke up and had the strange metal taste in her mouth along with a strange feeling in it.   At 11AM she had mild episode of the SOB and coughing.  At 3:15 she still has this taste in her mouth along with the strange feeling.  Pt is waiting on a CB from her PCP.

                                                With the first dose, I had only arm pain.  After the second dose, 23 hours in, I had fever, chills, cold sweats, L sided neck pain and stiffness, Left sided headache, brain fogginess, insomnia, muscle aches in my legs, exhaustion.  I was unable to get out of bed for 24 hours.  After 24 hours of this, my headache lingered for 2 days as well as my neck stiffness and malaise.  I would likely not get a 2nd dose ever again because the symptoms were so awful.  I am a Registered Nurse.

As I was driving home at 3:50 pm I suddenly started to feel tingling in my lips and my throat felt swollen and my chest tight. I was halfway home and panicked so I went home and stayed put. My throat started to relax but my chest felt tight and I was dizzy and light headed till about 9pm. My lips ended up getting a little swollen and I?m still having a burning sensation in my cheeks and chin and my lips are still itchy.  I am a nurse and my husband is a physician and we had an epi pen on hand so I didn?t feel the need to go to the hospital as I was in good care but it was terrifying.

                                                On the 1/23  I started to have a rash at the area of the injection site. It was very uncomfortable. Very itchy and felt very hot.  I had to ice pack it and put calamine lotion to help with the symptoms. I did not take anything orally as I was not sure if it was safe to take anti histamines being that I am pregnant. The next day I went to work however I was still having a lot of itchiness in the area of injection.  I took a benadryl table at around 9 am.  At around 10 o&#39;clock I started feeling dizzy and not myself.  I felt that I could not think clearly and I was worried about passing out.  Specially due to my pregnancy ( 13 weeks at that time)  I decided to seek medical attention and went to urgent care.

                                                I am a healthcare provider. I had prophylactically premedicated with Tylenol prior to receiving my covid-19 vaccine. Immediately following the vaccine I had mild / moderate pain at injection site and muscle soreness at injection site. Roughly 20-24 hours after receiving  the vaccine, I developed moderate headache, fatigue, fogginess, full body aches, nausea and upset stomach. I continued on Tylenol twice daily. After a good night?s sleep, I felt better the following morning and all symptoms had resolved within 48 hours post vaccination.

I began to feel like my mind was foggy and some fatigue, then my lower lip and tongue started to tingle. I stopped driving and waited to see if anything further developed. I then felt flush and my hands became clammy. After maybe 2 minutes these symptoms resolved, I never had any trouble breathing so I continued home and did not seek any medical attention. The whole time frame was about 5 to 10 minutes.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

Not so bad as to go to hospital, but wanted to share side effects give them the limited data on this new vaccine.

                                                Approximately around 8:00 pm the same day as my injection I started to be in a fair amount of pain at the injection site (right shoulder) I took a bath still was in pain took Tylenol hoping it would take the edge off around 11:30 the pain started to increase so I put a heating pad on my arm . As the night progressed my shoulder pain intensified and then  I started to feel pain all over my by body mainly in the joints. It was very severe joint pain all over and especially in my right shoulder that I took another bath.  I couldn?t lay down or sleep I could barely walk around my bedroom but even that hurt so bad in my hips and knees. This feeling was very similar as if I were to having an lupus episode in my joints. Around 4 am on January 14th I finally took ibuprofen and eventually I was able to fall asleep. I later woke up around 9 am and thankfully pain free other than a mild shoulder pain where I got my vaccine.

I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

                                                Since receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 12/30/2020 I have been experiencing what almost feels like brain fog. I have had some trouble staying on task at work, trouble finding words, remembering common last names, etc. Oftentimes I will have this temporarily as a migraine aura, but it typically goes away once the migraine comes and goes. This seems to have come to stay since receiving the vaccine. I did have fatigue for approximately 3 days after the vaccine administration - 2-3 hour naps daily. This has improved some. I also had a dull headache that seemed to be there daily for approximately 2.5 weeks post vaccine- nothing I could not tolerate but it just did not want to go away even with my usual treatment - Excedrin Headache and ice.  The best way I can describe it is a dull pain all over the top of my head and forehead. I did have one headache that occurred approximately 5 days after the vaccine, that I would consider a &#34;bad migraine&#34; (Migraine that rendered me incapable of completing my daily routine - having to stay in bed, dizziness, etc). My face on the side with the weakness as a result of my brain tumor has also been a bit more &#34;tired&#34; than usual - facial palsy more pronounced. There have been times in my brain tumor journey where this happens for sometimes a couple of weeks at a time usually due to stress or an impending &#34;bad migraine&#34; coming on or if I have been exposed to or end up developing an illness later - but I never developed an illness an no additional stress. Facial symptoms include smile not as symmetrical (basically more assymetrical than usual - not wanting to move at all so much on the affected side) and more eye watering on the affected side. I do still feel a little lightheaded at times, but otherwise no other neurological symptoms. No upper respiratory symptoms or any other &#34;COVID-like&#34; symptoms. No nausea, vomiting, numbness, or tingling. Symptoms do seem to be improving this week.

                                                About a week after my first does, the injection site swelled more and was hard and warm to the touch and itchy. The next day the affected area was much larger and still hard and warm to the touch. That evening there was a dull, throbbing pain that radiated to my elbow joint and behind my shoulder. The discomfort made it a little difficult to sleep, but pain level about 4/10. I iced it that night and took some Tylenol. Today the pain isn&#39;t as bad 3/10 but the area is still swollen. The appearance reminds me of my allergic reaction to mosquito bites. I had a headache and took some generic Migraine medication.

My body started shaking, I felt very hot and then very cold (back and forth) and began experiencing shortness of breath. It was all very scary and I ended up in the ER.

I was unable to tolerate sleeping on my left side that night and I had a bad headache. My arm is still sore now but I can tolerate pressure on it better. Yesterday around 1:00 pm, the day after the shot, I began having some itching along the back of my neck near my hair line. By around 7:00 that night my neck continued to itch, I was not scratching however, but also my upper posterior neck into my hair line became red, hot, swollen, and painful. It spread equally across my posterior cervical spine from the base of my head to about C7 level (pics taken). My headache worsened and pain spread all the way down my spine to my lumbosacral region. I still have these symptoms now but to a lesser degree. I feel nauseated today as well and had to stay home from work and contact my doctor because of these symptoms.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

By 3 am was up again vomiting. That lasted a few hours. Temp hovered around 101-102 all day (alternating Tylenol 1000mg and Motrin 600 mg q 3 -4 hours). Could not get out of bed all day.  It was pretty intense. By evening the N/V subsided but the other symptoms remained. Temp broke by 10 pm.  The next morning temp was normal, chills were gone, still had the migraine (which migraines are not unusual).  Felt fatigue and body aches, but was functional. By the evening joints hurt so bad could barely walk again. Cont. next page....

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

In the weekend I was getting fatigued and really bad chills and sweats on the second. The 3rd of January, I could barely walk to the bathroom because I was so fatigued. Low fever on the 4th - 99.4. Couldn&#39;t have a full visit to dr on the 4th.Tested for COVID on 4th; Negative result. Couldn&#39;t go back to work until the 7th. I was completely exhausted, no appetite; muscles aches; had a bit of a headache, too, but the fatigue was so overwhelming that I just slept for those three days 5th, 6th, 7th. I went back to work on the 7th - it was rough but over the weekend I started doing better and the following week was better for me.

After consulting with a nurse over the phone, it was recommended to see a doctor, but no appointments available, so I ended up going to the ER. No cellulitis, but it was recommended to monitor and ice my arm. On day 10, it is still swollen, but not as much, and not bright red. Lump in throat disappeared on day 9 in the afternoon.

Later I starter to feel very tired do I went to sleep like about 7pm and I took a Tylenol before doing so.   I kept on waking up in the middle of the night still feeling pressure pain in my head and like a tightness sensation with a slight pain on my chest.   I woke up at 5am to get ready to work and I was still not feeling well. I got out of the house and stoped at a gas station and when I got out of the car, I started to feel extremely dizzy while walking. Got to my work place and took my temperature and it was 99.1. After a while dizziness and pressure on chest kept on getting worst.   I had someone at work take my vitals and my temperature was 101.0,  BP was 144/95, BPM was 120,  SpO2 was 98%. My boss send me home. And now I?m having mid and back lower pain with a bit of chills

                                                3 hours post vaccine, extreme arm pain. Couldn?t lift my arm to get my sweater off. By 10pm I had extreme chills (shaking so hard my jaw locked from being so tense). Sharp shooting pain in my right leg started (still sore today). I then had extreme muscle aches, I could hardly walk to the bathroom. Finally at 12:15 am I took Tylenol.  Was able to sleep until 4 am and woke up with all the same symptoms... still extreme. Kidney pain started around 6am.  I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep until 10am. Woke up feeling just as bad- couldn?t eat. Went back to sleep. Woke up at noon with a headache on top of the rest and had to take ibuprofen (I didn?t want to exceed the allowed amount of acetaminophen in 24 hrs). Kidney pain continued, muscle aches as well. Chills went away around 4pm.  Woke up today feeling pretty good except the headache and kidney pain. Headache subsided around noon. Noticed a giant, raised, hot spot about an inch below vaccine sore tonight... assuming it?s ?Covid arm? . Super strange! Thankful for the vaccine, but dang- I?ve never had any kind of reaction from any vaccine, ever. I get my flu shot yearly.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

I also work up due to fever (temp 100.1 ), chills, and myalgia. I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night and got very little rest as unable to get comfortable. The next day I still had fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, joint pain, low back pain, fatigue and headache (felt similar to prior bad flu symptoms). I was sent home from work early as symptoms continued throughout the day with a little relief from a 500mg of acetaminophen. The following day 12/31 symptoms were gone except for the left sore arm which was improving and now completely done on 1/3.

                                                The morning after my vaccine I woke up with a very sore upper arm. By 4pm that evening I had fatigue, chills, and body aches. I went to bed and slept much longer than normal and woke up the next morning without chills or body aches. My arm still hurt quite a bit and I started to have elbow joint and hip pain. The following day I started to have sciatica from my hip to my foot on my injection side, the left side. My elbow joint was sore for about 3-4 days after the injection. I also had some numbness right at the injection site the night of the vaccine.

The following morning (24 hours post vaccine) I still was having numbness and tingling in my feet and my legs from knees down felt weak and jelly like. I still was able to walk fine, but it was uncomfortable, not able to work out etc.  12/31 (48 hours post) I worked for 10 hours this day and symptoms were the same, that evening I continued to have same symptoms and my knees and ankles ached intermittently. 1/1- Same symptoms as previous days. 1/2- Same symptoms and started having tingling down back of upper leg from butt to back of knee, still tingling in feet.  1/2- Went to ER waited 8 hours and left. 1/3- Went to Emory ER and they ruled out GBS and said they have not seen this particular reaction to the vaccine but due to presentation they believe it is a vaccine reaction&#34;.

                                                At minute 12 after injection (8:31am on 1/5/20), the pruritis started on my scalp and my back. I informed the volunteer at the end of the drive line. She offered to have EMS evaluate me, however I declined as I thought the reaction was mild. Over the next 10 minutes, after being released from the driveline, I was so itchy I wanted to literally rip all of my skin off. The back of my throat started to itch, but never felt tight or swollen. No SOB or chest tightness. I checked my temp at 8:45 and I was at 101.0 and HR was 110bpm. I am a PA working in dermatology and got to work and took 50mg of diphenhydramine PO but was not improving. One of the doctors I work with and I decided it was best for me to get checked out in urgent care. I had my MA drive me there and was seen immediately. I had a blotchy rash over my entire body, but not raised or hived. Temp was 100.6, HR 86 and BP 127/78, respirations 16/min O2 sat 98% and the itchiness was still severe but I could tell the diphenhydramine was kicking in. I was then given 40mg of famotidine PO and 10mg Dexamethasone IM in the right buttocks while in urgent care. After about 15 minutes, my symptoms were improving, but not resolved. I was released and went home to rest. Throughout the day yesterday (1/5/20) my heart rate would spike as high as 130bmp (my normal is 60-70bpm). Then it would come down within a few seconds to about 100bpm and steadily stay between 90-100bpm all day. Last night I was woken up at 3:30am (1/6/20) with a HR of 132bpm and O2 at 97%. I took a few deep breaths, and it slowly started to drop to 100bpm. Since 6:00am, I am steady at 70-80bpm with occasional spikes of 96-100bpm and I can feel when my heart is starting to race. I have my pulse ox on for the day and will continue to monitor my symptoms. I still have occasional pruritis, but it&#39;s tolerable. I was discharged from urgent care with PO Prednisone tapered dose, however, I am very shaky already and do not want to make it worse, so have not started it yet. Not sure if I should? And I would like to know if I should receive the second dose? If so, should I pre-medicate? Please let me know if you have any further questions about my event. Thanks.

Also noticed slight numbness of fingertips to right hand. Patient attributed this to her mask being on too tight and receiving the vaccine in right arm and was discharged from clinic without stating the above. As patient began to drive 50 minutes to home, she called her husband and stated she felt numb inside her right gum and cheek- he advised her to return to clinic. Patient presented to me as screener for COVID testing line- stating she was just here but didn&#39;t feel right- I escorted her inside- steady gait, no SOB, dyspnea, speaking in full sentences, upon reaching discharge area, VS 98.3- HR 61 reg- resps 18 unlabored, b/p 122/72 pulse ox r/a 100%.

                                                While waiting the 15 minutes after the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy, I thought it was just because I was nervous.  After the 15 minutes, I went outside and tood off my mask to get some fresh air.  I went back to work and was still feeling dizzy.  I drank water, ate some food and sat for a bit.  At about 1pm, I was still feeling dizzy but also started feeling off, as if I were intoxicated or like how you feel when you just wake up from having anesthesia, sluggish.  I then went home and slept for about 5 hours and now I feel much better.  Will someone let me know if it is recommended I still get the second dose next month?

                                                About 10-20 seconds after receiving vaccine I felt faint and the darkness started to close in and I almost passed out.  The back of my tongue became very dry.   I felt better after 10 minutes and never passed out.  They took my vital signs and everything was normal.  I have never been bothered by needles before at all so it was strange.  However I do have a long history of anxiety so it?s possible it was just that.

Side affects started the following morning after my vaccine with arm pain and stiffness. After about 24 hours I had fatigue and chills with body aches. I slept for about 14 hours that evening then woke up the next morning without chills, body aches, and less arm pain. I then developed joint pain in my elbow and hip, as well as sciatica down my whole leg, that lasted for 2 more days. I also had numbness at the injection site for about 1 day.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

                                                Two hours after the injection I experienced increasing soreness in my left shoulder up through the left side of my neck and down through the forearm. I became slightly nauseous through that evening. The pain and tightness got to the point I could not perform regular functions with the left arm. It felt as if my muscles were tearing and prevented me from sleeping. I took ibuprofen in addition to alternating ice and heat to no avail. It hurt to lift my arm, grip to pull or push even a blanket. This continued for 48 hours before there was slight relief. Full range of motion returned four days after the injection. For brief periods throughout the days following, I also experienced occasional slight heart palpitations.

                                                Moderately severe pain which made basic movements difficult and woke me up frequently throughout the night beginning evening of vaccination on 1/14/2021 and steadily worsening through the next day and night. Large oblong welt about 2 inches across at injection site. Symptoms started within a few hours of getting the injection and became steadily very significant by the next day. It took about 7 days to recover from the most significant symptoms and was still recovering from mild bruise and occasional itching but no redness. Today (1/26/2021) my arm started itching again, and I see that I have a large flat circular (about 2 inches across) red spot right where I had the welt a week ago.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

On the same date, after administration of vaccine, the patient had experienced swollen arm (swelling), hives on the back, 2.5in red circle, didn&#39;t feel good, was tired and couldn&#39;t process things well. On 18-Jan-2021, 10 days after the administration of vaccine, the patient had developed very large-red allergic reaction at the injection site with perfect circle and was hot to the touch. Treatment for the event included paracetamol (acetaminophen) and loratadine.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not provided.   The outcome of events didn&#39;t feel good, hot to the touch, hives on the back, tired and very large, red (2.5/3in circle) allergic reaction at the injection site was unknown. The event lack of correct administration, injection appears to be lower than where normally given, was injected in the fat and not in the muscle was considered to be resolved on 08-Jan-2021. The event swollen arm/hardness was considered to be resolved on 09-Jan-2021. The event couldn&#39;t process things well was considered to be resolved on 15-Jan-2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of a 37-year-old female patient who experienced non-serious events of lack of correct administration/injection appears to be lower than where normally given/was injected in the fat and not in the muscle ( inappropriate route of vaccine administered), didn&#39;t feel good, couldn&#39;t process things well, hot to the touch, hives on the back, swollen arm/hardness, tired and very large, red (2.5/3in circle) allergic reaction at the injection site..  All events excluding (large-red allergic reaction at the injection site with perfect circle hot to the touch) developed on the same day after the administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (lot # 011L20A, expiration date-unknown). The event of large-red allergic reaction at the injection site with perfect circle which was hot to the touch developed 10 days after the vaccine administration. Based on the information provided which includes a temporal association, a causal association between the administration of the vaccine and the other reported events cannot be excluded. Tiredness, redness and hives are consistent with the safety profile of the vaccine. The event of inappropriate route of vaccine administered is considered not applicable.

                                                Thursday morning I awakened sluggish and feeling foggy in the brain. I had chills and a tmeperature of 100.3 with tylenol. At 11:42 am my temp was 102.3. I had severe headache, fatigue, bodyaches, chills. neck stiffness and joint pain, light sensitivity, nausea/loss of appetite. Moderate swelling at injection site (left deltoid) and swollen lymph nodes. Dizziness.  I slept most of the day, awakening to use the bathroom and at that time check my temp. Today 1/29/2021 some things have improved. my temp have improved 98.5, my headache is there but not a 10. I still have not eaten today. I am still taking tylenol. The light sensitivity is gone. The neck stiffness is there, but improving.

My body hurt to touch. Left work early January 29 because I did not feel good. Afternoon of January 29 around 4 PM I noticed some redness approximately an inch and a half below the injection site. Looked like a lump under my skin and it was painful to the touch. I took Benadryl the evening of January 29 and the morning of January 30.,Not sure if the Benadryl is helping. I am keeping an eye on the redness and the lump, if it does not go away I will contact my provider. I do not feel the chills or feverish anymore and I was able to sleep through the night on January 29

                                                At approximately 11:45 pm the same day I received my second Moderna injection for Covid, I woke up from sleep shivering uncontrollably. I felt like I was chilled to the bone and was shivering so hard my muscles all felt contracted. I did not have a fever at this time. I got extra blankets and tuned heat up and over next 45 minutes managed to decrease shivering. Around this time, I rechecked my temperature and had a fever of 101.7. I used tylenol and later motrin as the fever kept rising. I was in and out of sleep with severe body aches, arm pain at site of injection, and increasing fever even after taking ibuprofen an hour later. My temp eventually reached a max of 104.5 at which point I uncovered myself and got ice packs for my head and neck. I managed to get my fever down to about 102.6 and it stayed in that range until about 445am the next morning. I was finally able to get a little rest. When I woke at 815am, my fever was 100.5. From there, the more notable issues were the intense body and joint pains and skin sensitivity along with increasing arm pain at site of injection. My fever managed to stay low grade around 99.5 throughout the day but then started increasing again in the evening. At about 500pm, it was at 100.8. I took more medication to reduce it and was unable to sleep until about 2am still from the pain. I then slept for approx 6 hours into Sunday morning,  today, and have had no fever. I am improving with pains, but have noticed red blotchy areas near my injection site which still hurts immensely but is tolerable.

                                                The first night after receiving the shot I had pain in my arm, this was not severe, but enough that it woke me up in the night on the night that I had the injection (Friday).  The pain went away after about 2 days.  Today, (eight days later) I woke up with a horrible itch at the injection site.  I started to scratch the area (still half asleep) and could feel it swelling with every scratch.  When I got up and looked in the mirror, it was hard as a rock, swollen, and about the size of a baseball.  The swelling in the center was white and looked almost like cottage cheese bumps under the skin.  I drew a circle around the swelling and went to see clients for the rest of the day.  Tonight, when I got home I drew another circle to see how much the swelling had increased.  It had increased quite significantly.  The area (that is rock hard) is about 8 inches from top to bottom and four inch width.  It is rock hard still, itchy, and hot to the touch.  The area is red, but the white cottage cheese bumps are down a bit.  I have also had a headache for two days prior to the swelling.  I thought this was unrelated, but I don&#39;t think that anymore.  I normally do not get headaches.  If the swelling has increased by tomorrow, I will seek medical attention.

Fever of 101, chills, aches, some nausea, and feeling like my body was on fire at times. I did have to leave early from work due to Advil and Tylenol not improving symptoms. I am however feeling a little better now over 48 hours post vaccine but still have some aches in legs and joints.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine I started to have an increased heart rate and blood pressure.  I was watched for close to an hour, and let go.  I experienced muscle and joint pain, which was to be expected.  Approximately 2 days afterwards, I started to experience dizziness, low blood pressure, and pressure in the middle of the back of my head.  The pressure became worse and worse, while continuing to experience the above side effects.  Since that time, I have been to the emergency room for pain all over, pressure in the back of the head, memory issues, blood in the stool, and extremely cold hands and feet without explanation.

I received my 1st dose of Moderna COVID vaccine around 5/45pm on Thursday 2/25 by a woman at the High School.  The shot felt fine at the time but I did notice she went a bit higher up on my shoulder.  However, the morning after, I was experiencing extreme shoulder pain with limited range of motion as the day progressed on 2/26. By night time of 2/26, I couldn?t remove my bra and had to ask my husband for assistance. I?m scared and terrified that I won?t be able to hold my newborn baby when he?s born. This is all I can think about. I don?t even care that I?m in severe pain. All I can think about is how this is going to ruin my experience caring for my child without full range in one of my arms. It?s 2:37am where I am and I can?t sleep because of the shoulder pain.

Zaleplon insufficient duration so switched to Zolpidem PRN. She has not required more than a few doses of zolpidem but now we have uptitrated her to gabapentin 600mg nightly. She feels significant improvement in her sleep and work product, but continues to have intermittent cognitive errors and some decrease in work performance, that remain concerning to her.

                                                This is a 37 year old female.  Within 10 minutes of her 1st dose Moderna, the patient developed a mild rash (location not specified).  She took a dose of diphenhydramine with some relief.  She went home.  2.5 hours later, she developed a facial twitching and reported to the ED.  She reported involuntary facial muscle twitching, like spasms, that were painful.  On ED presentation, BP=121/86, HR=93, RR=16, SpO2=98%.  ED noted no swelling, itching, SOB, chest pain, N/V/D, or rash.  The ED notes describe the symptoms as &#34;Numerous and varying facial movements including contraction of the lower cheek muscles on the left and then the right along with movement of the tongue from side to side at which point she bites or gets the tongue in the way while trying to speak.  Speech is therefore slurred however at times clear. Oropharynx is clear with mildly dry mucous membranes.  No oral or pharyngeal swelling, difficulty swallowing, or stridor.  Neck is supple and nontender without adenopathy. Differential diagnosis includes: allergic reaction, dystonic drug reaction (unusual to be varying from the left to the right), dyskinesia, anxiety, somatization or conversion disorder, among others.  Her symptoms are not consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy, stroke, or clearly tardive dyskinesia. Subsequently given diazepam, fentanyl, and 500mL IV fluids.&#34;  She was discharged home.  Patient returned to the ED on 12/31 (within 24hrs) with ongoing symptoms.  Patient was monitored and discharged home again.   One month later, on 1/28/21, chart notes indicate that she has continued to have intermittent symptoms continue.  A trial of steroids reportedly made symptoms worse.  She reports that she also feels fatigued and with &#39;brain fog.&#39;  She currently has a neurology consult pending.

                                                Shot given at 3:47- approximately 3-5 minutes later started to experience blurred vision, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.   Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

Earlier in the day I noticed a little pain discomfort in my right arm pit. As the day wore on, I noticed swelling in my lymph nodes and the level of discomfort increased to the point that it disturbed my sleep. 1/3/2021: The pain and swelling at the injection site and armpit continued to be the same. I took ibuprofen to try and alleviate the level of discomfort. That evening before bed also took Benadryl to see if it would help with the injection site reaction. I also started experiencing a dull shooting pain and tingling from my armpit down to my wrist on my right arm. 1/4/2021: The injection site improved, no more knot, heat, or itching. It still remained a little swollen. Lymph nodes were still swollen throughout the day, but manageable with ibuprofen. Shooting pain and tingling still occurring sporadically throughout the day. 1/5/2021: Still a little discomfort in the armpit, but seems to be improving.

                                                Employee Recollection: Wednesday and Thursday  felt kind of weak and more tired than normal, but thought nothing of it.  In the early afternoon on Friday the symptoms got worse.   Tired and confused.  I slept through my alarm and woke up to my mom, who was watching my daughter for me, trying to wake me up.  I was very confused, dizzy and weak.  My mom said I was really out of it, and that I had a really hard time focusing on what she was trying to say to me.    When I checked in for work my O2 stats were in the upper 80&#39;s lower 90&#39;s.  My temp was also in the lower 90&#39;s.  That was after numerous attempts at taking my o2 stats and temps.  Co-worker said I was very confused, tired, dizzy and weak.  She said there were times when I was walking that I would reaching for walls and railings to regain my balance.  I left work at 6am Saturday morning.  I went home and went straight to bed.  Slept all day long until a few hours before my shift started at 9:30 P.M.   since then I&#39;ve been feeling better, but my temp and 02 stats are still low.  But I&#39;m continuing to monitor symptoms.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if anything changes.

Tuesday I woke up within 20mins I was nauseous and threw up multiple times. My body was achy and just felt &#34;blah&#34;. Was weak and dizzy when I stood up. I felt like my insides were on fire (like the worst temperature you&#39;ve ever had) but didn&#39;t have a fever. Felt like my brain was going to swell out of my head and it was the worst headache. I slept all day. Woke up long enough to call the dr and fell back asleep. Halfway through the day I ended up with a fever of 102 (it went down after a few hrs). Today I woke up still feeling weak and somewhat dizzy, spacey.

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

                                                I  got it at 2pm Friday.  About 2 hours later my arm started feeling sore but not too bad. I did some light yoga and walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.  Otherwise took it easy that day. Satu I woke up with a slight headache which isn&#39;t unusual for me.  I still had mild soreness in my arm. I did a more difficult yoga workout and then walked 5 miles outside.  Took a shower after and relaxed for a bit. Then had dinner around 5 and within the hour started having diarrhea.  This lasted a few hours during which my arm started gradually hurting more, it was pretty bad. Could barely move it and hurt to the touch even. Shivering started soon after.  I never had a fever or fatigue during all of this. Highest temp was 98.4 with forehead thermometer. I talked to a doctor to put my mind at ease and he said I was having a big immune response to the vaccine, apparently younger adults between 20 to 40 are having bigger immune responses. The second dose is stronger so most are  having these symptoms after that one, but some are having it after the first as well. He also told me I should have taken it easy these past 2 days and that I likely overdid it. He advised that I take motrin or Tylenol, get under blankets to stay warm, and rest. That&#39;s exactly what I did and a little over an hour later I was feeling much better.   I&#39;m a bit freaked out by what the second dose is going to do to me since it is supposed to be worse. Is it safe for me to get second dose?

                                                About 24 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced extreme breast tenderness in both breasts. They felt sore to the touch all over, had the sensation of being full and heavy, and had to be supported in a bra in order to be tolerable. I liken it to postpartum pain associated with breast feeding and milk engorgement. I would list the symptoms the first night as moderate to severe. It limited my ability to do certain tasks because of the pain and discomfort. The breast tenderness has decreased in severity since then but it is now 1/11/2021 and both breasts are still tender. The severity is now mild. It&#39;s uncomfortable but does not limit my daily activity. Of note, I have had a tubal ligation and ablation and am not pregnant but I cannot track the timing of my cycle to know if the vaccine affected my cycle or caused hormonal changes that could explain the breast sensitivity.   I had arm soreness at the injection site for the first 48 hours but that has gone away. No other symptoms to report.

                                                I had the vaccine Sunday night and experienced fatigue that night, and then developed arm soreness that lasted for a little over 24 hours. I also developed minor body aches and felt crummy Monday and Tuesday. I was then fine for the rest of that week. Monday, January 4th at 7:30 PM, I felt something tingly, burning, and hot on my left arm. When I looked at it, I had a large round red rash that had a knot and was hot to the touch and itchy. At 3:30 AM on Tuesday morning, I woke up in pain and crying. I went to Urgent Care to have it assessed. The doctor diagnosed it as cellulitis in relation to an infection at the injection site and gave me an antibiotic and drew around it with a surgical marker. He told me to go to my PCP if it grew outside of the line or to the ER if I developed severe symptoms. On Wednesday, it had grown and was not getting any better and had started forming blisters. I called my PCP and he told me to take 2 Loratadine every 24 hours and to come in if it was not better by Friday. It appeared to be getting better and I was fine on Thursday. Friday morning, I woke up in pain again. The rash had spread across the majority of my upper arm. It was red and painful and itching with heat. I went in to see my PCP and he diagnosed it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He gave me a steroid, which seems to be suppressing the rash and symptoms. I still have a rash and itchiness, but my physician said it could last for another week or two until it goes away.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

I woke upbat 5am and the pain was still just as bad. Any little movement was excruciating. I could not change my clothes, brush my hair, wash my face. The only reason I waa still able to work is because I am a teacher and we are remote so I was able to sign on from home and sit at my desk with my arm in an imaginary swing because that was the only time it did not hurt. Later that night I could begin to move my arm a little before pain started but still needed help getting dressed, etc. The next two days I was able to move it little more before pain started.  It is now 5 days later and I can lift my arm up. I still feel pain but it ia tolerable.

                                                Around 6pm my arm starting getting sore. All night it hurt really badly and kept me awake. I took Tylenol around 3am and that helped. When I woke up the day after I had a HUGE lump on my arm at the injection site. It looked like a golf ball. It was red and hot. It stayed this way for about 3 more days and finally started to go down. The red mark at the injection spot remained though and continued hurting until about day 9 after the shot. Then it started getting itchy but remained red. I am now over 2 weeks post shot and the red mark is still slightly there but not very visible and the pain and itchiness has gone away.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

Little out of it feeling.  This was pretty much done by 1/1/21. 1/7/21 one week and a day after injection, injection site became raised, hard, inflamed looking  and was itchy. Site was visibly red and raised and had approximate 3 in diameter.  Previously mentioned symptoms began again (waves of hot flashes, nausea, aches).  This lasted at least until bedtime.  Next day, 1/8/21 felt better and injection site, though still hard and red, reduced down to size of quarter.  No further symptoms BUT injection site now as of 1/20/21 still looks like a quarter sized bruise.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

                                                Left arm pain began on Thurs. 1/7/21, approximately 30 minutes after vaccine.  Severe headache and pain radiating to left side of neck began approximately 22 hours after vaccine (around 2pm on 1/8/21) and left arm pain worsened.  On 1/9/21, unable to get out of bed-felt like I had been drugged- severe HA, fatigue, and left side of neck soreness.  Felt slightly better on 1/10/21 and 1/11/21, however stil unable to get out of bed due to severe HA and fatigue.  On morning of 1/12/21, fatigue relieved and severe HA relieved around 1pm.  Since 1/12/21, Severe HA, left arm tightness and left neck soreness has continued intermittently.  This is a HA I have never experienced before.  Yesterday, on 1/21/21, I had a severe HA all day at work and when I went home, I had to lie down the rest of the day/evening d/t severe HA, fatigue and left neck tightness.  I was unable to do daily chores and help my children with their homework.  I also woke up this morning with the same severe HA and left neck soreness/tightness.  I do feel this HA is from the vaccine as I have never experienced this type of HA prior to receiving the vaccine and I am not someone who gets HA&#39;s often.    I know the vaccine was given too high, as I give vaccines often for my career, and I am wondering if that has anything to do with my neck pain.  I did bleed a lot with the injection (do not think it went into my muscle) and am wondering if that has anything to do with my adverse reaction.  I am fearful these severe HA&#39;s will continue and I am extremely hesitant to receive my second dose!

It is hot and tender to touch. And very red.

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was dizzy. I sat down where they had us wait and the dizziness wouldn&#39;t go away. Became difficult to swallow - felt like a lump in my throat. More difficult to breathe then normal. Vitals taken. BP taken. Feeling like I had an epidural. Legs had a sensation like they were going numb and then they went numb. Benadryl injection given. Legs felt like they fell asleep. Waited and within second 30 min timeframe I was feeling a lot better so I left. 2:30 in the morning, my legs were asleep again and the lump came back in my throat and took Benadryl and it went away and I felt fine. I went to work the next day. At 7:00 that evening felt chilled and it came and went. I came up and took more Benadryl and rested.I went to work the next day and I sent a message to my Primary Care DR. - but leg was fine and the lump in throat wasn&#39;t there. On Saturday morning - after 10 days - had a headache that would not go away  (Very severe headache)- took Tylenol 1000 mg it didn&#39;t work. It was very bad Saturday night I took another Tylenol 1000 and Sunday morning it - headache still wasn&#39;t gone. Leg was numb again. This time the leg  numbness was worse than ever had felt. Left axilla - there was a lump/nodule and it was painful. Tried TeleHealth Med and they recommended I go to ER but I didn&#39;t feel good enough to do it. Dr.  I reached out to her and she took the history and she prescribed Prednisone; but wanted me to do a COVID test and Urine sample to see how I was doing before I took the medication so I did it next the day. Urine sample was clean. Prednisone 60 for four days 40 for four days and 20 for four days - On day Prednisone my legs feel fine, but the headache just lingers. On day two of Prednisone she told me to stop the Benadryl. Three days after Prednisone the lump under axilla resolved. I am taking coffee. Headache is still there but not as severe.

Basically it feels like a bruise when I flex my bicep it hurts there or when my arm is relaxed at my side the pressure hurts in the armpit. It is not superficial .

                                                The following day I had redness at the injection site about 2/12 inches long and wide with itching and minor swelling/bump. The day following also was tired achy and felt off/headache. On Thursday symptoms went away other than the arm and a slight headache. On Saturday the redness and I ring was gone, but I started having pain in my armpit and when I moved my arm in different positions. Hand was tingling with certain positions suggesting nerve pain. Lasted 2 to 3 days and got worse before better. Was mostly gone by Tuesday. Wednesday 8 days after injections the redness, itching, and swelling in my arm returned. Same size as the day after my injection. Called the doctor to see if I need to be concerned that the redness, itchyness, and swelling returned after completely going away 4 days earlier. Also feeling tired for the past 3 to 4 days but otherwise good. Some minor discomfort/pain in collar bone around and lump node in neck but is not consistent. Comes and goes. Not sure if the nerve pain in arm was related to the vaccine, but since the redness returned it may all be related.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart started racing and I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

My brain was telling me to walk forward and my legs were stumbling all over as I tried to walk. I went back to sleep and woke up hours later more stable but still with my head feeling very light(not quite dizzy). I was slightly nauseous and just blah most of the next day. I?d get slightly out of breath when talking for awhile. I was in a deep fog. To the point it took a few minute to process the sound my dog made with it coming from him. Overall, I felt like I was drugged or really intoxicated. I worry about my 2nd dose!

The next morning, I woke with minor side effects body aches, chills, slight fever and arm sore from injection. As the day progressed, my symptoms got worse. By body aches were so severe that it hurt to stand, sit, bend and curl my toes. My head was so full of congestion by the end of the night. I was meeting with a small group of family for New Year&#39;s and thought that I would get checked to make sure that it was nothing. I was tested for COVID and for Influenza. I came back positive for Influenza A. I was sent home with a sample of Xofluza. I was in bed for 2 days and symptoms started subsiding. I went back to work the following week.

It was sensitive to the touch to the point that I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body.  It also hurt to raise my arm any higher than shoulder height.  It went away on its own after about 36 hours.  One week later, on January 7th, my husband noticed that I had a large red patch on my arm where I had gotten the vaccination.  It was about 1.5-2&#34; across, raised, red and warm to the touch.  It was slightly itchy, but didn&#39;t hurt.  My husband noticed this in the evening, but I am not sure how long it had been that way since I had had long sleeves on all day.  By the morning, it had gone away.  I didn&#39;t treat it in any way.

                                                7 days after (Wednesday, January 27) receiving the vaccine, I developed a small itchy hive at the injection site. Considered it was a mosquito bite but woke up the following day (Thursday) with the area swollen, red, and hot to the touch.  I also had a stomach ache so I took Tylenol which did not help.  Friday, I took ibuprofen  and the redness and swelling subsided but the heat remained until the evening of Sunday, January 21 when I started having an anxiety attack and noticed a red ring/rash around the injection site.  I took benadryl but it&#39;s still there.  I read that people are calling it &#34;Covid arm.&#34;  It&#39;s not itchy, just a raised red circle/square about 5 inches in diameter around the injection site.  It is still very hot to the touch.  Besides this and severe anxiety brought on by it, I&#39;ve had no other symptoms.

                                                About 5 hours after the vaccine, I started feeling really hot especially in head and face. From there, I had fever and it started going up. Body aches; joint pain; headache; and this went on all throughout that night (Jan 2 and morning of the 3rd). The 3rd, my fever wasn&#39;t as high but I still had fever and felt really really tired and body aches/joint pain. On the 4th, when I woke up I noticed that I didn&#39;t have any taste and smell and so I went in and got tested for COVID 19 (the 4th) - positive for COVID-19.  I went to a clinic that could do a Rapid test. Doctor there gave me Azithromyocin - 2 the first day and one every day after; Dexamethasone once  a day for 10 days.  I could  Tylenol and Motrin (alternating because my fever wouldn&#39;t go down). The highest my fever got was that Saturday night got up to 103 degrees. The last day I had fever was the 5th of January and that was 99.8. Jan 7, 8, and 9th -  I continued to have other symptoms like really severe headache; no appetite; felt super tired and could hardly get out of bed. Those symptoms resolved about the 10th of Jan -  headache almost went away and fatigue was still there and it is still there. I got out of quarantine on the 15th and I went back to work on the 18th - I had no fever. I just felt tired. I couldn&#39;t sleep - throughout. I finally started being able to sleep just a couple of days ago. I had the second dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 30th - I had fever again; body aches; joint pain.

After about an hour, my arm was swollen and very painful to move and touch. I put an ice pack on and took Tylenol but the pain and swelling didn?t completely subside. I went to bed with Tylenol PM to help me sleep and woke up several times from the pain. Throughout the day today (2nd day), the pain has steadily gotten worse. I can barely move my arm due to the immense pain. The swelling is still there. I have been icing it and taking Tylenol but the pain has only gotten worse. I feel achy in my neck and the pain is radiating down my arm to my forearm, wrist, and fingers.

The red areas were swollen, hot to touch, and each were a hard lump a little larger than a marble.  These two spots were about 3 inches below the injection site and an inch closer to the body midline.  These red spots worsened and joined together.  1/28/21 I was still experiencing the red raised area that had grown in size, still hot to the touch and now red and rashy around the outer edge.  Redness diminished over the weekend and resolved by 2/3/21.  Arm and shoulder still are achy and sore.

                                                Client reported being anxious prior to vaccination, but did some deep breathing which she felt helped calm her down.  After the injection, she felt dizzy, &#34;the room was spinning&#34; and she was not able to focus on what the vaccinator was saying.  She reported feeling dizzy to the vaccinator who kept her seated and provided bottled water.  Clinic Manager and Vaccine Group Supervisor took initial vital signs.  Client also appeared to be shaking.  10:20am: BP: 130/96, HR: 90.  At about 10:25am, client reported feeling better.  VGS moved client to a seat near the clinic staff area to complete her 30 minute waiting period.  VGS took vital signs.  10:30am: BP: 120/90, HR: 88.  Client was no longer visibly shaking.  She reported that her husband was waiting in the car to take her home.  Client&#39;s condition improved and was released from the clinic to return to her home.  Client was escorted to her car by the Deputy Safety Officer.

                                                Towards the evening of the day of the vaccine, I got headache and body aches. Next day, it was like full blown Covid all over again - joint aches; fever - 101.6; sweats; body aches; rash around the injection site; headache; redness and warmness around injection site, too. I had extreme fatigue.I had a terrible cough. I didn&#39;t have a sore throat. I had a lot of shortness of breath. My shortness of breath and my cough was still lingering (from when I had COVID before the vaccine). Went to URGENT Care on Friday, 8th; They Took chest x-ray - COVID pneumonia -was what DR called - antibiotics  - took one course but didn&#39;t finish the second and prednisone - did finish the course of the asteroids. Next day they said the radiologist said it wasn&#39;t pneumonia.  I still felt pretty crappy the following week and then I was fine. I didn&#39;t work 11th or 12th but as the week went on I started feeling better. Symptoms have resolved. I had the second vaccine on February 2nd, 2021. It went better then first - but I had joint aches; fatigue; headache;chills on the day after and then they slowly tapered off the next two days and then I felt fine.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:25 pm on Saturday Feb 13th. I woke up early Sunday unable to sleep due to all over body aches and joint pain. I did not have a fever at any point. I had chills off and on, but mostly horrible body aches everywhere. My left arm was also extremely sore. I knew this was all normal so I was not at all worried. Then Sunday evening my right knee started aching more than the rest of my body and started swelling. I took ibuprofen and went to bed. When I woke up Monday morning it was severely swollen and bright red and heat was radiating  from it.  I had to take a day off of work because I stand at work and it was making it much worse. So I iced it and elevated it and took ibuprofen, but it remained swollen and red and very painful. I was unable to bend the knee and couldn&#39;t crouch down or bend the knee to sit.  On Wednesday morning I went to my doctor at the clinic on the advice or a friend that is a nurse and a friend that is a pharmacist. See below (item 19) for what was prescribed. This took away the severe swelling within about a day and a half, but it&#39;s still painful and achy and hurts to bend. There is also still a bump on the top of my knee.  The all over body aches and joint pain lasted until about Friday the 19th . I have photos of my knee if you would like them.

Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

Fever and pain subsided a bit by the next morning at 8am but not fully. I stayed in bed and was in and out of sleep until 1 or 2pm. Headache and bodyaches stayed with me throughout the day and fever stayed at or above 101. Around 3 o?clock I took pain medication and was able to go about my day almost as normal but with fatigue.

Around 6:30 that evening I got very dizzy and shaky and needed to sit down. The next day I was very tired, had a headache, very foggy minded, an upset stomach, and the injection site hurt bad. I slept a lot that day. On the 1st of March I am feeling tired and have an even worse headache and have had an upset stomach and am tired.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

I was unable to work, unable to function at home, unable to take care of my kids and myself. All I could do was lay in bed and feel like I was on my deathbed. I had COVID, this was worse than COVID. Started 3/3 around lunch and ended 3/4. I noticed that my arm has a huge red hot swollen hard swollen knot in it and it is itchy. 3/5 my arm is still itchy, swollen, hot and red.

                                                Patient received a COVID vaccination for her second dose on 3/3/21 at 1538.  She had informed the staff of the clinic that she did have a local reaction following her first dose (9days later) that she saw her PCP for. This was just treated with Zyrtec and no further intervention.  At 25 minutes following her second dose PA noticed that the patient appeared flushed.  He checked with the patient and she said she was ok.  A few minutes later noticed the patient was even more flushed.  At that time went and evaluated the patient - her BP was elevated 150/94 HR of 112 ad Pulse ox of 96%.  The patient reported feeling different than how she felt after her previous injection.  Clinic team offered for patient to be transferred to ER for further evaluation if she would like which the patient accepted.  She was transferred to ER via wheelchair in less than 5 minutes in stable condition with mild nausea.  She was cared for in ER by Dr.  Patient reported feeling tired and &#39;heavy&#39; in the ER.  Dr evaluation found a generally healthy patient with a non-toxic appearance  Lungs were clear and no obvious signs of swelling or other signs of an immediate allergic reaction.  Patient was given oral diphenhydramine and observed until she felt comfortable going home.  Discharged from ER at 1733

                                                Mar 5-2:30pm: arm began to feel sore. Mar6-12:00am  I can barely lift my left arm above chest level. The soreness has traveled from the injection site down to my wrist and fingers. The injection site is slightly pink, not really noticeable, and warm to the touch. I start to feel a little nauseous and also starting to get body aches and chills. From 12:00am-4:00am i constantly wake up because of arm soreness and body aches. At 4:00am, I woke up  to use the restroom and realized even the bottom of my feet hurt with every step I took. Took my temperature and it was at 101.5.  I went back to bed and fell asleep even though I kept waking. At 7:00am, the migraine started. I was trying to avoid taking meds just to be able to get a clear picture of how my body responds to the vaccine, But by 9:30am (22hrs post vaccine) I ended up taking Tylenol for severe migraine. It feels like someone is stabbing my temples with a very sharp object. Turning or even slightly moving my head strengthens the migraine. My arm is still so sore that I can barely move it!  Tylenol brings temperature down to 100.7°. 10:30am I began with extreme fatigue. By 12:30pm I went back to bed because I couldn?t stand my body aches and migraine. I slept until 4:00pm woke up feeling a little better. Migraine was still there but not as bad. At 8:00pm I began to feel pressure on my chest. That pressure slowly turned into pain. By 9:20pm I was in excruciating pain, I was in tears and I literally thought I was going to die. It hurt to breath. I checked into the ER by 9:30pm the pain was sharp and it would come, last a few minutes, then slowly ease off a bit. On a scale of 1-10 if was definitely a TEN!!!! The ER said it wasn?t cardiac so they sent me home. The DR did say that the chest pain could have possibly been caused by the vaccine, as many have seen different symptoms and everyone has reacted differently. I was home by 1:15am. The pains continued until 3:00am. By 8:30am on Sunday Mar 7, the only thing I was suffering from was soreness in the arm and my chest was sore from the pain. The pain in my chest was a 1 or 2 compared to the 10 that it was when I went to the ER, And that pain/discomfort has lingered all day.  I?m currently 22weeks 4days pregnant with a boy and expected to deliver July 7th. I?ve been pregnant 19 times have 4 living children and suffered 14miscarriages.

She looked at her arm and noticed below the injection site was a reddened area approx 2.5 inches long by 2.0 inches wide.  The &#34;bee sting sensation&#34; has gone away shortly after noticing the reddened are and now is just tender to the touch.  Encouraged patient to put Ice on the reddened area and or Tylenol or Ibuprofen if needed for pain or swelling. Patient will report back to me tomorrow.  The health department will monitor this situation over the next couple of days. Encouraged patient to follow up with her primary care physician for worsening symptoms.

                                                6 days after vaccination, I started to feel ill. Throat slightly scratching, almost like I was getting a cold. Then it went away. 7 days after vaccination, same thing, started to feel a little ill. Developed an itch at injection site. Nothing could be visually seen at the injection site. Within a few hours, half dollar sized round res spot appeared, with knot under it. Warm to the touch. Felt like a sunburn, with a knot under it. Day 8 after vaccination, woke up with double the size of circle at injection site. By end of day, pounding headache on left side, felt nauseous and unwell. Injection site itchy, warm to touch and began to grow in size. Went to urgent care. Once there, injection site was about the size of a baseball. Dr stated it was a reaction and prescribed an antibiotic and oral steroids. He noted how hard the knot was and was worried about cellulitis and infection. He told me to report this delayed reaction and advised me to not get a second dose. Since being there, about an hour ago, I feel worse. Ears are ringing loudly, increased headache, and almost a wet feeling at swollen injection site.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 EUA Received shot at hospital at 2:30 pm on Jan. 5th.  Had a mildly sore arm that evening and next day at work.  I did notice I had a hard, reddened welt area around injection site, about an inch and half in diameter.  At 8:15 pm on Jan. 6th, I became increasingly achy, and by 9 pm, I could barely stand without my entire body aching.  I took 600 mg of Ibuprofen along with my usual nightly meds of Ambien, Trazodone, and 50 mg benadryl.  It was very hard to sleep that night, as no position was comfortable, and even the weight of the blanket hurt my skin all throughout my body.  I called in sick to work Jan 7th.  I continued to take Ibuprofen and benadryl as directed on the label throughout the day.  Around 4 pm on the 7th, I finally started to feel some relief from the body aches.  My upper left arm remains slightly itchy and has an even larger reddened area now, that measures 3 inches as of today, Jan. 16th.  It remains warm to the touch, and slightly hardened under the skin.  I do have pictures of my arm from January 6th, the day after receiving the injection, but prior to becoming achy, and from today, January 16th, that I would be willing to share.

                                                Got my 1st covid vaccine around 9:30 am 1-18-21. Shot was administered with no issue, waited my 15 minutes and went home. Was feeling a little tired throughout the day and around 9 pm noticed I was starting to notice some mild flu skin, body aches and headache.  Went to bed around 10 and had slight shivering but figured it was maybe just a low grade fever and covered up with another blanket.  Within 20 minutes I had full blown rigors. My husband had me take a hot shower thinking it might help but it did not. I had uncontrollable shaking for a couple hours then finally fell asleep (I did wake myself up once from shaking). I woke up at 4 am no longer shaking but I had a terrible headache,  my whole body ached and I was wet with sweat. My muscles and joints were so sore I barely was able to walk to the bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up around 6 (had to get kids up for achool) but I couldn&#39;t so had my husband get them ready. He brought me some acetaminophen and I slept until 11am. Got up and still had body aches and headache but not as bad as in the night. Slept on and off all through the day 1-19-21 taking acetaminophen 2 more times for headache and sore body. Went to bed around 10 pm and woke up back to normal 1-20-21

                                                I received the Moderna vaccination around 10:00am. It was confirmed that it was okay to get the vaccine being that I tested positive for Covid on 12/23/20. Around 19:00 I started to get cold and by midnight I was shivering uncontrollably, I had a fever and had a massive headache. I alternated ibuprofren and Tylenol which did not work. I was only able to sleep from midnight to about 3:00am. The entire day I was shivering with a massive headache. It hurt so bad that I wanted to cry but it hurt worse when I did cry. My highest fever was 101 degrees. My fever broke around 19:00 on 01/05/2021 but the massive headache and body aches lasted the entire week. I felt like I was &#34;hit by a bus&#34; and my entire top part of my arm was in pain . I was seen by a doctor  at HS on Thursday the 7th to have my medical condition documented. My arm felt better by then. She had me take off the rest of the week and to return to work on the 11th. I finally started to feel somewhat better by the 9th

                                                I had burning at the injection site immediately after receiving the vaccine. As I was leaving after 15 minutes I mentioned it to the person checking me out. At this time we noticed redness and hives starting at the injection site. I was told to sit for another 15 minutes but as soon as I sat down again the hives spread rapidly and I began to have dizziness and confusion. At this point I was taken to the ER and on the way I started having nausea and my throat started burning and felt tight. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and solumedrol and IM epinephrine. Since discharge I had one instance of hive and facial swelling and continued to take Benadryl for two days. I am now having episodes of shortness of breath and tachycardia.

                                                Legs extremely weak and felt like muscles were not functioning well. Knees were buckling while standing. Started about 4 hours after vaccination. Resolved by morning but fatigue continued. It was the exact same sensation felt last March and led to me not being able to get off couch for three weeks. Couldn&#39;t get covid testing until weeks after symptoms started and tested negative in March.   Numbness in lips. Lower lip&gt;upper. Started 2 days later. Resolved after gradually improving after 10 days. Fyi had lip injection/filler within the last 2 years. Moderate burning in Rt leg that started the Friday after the vaccine. No redness or edema. Resolved after 10 days.   Severe brain fog and fatigue and buzzing sensation in head. Much worse than baseline. Buzzing sensation was new. Slept all weekend. Improved to baseline after 14 or so days. Had sharp stabbing pains in the back of my head 7 days after the vaccine. Resolved after 3 to 5 days. Never had these sensations before. No history of headaches.  Went to PCP regarding leg pain, worsening brain fog and fatigue from baseline and unequal pupils that had previously resolved about 2 years prior. Pupils were unequal sizes when I woke up on 1/2.  Pupils now back to frequently being different sizes. No diagnosis made with previous episodes that had resolved. Maybe it was reactivated?  Also had visual distortions in left eye that were new on 1/3 that lasted two minutes. No pain associated with this.  Resolved.   Feel close to baseline now but hesitant to get second dose for these reasons.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

In the next 6 hours, I threw up 2-3 more times, the headache also became worse (7 on a 0-10 scale), I got chills and was sweating, and could not get out of bed. My arm was sore, but the other sx were so bad, I did not notice. By midnight I was a little better. I slept on and off for 18 hours, then by 2pm, I was good enough to get out of bed and take a shower. I slowly became better and better and today (Monday - 3 days later), I am fine and was able to run a few miles.

The following morning I began experiencing moderate aches and pains, generalized malaise which resolved quickly with Tylenol.  As the progressed, the achiness and increased and did not resolve quickly with Tylenol.  By 2:30 pm that day, I experienced chills that did not stop, and pain in the bones of my legs that felt like flashes of extreme heat, especially on the femur.  I began experiencing nausea. That night I was unable to sleep more than 3 hours.  Around 1 am of January 27th I began feeling chills, and pain once again.  I took Tylenol, and after a short while I began sweating.  Generally, the pain, chills, and burning sensation stopped that morning, however the nausea continued through the day, especially after trying to eat.

I woke up with my left pointer finger and thumb side of my hand starting to swell.  Pain at the injection site (slight) when my arm is not in motion and when my arm is in motion. 9:45 am the swelling was continuing and I felt strange all over, head felt cloudy, so I took Benadryl. 10:27 am hand swelling is reduced, but head and body still feel strange. Some acid-reflux type feeling happening Generally feeling off today.

                                                around 3 in the morning  I was awakened by the pain and discomfort  I was feeling throughout my whole body. I couldn&#39;t even turn over due to the pain I was feeling. I felt like my body had been hit by a truck, it brought me to tears several times. It continued for about 13 hours and then it was gone, just like that. I took 400mg ibuprofen and benadryl every 4 hours from 6am - 4pm that day and by 5pm I felt no more medication was needed and just like that it was over.

                                                The next two days I had a sore arm. But a week later, the following Monday and Tuesday, I had fatigue and headaches. I put the date as Wednesday because that is when the concerning possible reactions began. I woke with clogged ears feeling very sick. I took Advil Cold and Sinus and arranged to miss work. It felt like a possible ear infection in my left ear. Also my forearms were painfully sore. I had lifted a heavy box up the stairs the afternoon before but the pain in my arms was immeasurably more than ever expected. My ankles were also very tender as I had done a little jogging the day before and I normally walk. As the day progressed I was barely able to get out of bed. Sleeping and just laying there. My highest temperature was 101.25 at 2:45 pm. I had severe chills on and off. I reported these afflictions and was mailed a covid test by Thursday. The test came back negative by Friday evening. Wednesday night my whole body was tender and I had no appetite. I took tons of vitamins and drank tonic tea and took advil and nasal allergy medication. I am still using all of those. Thursday I woke drenched in sweat. My head was mostly cleared just a wet ear and I had a low grade fever on and off through the day. Just touching my body against a surface was painful. Or putting my hand on my hip. My forearms and ankles were no longer worse than the rest. I received my covid kit and taking it to be mailed was the only time I left my house. I was surprised to find extreme difficulty walking down the stairs with muscle strain and pain in my joints. I was not nauseous but had no appetite. Friday I woke up hungry and felt better. No fever. Fatigue and body tenderness but it was better. Saturday my body is only sore on my glands and jaw and back of head. And my muscle is sore in my left arm. The oddness of that being where my shot was given is what makes me wonder if it was an extreme reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it is a flu. I have never had the body pains I try to describe before.

                                                In the evening of receiving the vaccine, I started to feel brief sharp pains in my chest/ back.  Overnight, I was awoken by continued shooting  pains all over my body, and also fine shaking.  Around 2AM a headache started and progressed to be the worst headache of my life.  It was received in the morning by tylenol.  In the morning, I experienced extreme exhaustion and dizziness after climbing stairs I almost passed out, had to rest on the floor.  Later in the day I experienced hours of chills, a temp to 103, which came down with tylenol. By the evening I was feeling well but tired.  Today, 2 days after vaccination, I have neck soreness and am a little tired but well.

                                                Day 1: 7 hours after the vaccine shot, I experienced mild fatigue and chills. Overnight, I had night sweats and insomnia. (Night sweats are a symptom that started after the first vaccine shot, and had dwindled until the second brought them up again).   Day 2: The next morning, I experienced intense fatigue, dizziness, chills, fever, headache with light and sound sensitivity, nausea, and intense fatigue. I was unable to get out of bed most of the day. I could not sit up without intense effort to even drink water. At approximately 11am, I took 600mg Tylenol, then was able to sleep for 3 hours. When I woke up my symptoms were much better, though I still had mild fatigue and achiness.   Day 3:  I was mildly fatigued but otherwise felt good.   Day 4: I awoke with a series of small rashes on my torso (front, back, and sides), as well as my inner arm. They were red, flat, not raised, and mildly itchy, One was around my umbilicus, a few under my breasts, and other splotched in random other places on my torso. My inner ears were also mildly itchy. I put generic rash cream on the rashes on my torso and arms, and the itchiness subsided. The redness decreased throughout the day, though they were all still visible by evening.    Day 5: I awoke and my entire torso was bright red *except* the places where the rashes had been the day before, which were normal skin color. Ears are itchy again, and skin is very mildly itchy. Other than that, no other symptoms. No trouble breathing, good energy.   I have never had rashes or an allergic reaction like this before. I assume it&#39;s an allergic reaction, due to the itchy inner ears and skin.

I was in the middle of treating a PT. Scratchy throat; mild cough; persistent moderate headache; runny nose; diarrhea; very pale. Never had a fever. I had weird neurological side affects (didn&#39;t lose taste or smell  ) issues with facial recognition - didn&#39;t recognize my own face and finding words for every day objects and making sentences was difficult . I was easily winded and had tightness in my lungs. I called Public Health office - and asked them what to do. She told me to go home. Dr  (telehealth visit) told me to take a test in the parking lot that day for COVID January 6. Treatment  - none. All o f my symptoms lasted until Friday January 8 except being winded and fatigued. Those last two symptoms lasted until January 19.  Verbal issues also lasted until the 19th of January. Facial recognition came back around January 12.  On January 27 I had second dose.
