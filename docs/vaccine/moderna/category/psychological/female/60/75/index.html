When I woke up a few hours later, I noticed that I had a very bad headache and all-over body aches, and I felt like I had the flu.  Weak, nauseous and extremely tired.  I went to bed and slept through the night, when my alarm woke me at 7:00 am on Tuesday, January 5, I got up to use the bathroom and felt all the same symptoms from the night before, only worse.  I noticed that I had a rash on my left arm below the injection site.  I called in sick and went back to bed.  I slept from approximately 7:30 to 2:00 pm on January 5.  I felt a little better upon awakening, but had a very bad headache and no appetite.  The other body aches seemed better.

Very tender.  Also, edema starting in my right axilla extending down my lateral chest about 7&#34;.  Day 3 to 7:  Achiness is gone.  Edema and swelling continue.  Eventually the red swollen area became itchy.  The edema under my arm (not a lymph node) was tender when my arm was close to my body.  Woke me up during the night frequently.   Very hard to sleep.

Around 1115 she was still dizzy, stated she didn?t have much to drink or eat, so we brought her water and a snack.  No hx of diabetes. 1120 she looked flushed, and now had tingling in her left arm.  Took her BP 140/70, HR 70,  temp on her forehead 97.1.   1130 she continued to have a strange feeling in her arm from her shot site to her left hand, and up her neck.  Vaccinator counseled her to take an antihistamine once she gets home. Patient called her husband and her son who would take 40 minutes to come get her. She began to exercise her left arm, and began to feel better. She left with her family at approximately 1:00, still a little dizzy, no longer flushed with less discomfort.  We called her at 7;15 pm and she reported that symptoms had resolved.  Took Zyrtec. Extended observation and sent home.

I have had steroid injections in other shoulder and this is the sensation I felt during injection. The rn also told me &#34; You have tough skin&#34; after the intense pressure started. I worked the night before injection. I went home to sleep. woke around 2pm with intense pain in my left arm, I could not shift position or move my arm. with out excruciating pain. I used heat, aleve,  tylenol &amp; biofreeze. By saturday,  i could easily move left arm from elbow down, but extremely limited from shoulder. today i have most of my range of motion, but still have dull ache and pain restrictions. This pain is in my shoulder, not my arm or deltoid. . On thursday, pain was constant, roaring throb 7/10  shoulder to shoulder blade, almost to spine in back and down to elbow , then 9/10 with any movement.   Today is ache 2/10 just in my shoulder, with 5/10 with some movement. I had to call into work 1/7. I am scheduled tonight. I am an ICU RN.

Once I did get up I noted a severe red rash covering chest and extending up anterior neck (looked like a radiation burn). Symptoms lasted all day and made work or ADLs impossible. Felt about 75% better next day then symptoms returned the following day. Rash began peeling and appeared to look like a 2nd degree burn. Symptoms resolved by Day 4.

I felt dizzy and out of it. This lasted for 2-3 hours. The next day it was much better but I still feel that problem a little bit. Secondly, I felt tingling in my head, arms and legs since then, slowly waning.

                                                About 3 PM she received her second vaccination for Covid.  She states that she has a history of adverse reactions to flu vaccines that are anaphylactic like in the past.  She usually premedicates with Benadryl and steroids.  Today she did take 100 mg of Benadryl prior to her vaccination.  Shortly after receiving the vaccine, she did feel like her throat was getting a little bit tight but she did not feel like it was true anaphylaxis.  However she then felt very off.  After this vaccine her throat started to feel tight, and she stated she did not feel well overall.  She did have some tunnel vision and was shaky. At about 1730 her heart rate drops to the 30s, she started feeling itchy, and then she went into a coughing fit and started to feel her throat close. She received 0.3 mg IM epinephrine, 20 mg IV famotidine, 125 mg IV methylprednisone, 0.5 mL of nebulized racepinephrine, and 500 mL NS bolus. She has since recovered and is stable on room air.

                                                I became dehydrate and confused. This was noticeable in the hours leaving for the hospital at about 8:00 p.m. Once at the hospital, I was combatant and didn&#39;t recognize family. I continued in this state while the Dr&#39;s at the hospital ran tests.  Around the 16th and/or 17th, after 2-3 days of steroids, I could answer Dr&#39;s questions and recognized family.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

HAD A VERY MINOR HEADACHE THE TWO DAYS FOLLOWING THE VACCINE, JUST MILD DISCOMFORT.  FULLY RESOLVED ON ITS OWN AFTER TWO DAYS.  2.  MONDAY, JANUARY 4 WHEN I WOKE UP I FELT &#34;PUFFY&#34; - FEET AND HANDS WERE MILDLY SWOLLEN.  NOTICED MY SHOES FELT TIGHTER THAN USUAL AND HANDS FELT A BIT DIFFICULT TO FULLY CLOSE.  THIS IS FLUID RETENTION, AS IF YOU HAD TOO MUCH SALTY FOOD THE DAY BEFORE, AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS I HAD INGESTED MORE SALT THAN I REALIZED ON SUNDAY.  BUT IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE THAT OCCURRED FOR ME AND MY DIET DOES NOT INCLUDE MUCH SALT OR PROCESSED FOODS.  THEN TODAY MY FEET AND HANDS STILL FEEL PUFFY, SHOES STILL A BIT TIGHT AND HANDS A BIT HARD TO CLOSE SO THERE IS STILL SOME FLUID RETENTION GOING ON.  THIS IS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR ME, I AM QUITE HEALTHY AND HAVE A GOOD DIET AND DON&#39;T RECALL THIS HAPPENING BEFORE.    AGAIN, NOT AT ALL SURE THIS IS RELATED TO THE VACCINE, IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HEAD COLD, BUT AS I AM NOT SURE AND THIS IS UNUSUAL AND HAS OCCURRED AFTER RECEIVING THE VACCINE, I FELT I SHOULD REPORT IT.  THIS EFFECT IS VERY MILD AND I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND IT.

They gave me water and crackers and said try to eat something for second shot. After 30 mins I felt OK to leave. During the rest of the day I had a headache which worsen and next day (1/6/) the same and had that weird out of body sensation off and on. I also had mild achy feeling, fatigue and both hips and shoulders mild pain. I did take this day off from work. These symptoms resolved towards the end of that night. Doing much better today (1/8/21). I aslo had mild swelling and sore at the injection site which I expected like a flu shot. I have not had any reaction to any vaccination prior years.

Husband came in and grabbed her, to get her back into bed. she could not stand. Went to ER at  Hospital. Had CT scan, blood work , EKG, chest xray. Was still kind of out of it but was able to communicate with nurses. Face is still black and blue. Last night got up at 4:00 a.m. something was wrong with her throat. Felt like a walnut was in her throat. Went to doctor this morning. They said it was a reaction from the shot. Got an EpiPen, prednisone. Call them in 2 days to let them know how she&#39;s doing and also wear a heart monitor because they do not know how to take care of her, Has had vision blurriness in both eyes. Has not felt well at all.

Took off work.  Fever spiked at about noon the day following the vaccine to 100.1  Tylenol then Ibuprofen was taken. By 6:30 am the next morning (today )all symptoms seem to be gone.  I think it may be important to know that I was sick with covid 19 in April/May of 2020 for almost 3 weeks

Due to this we observed her for 30 minutes following administration of vaccine.  About 25 minutes into her observation period she began developing hives on her forearms and wasn&#39;t feeling her normal self.  She denied any respiratory symptoms but was continuously clearing her throat and when asked if she normally did that, she stated that she did not.  Decision was made to take vital signs and administer 50mg of IM Diphenhydramine.  She was agreeable to this plan .  After administering Diphenhydramine, we continued to monitor her vitals and had her stay another 45 minutes for observation.  Hives resolved and vital signs remained within normal limits.  Patient was education on allergic  reactions and she to seek medical care.  Patient verbalized understanding and felt  back to her normal self.

Although muscle aches and joint pain slowly decreased over time, the vertigo has persisted and at times is accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

Saw Dr and he said this is typical of the aging process.  Dont know if it was related just weird it happened now. Arm was sore for 2 Days but nothing major. Other than that i felt fine.

Very tired and did not feel well.  Low grade fever was sporadic.   Could not go to work. Called Dr. about symptoms and prescribe antiobiotic of Ceftin for the sore throat..  Sore throat went away after 24 to 48 hours of being on medicine. By day 10 all the skin reactions had calmed down and by day 12 was feeling good.  Dr. wanted me to report to you guys.  He was unsure if I should take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  He seemed confident throughout that this was an immune response to the vaccine.

                                                I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my PMD office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 13 Jan 2021, the patient received their first two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021, the patient experienced terrible chills, shaking for 8 days, shivers and cold all the time, cannot sleep and whole-body hurts. On 28 Jan 2021, the patient experienced facial paralysis which was getting worse more on right side then moved to the middle of her face. The patient was given steroids.  Treatment for the events included steroids.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, facial paralysis, terrible chills, shaking for 8 days (tremors), shivers, cannot sleep (insomnia) and whole-body hurts(pain), were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 61-year-old female who experienced a serious unexpected event of facial paralysis, the non-serious unexpected events of tremors, insomnia and pain, and a non-serious expected event of chills. Events began on 21-Jan-21 after the first dose of mRNA-1273 on 13-Jan-21. Treatment with steroids. Outcomes unknown. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On Jan. 25:  Went to bathroom around 3:15 p.m. with diarrhea and became woozy so decided to get off of the toilet and sit down on the floor.  Husband found me semi conscious on the floor with drool at about 4:10 p.m.  He tried to awaken me and found me not lucid, speech was garbled, fragmented responsiveness and could not keep upright position, could not give details to the situation.  Husband called 911.  Ambulance transported to hospital ER   during hospital exams and tests patient was not lucid and this continued for the next 32  hours.  EKG, EEG, CT scan, MRI, Blood/Lab work;  all tests were negative indicating no seizure , healthy heart, clear brain scan, no stroke, white blood count normal, dehydrated. All tests negative with all doctors unable to find a reason for this situation other than the Moderna vaccine considered highly for the situation.  Advised patient not to take the second dose of Moderna.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

                                                Approximately 4-5 min after leaving the facility in my car after my 15 minute check, I began to feel throat tightness -upper pharynx/larynx region - like something was stuck or like I swallowed something - no difficulty breathing, just constant throat clearing like something was stuck on both sides of my upper pharynx/larynx region.  I was monitored by EMS and given 50 mg IM Benadryl. After 30 - 40 min. symptoms cleared.

I went to bed but awoke hot, then alternated with cold frequently. I began having twitching in my hands which kept me awake.  These symptoms continued until morning. Toward the AM, about 0500, I had fluttering sensations in my body.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen all night and all day and could not get relief.  I missed a day of work because of this. I am still with fever as of 5:55 pm and the body aches and migraine. This was not explained to me. I feel like I did when I had Corona on the worst days. I am really praying that this ends so that I can go back to work tomorrow.   I thought that someone was supposed to call and check on us each day....

I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

Then progressed to whole body itching. Unable to sleep for two nights. Went to urgent care next morning. Was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg. Itching went away that night and was able to sleep. Next day bilateral hands had numbness and tingling and general dizziness so stopped taking hydroxyzine. Went to family practitioner and was prescribed methylprednisolone dose pack. After starting steroids, by 2nd day (today - 1-21-21), hands continued n/t. Bilateral feet developed n/t. Dizziness continues when standing but goes away when sitting. Balance and gait are unsteady. Difficulty walking from weakness, balance issues, and dizziness.

On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right. I still feel fatigued and I have a full feeling around the area of my right upper abdomen ( liver), I dont have a gallbladder. Otherwise, I am OK. Just wondering about the 2nd dose. Lymph node still slightly swollen above clavicle.

I went to work and let my supervisor know that my arm was really sore. I went out to do my patrol and noticed a headache. I thought I needed to eat some I tried to eat some cereal. I became nauseous. I went back to the office to do some paperwork and when I tried to walk it was painful I told my coworker who suggested I need something warm on my stomach. I tired that but was to nauseous. I ended up leaving work and coming home and laid. I have cannot lay flat as it is uncomfortable and have myself propped up in bed. I have been unable to sleep since then. I previously had COVID in November 2020

                                                The following morning after receiving the vaccine you work around 6AM my arm was really sore and my husband had to help me get dressed for work. I went to work and let my supervisor know my arm really sore. I left the office to go do my regular patrolling and started noticing that I had a really bad headache,  and I went and got something to eat. I ate some cereal and I got nauseated and I kept getting some chills. I went back to the office to do some paperwork and when I tried to walk it hurt. I told my coworker told me to get get something warm on my stomach, I tried to it but it made it nauseated. I ended up leaving work early and going home laid down  and have felt bad since. I can&#39;t not laid flat down as it uncomfortable, I propped myself up the bed. I have been up since 4am and have not been able to sleep since. I called the place where I received the vaccine at and they referred me to file a VAERS report. Had COVID in November 2020.

                                                hi, I had tingling a few hours after receiving the first does of the modern vaccine, mostly in my chin, tongue and lips. I have since then had on and off nueropothy, from severe numbness and tingling throughout my entire body and head, to mild tingling, some of it being so severe, that I could not sleep. My general practioner has advised that I do not get the booster.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

                                                A 63-year-old female with a medical history of Hashimoto?s Disease, on Levothyroxine 88 micrograms (4 days per week) and 100 micrograms (3 days per week), presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of acute onset of severe, debilitating, fatigue, weakness, anorexia and malaise. She had no clear precipitating events, stated that she was in her usual states of health, active, working as an optometrist at a University hospital. Stated that 1 week before symptom oncer she had her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Stated that 24hrs later her symptoms started associated with low grade subjective fever, however her fever disappeared, and she persisted with severe fatigue. She was unable to do her regular activities of daily living and was hoping her symptoms would resolve but upon persistence and given the severity of her complains she presented to evaluation. She denied recently starting any new medications/supplements, or recent change in her levothyroxine dose. There were no headaches, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, recent infectious illness or sick contacts. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s Disease over 10 years prior and had been on the same dose for more than 2 years.   VS were stable and within normal limits, physical exam was only remarkable for weakness on 4 extremities 4/5, lethargy, bradylalia, bilateral ptosis, no focal neurologic deficits, sensation intact. Laboratory workup revealed normal Hb 14.8, normal renal and kidney function, normal cortisol level, TSH normal 3.7, normal FT4: 1.2, normal CPK, negative tox screen. ESR and CRP were performed, and both were found to be elevated ESR 74, CRP 28, at that moment we decided to do immunologic workup showing high titers of ANA &gt;1:320 with a nuclear speckled pattern, and a positive rheumatoid factor 60. At this point a full rheumatologic panel was performed which was negative for anti-Ach receptor Abs, negative anti-CCP, anti- dsDNA, anti-smith, negative anti-Jo1, anti-RNP, negative anti-TPO, negative anti-SCL70, normal C4 and C3 however elevated total CH50 &gt; 60, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Her symptoms of severe fatigue persisted throughout her admission and it was decided to give her a course of prednisone 40mg for 5 days and follow up as outpatient with a Rheumatologist. Repeat workup 2 weeks after discharge showed still elevated ESR at 72, high CRP 17, rheum factor elevated again at 67.  At this point no clear cause was identified as she did not have any symptoms of Sjogren or anything else other than severe persisting fatigue.  Another course of steroids was given and 1 month later she stated that she was much improved and was able to go back to work. Stated that she would not take her second covid MODERNA vaccine dose due to fear of recurrence of symptoms. It appeared that this vaccine triggered a severe inflammatory and autoimmune reaction in this patient with history of Hashimoto?s disease. The association between MODERNA vaccine and development of autoimmunity and inflammatory reaction needs to be assessed.

                                                Tested positive for COVID 19; Hallucinating; Body aches; Fever; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 62 year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed body aches (myalgia), fever (pyrexia), hallucinating (hallucination) and tested positive for covid 19 (SARS-CoV-2 test positive).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 04 Mar 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Mar 2021, approximately 2 days after receiving vaccine, the patient developed body aches, fever and hallucinating. On 07 Mar 2021, the patient tested positive for covid 19.  Treatment information was not reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, the mRNA-1723 does not contain virus capable of causing infection and with the occurrence of SAR-COV-2 test positive after vaccination, is unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

Still felt odd.  Dizzy. Had to think before I did anything. I stood up from the bed and sat back down again as if I was dizzy and confused.  Drove myself home from work, fed the cats and went right to bed.  I felt very fatigued, had developed a monster headache.  Was dizzy, had chills, body aches, nausea.  I brought  water bottle over to the bed with me but after laying down just could not get myself up to get a drink.  Felt very fatigued.   Slept until 2 pm.  Took my temperature.  It was 101.5.  Had no energy, ate no food, took no meds, just went back to sleep.  Still nauseous, had headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Woke up at 5:00 pm to feed cats.  That?s all I did, and go to the bathroom.  Took my temperature again.  It was 100.9.  Still felt awful:  nauseous, headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Seemed like I could  not get warm.  Stayed in bed and slept.  Saturday, Jan.  9, 2021 I woke up around 7:30 to go to the bathroom.  I fed the cats also.  Still dizzy, moving slow.  My headache was gone, but still felt unsteady.  After feeding the cats,  I went back to bed.  Slept until 12:30 that afternoon.

Within 2 hours, I could not continue to work and went home. Took motrin at home and rested.  The following morning  the headache was mild but the injection site was very painful. No reddness or swelling, not firm but extremely tender to touch. Pain at injection site was present for 2 days then resolved slowly..

Felt swollen, but dont think it was, burning sensation on lateral borders and tip of tongue,extremely dry mouth.  Felt as though it had also been burned, and had a few white spots on tip, reddened borders on lateral aspects also, very scallopededges. Note I do have a fissured tongue but this reaction was unlike any I had ever had from eating certain foods that trigger any tongue response, and had not eaten anything night before to trigger this. Lasted a few days and progressively felt normal after 3-4 days.

She stated that she was dizzy but that she does suffer from vertigo already. She said these symptoms lasted about a week. On the 1/14/21 she was tachycardic, dizzy, weak and she had a raised red rash distal to the site of injection. She went to urgent care and was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescribed an antibiotic. On 1/17/21 she went back to urgent care since the rash had migrated and appeared patchier than cellulitis. Her doctor said that he did not believe it to be cellulitis at this time and prescribed her a steroid cream.

                                                About 14 hours after vaccination, I had a (really bad) pulsating headache in a band around my head, body aches (hip flexors, shoulders, back, neck), chills, fever/sweats, and nausea/vomiting (threw up twice, total, about an hour or two apart after not eating for 10 hours - small amount of liquid came up). The nausea/vomiting went away about 4 hours after onset while the other symptoms remained for an additional 42 hours. I also had sinus/eye pressure that began about 22 hours after vaccination and ended with the other symptoms. Could not sleep for the duration because of headache. Very tired/sleepy about 62 hours after injection and was able to nap since headache went away. I still have soreness at injection site about 72 hours after injection.  I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn&#39;t want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days. The next worst was the nausea/vomiting, because, well, nausea/vomiting, and especially because there was nothing to bring up. And, unlike vomiting from bad food or something, you don&#39;t really feel better afterward, just still nauseated. The other symptoms were more bearable. Did not call or see doctor because I had read about these possible side effects and didn&#39;t think there was anything the doctor could do to alleviate them.

I sat down to tie my shoe and noted Pitting &#43; 3 or 4 edema to BIL Calves.  Redness , warmth in a few areas.  R leg 1&#34; larger than L.  Then  I mentioned it to another nurse and  she said it could be side affect of Norvasc.  I spoke with my PA about it on 2/12 she D&#39;C&#39;d Norvasc and perscribed  Nefidepine 30 mg ER. I have not taken it yet I am monitoring my BP and it is WNL.   The edema less in calves however continues in ankles.  I have gotten MULTIPLE broken capillaries all over my legs.          Long short it has to be a reaction to vaccine.  And it continues almost 2 months after injection.   I can&#39;t wear most of my socks.  It is BAD.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna vaccine at nine o&#39;clock Thursday morning, felt fine until 2pm. She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

                                                The person who gave me the shot placed the injection too low on my arm. It should have been up near the shoulder, but instead the person gave it to me down toward the middle of my arm. I knew something was wrong immediately because it felt so warm and disruptive. The doctor on the scene said it was nothing. Nine days later I went to Urgent Care with swelling, hot-to-the-touch, itchy and a huge knot. The Urgent Care Dr. gave me a five-day prescription for Prednisone and also gave me a prescription for hydroXYzine pamoate, which is an antihistimine.

Light adverse side effects right after the vaccine was administered. Remained under supervision for 45 minutes longer instead of 15 min. Within 5 mins, heat rose up to my head causing dizziness &amp; head spin. Then loss of smell lasting for 10 min or a bit longer, then tongue tied hard / swollen for 3 hrs and lasting mildly 1 day after. Severe dehydration. Did not monitor heart beat due to severe fatigue. Took blood pressure rising and falling like roller coaster 2x. I stop and learned to relax and sleep throughout the day to calm the nervous system and the slight fever. Other normal aching pains as pre-described side effects. No nausea, vomiting, no rash as of 1 day after and no difficult breathing. Occasional and short loss of smell carried after 1st day.

                                                On Saturday on the 16th I started itching all over my body and my head, dry mouth and my ears were itching as well. On Sunday I noticed the itching  increased after taking my  levothyroxine. The 18th I noticed the same pattern of itching increasing after taking the levothyroxine the dry mouth as continued. Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

Approximately 12:30-1:00 AM on 01/09/2021 woke up, turned my head and experienced room spinning dizziness for about 2 minutes. Had to remain completely still to stop the room spinning.  For the next 2 days (until the morning of Monday 01/11/2021)  I experienced on and off room spinning dizziness at unpredictable intervals.  Usually didn&#39;t last longer than 2 minutes but had to remain completely still to stop the spinning.   Starting on Monday 01/11/2021 had &#34;normal&#34; dizziness along with some flu like symptoms,  headache, tiredness,  soreness/achiness and extreme soreness and pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine shot. I stayed out of work because of the on-going dizziness. These symptoms continued until Saturday 01/16/2021.  I took an antihistamine on Saturday night and finally woke up Sunday 01/17/2021 with no dizziness.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

After about 1hr my hands, feet and nose became very cold and my temp dropped to 94 degrees.  I felt very cold.  My blood pressure was 90/30.  This never happened to me before.  It took about two hours for my temp to go back to normal and for me to feel my normal self.   I had Covid 19 in August.

                                                48 hours after the injection I began to notice a sore throat before bedtime on Dec 30, but slept well. The next morning, Dec 31, I had acute allergic symptoms that never start so suddenly.  I was having constant Post-nasal Drip, nasal congestion and beginning of cough due to PND.  That night I had a severe sore throat similar to my typical allergic pattern.  I coughed all night and awoke on the morning of Jan 1st with clear severe onset allergies and could not talk without coughing.  That persisted for 4 days, then my allergist prescribed inhaled steroids BID which reduced the nighttime cough, but I persisted with symptoms for 10 days when they slowly resolved and my sense of well-being returned.  I missed 7 days of work, which is atypical for my allergies when I catch them early.  This was an acute flare of typical allergic symptoms that seems to have been triggered by the timing of the immune change from the vaccine at day #2-3 after the vaccine #1 was given.  I  am worried about getting vaccine #2 in 2 weeks and don&#39;t want to go through another flare up of dialing allergies again.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011L20A) intramurally in the left deltoid bursa for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 02 Jan 2021, the patient reported she had been given the vaccine in the wrong location. The vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle. The patient was also experiencing loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and she also can&#39;t sleep. Treatment information was not provided. Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. The event vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle was considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events loss of range of motion, can&#39;t sleep, and pain at the injection site were considered not recovered/not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of 65 year old female patient who experienced non-serious unexpected events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle for mRNA-1273, lot #  011L20A. The patient experienced loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and can&#39;t sleep. Onset latency was not provided.  De-challenge and re-challenge are not applicable. Based on the information provided the events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle, loss of range of motion and can&#39;t sleep are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 as this is due to product administration error. The event of pain at the injection site is included in the known safety profile of the vaccine, hence a causal association cannot be excluded.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

Was 3 inches by two inches. The arm is now back to normal.  .2. Day 8.  Woke at roughly midnight with extreme heat and burning in all toes.  Quite painful.  Very unusual, as I have never experienced anything like this before.  When pain and burning became overwhelming I took Tylenol.  It helped and I was able to sleep.   The next morning the pain and burning were gone but my toes were, and continue to be quite numb, as is the area of my feet that surrounds my toes.  I can&#39;t fully feel my socks, shoes, sheets, etc.  It feel like I have cotton stuffed in my shoes.  It is hard for me to related the level of heat, burning and pain that happened.  I felt like I could melt a block of ice with my feet.  It was severe. I marked &#34;disability or permanent damage&#34; below because I don&#39;t know if the nerves in my feet will return to normal.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

This was  accompanied by a prickling sensations.  I got a sore inside my right nostril and a cold sore on right upper lip.  The mottling and vein prominence continue intermittently still.  Improving but not resolved entirely. Along with this, my eyes became intermittently  itchy as if I had an allergic irritation. This has also completely resolved.  I spoke with a relative who is a physician  and he felt that I may have had a hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis reaction.

                                                About 6 PM the day I received the vaccine, the arm started to become extremely sore. It was achy feeling and it radiated down to my wrist. This lasted until Sunday and it started to fade. Today it is just some soreness left at the injection site. I was taking OTC Acetaminophen 500MG between 100 MG for pain. It was difficult to sleep due to the pain. I was also putting cool compresses on it.  The pain worse when I was trying to clean my car and shovel the snow. However the cold compress and stretching did help with some of the pain. I also felt agitated for different periods times after vaccination, I felt like my hormones were out of whack and I wanted to &#34;bite someone&#39;s head off&#34; this lasted for about an 1 hour or so. I also had mild headaches.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

                                                I received the vaccine yesterday 1/6/21.  Today, 1/7/21, I went for my walk this morning and felt off balance/swayed to the right a bit at one point. I don&#39;t think lightheadedness precipitated this, but it unnerved me.  I steadied myself and finished the walk without a problem. I checked and surface/pavement was uneven. My temp is 97.5 and I feel fine now but am just a little nervous that is a possible reaction to the vaccine. I had a reaction to the second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine 10 yrs ago, I fainted in early morning hours after getting up to go to bathroom.  I had received the second dose at about 11:30a the day before, and developed flu like symptoms by afternoon with a fever and ended up dehydrated which I think contributed to my fainting at about 3a when I got up to void.

                                                Patient appeared nervous upon receiving vaccine. Patient reported trouble swallowing ( has a history of radiation therapy on throat). When asked if breathing was restricted, patient was able to take long breaths with minimal additional effort. Shortly after, patient appeared to be close to passing out (not completely awake and alert), eyes dilated. The pharmacist who administered the vaccine then administered one dose of the epinephrine (Epi-pen LOT:0FM353/eEXP:NOC 21) while the staff member kept the patient stable in her chair. The facility was instructed to call 911. At 11:49 AM (7 minutes later), symptoms began to improve and the patient became more alert. EMS arrived around 12:00PM to take patient to hospital--patient refused and was back walking around the facility 5 minutes later. No further issues were reported with this patient (pharmacist administering the vaccine left the facility around 1:15PM)

Started getting sick to her stomach all evening, started throwing up last night beginning at 11:00 PM, throwing up bile.  Today having fever of 101, didn&#39;t take anything for it, but down to 100 now.  Took 2 Tums and had such achy joints and sat down in a chair and could not get up from the chair.  Took some Tylenol and that helped, but freezing cold.  Didn&#39;t sleep all night.  Has not notified her doctor of the symptoms, just calling us.

                                                When my fingers touched something cold they would feel weird and lose their color. The first time (1/21) was minor (one finger) and the second time was (1/23) and all the tips of my fingers of my right hand turned colorless when I touched something cold. 1/24 my toes tingled when I walked and happens when I go for a walk. The finger symptom seems to be diminishing. I have never had either of these things happen before I had the Moderna vaccine. My doctor told me not to have the second dose which is due on 1/30/2021.

                                                I received this vaccine at a walk-in-clinic, called STAT Med.  About 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt nauseated but finally managed to sleep.  The next afternoon on February 23 I became very ill with vomiting and diarrhea all at the same time.  I nearly passed out several times.  First responders arrived and found my blood pressure to be about 70/30.  Got in ambulance and given fluids.  Arrived at hospital around 5:15 pm.  Got more fluids and numerous blood tests, none of which were very remarkable.  My WBC was 17 but nothing else was wrong.  Left hospital at 9:00.  Physician assumes Covid vaccine cause these side effects.

My arm is weak and cannot raise, lift or rotate it above the elbow.  Very difficult to maintain sleep with a throbbing arm. I have been taking Alleve and it helps but the pain is still there just milder. Muscles are not sore but something is aching deep in bone/joints. I went to the Kinesiologist who told me the rotor cuff is the issue. He did an pressure point &#34;adjustment&#34; and the pain subsided for a day or two and now I&#39;m back to being in pain during any level of movement again.  I believe that my injection was given too high in my shoulder and caused SIRVA. I even took a picture of where the injection site was given.  If needed I can provide it to you.

                                                Moderna vaccine EUA within 4 minutes i began to feel faint, heart started pounding ,immediate headache and was very shaky.  I was laid down, cold compress. It came in waves over a period of 20 minutes. I was given a few sips of water. When it did not resolve I was taken to the ER and given IV fluids.  The doctor said I had an adverse reaction to something in the vaccine. The chief of Infectious disease thought I had a vaso vagel response.  While I am nervous to get the second vaccine , I will go forward and get it..

                                                16 hours after the injection, I was awakened with needing to vomit.  I had only clear liquid which I coughed out.  I was having difficulty catching my breath and unable to burp or clear the liquid.  After three tries, I was able to clear the airway and was able to breathe well.  I also checked my blood pressure which was 163/83.  I had phlegm in my throat and could clear it with drinking water.  After approximately 40 minutes of checking and rechecking my blood pressure and drinking water, I was able to sleep until 9:00 am.  It is now 24 hours from the injection and I feel much better.

By 9:00 p.m. I was shaking from chills (despite being bundled up under a blanket), so I took my temperature -- it was 100.5 degrees orally.  My normal temperature on that thermometer is 97.6 degrees.   That night, I kept waking up every two hours or so and was very uncomfortable.  THe next day I felt very lethargic -- unable to do anything other than make myself something to eat.  I took two naps, one in the morning, and the other in the afternoon (that was about two hours).  I felt slightly better by around 8 p.m.  That night I slept somewhat better and felt myself break into a sweat during the night -- so I guess that is when the fever broke.  The next day (today) my temperature was back to normal and I feel okay.  Throughout the now three days, the arm where I got the shot was painful, but gets less so each day.

                                                In about 12 hrs I felt fevered,  then went to cold, then I started trembling.  So hard, I still felt cold, but this wasn?t shivering,  I wanted to go to get in warm water.  I was shaking so bad I couldn?t take my clothes off.   I got in with clothes on, I was getting delirious.   My whole body was contracting so hard I couldn?t sit in the tub flat, my but cheeks contracting with all muscles.   I found myself in the night with a sticking hat soaked in water to cover my face.  I could not have called for help when the muscle contractions  were going on.  That lasted I think 30-45 minutes.  I was groggy on the 20th all day but getting much better.   I was very excited for vaccine and would do it again, but wanted to report what I consider pretty rough side effect, so you could make note of it. And I still thank you for the vaccine,  but dang I truly thought I was dying.

Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).  Patient presented to outlying emergency room with flank pain &amp; transferred here with severe bilateral hydronephrosis on imaging.  Patient had severe left flank pain about 2 weeks ago. Treated with tylenol, motrin, and heat and pain eventually dissipated. Then Tuesday and Wednesday pt did a lot of yard work and lifting. Thursday patient woke up with excruciating right flank pain.  Nothing has made it better.  Patient has tried ice, heat, tramadol Tylenol, Motrin, steroids and pain persists.  Additionally patient having nausea and vomiting.  She has started to have burning with urination.  Pain is excruciating stabbing.  Radiates to the groin.  Patient has also started running fevers today.  She feels pretty miserable.   Also patient notes difficulty with her bowels since her last surgery.  Prior to surgery she took Linzess every day.  Since surgery it has been suggested she does not need this medication.  Patient does note little to no notice when her bowels decide to move.  Severe significant gas.  Other times patient feels quite constipated.   UA suggests possible infection with positive nitrites, 1&#43; leukocyte esterase and 3&#43; blood.  WBC 2.1, Cr 1.0, K 3.0 CT scan with multiple abnormalities, but most notably severe bilateral hydronephrosis without obvious obstructing lesion.  Multiple scattered nodular densities concerning for metastatic disease.    Patient transferred for higher level of care and urology consultation.

I also became exhausted.  I realized I had been tired much of the first day but once my arm became so painful, I was completely exhausted.  I felt out of sorts for about  36 hours and then began to feel normal again.  It probably took a few more days to regain my energy completely.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

                                                I received the injection around 2:30 I felt fine. It did not hurt going in. I stopped by a restaurant to get some take out and must of started feeling disorientated and completely forgot I had this folder with the VSAFE information. I started feeling chills all over my body, I kept taking my temperature it was 95.7, I started having a headache top of my head, the temporal, the back of my neck. They were all over the place. I went to bed and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It was like my brain was going crazy, it wasn&#39;t like an anxious feeling. I finally feel asleep around 4am and kept waking up remembering fragments of valid dreams. The dreams were fragment with such dread and anxiety in them.  It was like a huge wave of depression and anxiety. By about 9am I was fully awake, but my body hurt, my muscles ached I felt fatigued. The chills and headaches were through. I was still having weird racing thoughts. About 10pm it all went away and I slept fine and woke up the next morning and I was fine. My arm is still sore at the injection site but all the other symptoms went away.    Saturday morning I was talking with a friend on the phone, and she reminded me of the folder I received the folder. I completely forgot about this folder. I found this folder later that day and then I tried to access VSAFE. It made me realize how disorientated I was.

                                                The patient came into the pharmacy the morning following her vaccination 1/8/21 complaining of extreme pain on her right side near her ribs, stomach and lower back. She experienced this pain the same night of receiving her vaccine, and it disrupted her sleep. She also complained of difficulty breathing up on inhalation, saying that it hurts to inhale.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Although I had arm pain bad enough to wake me in the night 30 and 31 December, that was not surprising.  What surprised me is that the site (about 9 cm round) became very red and very itchy a full week later (01/05/2021) and is still pink and itchy now.  This is not at all serious, and Benadryl cream reduces the itching.  I am reporting it only because it is not listed as a side effect on the documentation or CDC website.

                                                I felt fine until the morning of Jan. 10 (except for very painful arm).  I was awakened early in the morning by severe vertigo (my eyes were blinking rapidly and the room was spinning violently); I was nauseous and couldn&#39;t lie down without the violent spinning re-occurring.  I was very dizzy and exhausted the whole day, unable to function.  The next day I continued to be very dizzy and off-balance, couldn&#39;t work but better than prior day.  Each day, same symptoms have continued but milder.  I called my PCP on Monday, Jan 11.  He told me it sounded like an inner ear problem, probably unrelated to the vaccine and to call him the next day and report my symptoms.  I did (Tues. Jan 12) and reported dizziness was milder but still there.  He suggested I see an ENT doctor.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up at 2:15 a.m. feeling pains in my chest middle and extending through to my upper back.  The pain encompassed the span of my upper chest and back from one arm to the other.  I experienced very rapid heartbeats that I could feel throbbing from my head to my chest.  I was hesitant to move or rise from my bed because of the pain.  At 3:40 I called 911.  They did an EKG and I was told that my heart was fine.  My blood pressure was 180/90.  I chose not to go to the hospital but to call my doctor when his office opened up at 9:00 a.m. in approximately 5 hours.  My doctor had me come into his office.  I had another EKG which was fine and he sent me to have a Cat Scan. the same day which was also fine.  My doctor spoke to me and said that he felt that this was due to side effects of the vaccine.  I doubled up on my Acid Reflux medicine, taking 80 mg daily for  four days through Monday 2/22/2021.  I could not sleep well for three days after the vaccine experiencing pain in my chest and could not breathe deeply without feeling it.  Then I steadily improved and today I can take deep breaths with little pain.  I also experienced muscle pain in my left shoulder and neck but used Mineral Ice on my neck and was relieved in one day.

I went to bed early and when I woke up I had a fever of 101.5 accompanied by chills, body aches, nausea, fatigue, brain fog, and headache.  Over the course of two days, my temperature ranged from 101.5 to 103.  After two days my fever broke during the night.   I did not want to take fever reducing medication in case it interfered with the immune response, but I did take 1 dose each of Tylenol and Motrin over the course of the 2 days.  Still felt a bit sluggish on the 3rd day and continue to have brain fog 6 days later.

I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

                                                On the first day of the injection (1/14/2021) the left arm was sore and I felt tired. Towards evening and during the night I felt cold and hot at the same time - an intense burning/freezing sensation, but no sweating. On the first day after the injection (1/15/201) the arm was still sore and I still felt tired - burning/freezing sensation had ceased. On the second day after the injection (1/16/2021) the left arm was not sore and I felt better, but at 11:00 a.m. the vein in the left temple burst and bled until about 6:00 p.m. Continuous throbbing pain across the forehead the entire day. The  middle of the forehead is covered with red dots; the area near the left eye has a number of open, bloody lesions; the area below the temple (left cheek) is black and blue. There are also two bright red spots on my left knee - but no bleeding. Nausea was slight, but present during the entire day on Saturday and Sunday. Since the hospitals have Covid 19 patients and I do not have a car, I stayed home and rested in bed.  Today on Sunday (1/17/2021) I can sit up and walk around somewhat; the throbbing pain in the head has ceased. The lesions are still vivid red , but slowly forming a crust.  Will make contact with my doctor  on Monday, when the office is open.

I have never experienced that sensation before. Every time I changed position or moved my head the swirling happened for five days. The swirling lessened daily afterwards for about 3 more days. I messaged my Dr. But didn&#39;t go to see anyone.

She no sooner said to wait 30 mins, I turned to look at clock and bam! everything hit at once.   I was told to go to ambulance on site. They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

By 10:00 AM, I had a moderate headache that lasted the rest of the day even though I did take some Ibuprofen.  5 days after, I was extremely fatigued but able to go to work and do my daily activities but went to sleep soon after dinner.  6 days after was a repeat of the extreme fatigue but I did get through my day and went to sleep early.  Day 7, I woke up feeling great and have not had any other symptoms.

Shortly after that , while driving, had nausea, &amp; muscle aches to legs &amp; arms.  Reaching family members home, could barely carry bags with each arm, due to pain in joints, and to muscles, getting worse.  Through the next 6 hrs. had moderate to severe pain to joints, &amp; muscles &amp; gradually severe fatigue. Took 1 Tylenol 650 mg for pain.   Also, checked temperature thru out this time, with only mild 99.5 temp.  Vaccine site gradually became swollen, with increased pain.  Was doing work on computer, but could not continue, so left for my home, &amp; went to bed, to sleep.  Lt.  Arm started becoming red, with severe soreness &amp; swelling by 1/28/21, 2 days after vaccine.  Vaccine was given very high on my arm, almost shoulder area.  All Symptoms continued for about 10 days, including  to vaccine arm, which continued with redness &amp; soreness for 2 weeks.   My physician was notified.   She advised NSAID before #2 dose, but I already take NSAID daily (Meloxicam), so don&#39;t think I can take another NSAID.  I have been taking Tylenol 650mg at least twice a day, for increased joint &amp; muscle pain, since vaccine.  My 2nd dose, originally scheduled for 2/23/21 has been rescheduled to 2/27/21 due to no vaccines available.

She had to miss work for two days. She reported feeling more sick from the vaccine than the COVID infection she had a few months ago.

Took 2 Tylenol (500mg).  Left arm muscle tender but no redness  at injection site.  Slept good that night.  1/15/2021 woke up itching and saw  bumpy light red rash on both upper thighs.  Applied 2% Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride which helped.  Fever and headache gone and did not return.  Body aches less each day.  1/17?2021 Body aches, arm soreness gone. Itchy rash lighter in color, but remains today as I file this. Not concerned about it. Am sure it will go away soon.

Saw my primary and she said it could be they gave it too high and irritated the shoulder joint.  She is concerned about &#34;frozen shoulder&#34;.  It wakes me in the night and no position lasts without pain after 30-45 seconds.  Take one extra strength Tylenol before bed and administer Sagely 250 mg. BD cream on upper arm and part of neck where pain exits.  Last night I drank 3 glasses of red wine so I could sleep a few hours and today I have had no pain!   little weakness and I&#39;m trying not to aggravate it, but hopefully the site pain is resolving.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

I was told by the doctor that apparently my blood pressure decreased too fast causing me to faint.

However, in the interest of completeness and for investigative purposes, I am reporting to you the event in relation to the vaccination as the patient reported to me.  She received the vaccination on 2/14/2021 and became very confused.  She had significant left arm swelling much worse than when she had her first vaccination.  Her husband brought her to the emergency room and she was eventually discharged, but she went on to develop significant hypertension and she reported that her blood pressures were normal prior to the vaccination.  She had an emergency room visit in which her systolic pressures were well above 240.  She revisited the emergency room and had elevated blood pressures of 240 and was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy and later found to have posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or PRES.  We have started the patient on medications, and started laboratory work-up for secondary hypertension and her blood pressures have improved with treatment.  We discussed the case with the neurologist, who suggested that we repeat MRI scan to make sure that her punctate lesions noted on MRI on this admission on 2/25/2021, have resolved.  It was advised that if they had not resolved that we should call neurology again.  Hypertensive encephalopathy is rare and press syndrome as a result is also rare.  It is for this reason that I am reporting this event as again, I am not trying to mislead anyone or distort information, but should this be an adverse effect of the vaccine I wanted to make sure that this was reported as the patient&#39;s history prior to the vaccination and developing this complication post vaccination are temporally related at a minimum.  The patient is a known smoker but quit on the 14th of this month.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 13 Feb 2021, the patient received the first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch# 007M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the night of 13 Feb 20212, the patient experienced arm hurt a little bit and she felt fatigued.  In the early morning of 14 Feb 2021, the patient went to the bathroom.  On her way to the bathroom,  she felt confused and had overwhelming nausea.  She lost consciousness and banged her head on the cabinet.  Within second, she regained consciousness but felt extremely weak.  She could not recall how she got back to her bed.  The patient said she was cold and clammy at that time and she never got back to sleep.  During the day on 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt a throbbing pain on the arm where she got the injection.  She was not sure whether that was due to the injection or due to her fall when she lost consciousness.  She could barely move the arm.  Then she took a nap in the afternoon and was able to recover from her lack of sleep that night.    Treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown (although her doctor advised her not to get the second dose given the reaction she had).  The outcome of the events was resolved on 15 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Additional information has been requested.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded

                                                My left arm was sore a couple of hours after the injection. It continued to get worse throughout the day. That night had a hard time sleeping as it was painful and kept waking me up. I believed it would just get better on its own. It is now 2 days after the vaccine and again another restless night of pain. It is not getting better but seems to be moving down my arm. The injection was at the top of my shoulder, it is uncomfortable about 3 inches down my arm. I broke my shoulder In April of 2019,  It feels just like that  as I try to move my arm around.

                                                Typical expected side effects but were very SEVERE and UNable to function normally- headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Dizziness, Chills, Cold Sweats, Pain and soreness especially in lower back, and throat hurt when swallow.  These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

                                                By the late afternoon/early evening  I had developed a rash that covered my body from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head.  The rash was clearly visible but not bumpy.  It was extremely itchy.   I took Benadryl and soaked in an Epsom Salt bath several times that night as I was unable to sleep due to the intense itching.  The next morning (Saturday) I called my doctor and was prescribed a steroid to combat the itching  but was told not to take it until Monday so as not to interfer with the antibodies my body was obviously producing in response to the vaccine.  I was also instructed to start taking  one Zyrtec tablet each morning and two Benadryl tablets each night.  On Monday morning (01/25/2021) I began taking Methylprednisolone (4mg Dospak 21s) which relieved the itching.  At this time the rash is greatly reduced and the itching has almost stopped.  I will continue the meds until the  dosage is completed.

Day 8, arm itchy and red around the injection site.  Warm to the touch. Day 9, more redness and larger area. Size of a silver dollar.  Talked to the nurse at a local gym. Suggested a clinic. I Saw a Nurse Practioner at a clinic. She thought perhaps it was an insect bite as the red area was about 4 inches below where a &#39;normal shot&#39; would be given. Prescribed cream and antibiotic. I didn&#39;t take it.  Took Benadryl (pill). Improving after 1 hr of taking Benadryl.

Not a raised or bumpy rash at all, not sore or itchy.    Called advise nurse to determine taking a benedryl was ok and took one last night.  This morning rash less noticeable but still there - also new little mark on inner left elbow.  Feeling fine this whole time, just concerned because I haven?t read of this reaction much for second Moderna.

                                                After the shot, I went home and felt fine.  I did some housework (cleaning) for about thirty minutes, then sat to rest .  Shortly thereafter, I began feeling pain in my left arm.  The pain became more severe as the day progressed until it was very severe and movement of my arm was limited.  The pain progressed throughout the night and also moved into my shoulder.  I got very little sleep even after taking Tylenol and trying heat and  ice applications.  Now, on the third day I am still having pain and am unable to lift my arm or move it outward without severe pain.  I am definitely hindered in my movement and use of left arm.  This is disturbing as I am an artist and need both arms to do my work.

Blood pressure rose to 170-190 over 110 and would not go down.  Doctor advised I go to the E.R. for assessment, which I did. Blood pressure remained elevated for days . Noted the systolic was higher , mostly in the 80&#39;s.  I do not have hypertension BP this morning  in the 120&#39;s over 70.  Needed Alprazolam to calm my anxiety since.  Not every day. Very concerned about having the second dose. Doctor has advised me to only drink water the day of shot, take a tranquilizer an hour before and has given me BP med to take if my BP goes over 150.

                                                As her husband, and caregiver since 2017, when she was diagnosed with dementia (I believe she had symptoms long before that) I noticed a very observable increase in the severity of her symptoms of confusion, memory loss, not being able to stay focused, disorientation, anxiety, agitation, anger, depression as a direct result of the second dose of the covid vaccine  The change was very noticeable and has not gotten any better. This appears to be a permanent escalation in the severity of her symptoms. I would say she has advanced  a stage to stage 5. We are now considering adding a new drug for her to take to try and level things out.   She also appeared to have a slight fever for 48 hours after.
