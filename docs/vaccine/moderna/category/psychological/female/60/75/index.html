When I woke up a few hours later, I noticed that I had a very bad headache and all-over body aches, and I felt like I had the flu.  Weak, nauseous and extremely tired.  I went to bed and slept through the night, when my alarm woke me at 7:00 am on Tuesday, January 5, I got up to use the bathroom and felt all the same symptoms from the night before, only worse.  I noticed that I had a rash on my left arm below the injection site.  I called in sick and went back to bed.  I slept from approximately 7:30 to 2:00 pm on January 5.  I felt a little better upon awakening, but had a very bad headache and no appetite.  The other body aches seemed better.

                                                Starting on Day 9 post injection I awoke with severe flu like symptoms:  severe headache, body aches, joint aches, fatigue, inability to get out of bed. Once I did get up I noted a severe red rash covering chest and extending up anterior neck (looked like a radiation burn). Symptoms lasted all day and made work or ADLs impossible. Felt about 75% better next day then symptoms returned the following day. Rash began peeling and appeared to look like a 2nd degree burn. Symptoms resolved by Day 4.

                                                2.5 hours after the injection I developed left arm swelling, itching with ertyhemia as well as, severe headache, nausea, GI turbulence, fatigue, and chills. I had to stop working that day and the next day. The headache was unrelenting. I went to bed with a heating pad on my head. Typically my body temp is 97.3 it went up to 98.1 I took Ibuprofen and Benadryl around the clock for the next 10 days. Day 8 &amp; 9 were the worst. My arm looked like an orange at the site of the injection; it was red/inflamed, induration &amp; itched. The welt size 2&#34; x 1&#34;. My headache was intractable, severe chills with teeth chattering, nausea, GI turbulence. It was a horrible 48 hours at which time I was again not able to work. I finally felt better on day 10. On day 14 my arm finally looked like it had not had an injection in it.

I had to stop working that day and the next day. The headache was unrelenting. I went to bed with a heating pad on my head. Typically my body temp is 97.3 it went up to 98.1 I took Ibuprofen and Benadryl around the clock for the next 10 days. Day 8 &amp; 9 were the worst. My arm looked like an orange at the site of the injection; it was red/inflamed, induration &amp; itched. The welt size 2&#34; x 1&#34;.

                                                From the date of the vaccine given I only had a sore arm for a couple of days.  Nothing then until day 7 then I started to feel run down and noticed a lymph node on my left chest at the clavicle.  It was large .  I wasn&#39;t thinking about my vaccine at all at that time.  I made an appointment with the PAC and he was concerned about it and had me do an ultrasound and blood work.  The ultrasound showed nodes measuring 4-16 mm concerning for lymphoma or just reactive. Then I had a ct and the  impression was indeterminate left axillary lymphadenopathy.  For the next 7 days I was home in bed a lot and was not able to take call as scheduled at my work place.  They hurt and I also developed a rash on the injection site, the back, the scalp and neck.  It itched and was annoying.   As the days progressed my nodes on my chest hurt and I could feel them as well as my groin  and abdomen.  January 28 my left arm started burning and hurting when I stretched it out to do activities or work.  February 1 a lymph node appeared in my inner elbow space I confirmed this with my Dr. that it was a lymph node.  It doesnt hurt as much now as before it swelled.  Not drinking extra water on any given day makes them all hurt more.    I felt rotten enough the 7-14 days after I had a covid test and it was negative.  I just found out today that my Covid 2 igG  Sar2 GB was positive on 1/14/21.  My other lab work was perfect

                                                About 3 PM she received her second vaccination for Covid.  She states that she has a history of adverse reactions to flu vaccines that are anaphylactic like in the past.  She usually premedicates with Benadryl and steroids.  Today she did take 100 mg of Benadryl prior to her vaccination.  Shortly after receiving the vaccine, she did feel like her throat was getting a little bit tight but she did not feel like it was true anaphylaxis.  However she then felt very off.  After this vaccine her throat started to feel tight, and she stated she did not feel well overall.  She did have some tunnel vision and was shaky. At about 1730 her heart rate drops to the 30s, she started feeling itchy, and then she went into a coughing fit and started to feel her throat close. She received 0.3 mg IM epinephrine, 20 mg IV famotidine, 125 mg IV methylprednisone, 0.5 mL of nebulized racepinephrine, and 500 mL NS bolus. She has since recovered and is stable on room air.

                                                at 11:10 PM last night 02/03 my neck was starting to itch. I was on my way home from work and at 11:30 the itching was going down my chest. At 11:45. I took my shirt off and it was spreading across my chest and my breast. I called the toll free number and left a voicemail, I tried to access the website and was unable to. My son had generic Benadryl so I took 2 of those and I laid down to go to bed. I had a restless night but I didn&#39;t get out of bed until about 5:30. I went to the bathroom and looked and the rash was spreading more I was still tired so I laid back down and got up about 8:00 am and I was itching and burning from head to toe. I went to the bathroom and took off my pajamas. And I am covered with a red bumpy rash all over my body. I didn&#39;t want to take anymore of generic Benadryl because obviously it didn&#39;t work. I waited till 9 am until Dr. office opened and I called them and they told me to take over the counter Benadryl and to get Benadryl cream from over the counter. They told me they were cancelling my 2nd vaccine because they thought I was having an allergic reaction to the 1st vaccine.  I asked if I could get steroids, prednisone, they said the doctor advised against it because it would suppress my immune system. And he told me if I started wheezing or any shortness of breath to go to the ER and they told me to call in if I have any more side effects. So I got dress and went to pharmacy and bought Benadryl cream and Benadryl tablets and lidocaine spray. I did take the  Benadryl, sprayed the spray and rubbed the cream and it is only helping a little.

                                                I had a sore arm on Sunday night - and Monday it was really sore and couldn&#39;t use my arm at all so I called in sick. Got sick on Tuesday, the January 5th - woke up with a sore throat; hoarse throat; fever; chills; cough - and chest was congested.  Fever came and went. A bit of muscle aches in my chest from coughing so much. I called the DR and they sent me down to the COVID area of my doctor&#39;s office. They did COVID test and told me to go home. On Thursday, they reported that I was negative on my test. I called my Dr  and she told me she had to still be quarantined for 10-14 days. She told me to take my asthma medicine and she told me to take cough medicine (OTC) and take Tylenol if I still need something else. She told me to drink fluids and rest. I went back to work on January 19th, Tuesday. I still have a little bit of congestion and cough.  I had the second dose of the Moderna on January 28th. I had  a sore arm but not as bad as last time.

                                                On February 03, 2021 my arm started itching.  On February 04, 2021 my arm continued to itch with the appearance of three distinct circular areas of bumps (dime sized circles).  On February 05, 2021 I was awakened from my sleep due to my arm itching.  The previous distinct dime sized circles had merged into one large red papule (oval shaped 3 inches long by 2 inches wide).  I contacted Dermatology clinic for an appointment.  In the meantime I applied Hydrocortizone ointment to the area and took a benadryl tablet orally for the itching.  My doctors appointment is scheduled for 02/05/2021 at 10:30 AM.

                                                At 11pm on the day I recieved the vaccine, I noticed my ears and neck were itchy.  A half  hour later I had a bad sunburn like rash from my ears down to my chest and accross my shoulder s . I went to bed hoping it was just a quick reaction and it would go away. I took 2 benadryl.. When I woke up the next morning I felt like I was on fire. The rash spread over both arms around my torso and down to my hips. It was very itchy and painful.  I called the doctor and he said it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine. To continue with the benadryl,  go to urgent care or er if it got worse or if I had trouble breathing. My appointment for the second dose was cancelled. The rash wasn&#39;t clearing up when I went to bed so I rubbed cortisone 10 cream all over it and went to sleep. Had a restless night , got out of bed in the morning and both my hands were angry red and swollen as was the tops of my feet, the rash was a bit better on my arms, back and chest, but my buttocks down to my toes had angry red rash with welts, welts were also on my hands and wrist area I also had some chest tightness and a little difficulty swallowing. . I called urgent care to see if I could come in and I was told to go to er if I could drive or call 911. I went to er.  The dr put me on an iv with benadryl, pepsid and a steriod. The swelling came down and the redness was easing up along with the pain. Dr. said it was a drug allergy,  and I was allergic to vaccine. I was discharged with a prescription for prednisone and to continue the benadryl and pepsid for 5 days. I have no health insurance,  I cant afford it.

Could  not function during the day hardly at all.  After 36 hours felt almost no symptoms.  Shot given on Tuesday and Thursday night awoke with very high heart rate.  114 BPM - upon arriving at work was given a blood pressure reading of 170/160.  I called my doctor and due to not having any other symptoms of stroke prescribed a low dose high blood pressure medication.  I took only 2 doses but due to very adverse effects to the medication stopped after 2 doses.  My BP was going down as I was checking it.  The medication made me feel very dizzy with fatigue and increased heart rate.  On Monday morning at 1:00 A.M. - 2/8 I awoke AGAIN with chest discomfort and extremely high BPM - 140.  I called 911 and was admitted to the ER.  After 3 hours both BP and BPM decreased to a normal range and i was released.  Chest x-ray and blood draw  were all normal.  Continued to experience some dizziness during the day but could function.

This was noticeable in the hours leaving for the hospital at about 8:00 p.m. Once at the hospital, I was combatant and didn&#39;t recognize family. I continued in this state while the Dr&#39;s at the hospital ran tests.  Around the 16th and/or 17th, after 2-3 days of steroids, I could answer Dr&#39;s questions and recognized family.

About 4:00am diarrhea started.  I never went back to sleep that day.  At 6:00am after a shower I notice a bump by my left clavicle.  I notice it was movement about the size of a nickel.  I called Dr. office, they agreed to see me in the afternoon.  At 3:30pm I saw Dr. said that it&#39;s lymph and I should keep an eye on it.  He recommends an ultra sound if not better in two weeks. Left shoulder is painful and it is a little hard to type, but not a big deal. 2/25/21 about 9:00pm I went to the bathroom I had a bright red bowels.   2?26/21 I am waiting for Dr. (she has been my stomach doctor for many years) to speak with her about the bloody bowel.  I will also call Dr. a message to keep her up

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

Shortly after breakfast on the morning of the 25 I had a lump in my throat as though my food didn&#39;t go all the way down. Then, as the day wore on I got more &amp; more fatigued; later in the day my lips were mildly numb. I had no appetite at supper time and started getting a headache along with chills. All day Saturday I had flu-like symptoms, chills (no fever) extreme tiredness and a dull headache and laid under a blanket all day, no energy. Saturday evening around dinner time I started feeling better and Sunday woke up feeling as though nothing had happened other than a dull headache and soreness at the injection site.

Soreness in arm continued for 3 weeks, on and off.  Sometimes it felt like deep bone pain, she described as excruciating.  Sometimes woke her at night.  Did not occur every day.  Some arm swelling.   The injection was given at where she works.   This PHN did not give the vaccine, but patient called to inform of reaction.  We were going to complete this form together, but patient decided she&#39;d do herself.  I am not certain she will, so am sending the info I was told.  She received 2nd injection 3/1/2021.  Side effects seem less vigorous, by report, so far this time.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful.

Brain fog lasted 24 hours.  Trouble walking for 3 days.  Nose bleed on 1st night after getting shot while sleeping.  For first 2 nights after getting shot had tingly, like many fine needles from knees up to waist.  First 2 days had hot/cold feeling, nausea...all in all incredibly unpleasant.

Approximately 48 hours later I began to have a headache and ran a fever of 101.4 with body aches and slept almost the entire day. The next day my temperature was 100.6 with headache but no body aches but I had nausea for the next for the next 48 hours. I had really bad night sweats for 3 nights. On 3/8 I developed a red bump the size of a dime in the center of my rash on my arm.  The arm has itched the entire time. On 3/9 I woke up feeling better finally but itching still persists but compared along with the other side effects it?s nothing.

                                                On Friday, March 12th, 2021 approximately 10:35 am, 60-year-old female received her first dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot Number: 003A21A) in her left deltoid at the facility.  Patient received the Moderna Vaccine. After which she sat in the designated medical observation area for her allotted 15 minutes. Approximately nine minutes post-injection around 10:44 am, she felt a bit ?wobbly? when standing up. A medical assistant called Emergency Medical Services (EMS) immediately and the Physicians Assistant went over to assess patient&#39;s symptoms.   During the wait time for EMS?s arrival, the physicians assistant performed an assessment. Patient states to have experienced lightheaded-ness, mouth/tongue tingling, shortness of breath and palpitations. She denied throat constriction, denied itching, redness or pain at the site of injection. She said the tingling she did experience resolved around 20 mins post-injection.   During the assessment, the physicians assistant noted clear breath sounds, irregular health rhythm, increased heart rate, extra-ocular movements intact with no nystagmus, no redness or swelling on the injection site and good grip strength.   Upon EMS arrival at approximately 10:48 pm, the firefighters triaged as per their assessment. She expressed that she is taking ?Lexapro? and allergic to sulfa-drugs. She claims to be ?borderline diabetic? and that the lightheaded-ness has ?never happened before?  The EMS took her to a separate room in the building and assessed her further. After approximately 20 minutes she left and did not leave in an ambulance against medical advice.  She left with her husband and went home. She was made aware that she should go to the hospital immediately if she felt her health was compromised.

Then about midnight, awoke to sever aches and chills and an overall feeling of illness.  I could not get comfortable and could not sleep.  I was FREEZING and ACHING terribly.  I also felt nauseous but did not vomit.  I drank some white soda and ate a cracker and took some more Tylenol, again 400 mg, and went back to bed..  I took my hypertension pill as well.  I slept this time for 4 hours.  I woke up again and felt extremely weak, achy and cold.  I had zero appetite.  I drank an orange soda, took another 400 mg of Tylenol.  I went back to bed and slept for  another 4 hours.  I woke up feeling like a truck ran me over.  I sat up and watched a clip on the news about the Moderna shot adversely affecting women more than men.  I knew how bad I felt and wished I had not taken the shot.  I took another dose of Tylenol 400mg.  I was up for an hour or so and then went back to bed, sleeping until 6:00 a.m. the following morning.   I was feeling better the next day, not 100% but way better.  I was able to eat.  I took it easy  the rest of the weekend.

                                                Got her vaccine with no problem, got her vaccine and felt dazed as she was going to the waiting area.  She was anxious and then started feeling heaviness in her chest.  She felt dazed, nothing registered and was not focused on anything, and sat for 25 minutes.    She then got up and walked to the car, felt like she was in the clouds and her right lung was really, really bothering her by the time she got home and tired.   Her heart rate was 140 and very fast.  She didn&#39;t feel as if she was anxious but just blaise.   She was really winded and exhausted by the time she got home.  She had not eaten before she got the vaccine, made herself a sandwich and fell asleep and slept for about 3 hours.  When she woke up she had a very, very sore arm.  Then on Saturday, she woke up around 3:00 AM, and could not go back to sleep as she was wide awake.  Then every task that she did just exhausted her and still felt heaviness in her chest and back and the right lung was really bothering her like she had worked like an animal for a period of time.  She has a small apartment and it doesn&#39;t take any energy to walk to the kitchen.  Saturday she felt fine, was cleaning and felt good.  Sunday she slept all day and her right lung was still hurting her.  Yesterday was still exhausted and winded feeling.  Today, 3/16/21 she is still feeling the same way and exhausted doing simple tasks.  She has a nodule in her right lung and several spots in her left lung but nothing is being done for them.  The vaccine seems to have exacerbated the symptoms and made them worse.  The injection site is a little sore but nothing out of the ordinary for a vaccine.  She took two Advil for her symptoms which did help as she had pain in her head with this which will last for 5-10 minutes and then goes away.  She has notified her doctor and she has an appointment on Friday at 11:00 AM.

Occurred approximately 15 minutes after immunization.  Called 911 and paramedics evaluated her before taking her to the ER where she was released.  Previously stated she was extremely nervous about receiving the vaccine.

                                                I felt slightly dizzy within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine, but shrugged it off as unimportant.  I developed a slight headache within an hour of the vaccine.  I continued to feel a bit dizzy and confused the rest of the day but didn&#39;t take anything for the slight headache.  When I awoke this morning, I had a bad headache, chills, body aches all over, dizziness, light-headedness and confusion.  I was so confused that I didn&#39;t remember making coffee for my son.  I&#39;ve also had difficulty concentrating or keeping on task.  I took less than half of a Benadryl tablet about 45 to 60 minutes ago in case my body was experiencing an allergic reaction.  Hopefully the dizziness and confusion will subside soon.

The injection site on my left arm later bruised and was painful to the point of interfering with sleep.  One week later, a painful red rash developed and spread on my left arm.  I again began to experience slight difficulty in breathing.

Today is 15 days later and can raise my arm to 90 degrees only and have stabbing pain in the shoulder/ rear felt. Cannot sleep on it, keeps me up all night so I?m beginning to become concerned. I?ve tried Motrin,heat,ice and  nothing is working and still VERY painful.

Coincidentally, it seemed to help with headache and dizziness.  Still taking meloxican and headache and dizziness are minimal, but still present.  Will be getting off the meloxican on Friday, 3/26, and we&#39;ll see???  3/ 20 - started with fever blisters and mouth ulcers(probably from shot or stress  all this has brought on my body)

I laid on the floor for about 15min they symptoms got somewhat better enough to sit up.  I was sent home by my boss who also offered me a ride because I looked so awful. At home I went to bed but continued to throw up and have chills.  I slept the rest of the next 2 days.  I have continued to not feel well since the body aches and nausea  as well as short of breath being the worst at this point.   I felt in the beginning I was going to die it was so bad.  I&#39;m not one to just go to the doctors so I went home to bed.  I have been short of breath

Occasional Nausea.  At almost week 3 I&#39;ve tried Motrin, 1,000 mg a day, Psuedofed, as needed, Miclazine, and Vitamine C

                                                Sore arm right away - that evening I could hardly move my arm. When I woke up the next morning, I had all of the symptoms that I had when I had the virus and I had 100.5 fever - headache; tired; achy. And those lasted not even a whole day and then they went away. Then the next night after that I couldn&#39;t sleep on the arm it hurt so bad. And the next day I noticed a rash - in the area around the shot on the top part of the left  arm and it was burning and hot  and it itched real bad. I took Benadryl. I went to the doctor (on the 18th or 19th - went for other reasons and I also showed her my arm) and she gave me some prednisone but I didn&#39;t take all of it because it started going away. I only took a day of the prednisone and day 6 it seemed to be going away.  I have photos of it. My symptoms had resolved by second dose. 2/12/2021 - I had a headache for a day after the second dose but that was it.

Later in the day on 3/26/3021 had a rash around elbow bone.  Starting to fade now (early 3/27/2021).  Mainly concerned if this was an adverse reaction &amp; if it would affect effectiveness.

                                                She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.  Then her arm started hurting to the point that she could not move it.  On Thursday, 3/25/21 she was tired but functional.  Then around 5:30 PM she started feeling really strange, odd, felt faint, got hot/cold, her heart was racing.  She laid down as she was at a friends house, they checked her BP, blood sugar and her temperature and they were all normal at that point.  Around 8:00 PM she got the nausea that would not stop and took Zofran.  Around 9:30 she started throwing up.  She then tried Phenergan and was not able to keep that down yesterday.  Then she started running a temperature, and called her doctors office and told her what to look for and to call back if things got worse.  They then got worse, called them back and then around 8:00 AM on Friday they told her to go to the hospital.  When she got to the hospital they started checking things as her fever was higher, her liver enzymes, her thyroid, her kidneys, iron just started going off the page.  Her fever then kept getting higher and higher and at one point it was documented at 104.8, and felt like her organs hurt.  11 days prior to this visit she had just had labs done and everything was normal.  So due to the new findings everything was all elevated, so they checked her for an infection, COVID which was negative, but the intensity of the symptoms got to the point they were unbearable.  She stayed in the hospital for 4 days, and the doctor came in and noted that she had a severe reaction to the vaccine.    They told her to stay longer than the 15 minutes as they had some issues today, and told her that they had to call a medic for 4 other people that passed out, which made her wonder if they had a bad batch or not, and wonders how many people from that day got sick as well.     She still has the most dreadful fatigue, headache and cannot walk from her house to the mailbox without feeling like she is going to faint and used to walking 2-4 miles daily.  Wonders how long is this going to last and that this will pass and that she will be okay, or is she going to be permanently this way.  She feels like she has a bad case of mono or something and cannot stay up and has to go to bed, and also has bouts of insomnia as well.   The body aches are extreme and is taking pain medicine daily due to these symptoms, which she did not have prior to the vaccine.   She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.

                                                I recently retired after 37 years and now stay and provide significant weekly care for my elderly parents.  Because I am a primary caregiver for my parents, and have been throughout the months of the pandemic, I explored various potential paths to ethically and appropriately get in line for a vaccination.  When I took my mother in for her second vaccination at the Health Department in late in March I was able, while my mother was waiting, to converse with a county public health care worker about options and avenues for me to obtain the vaccine as well. She could see, clearly, that I was a caregiver for my mother, so she took down my name and number, and she called me the next day to say that I could, as a caregiver, proceed to sign up for their next clinic vaccination day that would be happening on Thursday, April 1st.   I arrived for my noon vaccination time at the Health Department before 12 on Thursday, April 1st. I proceeded through the check in line and screening questions, and arrived at vaccination site #1 at 12:05 where I was promptly given the Moderna vaccine (lot #026B21A).  Within seconds of the injection, I knew that I was having a reaction. My heart immediately began pounding, my tongue swelled and the room disintegrated into swirling flashes of color. I looked into the kind eyes of my vaccinator and remember distinctly saying to her in those first few post-injection seconds that, I was, ??sorry, but I think that I am having a reaction.?  The vaccinator then took me over to the nursing site coordinator who proceeded to check and record my vitals. I do not have that sheet with the vitals that she recorded, but I do remember that my heart rate and blood pressure measures were high. I sat as she continued to monitor me.  After 20-30 minutes, as best I can recall, my vitals were not improving, but remained elevated and even seemed to be trending higher. Also, the swelling and tingling in my tongue was worsening and seemed to be spreading to my lips and face, and down to the base of my neck.  I began to feel dizzy, like I was going to faint, so she had me lay on the floor with my legs elevated.  Additionally, it was becoming more difficult to breath because of the pressure in my neck. She had earlier and initially offered me Benadryl for the symptoms I was experiencing but I did not previously have good luck with Benadyrl the one time I took it, and also was unsure if I would have been able to swallow it. At 12:40 she thus gave me an injection of epinephrine (3mL) in my thigh and an ambulance was called. I was transported to the ER at the hospital. (Please note that the nursing site coordinator provided top-notch, high quality care through-out my entire emergency medical reaction experience, and I am very grateful and appreciative of her professional and caring response.)  In ER they monitored my blood pressure and pulse, and other aspects of my heart rhythm, as well as the swelling and tingling that continued in my tongue, lips, face and forehead.  I met with the Dr., and worked with RNs during my time there where they continued to monitor me for a number of hours. By about 4:30, when my vitals had returned to normal and stabilized for over an hour, they released me from the hospital. Since my release from the hospital, late in the afternoon on Thursday, April 1, I have noted only a few, relatively minor persisting symptoms which have included tongue, lip and face numbness and tingling. Also, I have noted, from time to time, some periods of continued heart rate elevation, though wonder if it is more of an almost ?PTSD? type of reaction than a pure physiological response, since, for example, just retelling this story right now is causing my heart rate to rise as I recall what happened.  Needless to say, this vaccination induced medical event, explained above, made for a surreal and frightening day unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Processing of it, and grappling with its implications, from concrete to existential, is seeming equally daunting, and it is here where I have a range of questions for which I am seeking assistance and perspective from the CDC:  The most concrete types of vaccination questions first: They indicated I should not try to obtain the second dose of the Moderna vaccine but that I should consult and maybe it could be given to me in a hospital setting? I welcome thoughts and feedback on how to proceed to become ?fully vaccinated.? What about another vaccine?  What about the additional boosters now being discussed for the new variants? Will I need to consider a ?cave dwelling? of some type for myself in the future since I will not have the vaccination card that is being discussed as ?the ticket to travel? in the future?  Will there be special cards for folks like me who tried but for whatever strange immunological reason was not able to take the vaccine? Increasingly complex, bigger picture questions next: Would any type of ?reach-out? to Moderna be in order? Or, do you, at the CDC, reach out to Moderna for me as a result of this VAER? Are they studying people like me?  My sense, from what little reading I have done, is that what happened to me, though severe, is rare, though definitely want the producers of the vaccine to know about my experience. Bordering on existential questions: What does this mean for me and my life going forward? Should I meet with Moderna, or some type of allergy specialist to better understand what may have happened, and what I will need to watch out for in the future? As everyone begins sharing vaccination cards and experiences, what should I say? I don?t want to scare others away from doing what is needed to save lives by sharing my experience, and don?t want to fuel the ?anti-vaxers.? What about the lingering disquiet and unease that something I sought to help and protect me seems like it might have/nearly killed me? The pandemic has already shaken and taken so much in so many of our lives.  Immunization seemed to promise to give back some of what the pandemic has taken, yet, feeling now that ?normal? is not only more distant but possibly will not be achievable for folks like me, rare though we seem to be?

                                                Headache started 12 hours after the 10 AM injection. Over the next 10 hours muscle aches and joint aches set in with severe chills and fatigue. Felt nauseated/ did not vomit. My eyes ached. I stayed in bed for 24 hours. Two days after the injection most of the symptoms had subsided but my vision was very blurry. I have experienced the same type of blurry vision after taking Nyquil, so I don&#39;t take it anymore. Now 3 days after the second Covid shot, my vision is clearing. I am developing a cold sore which I feel may be another reaction to the vaccine. I did not take any medication for the symptoms and did not report it to my doctor. I just wanted the fact of the symptoms to be included with the CDC data.

HAD A VERY MINOR HEADACHE THE TWO DAYS FOLLOWING THE VACCINE, JUST MILD DISCOMFORT.  FULLY RESOLVED ON ITS OWN AFTER TWO DAYS.  2.  MONDAY, JANUARY 4 WHEN I WOKE UP I FELT &#34;PUFFY&#34; - FEET AND HANDS WERE MILDLY SWOLLEN.  NOTICED MY SHOES FELT TIGHTER THAN USUAL AND HANDS FELT A BIT DIFFICULT TO FULLY CLOSE.  THIS IS FLUID RETENTION, AS IF YOU HAD TOO MUCH SALTY FOOD THE DAY BEFORE, AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS I HAD INGESTED MORE SALT THAN I REALIZED ON SUNDAY.  BUT IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE THAT OCCURRED FOR ME AND MY DIET DOES NOT INCLUDE MUCH SALT OR PROCESSED FOODS.  THEN TODAY MY FEET AND HANDS STILL FEEL PUFFY, SHOES STILL A BIT TIGHT AND HANDS A BIT HARD TO CLOSE SO THERE IS STILL SOME FLUID RETENTION GOING ON.  THIS IS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR ME, I AM QUITE HEALTHY AND HAVE A GOOD DIET AND DON&#39;T RECALL THIS HAPPENING BEFORE.    AGAIN, NOT AT ALL SURE THIS IS RELATED TO THE VACCINE, IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HEAD COLD, BUT AS I AM NOT SURE AND THIS IS UNUSUAL AND HAS OCCURRED AFTER RECEIVING THE VACCINE, I FELT I SHOULD REPORT IT.  THIS EFFECT IS VERY MILD AND I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND IT.

They gave me water and crackers and said try to eat something for second shot. After 30 mins I felt OK to leave. During the rest of the day I had a headache which worsen and next day (1/6/) the same and had that weird out of body sensation off and on. I also had mild achy feeling, fatigue and both hips and shoulders mild pain. I did take this day off from work. These symptoms resolved towards the end of that night. Doing much better today (1/8/21). I aslo had mild swelling and sore at the injection site which I expected like a flu shot. I have not had any reaction to any vaccination prior years.

Due to this we observed her for 30 minutes following administration of vaccine.  About 25 minutes into her observation period she began developing hives on her forearms and wasn&#39;t feeling her normal self.  She denied any respiratory symptoms but was continuously clearing her throat and when asked if she normally did that, she stated that she did not.  Decision was made to take vital signs and administer 50mg of IM Diphenhydramine.  She was agreeable to this plan .  After administering Diphenhydramine, we continued to monitor her vitals and had her stay another 45 minutes for observation.  Hives resolved and vital signs remained within normal limits.  Patient was education on allergic  reactions and she to seek medical care.  Patient verbalized understanding and felt  back to her normal self.

Pt reported upper respiratory viral illness the week prior but determined with medical advice that she was well enough to be immunized on the 15th. Immediate post-vaccination period was unremarkable.  Later that evening pt experienced onset of HA and fatigue which progressed to severe HA, low grade fever (~99 F per patient), malaise, and sore shoulder the following day.  Symptoms gradually improved over the next 2-3 days with HA being the most troublesome and lingering symptom.  Pt used OTC analgesics to manage HA pain. On 1/19/2021, four days after prime dose administration, pt noted a visible lump mid-clavicle, determined to be a severely swollen lymph node.  Warm and tender to touch.  Pt sought medical attention for this the following day, 1/20/2021.  Physician&#39;s assessment: &#34;Pt received the COVID moderna vaccine Friday, left arm.  She is a triage RN at Medical Clinic.  She states yesterday a lump appeared on her LT clavicle area.  Pt reports the lump is tender, &#34;warm&#34; but not red, and no surrounding erythema.  Yesterday had HA and a &#34;weird sensation&#34; radiating to LT ear from the lump.  The lump is now the size of a golf ball, did draw a line under it to see it.  She is able to swallow okay and has no other concerning Sx.  No changes in breathing.  Has had headaches, which have been reported possible side effect from COVD19 vaccination.  This vaccination was given quite high in her arm she thinks as well.  Fever Sunday night, 2 days after vaccination.  Has been taking Tylenol and IBU (not what she does usually) taking with food and has some GI upset.  Did try a cool compress on the lump yesterday which did not seem to help.&#34; // &#34;Can clearly see her soft tissue mass above her left clavicle, with a line that she drove underneath it yesterday when it started to form. There is no redness but is certainly tender to touch. Can still see a little bit of bruise in her arm where her vaccine was given in her left arm which does seem quite high, not two finger widths from the acromion process. Discussed prednisone but she is terrified of this as she was given a Symbicort inhaler not that long ago and felt that the steroid really made her wired. Recommend warm compresses, alternate between Tylenol ibuprofen with food and even topical Voltaren gel which she has at home and Arnica gel to area. Can certainly get CBC CMP for further evaluation. Discussed soft tissue ultrasound if this does not improve, will order this today in case it is needed she can just get that scheduled. She is going to report her vaccine reaction to the link she was given on the paper which I think is appropriate. Hopefully symptoms will improve in the next few days and then can proceed with her second vaccination a month from the first.&#34;  I spoke with patient today, 1/27/2021, to submit VAERS report. She reports swollen lymph node is still visible though size and sensitivity continue to slowly diminish.

Very tired and did not feel well.  Low grade fever was sporadic.   Could not go to work. Called Dr. about symptoms and prescribe antiobiotic of Ceftin for the sore throat..  Sore throat went away after 24 to 48 hours of being on medicine. By day 10 all the skin reactions had calmed down and by day 12 was feeling good.  Dr. wanted me to report to you guys.  He was unsure if I should take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  He seemed confident throughout that this was an immune response to the vaccine.

At 3:04 pm, started having a strange body feeling,  felt a warm rush from my neck to my groin (like a person having a CT scan with dye), heart rate increased to 127bpm. I stood up and  said I&#39;m not feeling well.  Staff came, took pulse rate, bp (170s over 90s) walked to a cot and felt shaky legs. Around 3:11pm  they gave benadryl 50mg.  Staff called a rapid response.  I was told i had a rash. They shot me with an epipen and was taken to EMERGENCY DEPT.

By that evening, fever ( not checked nor confirmed but probable) 14 hours after the vaccine with rigors. Body aches for 24 &#43; hours after receiving vaccine. plus intermittent headache.   By 36 hours later, still having intermittent fever (100.1 ) with body aches and sheer exhaustion.  I am a nurse in an I.C.U.  I had to call off work today, 48 hours after the vaccine. was received. Mainly for this persistent exhaustion. Also this damn headache still hanging around...mild but irritating. I know none of this is what I would call ADVERSE but my co-workers insist I need to fill out this information so I am. I it 50 hours from the vaccine and I am tired, slow and have to lay down and rest. It&#39;s stupid. My first vaccine was NOTHING . I have not had covid and I don&#39;t plan on it.  :)

                                                I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my PMD office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

Pt had to continue to use ibuprofen alternated with acetaminophen during the day.  By 6pm on the 28th, the headache became unbearable. No NSAIDS were helpful. Pt reports that it felt like the top of her head could pop off.  Pt slept restlessly for the next 12 hours, but would awaken when the arm that received the injection would get bumped - that injection site was throbbing. Pt continues to have dull throbbing headaches daily. At time pt continues to take NSAIDS and reports this will most often take the edge off the headache.

Thought process has been fuzzy, difficulty typing and completing sentences  I also had vomitting x 2 on day one post vaccine but no diarrhea. Chills and fever persisted for approx 36 hours. Joint pain lasted x 36 hours. Headache continues now 5 days post vaccination. Per my employers request I was covid tested today 2/3 and my rapid results were negative. I continue to take ibuprofen and Tylenol for a continued headache. Thought process improved today.

                                                IM vaccination was  given in LUE deltoid. On the day of the vaccine felt slightly dizzy and more fatigued. The following day, I developed a painful, enlarged lymph node in left supraclavicular area. The next day I felt overall weakness and tiredness. No fever noted, but I was frequently flushed and had hot flashes with perceived sudden weakness. I had slight nasal congestion and prolonged sneezing spells on the following days. I had to find a place to sit down and remove my lab coat and turn down the heat because of hot flashes at work. I had fecal urgency and loose stool x 2 on 3/5/21. I have mild lymph node enlargement in left neck today (2/6/21) that is not painful. I had pain at the injections site for 2-3 days after the first vaccine injection that awakened me from sleep a couple of times. The second injection was given in the same arm. All of my symptoms are easily managed with Tylenol, Motrin, fluids and rest.

According to my Watch app., the resting hear rate upon waking was 115.. I had a severe headache and generally felt awful. I took Aleve and did deep breathing to try to bring heart rate down. One hour later it was coming down, although still higher than my normal resting rate of 60.  The arm where the injection was given has been extremely sore with a rash, sore enough that it is hard to use the arm. It is now 3 days since the vaccine, my heart rate has been normal. My arm pain is reduced but still sore with a rash. I feel fatigued and foggy. The severe joint pain is less but still present.

At around 11:00 the next morning all symptoms had subsided with the exception of feeling exhausted.   I was using v-safe to report my symptoms but never received any reminders about the second shot, and did not get a reminder until Sunday, which of course by then, all symptoms  were gone and answered how I felt that day which was fine.  I just felt it was important to report the symptoms accurately.

It felt very odd and was very scary. I had no tingling  in my lips or in my throat. I could speak, drink water and eat. The sensation lasted approximately 5 hours until it felt somewhat back to normal.  I have my second doze of the Moderna vaccine scheduled for March 5. I am worried about getting it after having this reaction.  Please advise me.

That night my temperature rose to 100-100.7;  By morning 2 days after the dose the fever was gone, as was the tingling and dizziness; but the headache remains.   Excedrin XS and drinking a lot of water helped to relieve some of the symptoms. There&#39;s still some pain at injection site, but I expected that.

Patient had tremors throughout her body, had abnormal vital signs - temp 98.8, HR 112, RR 24 and labored breathing, BP 88/42, O2 saturation variating constantly between 88-96% on 4 liters O2. Patient initially refused to have 911 called. Nurse has called patient&#39;s PCP and PCP spoke with patient who then agreed to call 911 to go to a hospital. 911 was called, report given to paramedics, the patient taken to local ER.  Per patient and family - some tests were done in ER (?including CT of head from patient&#39;s description). Patient&#39;s cognitive status and vital signs have improved and patient was sent home. Per ER, they think this was a reaction to the COVID vaccine.  Today 2/18/21 AM visit, same nurse - patient&#39;s cognition is at baseline. Patient seems very tired but vital signs are better.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

                                                After 45 minutes of receiving vaccination , the knuckles in my left hand, the arm I received the shot in, began to hurt very badly.  Before I was able to get home,  7 minutes away, both hands hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t hole the steering wheel and I was having cramps in my legs.  I could hardly walk up the steps to my house because my ankle joints hurt so badly.  I went to bed  right away and slept .  My hands hurt really badly, but I knew the vaccination caused an inflammatory response so I figured just  rest.  By the end of the day Tuesday, I couldn&#39;t type and could not hold the steering wheel to drive home.  I felt out of breath, I hurt all over, my muscles ached and were cramping.  I was nauseated, very emotional.  I had a fever that spiked at over 101 degrees.  I was so chilled that I was shaking violently. I hurt in every joint, my lymph nodes were painfully swollen, my heart was racing, normal pulse for me is 68 to 72, it was 88 to 90.  Halfway up our stairs, I just stopped, couldn&#39;t make my legs work.  Day 3 I called my doctor, had a virtual appointment I knew I couldn&#39;t drive or ride 45 minutes away.  I missed 3 days of work, stayed home all weekend and was better by Monday.  It was 3 weeks before my hands quit aching.  The pain came and went in my ankles, wrist, knuckles, hips and knees.    Food still nauseates me.

By evening when I was able to examine the arm the deltoid was swollen to twice it&#39;s normal size and a red diffuse itchy rash approximately 4cm by 6cm.  I took zyrtec and applied ice.  Swelling went down somewhat and itching relieved. 2/26/2021 swelling and itching continued. I iced at 1pm to get some relief.  7:30 feel really run down. will need to ice again to be able to get sleep. I am concerned that a delayed histamine reaction like this may get worse after the next dosage.

                                                By early the next morning, my mouth started developing sores &amp; my tongue became increasingly swollen.  I had a sore throat for about 15 days; at about one week past this dose, my right shoulder froze &amp; the rotator joint was swollen &amp; incredibly painful to the touch.  I lost the use of my right arm entirely for about five days, then the swelling &amp; pain slowly subsided.  My eyes were burning &amp; my arm was weak but I made a full recovery about 18 days after this dose.  The last symptoms were severe headaches, accompanied by an inability to remain asleep.  I took Tylenol &amp; Tylenol PM to alleviate pain &amp; regain some sleep &amp; did report these symptoms to my doctor.

                                                I started developing a fever of 100.2 around  11:30pm on 2/3/21, 13 hours after receiving the vaccine.  My fever rose to 101.3 by the following morning. It started to drop to 100.2 again by 9:30pm  on 2/4/21 and was 99.5 by 10am 2/5/21. I had  a severe headache that started as gentle pressure about 2 hours after being vaccinated and escalated to feeling like my head was in a vice  through the morning of 2/5/21. I had severe hip and knee joint pain and muscle pain all of 2/4. I was unable to walk because it hurt badly to put weight on my joints. I had a stiff neck and couldn?t turn my head more than 45% in either direction. I slept no more than 20 mins that night due to the pain.  On 2/4 I developed nose bleeds and incontinence. Those symptoms went away by 2/5.  Dizziness and lightheadedness, fatigue and headache stayed with me for 2 weeks. I am still more tired than usual.

Later that evening My are was sore and I continued to be dizzy. By nighttime I felt achy and tired. About 6 hours after the shot a fever started and I took Tylenol. By 1am I had 101.3, the rigors and a headache and dizziness which I still have 4 days later. My fever ran for over 48 hours and would not respond to any  ibuprofen or Tylenol. My joint and muscle pain was severe, my balance was off. I could barely move my arm. Today I am now nauseous. I was not this sick when I had Covid. My fever would at least relent. I?ve lost time from work and my life. I have heart palpitations and my resting heart rate has gone up. Pressure feels strange behind my eyes. My legs are sore.   I called my doctor two days after my vaccine and she minimized my symptoms.

I had confusion, reporting? Epipen?  Tell anyone.  I was not aware of my surroundings otherwise during the episode. Afterwards, I was breathing ok? and went home.  I later called Moderna, and reported this issue. I called the pharmacist, and reported the problem. I called many other pharmacies, asking for advise - ranging from NO do not take the 2nd vaccine (matter of life/death) due to serious reaction to take it &amp; wait longer.

One week to the day I started experiencing an itch around the injection sight. I was woken a few times thru the evening itching my arm. In the morning the area of my arm that received  the injection was warm to touch, swollen and it looked like I was punched in the arm. The red bruise that appeared  was round and the diameter of an orange. This lasted till Monday. I took 1 Benadryl tablet Monday evening and went to sleep   Woke up Tuesday morning and the redness, itch and swelling were gone

I have been to a chiropractor besides my Primary Care Dr.  Not absolutely sure if it is from the shot but could be a contributing factor.

                                                Weakness Confusion Falling down Vision impairment  Legs really weak All of the  above symptoms started on March 14, 2021 On March 18,2021 she was not out of bed except for just a few minutes.  On March 19, 2021 she was on the floor laying beside of the bed and my father noticed blood looking stuff on her shirt and bed covers. She was really confused and lethargic. She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

                                                I had the second Moderna shot that afternoon, scheduled for 4:15pm but it was about 4:30pm when I got it.  I moved around as instructed by my doc, and after 15 minutes went back to my car.  I noticed after another several minutes that my pulse was still elevated so opted to go back in and talk to a health care professional.  Pulse was 120.  Paramedic wanted me to lie down in waiting area but I didn&#39;t want to be in such a potentially  germy environment, and the guy next to me who had fainted earlier was just getting up himself.  She walked me back to my car, where I agreed to wait, listen to a stress relief hypnosis audio and see if my pulse rate would calm down.  She came back out w/ a BP cuff and said my blood pressure was 210 over 130 (or some number over 100; I don&#39;t recall which) and she said I needed to get in an ambulance right away and go to the hospital.  I said I would make my own decisions about my body and I wanted to try a couple of other things first, promised not to leave, contacted my doctor, naturopath.  (Note: I did not have any other worrisome symptoms -- blurred vision, dizziness, etc.  My head was a little buzzy, but whether out of fear or in reaction to the shot I didn&#39;t know.  I was a little flushed).  He asked me a bunch of questions, said my body hadn&#39;t had time to mount an immune response to the vaccine and that I had likely had a histamine reaction to a preservative in the vaccine (or similar), which a couple of his other patients had experienced.  He asked if I&#39;d been drinking fluids (yes, plenty), had eaten recently (no, so he suggested I have some food; I had some nuts, a little cheese and some Cheez-Its so had that), asked if I had an antihistamine around -- I did, but I don&#39;t do well with Benadryl and didn&#39;t have Claritin, but after looking through my bag found some Allervive, an herbal product he compounds.  He said, &#34;That&#39;s perfect.&#34;  I took two of the three capsules and hung up.  Staff were checking up on me in my car every ten minutes or so, by the way, very kind and professional as I had been quite upset at the whole &#34;get in an ambulance&#34; scenario.  He thought some of my reaction was probably also stress-related, and I noticed before the shot that I was teary, not from anxiety but the kind you get when you feel relief after a long ordeal.  I didn&#39;t feel anxiety, really, until the first blood pressure measurement.  He also let me know that if the bottom number didn&#39;t drop below 100 they couldn&#39;t let me go.  After eating, drinking some more water and taking the Allervive my BP was down to 138 over 75 in just a few minutes.  I agreed to stick around and make sure it stuck.  We re-tested again about 15 minutes later, perhaps longer, and it was the same.  I had been a little flushed but that had gone away too.  I left and went for a light walk and eventually drove home without incident.  I had symptoms after the shot that could have been related to my body fighting off the allergic reaction or to the vaccine itself, but they were pretty mild (fatigue later that night; occasional heart rate elevation sometimes after eating or with very mild exertion -- not unusual for me if I&#39;m &#34;fighting off&#34; something; sore, itchy, red blotch sized between a quarter and a half dollar at vaccination site -- it is still a little tender today and appears a bit bruised; a bit sinus headache-y for three days, especially when I bent down to tie my shoes or something like that - also not that unusual as I often seem to &#34;cleanse&#34; through my sinuses when I have a bug or am fighting something off).    In hindsight, I think the symptoms I had after the first shot, which lasted about 9 hours, may have been fighting off the allergic reaction and not a reaction to the virus vaccine itself.

After the 2nd dose, I had &#34;brain fog&#34;, tireness tireness, and occasional headache for 4 days. The brain fog diminished but the tiredness increased where I have to take 30-60 minutes naps periodically sometimes  2-3 times during the day. Week of 5/3/21, I have diarrhea. I take Tylenol, drink Pedialyte, and increased my water intake. The tiredness interferes with my work and home life.

I was monitored by EMS and given 50 mg IM Benadryl. After 30 - 40 min. symptoms cleared.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen all night and all day and could not get relief.  I missed a day of work because of this. I am still with fever as of 5:55 pm and the body aches and migraine. This was not explained to me. I feel like I did when I had Corona on the worst days. I am really praying that this ends so that I can go back to work tomorrow.   I thought that someone was supposed to call and check on us each day....

I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

                                                Started with itching and rash at injection site. Went away in 2 days. Next day palm of hands and soles of feet became very itchy. Then progressed to whole body itching. Unable to sleep for two nights. Went to urgent care next morning. Was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg. Itching went away that night and was able to sleep. Next day bilateral hands had numbness and tingling and general dizziness so stopped taking hydroxyzine. Went to family practitioner and was prescribed methylprednisolone dose pack. After starting steroids, by 2nd day (today - 1-21-21), hands continued n/t. Bilateral feet developed n/t. Dizziness continues when standing but goes away when sitting. Balance and gait are unsteady. Difficulty walking from weakness, balance issues, and dizziness.

On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right. I still feel fatigued and I have a full feeling around the area of my right upper abdomen ( liver), I dont have a gallbladder. Otherwise, I am OK. Just wondering about the 2nd dose. Lymph node still slightly swollen above clavicle.

                                                About 9PM after the receiving the vaccine I started had riggers which lasted for about an hour. I couldn&#39;t reach for my phone or call for help. I either passed out or fell asleep. Around 1AM I woke up and checked my temperature 102.7.  Some point after I took some Tylenol but don&#39;t remember when. I finally had to call for help from my family in the morning because I was not able to pee or drink. Tuesday was my fever was still 102.7 with taking Tylenol and Advil it would just go back up.  Tuesday I had Riggers again about 5:30 it only lasted 3-5 minutes. Wednesday my fever went down to 101.4-101.5. Have had difficulty swallowing when the fever is high, did not feel as if I had a allergic reaction or that my throat was sore it was just hard to swallow.  I have a weird bruise on my arm I have clue where I got it. I didn&#39;t urinate for 9 hours. Headache. Pulse OX was at 93-94 for Monday and Tuesday but then it came it up 95-98 yesterday.  As of today I still pretty weak no fever when I woke up.

                                                Awoke at 11pm from a sound sleep feeling unusual but unable to identify anything specific. Checked my O2 saturation with my pulse ox and was 76% with a heart rate of 122.  Used my rescue albuterol inhaler which I haven&#39;t used since October (Fall and Spring are my typical times when I need albuterol inhaler and then not regular use.) Waited 15 mins with no change.  Took a nebulizer treatment of albuterol.  After 30 minutes was getting O2 saturations in the 80&#39;s. With deep breaths after an hour got a reading of 96% but wasn&#39;t consistently staying in the 90&#39;s.  Fell back asleep around midnight and awoke feeling ok.  I did not feel SOB when my saturation was at 76%, but my pulse was elevated to help compensate.

Then 02/01/21 exactly one week later had a strange feeling in my head not a headache not dizzy just felt an unusual feeling in my head of not feeling quite right especially with movement then 2 hours later had a ringing in my ears have no ear infection noting unusual im an RN and would report any other conditions. then  that evening i began feeling itchy at my injection sight but i was just iching it though my clothes and wondered why i&#39;m so itchy on my shoulder I really didn&#39;t think about the shot as it was 7 days later. The itchy feeling continued so I went to the bathroom took my shirt off and saw a rash which i will include pictures of the rash if I could. i was alarmed and concerned about the big rash and the papules sticking up.  It&#39;s now the next day 02/02/21 I still have a big rash on my arm it&#39;s about 6 inches long 3 inches wide red elevated.  I googled it and it said it was the covid arm or something.  I am willing to provide pictures

                                                I had a positive Covid test 10/26/2020 with severe symptoms (every symptoms except SOB)that lasted for 1 month until 11/27/2020.  I received Moderna Covid vaccine on 12/31/202 @ 12:30 pm.in my left deltoid.  Fifteen hours after receiving vaccine, I was awakened from sleep at 3 am with a pounding headache, this headache continued for days eventually shifting to the left side of my face and head with posterior neck spasms and pain. I had generalized mild body aches, and mild fatigue.  2 nights I woke from sleep completely soaked and had to change my clothes- I did not check my temperature ( the same thing occurred with Covid). Post vaccine:  Left Arm very tender initially.  On day 3, 1/2/2021, I developed increased pain,  swelling with a warm ,red rash at the injection site on my left arm.  By day 5 this area had greatly extended in size, warmth and tenderness.  Day 6, the rash on my arm had disappeared and I am able to palpate a small lump with very, very slight tenderness at the injection site. I had a repeat Negative COVID test on 1/5/2021 I am continuing to have a dull sensation of pain on the left side of my face (as of 1/8/21), still with palpable spasms on the left posterior neck. All other symptoms have essentially resolved. I have not contacted allergist- wondering if I should before receiving 2nd Covid vaccine.

                                                initial symptoms started at ~ 8-12 hr post inj on FRI:  fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain (generalized), back pain from sacrum to occiput, through cranium to behind eyes, nausea, loose stools, exhaustion, arm swelling (6&#34; diameter) with bandaid indented becoming hard (feeling a little like cellulitis).  routinely measure pO2 and body temp--both spiked; resp rate went from normal pattern of 10-12 to 25; night time HR went from low 60&#39;s to the 100&#39;s; pO2 went from 96-98 to 89-91 (Innovo PulseOx)Treated with sleep (slept from 8PM night of shot until 48 hours after the shot), fluids, hot water bottles, arnica (I can&#39;t take NSAIDS), vit C, zinc megadoses;  by ~36 hours post injection I started wheezing and coughing deeply but non productive, both nasal passages were/are open, feels as though phlegm is stuck at bronchi.  By 48 hours, I was feeling better except chest, ribs, head, and neck and was experiencing 1-3&#34; episodes of spasmodic coughing, wheezing, SOB; Occurred every 20-30 minutes and leaving me physically exhausted.  Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

The next day I noticed increased pain and when I checked my arm I noticed a red circle around the injection site in upper left arm about the size of a silver dollar.  It feels hard underneath.  That evening the pain increased and during night, sleep interrupted due to pain.  Next day I experienced pain all day and in late afternoon, site began to itch.  Red circle was somewhat larger.  By the following night, the  pain decreased and itching was minor.  Today, redness is still there although faded and not as large.  Pain and itching has also decreased.

                                                My arm had minor itching for the first several days, but on Wednesday (Feb 7, 2021) after the vaccination (Feb 2, )2021, the itching intensified and was waking me up at night.  I put some anti-itch cream on it and it would quit itching for a few hours.  By Thursday, the itching was waking me up at night and by Friday afternoon, I had a half-dollar sized welt around the injection site that was very red, hard, swollen and feverish.  We weren&#39;t in school Friday, so I didn&#39;t talk to our school nurse, and today is the first day back from snow days and she advised me to fill out this report. The site is no longer bright red or itching, but you can still see the faint outline of where the swelling was.

It has been worse at night or when my leg is straight; a little of same in right leg. Also some tingling in my leg down to my toes, and a few tingling spells on left side of face.  Also stabbing pains? once in top of left foot &amp; once in side of left leg. Treatment: ice packs and heating pad;  a few doses of naproxen &amp; acetaminophen which didn?t really help.  It has been 2 weeks since my 2nd vaccination &amp; I am still experiencing these side effects although they have lessened.

                                                I developed chills/shivering in the evening of the vaccination (2/19/21) but was not alarmed, just tried to stay warm.  I ate normally.   I awakened in the night with extreme chills and was shaking most of the night, unable to get warm.  I felt feverish and had body aches as well as nausea.  I threw up what I could to alleviate the feeling of nausea, about 2 a.m.   I slept restlessly until 9:00 am, then tried to take a hot shower.  Though the chills were gone, I felt weak and listless and went back to bed shortly after showering.  I slept for about 4 hours.  I had little/no appetite for most of the day after the vaccine.  By the second day I still had a headache but felt better, albeit weak.   I took Ibuprofen for the body/headaches with minimal success.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

                                                Following my second dose of Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on 2/13/21 I experienced a significant reaction to the second dose: My temperature rose to 102 with headache and arthralgia throughout body that prevented sleep. I was in bed for more than 24 hours due to lightheaded/dizzy/nausea when standing. I fell once when getting back into bed due to loss of balance. Severe symptoms started 15 hours after receiving the dose and lasted approximately 36 hours post dose when my temperature then returned to normal. The next 1-2 days, while I no longer had a fever and symptoms were improved. I was still fatigued and did not feel fully recovered. Treatment during the severe symptoms included rest, icepack to head, Tylenol or Ibuprofen slightly decreased temperature for a brief periods. I informed my physician&#39;s office Dr, of the above reaction and was told to file a VAERS report.

I could not even hold water down and just kept throwing up and having diarrhea until after 8:00 am Thursday morning.  I had chills so bad to where I was shaking and my fever went up to 103 F.  I was in bed all day and could not go back to work on Friday due to still having high fever.  By Friday evening, my fever finally broke; however, my started getting red and swollen.  It just kept getting redder in a larger area.  It is very red today and this is five (5) days after the shot.

                                                A 63-year-old female with a medical history of Hashimoto?s Disease, on Levothyroxine 88 micrograms (4 days per week) and 100 micrograms (3 days per week), presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of acute onset of severe, debilitating, fatigue, weakness, anorexia and malaise. She had no clear precipitating events, stated that she was in her usual states of health, active, working as an optometrist at a University hospital. Stated that 1 week before symptom oncer she had her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Stated that 24hrs later her symptoms started associated with low grade subjective fever, however her fever disappeared, and she persisted with severe fatigue. She was unable to do her regular activities of daily living and was hoping her symptoms would resolve but upon persistence and given the severity of her complains she presented to evaluation. She denied recently starting any new medications/supplements, or recent change in her levothyroxine dose. There were no headaches, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, recent infectious illness or sick contacts. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s Disease over 10 years prior and had been on the same dose for more than 2 years.   VS were stable and within normal limits, physical exam was only remarkable for weakness on 4 extremities 4/5, lethargy, bradylalia, bilateral ptosis, no focal neurologic deficits, sensation intact. Laboratory workup revealed normal Hb 14.8, normal renal and kidney function, normal cortisol level, TSH normal 3.7, normal FT4: 1.2, normal CPK, negative tox screen. ESR and CRP were performed, and both were found to be elevated ESR 74, CRP 28, at that moment we decided to do immunologic workup showing high titers of ANA &gt;1:320 with a nuclear speckled pattern, and a positive rheumatoid factor 60. At this point a full rheumatologic panel was performed which was negative for anti-Ach receptor Abs, negative anti-CCP, anti- dsDNA, anti-smith, negative anti-Jo1, anti-RNP, negative anti-TPO, negative anti-SCL70, normal C4 and C3 however elevated total CH50 &gt; 60, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Her symptoms of severe fatigue persisted throughout her admission and it was decided to give her a course of prednisone 40mg for 5 days and follow up as outpatient with a Rheumatologist. Repeat workup 2 weeks after discharge showed still elevated ESR at 72, high CRP 17, rheum factor elevated again at 67.  At this point no clear cause was identified as she did not have any symptoms of Sjogren or anything else other than severe persisting fatigue.  Another course of steroids was given and 1 month later she stated that she was much improved and was able to go back to work. Stated that she would not take her second covid MODERNA vaccine dose due to fear of recurrence of symptoms. It appeared that this vaccine triggered a severe inflammatory and autoimmune reaction in this patient with history of Hashimoto?s disease. The association between MODERNA vaccine and development of autoimmunity and inflammatory reaction needs to be assessed.

Was woken up at 1AM  by wide spread discomfort spots in entire body..sort of flu?ish, but with several ?heavy?/intense/crampy areas of pain ALL in my back &amp; various muscle groups in the legs. Took OTC pain reliever and applied more topicals. Noticed I kept having chills, but no fever through out the restless, painful night. This continued ALL weekend...at one point I felt I was at a 8-9 level, in tears, even after taking many OTC antiflammitories (that I normally avoid to protect my long term health)and then with some old muscle relaxer (skelatin) &amp; pain (tramadol) ?scripts that I dug up. My left arm was also very swollen, rashy red &amp; hot. By that Monday (2/15), I was a bit better &amp; was able to stop the ?Scripts &amp; drive myself to my pain specialist for my monthly appt? Dr. was surprised to find so much stiffness/inflammation in my body and worried about my arm.  She was able to treat it and my poor body and I felt a bit more doable for a couple of days....but my back always stayed very stressed/strained! It eventually went out on me ??and I have remained in terrible pain for 4 weeks now?with ~20 Trigger spots all over body?bizarre!!!M

I&#39;ve been through this many times before, so took 25 mg  Hydroxyzine HCL, sat in a very hot tub, and went back to bed.   Next day  feverish, which is likely the shot.  Total lack of focus, ability to function was likely the Atarax.  (Hate the stuff, but it works.). 2nd day:  feverish, achy joints, and some ability to focus, but overall not a productive day.   I went into this shot with a completely clean diet of things I know I can tolerate, exercise, lots of liquids.  I will add acupuncture before and after the next shot.

After 1 episode of nausea,  I started experiencing more than mild muscle cramps.  Could not lay on either side.  Darkened room because light/ sound was adding to already severe headache. Used cold washcloths on forehead.  Was having trouble trying to walk, use restroom, frequent urination but could only sip water. Over the next 24 hours...just slept and used bathroom.  Severe muscle cramps, chills, fever, headaches.   Called my Dr.&#39;s nurse-she advised to hydrate and to go to ER if needed.  24 hours later, I realized I would be okay...but took me another 24-36 hours to feel 80% normal.  Lost 8LBs. during 48 hours.  Experienced extreme dreams/delusions.

                                                Around 3:30pm the day after injection I felt queazy with  stomach tightness.  Tested blood sugar.  It was 78.--technically not dangerously low but low for me.  Drank a non-diet Sprite.  Physical discomfort went away.  Felt tired.  Fell asleep for 2-3 hours.  After officially going to bed I woke up approx 2:30am feeling light-headed and shakey which is typical reaction when my blood sugar is too low.  Tested blood sugar.  It was 54.  Ate 7 life saver candies and went back to bed.  The next day (second day after injection) around 3:30pm felt hot which is  another typical reaction when my blood sugar is low.  Didn&#39;t test blood sugar but ate 7 life saver candies.  Then I felt better and continued on with my day.

                                                March 3rd I had chills for about 4-6 hours.  My arm was sore for 3 days.  March 4th, I had a headache &amp; felt like I had a head cold with sneezing and stuffy nose.  My right ear was itching.  I had bouts of chills that lasted 4-6 hours that day as well.  March 5th  I had another bout of chills that lasted about 4-6 hours.  On March 6th, I had intense fatigue and slept the entire day and night.  Then on March 15th, I broke out in a big rash on my left arm where the 1st vaccine was given and around my stomach.  My arm was very sore, was hot to the touch and very hard. On March 16th, it was still very red, super itchy and hot to the touch.  My doctor told me to take antihistamines and Advil.  She never actually saw me nor looked at my arm.  She stated it was &#34;normal&#34; and I should have the 2nd vaccine.  However, today my arm is the same or slightly worse.  There is less itching, likely from the antihistamines and cortisone cream.  My friend told me I should report this and should reconsider getting the second dose, given my history of severe reactions.

Rash spread to an area of approximately 5? wide and 4? high and is swollen hot, itchy and uncomfortable and persists today, 10 days after vaccination. At the same time as the rash appeared I began to have sleepless nights, waking 2 hours after going to sleep every night and spending the rest of the night waking every hour. I had no symptoms, apart from a sore arm, until the 6 day point.

                                                I was really nervous about getting the vaccine.  I received the shot at 3:40pm and waited at the site for 15 minutes,  and I was feeling good, so I went home.  I had dinner around 7:00pm.  It was around 8:30pm when  I was standing at the kitchen sink  doing the dishes and I felt a wave wash over me and the rapid heart beat started.  I immediately took Metoprolol since I usually take it around 9:00pm, and my heart rate went down some what. My heart beat is usually around 72.  I didn&#39;t have my fit bit on, but I put it on after I took the medication and it was around 124, but I know it was much higher on the onset.  It only lasted about 1 or 2 minutes.  My heart beat was jumping around after that, I was scared, nervous, so I took a Xanax around 11:00pm.  I slept through the night and had a normal heart beat in the morning.

Body aches, headache.  It was over by Sunday late in the day.  I then got a second reaction on Thursday March 18, 2021.  I left work at 10:30am with a fever starting. I got a 103 degree fever on Thursday and Friday.  Had all the same symptoms, Headache, body aches, joint pain, high fever.  Saturday I went to urgent care to rule out anything else.  He said it was probably from the vaccine.  Fever was finally starting to get lower and I felt ok on Sunday morning but the fever came back to 101.4 by the afternoon.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 04 Mar 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Mar 2021, approximately 2 days after receiving vaccine, the patient developed body aches, fever and hallucinating. On 07 Mar 2021, the patient tested positive for covid 19.  Treatment information was not reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, the mRNA-1723 does not contain virus capable of causing infection and with the occurrence of SAR-COV-2 test positive after vaccination, is unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

I drove to work the next day but my boss sent me home because I was the same. My eyes feel like they are flickering and are in pain. I feel like its a nerve in my eyes that are messing with me and are very painful. I am afraid to take the second shot.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).    On 12-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMORRHAGE (Bled down her leg), HAEMATOMA (Hematoma on lower leg), FEELING ABNORMAL (Creepy) and RASH (Rash on legs, hands, wrists, fingers). At the time of the report, HAEMORRHAGE (Bled down her leg), HAEMATOMA (Hematoma on lower leg), FEELING ABNORMAL (Creepy) and RASH (Rash on legs, hands, wrists, fingers) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-059458 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62-year-old female with a serious unexpected event of hemorrhage, and nonserious unexpected hematoma, feeling abnormal and expected rash. Event onset with unknown latency after first dose mRNA-1273. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

                                                3 days after the injection, I was fatigued, and my joints in my arms and legs were sore.  My arms felt so heavy I felt it was an effort to lift them.   This was identical to the way I felt after my first vaccine on 3/11/21.  However, I developed an additional symptom of pain in my right knee.  It became swollen, warm, and there was pain on the backside of the knee as well as the kneecap area.  This became so severe that I could not put any weight on this knee on Sunday afternoon ( 3 full days after shot).  I know I didn&#39;t injure the knee because on Saturday we drove  and I was just in the car for 2 days.  It hurt to extend the knee but felt better to elevate it.   A knee brace was not helpful.  IThe pain woke me up almost every night for the last 3 weeks.  Ibuprofen barely helps.  For a couple of days last week, the knee would crack with every step.  This was painful, so I limited walking.  I have been staying off of this leg ever since and am waiting for an appointment with an orthopedist on the 20th.    It is just starting to feel better.  It is still warm but yesterday I finally saw the kneecap peek out.  I am not certain this is from the vaccine and i can only find one journal article describing a &#34;flare up&#34; of rheumatoid arthritis following the shot.  I do not have arthritis (yet) so the article was not helpful.  I have had bursitis in my hip twice but not for over 10 years.  I am getting an Xray tomorrow.

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

                                                After receiving my shot on Friday, my arm began to get sore, my ears felt like they were on fire.  I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

                                                Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021 I felt a little strange.  Just not myself. A little dizzy.  Went to work overnight.  Got up at 5 am Friday, Jan 8, 2021.  Still felt odd.  Dizzy. Had to think before I did anything. I stood up from the bed and sat back down again as if I was dizzy and confused.  Drove myself home from work, fed the cats and went right to bed.  I felt very fatigued, had developed a monster headache.  Was dizzy, had chills, body aches, nausea.  I brought  water bottle over to the bed with me but after laying down just could not get myself up to get a drink.  Felt very fatigued.   Slept until 2 pm.  Took my temperature.  It was 101.5.  Had no energy, ate no food, took no meds, just went back to sleep.  Still nauseous, had headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Woke up at 5:00 pm to feed cats.  That?s all I did, and go to the bathroom.  Took my temperature again.  It was 100.9.  Still felt awful:  nauseous, headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Seemed like I could  not get warm.  Stayed in bed and slept.  Saturday, Jan.  9, 2021 I woke up around 7:30 to go to the bathroom.  I fed the cats also.  Still dizzy, moving slow.  My headache was gone, but still felt unsteady.  After feeding the cats,  I went back to bed.  Slept until 12:30 that afternoon.

Within 2 hours, I could not continue to work and went home. Took motrin at home and rested.  The following morning  the headache was mild but the injection site was very painful. No reddness or swelling, not firm but extremely tender to touch. Pain at injection site was present for 2 days then resolved slowly..

Felt swollen, but dont think it was, burning sensation on lateral borders and tip of tongue,extremely dry mouth.  Felt as though it had also been burned, and had a few white spots on tip, reddened borders on lateral aspects also, very scallopededges. Note I do have a fissured tongue but this reaction was unlike any I had ever had from eating certain foods that trigger any tongue response, and had not eaten anything night before to trigger this. Lasted a few days and progressively felt normal after 3-4 days.

Then felt &#34;odd&#34;, BP was 92/47. drank 8 ounces fluid, BP slightly increased then dropped again. Felt very faint chest pain, about 8-9 deep &amp; sharp, but resolved quickly. Returned to work. Next day at 32 hours exactly, arm injection site felt slightly achy , return of off feeling. Headaches off and on.  On day 3 fatigue began, and intense injection site sharp pains which woke me at night although not apparent in day.   Over next several days, intense site pain continued to wake me in middle of night, very painful.  On day 7, began to feel better, but then woke that night with extremely intense pain at site. Today is day 8, I found 2 red swollen, thickened and hard, pear shaped areas 4cm x 10cm; smaller one at site and a second larger area below that, area red and warm to touch indicating a cellulitis was developing.  Call to primary doctor and CDC, instructed to complete this. Now concerned about whether to obtain vaccine #2.

                                                About 14 hours after vaccination, I had a (really bad) pulsating headache in a band around my head, body aches (hip flexors, shoulders, back, neck), chills, fever/sweats, and nausea/vomiting (threw up twice, total, about an hour or two apart after not eating for 10 hours - small amount of liquid came up). The nausea/vomiting went away about 4 hours after onset while the other symptoms remained for an additional 42 hours. I also had sinus/eye pressure that began about 22 hours after vaccination and ended with the other symptoms. Could not sleep for the duration because of headache. Very tired/sleepy about 62 hours after injection and was able to nap since headache went away. I still have soreness at injection site about 72 hours after injection.  I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn&#39;t want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days. The next worst was the nausea/vomiting, because, well, nausea/vomiting, and especially because there was nothing to bring up. And, unlike vomiting from bad food or something, you don&#39;t really feel better afterward, just still nauseated. The other symptoms were more bearable. Did not call or see doctor because I had read about these possible side effects and didn&#39;t think there was anything the doctor could do to alleviate them.

On Saturday she felt mildly achy and had a headache and stayed in bed.  Sunday her heart was flip-flopping with palpitations.  She noticed new dyspnea on exertion with just a short distance as well as feeling panicky.  On Monday she went to work and continued to have the same symptoms.  Two colleagues were vaccinated at the same time she was also reported the same symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea and new onset anxiety.  Yesterday the symptoms were even worse, &#34;really bad&#39;.  Her vital signs were checked at work and were all normal.    Today she is not feeling as bad but still feels very anxious.  She woke up with a headache again.  She is taking ibuprofen for the HA which helps.

I took Tylenol along with my regular medications on Friday night.  During the night I had trouble moving, because my body hurt so much and I had to keep peeing, which made it worse because I was having issues with moving, my eyes felt like they were bulging out of my head and I was very cold, so I did not want to get from under the covers.  All day Saturday, I was in the bed sleeping.  My daughter was worried that I was dying and wanted to take me to the hospital, but I told her it was the medicine working.  I was sick until around 3 or 4 p.m. on Saturday, when I could feel a little difference in the way I was feeling.  Sunday morning, I felt better, got up and went to the grocery store and came back in for the day,  My head felt a little fuzzy intermittently during the day, but I did not do much and felt better.

                                                I was woken up from sleep at 11:30 with swelling of my tongue.  It was getting hard to breath, so I got ice and sucked on it for awhile, then I put a cold cloth on my face, tried to relax and the swelling seemed ok.  I stayed up all night because I was afraid that it would get worse, At about 9:30a.m. it seemed to be getting back to normal with just a little swelling in the back of my tongue.  I felt terrible for the next three days and still don&#39;t feel great. Sore joints, got chills, headache.  I am not going in for the second shot.

PCP; She gave me medicine to get sugar down;  Jarviance 1/21 Blood sugar went up to 495; went to ER.Opthamologist;  He told me nothing he could do for me. He told me I had vision reversed due to sugar being so high. He told me he couldn&#39;t give me any glasses as when sugar decreases, the vision will go back to normal.

I sat down to tie my shoe and noted Pitting &#43; 3 or 4 edema to BIL Calves.  Redness , warmth in a few areas.  R leg 1&#34; larger than L.  Then  I mentioned it to another nurse and  she said it could be side affect of Norvasc.  I spoke with my PA about it on 2/12 she D&#39;C&#39;d Norvasc and perscribed  Nefidepine 30 mg ER. I have not taken it yet I am monitoring my BP and it is WNL.   The edema less in calves however continues in ankles.  I have gotten MULTIPLE broken capillaries all over my legs.          Long short it has to be a reaction to vaccine.  And it continues almost 2 months after injection.   I can&#39;t wear most of my socks.  It is BAD.

                                                4 days after getting the vaccine feeling extremely tired in the afternoon and like I was zoning out, and have had that feeling when my blood pressure has spiked before, but this was even worse--could barely keep my eyes open and felt weird, so measured my BP, and it initially read 190/151 which could not be right, but I know it was high.  I took it again a little while after, and it was down to 140/90, but usually is not that high when I&#39;ve taken my full medication in the morning, which I did.  I then took my Spironoloactone.  BP was high for about an hour and then came down.  Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the vaccine, but I haven&#39;t had it spike in quite a while, especially if I have taken my full amount of Losartan (which is 50mg), and while it may not have been 190, I know it was higher than it&#39;s ever spiked because I felt worse, and I can always feel when my BP goes up.  (There are days when my BP is too low to take the full pill, so I take half, but this day, I had taken the full pill.)  So, as I said, not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine or not, but was the worst I felt during a BP spike and lasted longer than ever did as well, but then came down without having to take any more medication except the Spironolactone, but it had come down a bit before that kicked in.

There were bumps resembling insect bites or poison ivy on elbow and red area, Botches of red spread up right arm to head, causing itchiness. Next day, the blotches were gone, but the redness and bumps on elbow remained. Two days later, the bumps, itchines and redness remain on the elbow, and some bruising has appeared. The shot was administered in the upper right arm. Not sure if this attributable to the vaccine, but there&#39;s nothing else that has changed.

                                                Felt fine for first 36 hours, then the typical &#34;viral prodrome&#34; feelings of fuzziness with a low grade temp of 99.9 and generalized malaise overnight.  Felt fine on day 3 post-injection. Starting that evening of 3/5/21 I noted sharp pains of phyarngitis (like Strep), but ONLY on the RIGHT side.  When I woke the next morning,  very painful to swallow, very tender nodes only in the Right neck that were somewhat enlarged.  The pain was strictly located to the RIGHT side of my neck and throat.  No axillary nodes or tenderness.  Today my symptoms persist - I find that I wake up after 4 hours of lying supine due to soreness in Right neck and increased fullness in soft tissues.

                                                Patient called via telephone at 4:53 p.m. on 2/26/2021. Patient reports that she was in for a 3:40 Covid-19 (Moderna) 1st dose shot appt.   She waited her allotted 15 minutes post vaccine before leaving. Patient denied ever having any reaction  to anything or vaccine in the past. Patient reports that once she was on her way home she started to experience nausea while driving home.  She also started to experience a weird kind of numb feeling that in time moved down in to her left arm, up her to the left side of her neck, jaw and eye. She felt like her eyelid might be drooping but she looked in the mirror and it wasn&#39;t.  She explained it as a &#34;novacaine feeling&#34; before it is fully numb.  &#34;It starts in a spot then spread.&#34;  &#34;Weird sensation, like going to the dentist.  Patient reported that she also has &#34;weird skin&#34; on her arm so can&#39;t really tell if there is a local rash.  Patient questioned if she can take Bendedryl and this PHN confirms that she can do that. PHN confirms that patient is not home alone and encouraged patient to follow up if she felt the need if her symptoms did not resolve or continue to spread or worsen.  Patient reports understanding of this.       1/26/2021: 6:30 p.m.  call update from patient.  This PHN called patient back and patient reports that she is lying low.  She took some Bendryl and it helped some. Patient continues to have a little bit of numbness and it did go in to her left teeth a little bit but the numb feeling isn&#39;t as bad as it    was.  PHN recommended that patient try to verify with her doctor before dose 2  of what happened and verify that it is okay to get her 2nd dose. PHN also informs patient that the is diphenhydramine (&#34;Benedryl&#34;) on site that we can give her if needed when she is here for her 2nd dose.  PHN also recommends that if she comes in for her 2nd dose she would wait for 30 minutes post vaccination vs. the typical 15 minutes. 3/9/2021 telephone update from patient.   Patient contacted this PHN  to inform that she has had continued issues post Covid-19 vaccination.  Patient reports that she continues to have some numbness in the left side of her face and her BP continues to fluctuate up and down ranging from 182-90 to 142/?.  She has been in to doctor 2 times and has 1 more appointment scheduled.  She also is considering doing a neuro consult.  She did have testing done that ruled out a stroke.  Patient is unsure if she wants to follow through with  her 2nd.  PHN did not recommend patient getting her 2nd dose but encouraged her to have this discussion with her primary care provider

After I felt better I ate shrimp on 2-13 and 2-17 and had a reaction to the shrimp on 2-17 which required a doctor visit and complete bloodwork analysis which showed allergy to shrimp and a high titer which could be an auto immune disorder.  Since then I have logged foods and have determined I have  reactions when something has MSG or Maltodextrin.  I have dry back of my throat, a feeling that I have a lump in my throat,  eyes seem a little dry,  the headache has not gone away.  Pressure on the top of my head and my forehead.  Tingling and on fire in hands wrists, forearms, shins and ankles.  I have an appointment with a Rheumatologist on March 30.

                                                Modern Vaccine I felt a little nervous but I?m not afraid of vaccines. Arm hurt, got home was more shaken inside. Took Ibprophen for pain. I continued to feel hyper, then tired, repeatedly all day long. At some point I remember feeling like my breathing was way too fast. The nervousness became fretfulness. At bedtime, I took my normal medicine and 3 mg of Melatonin as usual. I could not stay rested. My body would do one jerk and wake me. I finally got up to read and took .025 mg of Clazonapem . I have that for flying, etc.  Today, March 11, 2021 I awoke at 6:30 am feeling much better but then as the day has continued I am out of sorts. Everything is very difficult to think about doing. My brain is getting stopped from simple writing ABC?s on index cards. Questions are overwhelming me. I?m not sure if I should even consider the second vaccine. This is very unsettling as I am normally very functioning as  a teacher, artist, homemaker. Caring on a conversation is troubling.

At 10 o?clock pm on that same day I had a fever of  101 Fahrenheit. That fever of 101  lasted for 31 hours. In addition to the fever, I had severe chills, severe body aches, and injection site reaction of swelling and throbbing pain. I was on able to perform normal daily duties and was unable to get out of bed for more than using the toilet. I was also exhausted and slept for the majority of the 31 hours whilst having the fever. I was unable to function normally until mid afternoon on 3/11/2021. Truthfully, this was an horrific experience.

                                                Around 12 noon, approximately 20 hours after receiving second dose of Moderna Covid 19 vaccine I started feeling lightheaded, was unable to concentrate and felt like I was going to pass out, leg muscles became achy and rubbery feeling.  Sat down and put my head down to avoid collapsing.  Sat for about 15 minutes like this and became very warm and began sweating profusely.  Felt nauseous and had dry heaves.  Stood up and put my head down on our sink. (I was at work at the time as a retail pharmacist)  Stayed in this position about another 10 minutes.  Finally my head felt like it was starting to clear so I stood up and was able to walk around the department.  Went back to my workstation and was able to concentrate but then felt very chilled to the point where I started shaking.  This lasted about 20 minutes.  Shaking gradually stopped but then I felt very tired.  Was able to finish my shift 2 hours later, was able to drive home but felt very tired and was having muscle pain in my lower legs (thighs to ankles) and developed a mild headache.  Took one  Aleve (naproxen sodium) tablet around 4pm that afternoon.  Started feeling somewhat &#34;normal&#34; later in the evening around 8pm.  Woke up Sunday 3/14/21 and felt fine.

                                                The same night after getting my second dose, I woke up about 3:00 AM to go to the bathroom.  I couldn?t sit up.  So I slid down to the floor and tried to get up using my arms to push myself up but I couldn?t. It was like I was paralyzed.  I had to call to my husband who was in another room to pick me up.  I wet myself. Had absolutely no control.  He literally had to pick me up amd practically carry me to bathroom using his legs and kinda dragging me.  No leg muscles working and arms barely.  Then he had to pick me up off toilet and drag me back to bed using his legs.  I took a Tylenol and went back to bed and in the morning muscles worked and I could walk again.  So I never did call the dr because side effect went away but thought I should report it to you because I never heard of this happening.  Second day (yesterday) I was just tired and kinda weak and not very hungry, little nauseous but today, knock wood, seem back to normal.

Noticed eyesight blurred. Pharmacist told me my chest &amp; face were bright red. I felt slightly nauseous &amp; my mouth tasted like penny&#39;s. Pharmacist administered antihistamine. By this time I had a bad headache &amp; feeling of pressure in chest &amp; head. I was made to sit in lobby &amp; wait 30 min. I continued feeling strangely unwell for 8 days. My b.p. went up &amp; I felt anxious &amp; exhausted. Arm hurt. No temp. On day 3 ( I believe..or day 4) arm became even more painful &amp; A round rash appeared. My chest &amp; neck were also red again . I took pictures of my arm, chest &amp; neck.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.     On 03 Mar 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Mar 2021, the patient experienced severe diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort. At 4 AM she had lost consciousness and fell after urinating and hit her head on the curb of the shower. Her husband found her and when he saw her, she was cold, clammy and very sweaty. Her husband reported that the patient had low blood pressure that caused syncope and caused her to fall. The patient was in a semi-delirious state and was confused, tremulous. The cramps were intermittent for 1-2 hours. The patient was in a borderline shock or in shock as she was very dizzy when she stood up. The events were resolved after four hours. On the next day her temperature was at 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, loss of consciousness, fall, cold sweats, hyperhidrosis, hypotension, syncope, confusional state, tremors, muscle spasms, shock and dizziness were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

                                                Seizure; Neurologically confused; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 63-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and  experienced a seizure and was neurologically confused (confusional state).  The patient&#39;s current conditions included epilepsy. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 26-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22-FEB-2021, right before the patient was supposed to get the second dose of vaccine, she had a seizure and was hospitalized. The same day, patient was neurologically confused. The patient underwent different unknown tests including computerized tomography. On 24-FEB-2021, the patient was discharged from hospital.   No treatment information was provided by the reporter.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of events, seizure and confusional state were resolved/recovered; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and the prior history of epilepsy, the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

I then experienced pain at the injection site a couple of hours after receiving the injection. Around 10 p m,,. I started having episodes of waking up and having too throw up phlegm. The next day I had a lot of sinus pain and a headache. My left arm continued to hurt, and I noticed I couldn&#39;t lift it sideways all the way to my head. At my shoulder, it would want to turn towards my body. Most of the pain has subsided, but I still am having difficulty lifting my arn,

I felt really bad by the morning, so I took some Ibuprofen. The belly pain was in my left abdomen, which is the area where the pain was when I experienced diverticulitis four years ago. I decided to drink liquids and not eat a lot. I slept off and on all day. On Wednesday, I was still feeling badly, so I started antibiotics. I started to throw up that evening, so I went to the ER. I got some IV fluids and a lot of testing. I was still nauseous for a few days and I eventually got back to normal. I got the 2nd dose and all I experienced was a sore arm and a little fatigue.

                                                On 11 Mar 2021 at 11:00 am (23.5 hours post vaccine) I had a mild headache and significant dizziness. I had to leave my work desk. This lasted for approximately 2 hours and then &#34;lifted&#34; and I went back to work.  At 4:00pm, about 5 hours later (28.5 hours post vaccine) I felt a total lack of concentration, extreme fatigue, and dizziness. I should have left my desk but had work I needed to complete. This episode also lasted for about 2 hours and then I felt pretty normal again. The following day, on 12 Mar 2021, at 5:00 pm (53.5 hours post vaccine) I had what I described to my sister as  crazy dizziness and extreme lethargy. This lasted for 2-3 hours, I was able to go out with my husband to a store, but was not able to drive. I also experience two days where I had a metallic taste in my mouth. It was not overwhelming, and since I&#39;m sensitive to odors and chemicals anyway I just assumed that there was something in my home I was exposed to, even though that had never happened to me before in my home. This probably occurred on day 3 &amp; 4  post vaccine (13 Mar 2021 and 14 Mar 2021) but I did not annotate the details. I am very suspicious this was also related to the vaccine. As I think about my past few days, especially while at work, I think I am having a harder time than normal concentrating, although at times I have perfect clarity and feel normal.

                                                Per patient&#39;s daughter, patient started with headache about an hour after her first Moderna COVID19 vaccine. It turned into a migraine, and she started acting very weak. She was taken to the ER the next morning and presented with mental status changes, weakness, right arm tremor, neck/shoulder pain, and headache. Patient&#39;s symptoms were similar to when she had encephalopathy due to COVID in December 2020. She was transferred to the hospital on 3/12/21 for observation. Several tests were ran but nothing specific was found. The doctors overseeing her care felt she was experiencing a reaction to the COVID vaccine.

It should have been up near the shoulder, but instead the person gave it to me down toward the middle of my arm. I knew something was wrong immediately because it felt so warm and disruptive. The doctor on the scene said it was nothing. Nine days later I went to Urgent Care with swelling, hot-to-the-touch, itchy and a huge knot. The Urgent Care Dr. gave me a five-day prescription for Prednisone and also gave me a prescription for hydroXYzine pamoate, which is an antihistimine.

Light adverse side effects right after the vaccine was administered. Remained under supervision for 45 minutes longer instead of 15 min.

Then loss of smell lasting for 10 min or a bit longer, then tongue tied hard / swollen for 3 hrs and lasting mildly 1 day after. Severe dehydration. Did not monitor heart beat due to severe fatigue. Took blood pressure rising and falling like roller coaster 2x. I stop and learned to relax and sleep throughout the day to calm the nervous system and the slight fever. Other normal aching pains as pre-described side effects. No nausea, vomiting, no rash as of 1 day after and no difficult breathing. Occasional and short loss of smell carried after 1st day.

                                                Hello, i took the Moderna 1/4 and am scheduled for 2nd shot 2/1. I just wanted to pass on some side effects and i did not go on the agency website which i should have to report them. I had a headache off and on the first week. the first day afterward i had a 100 degree fever as well. I never have sleep issues (falling asleep etc) i had insomnia and could not sleep and didnt sleep well for around a week. What i noticed most though is it really affected my stomach and i was awakened with acid reflux several times. the muscles of my stomach were sore like i had been coughing (but hadn&#39;t) and i had no desire for food, only fruit, light watery things. as soon as i eat anything i have stomach pain digesting. Since last weekend i sleep way too much, even if i set the alarm i turn it off and keep sleeping. I try to walk and get out.  when i wake up it seems my stomach has been really active, i have a horrible taste in my mouth and acid reflux liquid in my through.  Just letting you know; and I have the 2nd shot so fingers crossed i&#39;ll come through all of this. Take care as well. Thanks

                                                On January 14th woke up with a headache and extremely tired. Slept on / off most of day. On January 16 woke up feeling great and about 3:30 in the afternoon with no warning extreme dizziness and nausea came over me.  Felt so awful, tried to eat something, vomited immediately.   Felt so horrible, had to go to bed, slept on and off throughout the night.  Woke up Sunday, feeling better, not 100%.  I?m concerned if on January 16th was a reaction because it was two full days after receiving the injection.

                                                On Saturday on the 16th I started itching all over my body and my head, dry mouth and my ears were itching as well. On Sunday I noticed the itching  increased after taking my  levothyroxine. The 18th I noticed the same pattern of itching increasing after taking the levothyroxine the dry mouth as continued. Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

                                                At the time of 1st dose shot (approx. 1pm) on Friday 01/08/2021 slight irritation at injection site. Approximately 12:30-1:00 AM on 01/09/2021 woke up, turned my head and experienced room spinning dizziness for about 2 minutes. Had to remain completely still to stop the room spinning.  For the next 2 days (until the morning of Monday 01/11/2021)  I experienced on and off room spinning dizziness at unpredictable intervals.  Usually didn&#39;t last longer than 2 minutes but had to remain completely still to stop the spinning.   Starting on Monday 01/11/2021 had &#34;normal&#34; dizziness along with some flu like symptoms,  headache, tiredness,  soreness/achiness and extreme soreness and pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine shot. I stayed out of work because of the on-going dizziness. These symptoms continued until Saturday 01/16/2021.  I took an antihistamine on Saturday night and finally woke up Sunday 01/17/2021 with no dizziness.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

That went on for days. I called my doctor and she put me on Metrozal to help with heart rate and BP and that brought that back down again. I&#39;m taking this every day now in addition to my other blood pressure medicine. It has helped.  I had headaches; I had terrible dreams and couldn&#39;t sleep. My eyes turned all dark - like when you need to drink water (underneath eyes). Had a terrible thirst. I drink water constantly.  I had bruising on various parts of my body - legs; arms etc. It&#39;s calmed down with all these symptoms within a couple of weeks.

Next day pt woke up with head congestion and coughing with major drip of mucus going down her throat.  She is also weak and dizzy.  Three days later pt had tingling in upper lip and gum.  Fourth day pt still had congestion and still had the tingling in lips and gums.  Pt spoke w/ PCP on call and was told to rest.  Fifth day pt still had all of the same symptoms and then she had developed a light vibrating sensation on her right side on the inside area around the breast.  Pt had this symptom for the next  2 days.  She went to her Pulmonologist which did not find anything wrong w/ her lungs and thought she may have hurt her back.  Pt started feeling better but is still very weak.  Pt stated about a week later she developed a headache that she could not get rid of.  On 2/8/2021 pt still has headache.  On 2/9/2021 she woke up weak and dizzy and just dont feel well.  Pt is concerned about taking her 2nd vaccine.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA: I got the vaccine at 11 am on 2/15/21. There were not immediate adverse effects.  By 3:00PM, my arm was becoming very sore. By 8:00 PM, my right arm was extremely sore and overall body aches ensued as I began to feel weak. By 9:00 PM, I felt the need to get into bed and had chills, a severe headache and pain over my whole body, accompanied by shooting burning sensations down both arms into my palms and fingers. I had not taken any medication for the discomfort up to this point.  As time went on, my pain became excruciating, I never felt this kind of pain in my entire body. I had pain in areas I never felt pain before like my arms, hands and toes.  I also had extreme pain in the back of my neck, both shoulders, both arms, my hips and knees. The pain was so intense and throbbing, my headache was severe at my temples and I had chills.  I did not take my temp, but I am sure I had a fever, although I was not sweating. I could not sleep at all and finally broke down at 1:30 am and took an Advil.  There was minimal help with the Advil and I slept on and off over the next 4 hours. Throughout today, the headache, chills and pain continued, but slightly less and I was able to take a 2 hour nap.  I think it important to note that I had more of a reaction to the first COVID shot that most others I talked with and felt an ongoing weakness after the first shot over the course of the month.  I understand that some of my symptoms are part of my body&#39;s reaction to building antibodies, but  with the intensity of my reaction, I have to wonder if there is more going on.

Later sometime in the middle of the night, I wasn&#39;t able to fall asleep as if I&#39;d had a stimulant, and had intense arm pain where shot given, some nausea, some intestinal discomfort, intense pain at temples and behind eyes, overall &#34;crappy&#34; feeling.  Sun., Feb 14, 3rd day after shot: Pains/symptoms same as above with the addition of a low grade fever (99.9), chills, fatigue, no appetite. Tylenol didn&#39;t help. Was able to drift in and out of light sleep. Later in the day, fever and majority of symptoms suddenly &#34;left&#34;,  gradually decreasing until I felt fine again by Sunday evening. No issues Monday, Feb. 15.

                                                I started experiencing chills within half an hour after the shot.  The following 24 hours I experienced total insomnia, chills, headache, body ache, shoot pains, extreme weakness, and nausea.  Insomnia lasted 3 nights.  The other side effects began to decrease after 24 hours, but still prominent enough to prevent from actively engage in anything for another 24 hours.  After the third night of insomnia, I thought I had turned the corner.  But I continued to experience headache (I basically never have headache), occasional nights of insomnia (I usually sleep extremely well), and low level of nausea, and fatigue.  Today, 8 days after the shot, after another night of difficulty in sleeping, I woke up with the same headache behind my right eye, nausea, weakness, and fatigue.  This is when I thought to report these side effects.

                                                Headache began early afternoon and gradually the pain increased through the remainder of Friday March 5,2021 and lasted through Saturday, March 6,2021 until about 6 PM where the pain subsided enough that I could function. As the pain intensified, I had throbbing pain in the temples and behind my eyes, the pain worsened even more if I bent forward, like to pick up something from the floor. My neck muscles were extremely tight. I couldn&#39;t concentrate on anything, like reading or working.  I was feeling less than energetic,. Also, my left arm was red, not swollen at the injection site and hurt to touch, not as bad as the 2 days after receiving the vaccine, but I thought it was unusual that my arm was red &amp; sore. This is what made me conclude it was a delayed reaction to the vaccine. I rarely have headaches and if I do  taking 2 Ibuprofen will take care of it. Taking 2 Ibuprofen this time did absolutely nothing to ease the pain.  I did increase to 800 mg of Ibuprofen late Friday and early Saturday which did help, used a cervical heating pad, hot shower to try to ease muscle tension. I was able to sleep and by Saturday evening with home remedies, the pain did subside and by Sunday March 7,2021 I felt back to normal with a slight, slight bit of headache but not much to worry about.

I stayed in bed all day and drank plenty of fluids,  napped  throughout the day, fell asleep early and slept most of the night.  Day three, Monday, I awoke feeling OK, when I walked my dog for about 15 minutes, I got very dizzy and returned to bed for the day.  No other symptoms arose but, the dizziness remained for the entire day.

Stayed in bed and slept a lot. 1 dose of Nyquil Cough to sleep for 2 nights. Felt progressively better and all symptoms just lifted away right at 72 hour mark after shot! I did not see the cough and all the flu like symptoms listed as side effects. So our family started a chat and a cousin&#39;s husband - big strapping police captain had the exact same side effects as me.

It was itchy, and then that&#39;s all she noticed.  Then yesterday, 3/9/21, noticed tenderness going up her neck and around the lump, inward towards the middle of her throat was a little tender.  On the injection site it was a little pink, but today it&#39;s not inflamed, it&#39;s redder and feels warm to touch.  She may have some tenderness in her arm area at the elbow.  She took Advil yesterday and not taken anything today.  She called her doctor and they told her to call us.

As I drove, I started getting a sparkly effect in my vision (for me, this is usually a precursor to migraine), about 2 hours after the injection. After I got home, I started getting a minor headache, about 2.5 hours after injection. I sat for awhile, and the headache did not worsen and the sparkles dissipated. About 9 hours after the injection (and after preparing and eating dinner) I began to feel lightheaded, almost a feeling of inebriation. I quickly prepared for bed and went to sleep. About 2 hours later, I woke up with diarrhea. I continued to wake up twice more, about 2-2.5 hours apart, with diarrhea. I finally slept for about 4 hours and woke up feeling better.

                                                Last part of vaccine sent a tingling feeling down my arm to my middle finger. Once the needle was out it stopped. Came home and iced the area once. 5:15 pm first chills started. Went away after I drank hot tea. Headache started and stayed the rest of the night until next morning. Also at 5:15 started the achy body feeling, my joints hurt. I have a total knee replacement on the right side and it ached. I had a hard time to walk up and down the steps in our house. I was suddenly real tired. Went to bed at 9:00 pm exhausted and feeling nauseated. Slept until 11:15 pm when I woke up to my teeth chattering. Put wool socks and sweater on and extra blanket. Fell back to sleep. Woke up at 7:00 am felt better,  but after being up a short time I felt  off. Took a nap at noon because I became real tired. Slept until 2 that afternoon (now Friday day after injection) and woke up feeling like myself.  Saturday I felt fine. Sunday I woke up to a cold sore on my lip. Tender to  the touch at the injection site but nothing by Sunday.

                                                2/10 1015 AM 10PM I was extremely fatigued. Slight HA. Dizziness/light vertigo. Sore shoulder on left. Symptoms with stomach cramping lasted into 2/11, all day. By 9PM, I had a severe HA, chills, spent most day in bed. My heart was pounding. Couldn&#39;t lay down, HA was throbbing. Temp was 101.5. I contacted my PCM. Advised to rotate between Tylenol and Motrin. The fever did break overnight.  2/12 I was still feeling fatigue, HA. No fever, no chills. Still having vertigo with chest tightness. That had set in on the 2/11. Started my albuterol on 2/11 and lasted till 2/16 with a slight cough.  2/16 Dr was able to see me. She could feel the inflammation in my chest. *Exacerbated the problem because on 2/13 I felt chest tightness and thought it was the asthma, exercises made my symptoms worsen. The acid reflux gave me the sense I was having tight chestness due to the asthma but it was actually due to me exercising on 2/13 which worsened by the 2/15-2/16. I had still had the chest pain, HA Prescribed Advil.

Not able to sleep, comfortably  until the seventh day. Had a stiff neck. I did have a positive Covid result, asymptomatic 1 month before my first vaccine

Drank vitamin C 1000mg.   After 15 minutes I felt better.   About every 15 minutes there would be another wave of the same pains.   Then I would feel better and then another wave.   There were five waves.   After 1 1/2 hours, it stopped and I went home.   Later that night, I was very thirty, couldn&#39;t sleep and my kidneys were sore.   Next morning, I could not raise my arm from the pain.  Every day since, I have had another wave of the same pains once in the morning and then again in the evening.   Each wave lasted 1 to 2 hours.   I would sleep and afterwards felt better.  Saturday March 20th, the wave at night was the worst one and it lasted 3 hours.   The wave today March 21st, the wave was smaller and then I could sleep.   Today my arm is better, I could move it normally.

Along with severe body shaking, chills, body aches and pain, mild headache, earache, sore throat, coughing, and loss of emotional control. Used Tylenol and ice packs for the fever and pain. Took 4 hours to get things tolerable. Early Sunday morning I only had a slight headache, sore throat and earache-which are probably due to my seasonal allergies.

                                                The next day after my shot,  I was debilitated. I was in bed with severe chills, nausea, headache, and a sore arm. my muscles hurt all over. I have  history of migraines so I have nausea medication that I used for the nausea. I took Zofran , Flexural, Ibuprofen, Promethazine, and  fioricet over the course of feeling this way so I could manage the side effects. This lasted for a few days and gradually got better. the arm had a red swollen welt at the injection site and was still sore. by 03/20 I still felt bad. on03/21 I started feeling better, the welt was getting bigger and hotter, I put marks on my arm to see if it would surpass the marks, but the next day it had moved completely to a different area on my arm. it&#39;s a ways away from the injection site. (03/22) I noticed my face from the cheek/smile crease has fluids swelling up on both sides of my face but the left side is definitely worse. my face is very swollen. its itchy because I normally have rosacea. I had skin cancer on my face once that was removed and usually causes some tingling but the swelling is causing more tingling.

                                                No treatments initially. Big chills in the evening of March 20 and difficulty breathing, 100.7 F fever by morning, inability to even sit on March 21 so I stayed mostly in bed, nausea, headache, sore throat, altered taste (things tasted bitter and as chalk), strong body aches. I  understand that the fever was not high, so my extreme weakness and exhaustion were not really related to the fever. Fever subsided by March 22, but numbness on the whole  left side of head and body appeared  for about 2 hours in the evening - unpleasant and scary, but I did not seek intervention. Headache and nausea on March 23 and 24. Total inability to sleep on the night of March 23/24 (stabbing headache and nausea contributed to a lot of anxiety). Finally took Xanax in the morning of March 24, so I finally slept between 7:30 and 10:30am. I am writing this at 3:30 pm on March 24. I am much better compared with March 21, but still with a significant headache and some nausea.   I had Covid-19 in the first half of November. Post-vaccine symptoms were similar to my covid symptoms, but quick. In December I got post-covid a-fib and was diagnosed with heart failure. Improved on medication, awaiting heart ablation in May 2021. I am concerned that with the strong reaction I felt  after the first dose, my reaction after the second dose may be even worse than that on March 21.

                                                She had sudden onset of fatigue, stiffness, joint pains in her shoulders and hips bilaterally, and depression. The pain was worst in the mornings and across the shoulder girdle. These were the most severe symptoms she had ever had and they reduced her to about 50% of her usual capacity. These symptoms started much more suddenly than past joint aches and were persistent without any improvement for two weeks, leading her to seek care on 3/2/2021. This provider checked labs and referred her to specialist. I saw her on 3/17/2021, ordered a few more labs, and prescribed prednisone on 3/22/2021 for suspected polymyalgia rheumatica. She is starting to have less pain, fatigue, and depression as of 3/26/2021.

After the vaccination, I felt fine; no side effects for about 5 hours.  At approximately 4:30pm, I got the chills, body, muscles and back aches, fever - 101.2, sore throat, my eye balls hurt and a sore scalp.  All of these effects came one like a wave. My entire body ached and I felt as though I was run over by a steam roller. I took Tylenol, 500mg at 5:30am and the next day, April 7th at 11:30am and still had a fever. My entire body was in  pain and discomfort and I could barely move and was unable to work for 4 days and laid up on the weekend.  To-date, I am still feeling tired, achy and lethargic.

                                                I sat for 30 mins after the vaccine at the doctors office.  When I got home I started feeling my heart beating and started feeling like my body was raising. After 10 mins I checked my BP 140/90 which is high for me.  I took a BP pill.  It took a couple of hours for it to come down to normal. Went to sleep and woke up BP normal and a slight headache.  My arm was sore lasting about 3 days.

                                                48 hours after the injection I began to notice a sore throat before bedtime on Dec 30, but slept well. The next morning, Dec 31, I had acute allergic symptoms that never start so suddenly.  I was having constant Post-nasal Drip, nasal congestion and beginning of cough due to PND.  That night I had a severe sore throat similar to my typical allergic pattern.  I coughed all night and awoke on the morning of Jan 1st with clear severe onset allergies and could not talk without coughing.  That persisted for 4 days, then my allergist prescribed inhaled steroids BID which reduced the nighttime cough, but I persisted with symptoms for 10 days when they slowly resolved and my sense of well-being returned.  I missed 7 days of work, which is atypical for my allergies when I catch them early.  This was an acute flare of typical allergic symptoms that seems to have been triggered by the timing of the immune change from the vaccine at day #2-3 after the vaccine #1 was given.  I  am worried about getting vaccine #2 in 2 weeks and don&#39;t want to go through another flare up of dialing allergies again.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011L20A) intramurally in the left deltoid bursa for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 02 Jan 2021, the patient reported she had been given the vaccine in the wrong location. The vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle. The patient was also experiencing loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and she also can&#39;t sleep. Treatment information was not provided. Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. The event vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle was considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events loss of range of motion, can&#39;t sleep, and pain at the injection site were considered not recovered/not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of 65 year old female patient who experienced non-serious unexpected events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle for mRNA-1273, lot #  011L20A. The patient experienced loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and can&#39;t sleep. Onset latency was not provided.  De-challenge and re-challenge are not applicable. Based on the information provided the events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle, loss of range of motion and can&#39;t sleep are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 as this is due to product administration error. The event of pain at the injection site is included in the known safety profile of the vaccine, hence a causal association cannot be excluded.

I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

Pain feels muscular and nerve like (similar to when I had shingles).  Pain is not relieved by Lidocaine 1% patch or with Ibuprofen or Tylenol.  I am not sleeping and am in pain all day.

Was 3 inches by two inches. The arm is now back to normal.  .2. Day 8.  Woke at roughly midnight with extreme heat and burning in all toes.  Quite painful.  Very unusual, as I have never experienced anything like this before.  When pain and burning became overwhelming I took Tylenol.  It helped and I was able to sleep.   The next morning the pain and burning were gone but my toes were, and continue to be quite numb, as is the area of my feet that surrounds my toes.  I can&#39;t fully feel my socks, shoes, sheets, etc.  It feel like I have cotton stuffed in my shoes.  It is hard for me to related the level of heat, burning and pain that happened.  I felt like I could melt a block of ice with my feet.  It was severe. I marked &#34;disability or permanent damage&#34; below because I don&#39;t know if the nerves in my feet will return to normal.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

The lump was hot, bright red, and it was the same size as a mosquito bite.  The lump went after 2 days.   I did not do any treatment.  I have been very tired since the injection, and I have to sleep 3-4 hours during the daytime.   I do not normally have to take a nap during the day.   I am still very tired and am sleeping a lot since the injection.   Normally I am very active during the day.

It only lasted a few minutes.   About after an hour of being home, I had an issue swallowing only once.   I don&#39;t know if adverse reaction, or panic attack.  I have my 2nd dose schedule for the beginning of Feb  I will let them know what happened.   Also, quarter size red spot on right arm.   It hurt when touched.   Lasted a couple days.

                                                My arm is swollen, red and warm. It?s been hurting so much I couldn?t lift it. It?s even swollen under my arm. For 48 hours i was exhausted and didn?t eat. My arm is still sore but I?m back to eating. Advil has worked well. The only time it?s hard is trying to go to sleep and get comfortable.

                                                I felt anxious after the shot, but that night felt ok. Morning was another story. I woke up with pain in my muscles from the waist down and found it difficult to walk. My eyes started to hurt. I had blurred vision. Around 2:00 I went by the mirror and saw that my eyes were blood red. I laid down and rested. About 2 hours later I got up the most of the redness was gone but then I had a headache.  The next  morning a persistent cough and the sneezes started.  The headache would return every time that I coughed or sneezed. It was very painful- as if someone hit me with a hammer.  Even though the pain only lasted a few minutes, it hurt a lot. I sneezed and cough a lot. Finally, Sunday morning I was walking better; however, I felt I had the flu. Normally, I would have gone in and got ready for a sub, but I wasn&#39;t able to. I rested on the couch. Then took a 2 hour nap. Finally, I felt better around 6 pm except for the painful headache that returned every time I coughed or sneezed. It has been a week. I thought the worse would be over by now. I guess I will have to go in and talk to my doctor on Monday because the sneezes and coughs are still quite painful. When will it end?

                                                Maybe be completely insignificant...one week after I received the vaccine, my left shoulder in which I received the vaccine started itching and itched for 24-30 hours.  I believe it  itched enough to disturb my sleep moderately.  The next morning I took a single zyrtec and either due to time or the effects of the antihistamine, my shoulder stopped itching.  My shoulder did NOT become red or show a rash. It is probably insignificant and may be normal for the general population but of all the shots I can remember and I receive a flu vaccine every year, I never had my arm itch significantly near the shot date or after.  It  was not a significant event, but I report it just in case this is unusual.

The left muscle in my left side of my neck stiffened.  As we left the area and headed down the street I was getting anaphalactic:  numb jaw, swelling tongue, closed throat, eyes closing, inner cheeks numb - as if I was severely novacained from the dentist.  I was able to breathe ok to  get home hoping it would pass and drank wanter to keep things fluid.  I was there for one hour.  On advice, I went to the ER to get checked out.

My brain felt compromised in it&#39;s thought process struggling to think straight 30 minutes into receiving shot. Eyelids felt so heavy . I struggled to hold my eyes open but could not. Fell into a 3 hour deep sleep. Woke up feeling foggy brained &amp; clumsy.  At 3am the next day my throat felt thick &amp; dry with difficulty swallowing.  Went to ER at 3:30. Was told my tonsils were swollen. I did not have a sore throat.  Dr tested for strepp throat with negative result. I was given a shot of benedryl &amp; an oral Allegra pill. Symptoms began to subside &amp; I was sent home. Nasty headache &amp; wobblyness continued through the day &amp; into the following day. Started feeling better Sunday night

I developed a rash, pain, swelling and heat over injection area that was about 6 inches round. I also began to have ringing in my right ear and pain in the right side of my head. All of the symptoms persisted for over 48 hours and as of now four days later I remain with severe ringing in my right ear.

                                                Vaccinated at 1:20 PM on 1/26/2021. Approximately 15 min later I was in the waiting area, the nurse had been pre-notified to watch me for allergic reaction . In 15 minutes my symptoms were fast heart rate, lips burning, dark red facial flushing, ears flushing, and anterior neck flush, body tremors, a rapid response team notified to evaluate me. I was administered a 25 mg  Benadryl tablet per mouth.  I felt stabilized and chose to go to the ER within the building for further evaluation.  Remaining stabilized, had a 4 hour wait until I was seen by emergency staff. My treatment was Solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and Benadryl 25 mg po. I was placed on a heart monitor and a pulse oximeter to check my oxygen levels the entire time I was in the ER. 4 hours prior to being seen by the ER doctors I had a CBC, a BMP blood work, and an EKG. After medications were administered I was observed approximately 1.5-2 hours. I was discharged with a 5 day medicine regimen to follow. Prednisone 40 mg per day; Pepcid 40 mg per day; Benadryl 25 mg every 6 hours. On 1/27 I chose to take the Benadryl 25 mg only because I had received the Pepcid and Prednisone the previous night late. On the 28th I took the medicine as prescribed but only took Benadryl every 12 hours. I felt Benadryl 4 times a day would not be handled well with my body. On 1/30 I was able to take the Pepcid and Prednisone but had to discontinue the Benadryl due to waking up with a spinning sensation upon opening eyes and a loss of equilibrium upon walking. I completed my medicine regimen on 2/1. Today 2/2 I woke up with symptoms of watery eyes, flushed face, mild facial itching, after drinking one cup of full caffeine coffee developed an increased heart rate and nervousness, was medicated with Benadryl 25 mg po at 10:00 AM along with my blood pressure medicine and potassium. Also at that time my blood pressure was 150/80. Three hours later my blood pressure had come down to 130s/60s but felt extreme weakness and felt the need to lay down and rest with legs elevated.  I continue with my day with increased heart rate with activity, so I have remained inactive for the rest of the day.   Also on 6:00 AM on 1/27 I was awakened with a heart rate In the 160s, I called 911, paramedics came 5 minutes later. On arrival my heart rate had instantly went down to the  112-120 range. The paramedics explained they have been treating COVID patients and have seen this a lot, we discussed going to the hospital but I felt I was stabilized and didn&#39;t need further treatment.   Also upon discharge from ER visit they had me get 2 epi-pens and I now have 2 epi-pens available at home.

                                                Beginning 12 hours after the shot, I started having chills. My upper left arm (the injection site) was also sore which made it hard to sleep. These symptoms continued through the night. The next morning I had severe fatigue and had to call in sick to work. This continued all day and into the next night (36 hours after the shot). Overnight (40 hours after the shot) I had a low-grade headache. After 48 hours most of these symptoms subsided. Right now (54 hours after the injection) my arm is still slightly sore.

                                                I had the shot at 12:30pm.  I went bed about 10pm, and woke up to my right arm having a series of tiny shooting pain tingling (at specific spots, as if it were a pin prick traveling up and down my arm; pinging randomly across the arm). This  was accompanied by an extreme desire to scratch/itch my arm where the pin pricks were being felt. I found myself scratching my arm in my sleep. There didn&#39;t seem to be a discernable rash of any color, but by the next day, i was seeing slight welts at various points along my upper and lower outer arm. I would feel a sharp pin-prick/tingle and instantly would feel the urge to scratch it. The scratching continued -- but not consistently. Sometimes for an hour or two at a time, seemingly coming out of no where. The arm was fine and then I&#39;d wake up or be jolted by the sharp pin prick accompanied by the insane desire to scratch my arm.   These &#39;spells&#39; of tingling and itching have continued until today (one week and one day after getting the #2 Moderna shot.  I have managed this with Benedryl (it worked by addressing the itching somewhat and provided relief from the tingling - it made me sleepy); anti-itch creams (soothed the skin topically), ice (to take the sting/itch sensation away) and calamine lotion (didn&#39;t really work). Tonight (1/8/2021 I cannot sleep. Although the itching and sensations seem to be intermittent, I have woken up the last couple of nights with intense itching and tingling to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep  Usually Benedryl calms everything down, but tonight it isn&#39;t helping at all and I am crawling out of my skin.  I have not gone to my Primary Care Physician, but will call and go in tomorrow.

I was able to go to work on 2/4/2021 but experienced some weird brain fog and fatigue. On 2/5/2021 my arm had a large red ring around injection site and hives below it. I remained fatigued and lack of appetite for 4 days or so.

                                                I felt hot shortly after getting the vaccine.   I do get hot flashes on occasion, so I attributed it to that plus I was a bit anxious.  After the 15 minute wait, I proceeded to my car.  When I removed my mask, I saw that my cheeks and nose were very red.  By the time I arrived home (about 30 minutes after being vaccinated) the redness had gone down considerably.  I did not even know that this was considered an adverse effect until I saw it online a few weeks after my vaccination.

                                                Three days after receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine I developed severe radiating low back and leg pain and inflammation and pain in my right knee .  I also developed a persistent pain in my right hand and thumb along with &#34;trigger finger&#34; type symptoms in my hand where it clenches up and I cant open my hand up without using force. At times the pain is so bad I am unable to walk normally  and also unable to utilize my right hand to open or hold things.  In the 22 days that have passed since the shot the symptoms have not subsided and are effecting my ability to get around and carry my normal activities of daily life.

Lasted about a day. # Midweek,as I  reported. about the wed after receiving  first dose friday AM,  I started having dry mouth and extremely dry lips, and  continuous thirst. Didnt have to drink much, but continued recurring over the course of  one and a half to 2 weeks, until finally disappeared. I was advised by one of my physicians to put real lemon juice on tip of tongue to stimulate the salivary glands.That really helped. did hear that this happened to several other patients.

                                                About 6 PM the day I received the vaccine, the arm started to become extremely sore. It was achy feeling and it radiated down to my wrist. This lasted until Sunday and it started to fade. Today it is just some soreness left at the injection site. I was taking OTC Acetaminophen 500MG between 100 MG for pain. It was difficult to sleep due to the pain. I was also putting cool compresses on it.  The pain worse when I was trying to clean my car and shovel the snow. However the cold compress and stretching did help with some of the pain. I also felt agitated for different periods times after vaccination, I felt like my hormones were out of whack and I wanted to &#34;bite someone&#39;s head off&#34; this lasted for about an 1 hour or so. I also had mild headaches.

                                                Nearly  continuous headache behind the eyes since the evening of vaccine shot (11 days as of current date). Sometimes dull throb, sometimes sharp pain usually on left side (same side as vaccine shot). Sensitivity to light. When pain is sharper causes indigestion and nausea. Pain goes away if I take  ibuprofen, but always returns and persists overnight. I don&#39;t like taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen more than once a day or for continuous days. Acupuncture worked for a short time. Affects my ability to concentrate and work on computer or watch TV. What other natural treatment will help? How much longer will this last?

                                                First, extreme upper arm discomfort after nursing student had difficulty stopping the bleeding.  Then, within 5 minutes, felt somewhat dizzy as pain radiated across shoulder, up spine and neck, into jaw and right ear.  Then, horrible jabbing pain under shoulder blade, followed by a feeling of extreme compression from site of injection to wrist.  Checked every 10 minutes or so by nurses for 50 minutes.  They said that redness first was up arm then down arm.  Once light headedness improved, I left for work (remote teaching from home).  By 3:20, I found it hard to focus, the throbbing under my shoulder and compression feeling of my arm increased with diminished feeling in right hand.  Usually 97.2 temperature but ran low-grade temp of about 99 degrees for 3 to 4 days.  Sleepless night first night with increased pain and discomfort, i.e., no new symptoms but all symptoms increase with difficulty turning neck and head.  Area around injection warm for several days, with swelling first 24 hours, resolving over a few days; still dark black and blue today, 8 days later.

                                                Injection on  Wednesday at 3 PM. No immediate reaction. However, a few hours after the shot my left arm (at the injection site) was sore and swollen.  That evening it was painful and disrupted my sleep. The next morning (Thursday) I was somewhat feverish. By the mid-morning my fever was up to 100.4, and by the late afternoon it was up to 101.4. I felt exhausted -- too exhausted to even write an email. I had chills, backache,  and slept nearly the entire day (~8 hours). Based on this, I would call this day a 4 in terms of severity.   The next day (Friday), my fever had declined to 100.2 but was still elevated, but now I had a backache (lower back), and I was still weak. However, I could get out of bed for about 10 minutes without too much difficulty. I slept for about 5 hours during the day. This may also qualify as a 4.  On Saturday, my fever had declined further to 99.4, and my energy level was somewhat better.  Even so, most of the day was spent in bed, but I slept less during the day than on the previous days (about 3 hours). The main thing that was a problem on Saturday besides being weak was a headache. This is a strange thing because I rarely have had headaches in my life.  This is a pounding in the front of my head, only occurring when going from an upright position into a seated or supine position. Most of the headache disappears in about 30 seconds.  Overall I would say Saturday was a 3 in terms of severity. Today (Sunday) my temperature seems to be normal (98.6) -- though this is a full degree above what is normal for me. However, the headache has become worse -- it was hurting me while sleeping, and woke me up from the discomfort.  I still have the backache, and I am still weak. It&#39;s only 6 AM here so I cannot comment on how the rest of the day will go.

There was no fever or chills but I was cold and could not get warm and just felt lousy. The symptoms appeared consistent with a flu. These side effects began to dissipate slowly the following day (20/26/2021) and were completely resolved by 02/27/2021.

At one point I thought about calling an ambulance but my mind was unable to figure out how to do that.  24 hours after injection: 1) headache, mild body aches and some feeling of skin burning.

                                                Patient received her COVID-19 Moderna vaccine this afternoon.  She then started &#34;feeling strange&#34; a few minutes later, requesting fresh air. She was monitored outside for 30 minutes. Her O2sat remained &gt;96%ile the entire time. Her HR remained in 60s-70s. Her initial blood pressure was elevated at 210s/140s and improved to 140s/110s with calming relaxation techniques.  She did have brief jerking episodes of her lower extremities intermittently. They were suppressible. She remained conscious the entire time and maintained good eye contact.  At minute ~20 post-vaccination, she endorsed not remembering why she was there, requesting to stand up. She stood up with support and then sat back down. Repeat BP was elevated to SBP 200s.  Decision was made to continue observation in Urgent Care as her blood pressure was still elevated and she still appeared anxious. She was speaking in full sentences and was drinking water without assistance.  She was placed into wheelchair and brought to Urgent Care. However, during UC triage, she  reportedly informed nursing that she didn&#39;t want to be in the enclosed observation room in UC, that she wanted to go home. Her partner wheeled her outside to the patio. When nursing went to go find her, the patient had eloped.

She asked me if I took blood thinners, I said &#34;No,&#34;  She put gauze on the injection site, held it there and then put a bandage on it.  I told her this has never happened to me before ever when I took any shots in my arm.  She said I would be alright and told me to wait 15 minutes in the parking lot which I did.  That night, I had a slight fever, my arm felt like it was on fire and I had hot and cold chills and couldn&#39;t eat anything or I  felt I would vomit.  I felt the same way the entire next day and just felt  miserable.  I also had problems breathing all day.   I had to use my inhaler every two hours with 3 or 4 puffs.  This went all ALL day and in the evening.  The second day (5th), I felt slightly dizzy and my arm still hurt and noticed a red rash but I could BREATHE finally with no problem!

                                                I was awaken at approx 5:00am the morning  following my 2nd Moderna Covid 19 vaccine with my upper left arm severly aching.  The person who gave me the shot informed that if my arm hurt I could use a cold pack and take aspirin, which I did that morning.  Approx 30 minutes after applying the cold pack, I became extremely cold and my entire body shivering.  I wrapped up in a blanket and drifted in and out of sleep for about 5-6 hours, cold and shivering the entire time.  When getting up to get water or use the restroom, my arms and legs were extremely weak and wobbly.  I almost felt as if my legs would collapse under me when walking.  I took my temperature throughout and it was at a normal level.  Around 11:00am, the cold and shivering subsided but then I began to feel warm.  I continued to take my temperature and it was continually climbing until it reached 103.2 degrees before beginning to reduce down.  My weakness and wobbleness also continued and I had a severe headache. I also vomited 1 time.   At approx 7:00pm, my temperature was back to normal and I began feeling a lot better.  I have had no further symptoms since then.

The next day,  Friday, 3/5/21,  at about 10:00am, I experienced chills and muscle fatigue that lasted until  bedtime about 11:00pm.  Life returned to normal until yesterday, 3/8/21,  when, beginning around 11:00pm and lasting until 11:00pm bedtime,  I experience body chills similar to 3/5/21.  Today,  Tuesday,  3/9/21, when I awoke at 6:00pm, my heart rate was noticeably elevated but stabilized within 15 minutes.  And about 10:55am, as I was focusing on work (reviewing/editing an electronic document), I  had an unusual blurry vision and mentally spacious experience that lasted for less than 2 minutes but required me to halt work and collect my thoughts. These experiences are completely new to me.

I had fever of 100.3, headache, rapid heart beat and joint pain throughout the night.    Off and on, I iced my arm for hours.  I finally took extra strength tylenol 23 hrs after the injection.  It helped but my fever persisted until Tuesday, March 9th along with headache and arm pain.  On the evening of March 9, i developed a huge red, warm rash all over my upper arm below  the injection site.  It is more than half way around my arm and about 3-4 inches long.  I rubbed benedryl on it and took a Benedryl pill.  It still appears on my arm and is warm and tender on the morning of March 11th.

                                                After 3.5 hours, the injection site got sore.  By the next day, it was painful and swollen.  By the following day, it was 80 % better.  After that, it seemed fine.  About ten days later, I noticed that the injection site had become dense and a little sore.  Within a few more days, I started having pectoralis muscle spasms, and I can no longer raise my right hand to my mouth, to my opposite shoulder or overhead.  Trying to make those motions causes me to cry out in pain.  I can&#39;t sleep on that shoulder, and need help getting dressed.  I get acute pain from moving it in other ways, too.

                                                The morning of the 23rd of January began to feel the pain in my left shoulder.  on Friday the 24th i scheducled an appointment with the urgen clinic.  They have me a steroid shot and 5 days of prednisone. .. for pain PRN.  I also used a warm press.  However, at night i am awakened every few hours with anoying discomfort and pain.  the pain seems to be radiating up and down my arm and my deltoid seems to be paining as well.  this continued on.  I contacted my doctor in california and we did a telehealth visit.  he perscribed Naproxen 550 mg and an ointment. not much help.   i got my second shot on the 22th of Feburary at a different health facility in Tx.  I got it in my right arm. no issues at all.  My left arm continue to bother me.  I went to california  and visited my urgent care facility.  The provider told me she had seen this continued arm pain in clinic but nothing after 30 day or no one reported this problem.   I have to sleep on my right side and put a pillow between my arm and my body.  I just went to buy a sling to reduce the movement.  I don&#39;t take perscribed medications.  I don&#39;t have High blood pressure, diabetis or any other underlying condition.  I went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist advised that i put in another adverse reaction as i had reported some time ago.

I sat in a chair and was unable to get up or pick up head for about 30 mins.  (disoriented, semi conscious)  Day after, (today) feels like after effects of a migraine episode I used to get. Very tired, low energy.

                                                17 hours post injection I had terrible back pain!!!  Preceded by headache, chills and fever.  The pain was excruciating for six hours, finally relenting slowly.  After six more hours, all effects but the brain-fog disappeared.  Brain-fog lasted three days.

                                                On Monday evening, I started feeling rather weird, rather out of it. During the night, I was having trouble sleeping and woke up with a fever of 100. I took Tylenol and went back to bed.  When I finally got up probably around 10 a.m., I was not feeling well at all.  I had body aches, a headache, stomach cramps, chills, fever, my arm was very sore, very tired, and exhausted. I fell back asleep early afternoon and woke up with a 101.7 fever. Took Tylenol &amp; continued to not feel well.  Went to bed around 10 p.m. and slept for 12 hours.  Wednesday, I was still very exhausted, but not as many body aches. That evening, I noticed my face had many small pimples on it.  The next morning, I woke up with a rash and redness around the injection area, a rash on my face and on other areas of my body, which caused itching/tingling sensations.  I called the health department nurse and she indicated that the rash was also a side effect of the vaccine.  She suggested Benadryl, but I mentioned that I don&#39;t handle that medication very well.  I did use some Benadryl cream on my arm for the itching.  Not sure whether the cream caused a reaction, but I once again became very tired and took a nap.  I also developed a stuffed, clogged left ear, which affected my hearing.  This sensation came and went several times from Thursday through Sunday. On Friday, I still had a rash and experienced some fatigue.  When I woke up on Saturday, I finally felt like I was &#34;normal&#34; again.

I applied cold compresses, and took Motrin and Benadryl.  The pain was so intense that I was in tears.  It would not stop.  The pain went down my arm to my hand as well.  I was unable to sleep.  The swelling has gone down, but is still present.  There is discoloration under the bottom of my upper arm, arm pit and breast.  The pain is still awful when my arm is not in use, and  increases when I do use the arm.  I reached out to doctor&#39;s office and for two weeks I didn&#39;t receive a call back from anyone at the facility following almost two weeks of calling.

                                                Suddenly, 6 hours after receiving Dose 2 of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine my injection site arm starting hurting.  I took 1000 mg Tylenol and went to bed.  For the next 48 hours I remained in bed with major flu like symptoms:  fever, chills, severe body aches every where, very bad headache and severe arm pain.  I suppose the nausea I felt was due to taking 1000 mg Tylenol every 5-6 hours for 48 hours.  Then as fast as all this came on it all seemed to go away after 48 hours.  It was a long two days since I had major difficulty getting out of bed or caring for myself.

The nerves in my back feel sensitive like happens with shingles but shingles only break out on the back of my thighs.  By 2:30 AM felt terrible, couldn&#39;t sleep, took Tylenol and bundled up.  Finally stopped shaking and got warm.  By 6:30 AM fever seemed to have broken but body aches and headache continue.  Took Tylenol at 6:30 AM, 10:30 AM.  Feeling somewhat better but still have body aches and injection site soreness.  Have I recovered?  Not yet, not completely but going in right direction.

During my sleep, after 11pm, I was awakened by an intense headache. I was fatigued and didn&#39;t want to go and get ibuprofen. I probably didn&#39;t take that for several hours. Then I took 600mg; about 3 hours later, 400mg; 400mg 3 hours later and another 400mg about 3 hours later. The headache was still intense, although diminished. I had body chills and intense heat, which normally would bother me, but not this time. I awoke at 11am but slept throughout the day. I next ate food -- a bowl of plain pasta -- about 7pm. I still had a headache and nausea. I went back to sleep, waking at 6am. My headache subsided; my digestion was mildly irritated. About mid afternoon took a short walk and felt fatigue afterwards, along with mild cold symptoms.

Woke up around 3 am with a slight fever (100 degrees), achy muscles and joints, muscle weakness, dizziness and headache.  Drank a glass of water, put gel ice pack on forehead, back of neck, injection site (very sore.) Went back to bed around 4 am, woke up again around 6, same symptoms, drank some more water and went back to bed again - very tired.  Got up around 9 am, still feeling bad but fever was a little lower - 99.6.  Fell asleep on the couch twice that day, took 1 ibuprofen around 3 pm.  Reduced appetite that day. Fever gone by night time.  Following day, ~48 hours post-injection, only symptom was continued dizziness.  Some dizziness still  on day 3, very slight on day 4.

Points of arthritis was extremely painful.  Fever got up to 100 degrees.  Fever broke around 7 am the next morning.  I felt tired and weak that day.  By 2nd morning began to feel better.   Since that time I seem to be having inflammation issues.

                                                I had been doing really well with my irritable bowel and stomach issues for several weeks, but, the rash on my neck was in a flair up.  I had some flairing  going on with my upper neck and back area and some burning in my upper legs.  I had gone to sleep on Wednesday night and around 3 A.M., I was awakened by a horrible burning sensation in my upper stomach, back, face, neck, and arms.  They felt like they were on fire inside! My left lower jawbone was hurting up around the front of my ear into my cheekbone underneath my left eye.   I took a terribly burning diaherra, chilling, and aching all over.  I could hardly stand to set straight up in a chair , let alone lay down.  This was terribly bad until around 8 or 9 A.M.  It eased up some and I slept for a couple of hours.  It came back intermittantly for the next four days and nights..So much worse at night.  Even though I have issues with burning sensations and diaherra, etc., I have never experienced anything of this magnitude before!  I am afraid whatever was in a flair up within me was magnified times over!

Went to the Emergency room. Was given Antacid. I had already taken Benadryl.  Topical application is Benadryl and hydrocortisone. No relief. Day 2 Used EMU oil on rash and it gave relief but rash came back after 7 hours. Plus vomiting of food and antihistamines.  Day 3 Using EMU oil, Benadryl topical and orally. Rash is not as severe but the burning in the limbs, hands and feet still present but not as visible. Pain in abdomen, and chest, but no vomiting. Stopped taking the acid reducer only the Benadryl. Omega vitamins with vitamin D seemed to help stop the burning under the skin on Day 2 but not Day 3 Throat is raspy and voice has a different sound; lower and breaking up. Sleeping a lot

Took two Alleve ibuprofens during that time, which helped a little. Fatigue diminished daily, but lasted about a week. A curious effect was tingling and slight pain at the site of two broken bones (tibia and fibula); breakage occurred over 40 years ago. Another curious note is that my orthopedic surgeon reported hearing the same thing from many other clients.

                                                After the first dose on 1-29-2021 I was violently vomiting and nausea for several days. I was hesitant to get the 2nd vaccine but I did it anyway. My 2nd dose was on 2/25/2021. Exactly 2 weeks later on 3-11-2021 at 11am I went into a full seizure and my husband called 911. I was not aware of my surroundings until 3/12/2021 at 10am. I spent 4 days in  Hospital .  MD and several other Neurologists  reviewed and tested me for seizures. I had no history and my tests came back with no reason or conclusion for having a seizure. The COVID vaccine had been the single only change in my life. I also had NO pre existing condition to  have a seizure. I was so sick after the first vaccine 01/28/2021 that I did not think I should get the 2nd dose but I did. For over 30 years I have gotten my flu vaccine every year with no issues. I will never ever get a COVID vaccine again.

My first shot on 2/25/21 resulted in headache general feeling of not feeling well on 2/27.  My 2nd dose on 3/25 resulted in my insides trembling for about a day, feeling cold but sweating, severe headache.  I have only had this trembling inside feeling one other time and it was when I had food poisoning.  It is like you cannot stop your insides from shaking.   That was only 12 hours after vaccine and lasted all night.  3/26 was still feeling lousy, headache and trembling that came and went, and dizzy off balance feeling.  Which is not unusual for me, but much more intense.   I slept frequently.   3/27 - today I am still having slight headache but feel I am on the mend.  Taking Tylenol for headache the whole time seemed to help.  Just wanted to give input for people with MS.

If it had gone on for much longer I would have had to go the the hospital.  The level of pain was terrifying....and lest you think it&#39;s just that I can&#39;t handle pain, I&#39;ve given birth to 5 children without any pain mediation whatsoever.  I am still in the depths of an autoimmune flair-up where severe pain in my joints and muscles occur.  I continue to feel significant fatigue.  I also continue to experience some level of &#34;brain fog&#34; (the inability to follow though streams for long, read more than a few sentences at a time, inability to stay mentally organized).   Mild nausea and inability to digest well continues since the day of the vaccine 3/15.

She grabbed onto the towel bar on the wall and fell hitting her left hip, left ankle and left upper arm.  She does not remember too much after that, but that she was in and out of consciousness until about 12:30 PM Saturday when she remembered being alert but nothing made any sense to her.  Her son came in and found her on the floor, she could not get up, she had a skin tear on her right elbow and she had been incontinent of bowel and bladder.  He started to ask her the orientation questions and got them all wrong, but she knew that she was confused and disoriented.  She could not get up on her own, called the paramedics and they took her to the hospital.  The confusion and disorientation lasted into early Sunday morning 3/28/2021 at about 3:00 AM when she started to answer questions appropriately.  As the day went on things got better, but still exist to this point today 4/6/21.  It was more severe as she came out of the confusion.  She has brain fog, inability to sequence thoughts, a little bit of expressive aphasia.  She had two CAT scans and an MRI that were negative for subdural or CVA&#39;s.  I had urine specimen and blood cultures to rule out a UTI or sepsis and those were negative.  Her kidney labs were normal.  She ABG&#39;s drawn and those were normal.  They placed her on oxygen and she sat for 3 days and then they released her to home.     Today, she is still having the brain fog, still the not able to sequence thoughts, general fatigue.  She is black and blue from shoulder to elbow due to the fall.

                                                Immediately I could taste a metallic salty taste in my throat. About 1 minute later my throat was burning and itching and I began coughing. The nurses put me in a room with another nurse, gave me cold water and watched me.  5 minutes later I began feeling dizzy and nauseated.  My throat seemed to settle a bit and I finally told them I felt good enough to leave about 45 minutes later.  Around 5 pm  my throat was still burning and throbbing, so I took a benedryl, claritin and a pecid. My head felt fuzzy.  I ate ice cream for dinner because my throat kept throbbing and I was still nauseated.  I went to bed at 6 PM and around 10 PM I woke up with my throat throbbing and burning and I ached all over as if I&#39;d been beaten in my sleep.  I considered using my epi pen, but took another claritin and Hydrocondone instead because I never had trouble breathing and my lips didn&#39;t swell.  The worst was the swollen, itchy, throbbing throat and body aches.  By morning my throat had cleared up, but the body aches and headaches, and fuzzy headed are still with me 10 days later. I feel permanently damaged by the vaccine.

Patient had pain that started in arm where she got shot, then hurt in right leg, and then left leg and arm. Patient passed out at one point, causing her to fall and hit head on bathroom floor. She did not seek any medical attention at that time and has not since her vaccine. She had extreme thirst from 8pm until 3am. She could not sleep due to pain.

Patient is wanting to speak to someone that knows about Mold toxicity and if it correlates to the covid Vaccine. She states she had the same symptoms when she had mold toxicity before.

Patient states she will look up someone if she needs to and does not want the provider to do any leg work. She has several books and has ordered more.

I was feeling a great deal of soreness immediately. my arm at the injection site is tender to the touch and my shoulders and neck are sore too. I started with 99 fever Monday night and Tuesday night  I experienced sweats and clamminess. I couldn&#39;t sleep. When I awoke Wednesday morning, I had 100.5 fever. I took Tylenol and a couple of hours later, fever went  to  99. 2. I will continue to take Tylenol every few hours.

During the day it felt hot and the itching increased.  It was sensitive to my touch. It was not comfortable sleeping on my left side.   On January 30 I now have a circle of redness (like the pictures of people on the internet, called Covid arm).  My arm still itches.  It is still sensitive to my touch.  It is not as warm as yesterday.

Fatigue aches in  muscles and joints persisted until 1/31/21 am. Headache persisted from onset of symptom on 1/30/21 until approximately 10:30 am on Sunday 1/31/21. I did not seek medical attention, as I am a health care provider and was aware that these were common side effects of the vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  For the first 8 days, I experienced no reaction to the vaccine.  On day 9, I developed a rash on my right arm surrounding the vaccination  site. I was also flushed and my eyes were red.  And, I experienced diarrhea.  I began taking Benadryl 25mg  every 4 hours during the day (and took zolpidem only at night). In the subsequent 4 days, In addition to the rash, I experienced minor headaches and body aches (not unusual with my Fibromyalgia) so I added Tylenol 500 mg every 6 hours. The rash remained the same. Today is Day 5 and I awoke feeling better and the rash is the same size but not as vibrant. I used a cortisone cream on the rash today and only took Benadryl once when I began to feel lousy at the end of my work day.

Friday continued to feel the same sickness, nauseated, headache, off and on low grade temp and pain  in arms and upper back. I was taking 800mg Ibuprofen 3 times a day and it would ease off headache a little, but nothing  would stop for long.  I was just miserable. had heard the 2nd vaccine could cause such problems, but not the first...therefore, I am a little frightened of getting the 2nd vax. I tried to call the triage nurse at the VA to  ask her about it, but never could get thru to her.  Sent message saturday night to PCP, and was told to go to this website and put in info.

                                                From my diary about the events of yesterday and today:   I will try to relate what happened to me yesterday.   I received my second Covid vaccination a few days ago and perhaps the following is related, but I?m not sure.  I think I felt fine yesterday morning, and decided to scrub my tub. I was mostly finished when I felt dizzy and went to lie down around 1pm.  A friend texted me asking if I was free for a chat, but I wanted to rest a little and did so, texting her when I awoke.  I did feel out of sorts when I awoke, and was aware that I had had some dreams, but texted her anyway.  We agreed to have a call at 2pm.  While on the call, I felt I was struggling with the conversation.  I was trying to tell her of my experiences with a recent part-time job (which I quit) and couldn?t remember names of people I worked with or certain events that I wished to convey.  I still can?t remember names of people with whom I worked, and it was just one week ago that I left.  I suddenly felt really out of it and nauseous, and struggled to tell my friend I needed to get off the phone.  I could not remember her name, to tell her this (and I&#39;ve known her for 40 years)!   The next few hours are a total fog.  I know I was having dreams of a sort, but I was not asleep.  There are maybe 2 hours that I can?t account for. It is most troubling to me that I can?t account for this time, but I know something was happening with my brain and while I was having these dreams or hallucinations, I was not asleep. I remember having to think really hard about what my son-in-law?s name was ? note that I live with this person.  I did not seek medical care, but feel like this information could be related to the Covid vaccine, and may be important to you.  It was my night to cook, and I had a really hard time keeping up.  I did manage to pull most of a meal together, but right before I was done, I needed to call my daughter to finish it.  I was unable to eat anything myself, and only wanted a drink.  I felt really nauseous and unsteady, although my thinking was a bit more clear by this time.  I?m not sure when the numbness in my toes and fingers on one side of my body (right side) started, but as of this afternoon, both are still numb and weak.  It is 1:00pm and I am still having trouble remembering some things, and that few hours of the afternoon from yesterday are completely lost to me.  I have like a shadow hanging above one eye. I am seriously thinking I have had some sort of a neurological event.  As of 3:00 today, my right hand and right foot are still numb, although my thinking seems to be clear.

Woke up so got up to take evening meds and brush teeth. Had vertigo and moderate nausea. While brushing teeth, I fainted. Came around quickly - was on bathroom floor. Took only one of my medications - the one to prevent migraines and went back to bed. Continued with body aches and chills on and off through the night. In the morning I had worsened vertigo and nausea, but this is typical of my vestibular migraines and I think that was what was going on. I called in sick to work, took one of my  pills for treating migraines and basically slept all day. I do not get migraines often - usually

Immediately felt a little lightheaded during the 15 min window afterward but was able to ambulate independently with walker just afterward.  After taking a nap, she woke with a headache, chills, a little shaky and feeling very tired.  She was able to eat and take Tylenol at the time.  For the rest of the day, she felt under the weather.  The next morning she was very weak, unable to ambulate and tachycardic prompting nursing staff to send her to the hospital for assessment.

I IMMEDIATELY RAN TO THE BATHROOM TO TAKE A HYOSCYAMINE TABLET (0.125 MG) FOR THE PAIN.  IT WAS TOO LATE - I HAD TERRIBLE VOMITING AND DIARRHEA/CRAMPING. IT EVENTUALLLY SUBSIDED BUT I HAD A SECOND EPISODE ABOUT 2 HOURS LATER. AT THAT TIME I TOOK AN ANTI-DIARRHEAL PRODUCT WHICH HELPED. I WAS DRAINED (WEAK AND SHAKY) THAT DAY AND INTO 01/13/21 - SLEPT ALOT.. I STARTED FEELING BETTER IN THE AFTERNOON OF 01/13/2021. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF IT WAS A VACCINE REACTION OR A DIVERTICULOSIS EPISODE.

                                                The evening of the day after vaccination my stomach was upset, then had a large amount of green diarrhea, chills.  That  night and the next day I slept most of the time and had chills,  It&#39;s now the 3rd day and I&#39;m feeling a bit better but still very tired and sleeping a lot.

                                                After a half hour of receiving the vaccine, I experienced redness and swelling in the injection site, flushing on my forehead and nose, and itching all over my body. I took a 25mg dose of Benadryl and the hospital monitored my vital signs for about an hour afterwards. I had a fever on the second day (2/06/2021) but it only lasted about 5 hours. However, I have had constant systemic itching everyday. I take 25mg Benadryl but today, 2/09/21, it has been more intense. Please note that I had no reaction to the first dose besides a sore arm for three days.  I am very concerned about the itching and it is making it difficulty for me to sleep and also to do my daily activities.

Two days after injection, only at night when laying down, severe localized pain near shoulder blade and spine.  Deep throbbing and sharp pain.  Very difficult to sleep.   Lasted 3.5 days, started at night. During day, moving around, working with horses was not noticed.  Still have that localized pain going on 7 days.  As of 2/12/21. But not to the extent stated earlier.   When pain first started, took 800 milligrams ibuprofen each night and 400 milligrams for two nights.  Medicine took about 2.5 hours to actually work enough to be able to sleep.  Have not taken any meds for 2 nights now.  Occasional throbbing but staying away from meds.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

I took 2 tylenol and took a 3 hour nap.  When I woke I had several questions about events of the day that I did not recall.  Plus my daughter was with me and kept asking me if I was ok during prior to nap time.

I took 400mg ibuprofen at bed time.  During the night I woke up due to the pain and noticed that I had been sweating.   I took 400mg around 3am and went back to sleep.  Woke at 6AM on the2/27and still had joint pain but not as painful as the night before.  Couple hours later while taking a shower I noticed that my left arm at the site of the vaccine had a large red blotch.  It  did not itch or was painful but it was somewhat warm.  At that point I called my primary drs office and was advised to go to urgent care.  At Urgent care my arm was examined by a doctor and he ordered a Covid test and prescribed doxycycline as he felt I had cellulitis.

Immediately after ingesting the cookies, I developed irritated throat, felt as if my throat was burning, developed coughing, throat felt funny. This lasted for the entire day. Throat looked inflamed for 2 days. This was after my first dose, so I am praying it was a reaction to the cookies and not the vaccine.

My breathing felt a little different but it could have been from wearing two masks for a longer period of time than usual. After ten or fifteen minutes, I felt sort of dizzness and it didn&#39;t feel quite normal around my eyes and forehead. The staff were extremely attentive to me. I probably was there after the shot for 30-45 minutes. Dr.  suggested my symptoms was due to anxiety and out of an abundance of caution, the emergency squad was called and I was taken to  Hospital Emergency Department.

The shaking was so severe that I was having  trouble breathing between the shakes.  I also had 1 emesis.  At approximately 20 minutes of shaking, I called 911 at the advice of a nurseline.  EMTs checked my vitals and my BP, pulse, O2 sat and blood sugar was all normal.  I almost had another emesis.  They offered to take me to an ER, but I declined as I couldn&#39;t see what could be done for me at that point.  At about 40 minutes of symptoms they began to abate.  I then slept for 11 hours straight.

I was ok the next morning, I thought I was going to be alright, then Saturday my temperature went up to 104.6 and I could not get it to go down. was taking Tylenol every 4 hours and it would not go down.  I was shaking so bad. I was trying to do my chores and I could not physically do anything. I could hardly walk, I could not even go get some water. I felt disoriented. It was my own house that I lived for 24 years and I felt disoriented. I could not remember where the kitchen was. It lasted until about 8PM Sunday evening. Then I started feeling like a human again. I was able to walk to the bathroom by myself. My husband made me a bowl of soup that was the first time I ate since Friday. By that time I was coherent, was able to take a shower and around 10PM I went to bed and slept until 8AM Monday morning, I woke up like nothing had happened.

I did not take any medication because I didn&#39;t want to undermine the success of the vaccine.  I also experienced  severe chills but at the same time my body felt hot.  As the eve wore on I had a bad stiff neck.  I went to bed with an ice pack &amp;  did not sleep much.  I still had the same symptoms the next day until I finally took 1 Motrin at 2:00 p.m. &amp; another approx 1 hr. later.  Then the symptoms began to lessen.  Did not sleep well Sat eve either - my legs just felt weird.  Finally I felt better around 9:00 a.m.  on Sunday but still somewhat dizzy when moving too  quickly.

I went home and slept for 2 hours, got up and felt under the weather the rest of the day, a lot of pain at injection site. Got up Sunday morning still feeling under the weather. Took a nap at 1 pm and woke up at 5:30 pm with fever of 101.5, shortness of breath, headache and chills. Drank some water, went back to bed with extra covers. Got up at 7 pm and took 2 ibuprofen as headache was unbearable. Fever was now 99.5 and I was sweating profusely from the fever and was restless, could not sleep. Finally slept at 1 am. Still have headache today.  I WILL NOT BE GETTING THE 2ND DOSE.

                                                I was given my first Moderna vaccination at Pharmacy on February 26, 2021.  I noticed at the time that the needle was open and not covered but didn&#39;t think anything about it.  Later that evening my arm was sore.  Knew that was to be expected.  Within 2 days my upper arm was beet red and swollen beyond recognition.  Finally after 10 days of pain I went to Urgent Care in and saw a doctor there.  My arm was indeed infected.  Doctor gave me prescription for Amoxicillin &amp; Clavulanate Potassium 875 mg.  Take one twice a day.  Was also given Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment USP 0.1% to put thin layer on arm twice a day.  Today is Monday March 8th and the redness, swelling and infection has moved down to my elbow and as far as pain is concerned it&#39;s a 5 out of 10.  It&#39;s starting to affect my fingers too.  Elbow area is now red and very swollen and HOT!  I&#39;m going to try to get into my regular doctor today to see if she can help me.  I can&#39;t sleep it hurts so bad.

                                                Woke up around 2 am with stomach cramps, loose bowels, nausea, chills, sweating, dizziness, sore left arm, very shaky feeling.  Went to bathroom for bowel movement, had trash can in front of me in case of vomiting.  Apparently passed out and fell off toilet.  Woke up on floor, on my right side, with very cold chills and sweating.  Finished going to bathroom.  Noticed small cut on forehead, with dried blood, probably from hitting my head on trash can I was holding.  Went back to bed.  Still dizzy, chills, sweating, stomach cramps, nausea, sore arm, and aching all over.  These symptoms persisted for hours.  Finally fell asleep, woke up around 7:30 am, still dizzy, stomach cramps.  Took temperature, normal, took blood Additional information for Item 18: pressure, also normal.  Called office of primary care doctor, not open on Friday, declined appointment with another doctor, left detailed message, and was told they would contact me on Monday.  Went back to sleep, woke around 11:15 am, still nauseous and stomach cramps and dizzy.  Went back to sleep until around 2:30 pm.  Woke up feeling better, still sore left arm, sore stomach, achy and very tired.

                                                Hello,  FYI: My first Moderna vaccination I had a sore arm and fatigue for a day. For my second Moderna vaccination it was at 0745 6 Mar 2021. Twelve hours later side effects began. The first night was brutal. Temperature rapidly rose to 102. Joint aches, fatigue but couldn&#39;t sleep due to the pain, loss of taste and smell, nausea, felt real cold, shakes, congestion, gassy, hurt to breath, headache, shallow breathing, slightly elevated heart rate. I drank a lot of water and hot Green Tea.  I did call the medical center and spoke with a nurse about whether it was Covid or side effects to the second vaccination.  Second day was miserable; I still had a fever that gradually went down. Finally was able to sleep end of second day. I continued to drink a lot of water and hot Green Tea. Third day, still fatigued, mild heachach. Mild sore arm for three days.  Third through  nine days I have a below normal temperature, hoarseness, mild headache, and fatigue.  the medical center gave me annual flu vaccinations. I&#39;ve never had a side effect from them. While I was in the medical center, before I was deployed overseas, the medical center gave me some dozen vaccinations. Again, no side effects from them.  I have never been around anyone who turned out later to have Covid 19 or tested positive for it.  I have never had the flu. I have had some four cases of a cold. Worst illness was after my exposure to norovirus. I was gravely ill, had to be admitted to the hospital here. Norovirus worse than the two cases of food poisoning I had.  I figure with those awful side effects I now have an immune system better able to handle Covid 19 if I do get exposed.  Per CDC, I will still wear a mask, social distance, avoid medium- and large-sized crowds, avoid poorly ventilated public and private spaces, and wash my hands frequently for the forseeable future.

She noted a history of bee stings and that she has an epi pen at home so was given the shot and monitored for 30 minutes. 20 minutes post vaccine, patient noted she felt dizzy and somewhat disoriented. She noted a dry throat and like her arms and legs felt funny &#34;like jello&#34;. Her husband alerted staff at the vaccination site and EMS assessed her. She said she was told her blood pressure was high for her but otherwise vitals were fine. She denied itching, or shortness of breath or trouble breathing. She actually asked her husband to go home and get her epi pen and he returned with it and was given a dose of epi and sent to the local emergency room for evaluation. She said she felt better by the time she got their but was monitored for a number of hours. She felt completely fine by the time she was discharged. She noted for a few days following the vaccine she felt fatigued and a slightly itchy spot at injection site but that&#39;s it.

The fever (102 degress) subsided, but a continuous headache, varying degrees of dizziness and brain fog (the inability to focus or concentrate) continue uninterrupted. It has now been two weeks since my 2nd vaccination and it is difficult for me to attend meetings or focus and follow up on projects. I continue to experience fatigue, dizziness, pain and stiffness in my neck where it attaches to my head - and low-grade headache. I have NO prescription medications and NO pre-existing conditions. I am taking aspirin or Tylenol or Advil to see if any of them are effective. The neck pain is helped by the over-the-counter pain relievers, but the brain fog and dizziness continue along with a dull headache.

Was told to finish antibiotics and see if its better by monday.

                                                Approximately 3 days post vaccine I began to have severe tinnitus. On the same day, I began to have difficulty with my vision , especially in the left eye, a headache and all my joints began to ache. I was also very tired. The symptoms progressively got worse  over the following two weeks and included a couple of episodes of heart rhythm irregularities . During the third week, the headache, eye issues and joint pain began to resolve but the tinnitus is debilitating and prevents me from mentally focusing or sleeping.

This has occurred each night beginning 2 DAYS AFTER the injection.  Except for local burn or swelling the first day, the adverse reaction did not begin until 2 days later.  I moan in my sleep because of the pain, awaken and jump out of bed, flinging my arm around, grabbing it, massaging it, desperately trying to relieve the pain then take 2 500mg acetaminophen which helps it subside quickly and enables me to go back to sleep.

The next day, she experienced fatigue, headache, shaking and shivering, muscle aches, was getting weak, threwup once, fever, and didn&#39;t know who she was. She lived alone and was hollering for someone to help her. She couldn&#39;t get out of bed. She was hallucinating; she thought the floor was wet. Her arm was severely swollen and painful.  The patient couldn&#39;t lift her arm.  Treatments of these events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event is unknown.  The outcome for the events, hallucinations, confusional state, muscular weakness, asthenia, peripheral swelling, pain, fever, headache, fatigue, vomiting, shaking/shivering and muscle aches, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, confusional state, muscular weakness, asthenia, peripheral swelling, pain, fever, headache, fatigue, vomiting, shaking/shivering and muscle aches, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding the hallucinations has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

These symptoms went on for 2 weeks, until I had to do my routine lithium level on 3/18/21.  I was toxic at 1.7.  Have been on lithium 40 years and have never been toxic.  My doctor sent me to ER, where they gave me fluids and potassium.  When checked in ER, my BP was 214/87.  I never have high BP - 120/80 is normal.  On discharge, my BP was 194/79.  Saw my doctor ASAP on advice of ER.  My doctor put me on amlodipine for BP which I started today.  He said I had essential hypertension and heart rate is irregular.

The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID-19 and concomitant medication included Vitamin B12.  On 24-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011A21A) intramuscularly on left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 25-FEB-2021, one day after receiving mRNA-1273, patient started to experience sore arm.  On 26-FEB-2021 patient had severe severe ice pick headache, it felt like the biggest wasp in the world stung her head. She states that it was so painful, and it scarred her. Patient claims she searched it up and it was the cranial 7 nerve from her temple to the back of her head that was on fire which lasted for 5 minutes.  The next day 27-FEB-2021 patient states the headache was gone however the nerve still throbbed a little and she was afraid to go to sleep that night. She then woke up that same night with severe ice pick headaches that were slamming into her head.  On 28-FEB-2021 the patient took protective measures and got up early and did not experience anything on that day. On 1-MAR-2021, she accidentally touched her husband&#39;s forehead with her head lightly and had the most severe ice pick headache (like hot lava running through that nerve for 20 minutes). It alleviated when she took two Advil&#39;s.  The next morning 2-MAR-2021 the patient nerves felt like little electricity lines zapping through constantly. Patient had looked up Bell&#39;s Palsy within our clinical trials and when she went to the doctors on 3-MAR-2021, they said the wrinkles in the right eye was very smooth compared to the left but her eyes were not drooping), doctors believed it to be Bell&#39;s palsy and prescribed her Gabapentin, and Zovirax.  Since then her ice picks have left but there is still nerve pain. She feels like the cranial 7 nerves are still on fire. All her headaches happened in bed while laying down. Patient states that the headaches feel dangerous and feel like they will cause her permanent damage. Patient still feels pressure in her brain and is scared there may be swelling in her brain.  Treatment medications included Advil, Gabapentin, and Zovarax.  Seriousness criteria included medically significant events.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.    Outcome of the event sore arm, severe ice pick headache, felt like the biggest wasp in the world stung her head,  nerve pain, afraid to go to sleep, most severe ice pick headache/headaches happened in bed while laying down/headaches feel dangerous, patient nerves felt like little electricity lines zapping through constantly/still feels like cranial 7 nerves are on fire were considered recovered but bell&#39;s palsy, wrinkles in right eye was very smooth, patient feels pressure in her brain/scared there may be swelling in her brain and heart muscle is a little sore were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Headache is consistent with the known safety profile of he vaccine.

Also swelling ( a firm lump).  Itching intense enough to disrupt sleep.    Over the counter remedies did not help. Cold pack did not help.

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

                                                I received the vaccine yesterday 1/6/21.  Today, 1/7/21, I went for my walk this morning and felt off balance/swayed to the right a bit at one point. I don&#39;t think lightheadedness precipitated this, but it unnerved me.  I steadied myself and finished the walk without a problem. I checked and surface/pavement was uneven. My temp is 97.5 and I feel fine now but am just a little nervous that is a possible reaction to the vaccine. I had a reaction to the second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine 10 yrs ago, I fainted in early morning hours after getting up to go to bathroom.  I had received the second dose at about 11:30a the day before, and developed flu like symptoms by afternoon with a fever and ended up dehydrated which I think contributed to my fainting at about 3a when I got up to void.  I had a concussion and was treated with IV fluids at the local ED.

                                                Patient appeared nervous upon receiving vaccine. Patient reported trouble swallowing ( has a history of radiation therapy on throat). When asked if breathing was restricted, patient was able to take long breaths with minimal additional effort. Shortly after, patient appeared to be close to passing out (not completely awake and alert), eyes dilated. The pharmacist who administered the vaccine then administered one dose of the epinephrine (Epi-pen LOT:0FM353/eEXP:NOC 21) while the staff member kept the patient stable in her chair. The facility was instructed to call 911. At 11:49 AM (7 minutes later), symptoms began to improve and the patient became more alert. EMS arrived around 12:00PM to take patient to hospital--patient refused and was back walking around the facility 5 minutes later. No further issues were reported with this patient (pharmacist administering the vaccine left the facility around 1:15PM)

At its largest, swelling was about an oval about 2-1/2  wide x 3-1/2 long. Pain was significant enough that I couldn?t sleep on my right side. Swelling and redness are gone, but area is still tender to the touch.

Started getting sick to her stomach all evening, started throwing up last night beginning at 11:00 PM, throwing up bile.  Today having fever of 101, didn&#39;t take anything for it, but down to 100 now.  Took 2 Tums and had such achy joints and sat down in a chair and could not get up from the chair.  Took some Tylenol and that helped, but freezing cold.  Didn&#39;t sleep all night.  Has not notified her doctor of the symptoms, just calling us.

                                                When my fingers touched something cold they would feel weird and lose their color. The first time (1/21) was minor (one finger) and the second time was (1/23) and all the tips of my fingers of my right hand turned colorless when I touched something cold. 1/24 my toes tingled when I walked and happens when I go for a walk. The finger symptom seems to be diminishing. I have never had either of these things happen before I had the Moderna vaccine. My doctor told me not to have the second dose which is due on 1/30/2021.

While driving home my face became warm, after arriving home face/cheeks extremely red/flushed.  Have a picture taken at 3:54 for documentation. Not sure if from anxiety, but felt jaw tightness and a thick tongue.  No itching, swallowing problems etc.   lasted approximately 15 minutes. By 4:57 pm redness had faded.   Picture documentation. 9:15 pm had right ear pain and mild reddened of right cheek.   Picture documentation.

                                                Evening of 1/28, one week after first dose vaccine, left arm began itching below the injection site. It itched during the night and upon rubbing it, I felt a lump. The morning of 1/29, arm was red, rash, hot, itch, lump, and this is approximately 2-3&#39; below the injection site - interestingly around my small pox vaccination scar. By mid-afternoon, all symptoms were worse and I did not feel &#34;right&#34; and felt lethargic. I contacted by phone my PCP office and sent pictures. They said &#34;delayed inflammatory response&#34; to injection. I took Aleve and Benadryl at bedtime and it is better today but certainly not gone.   ** I did not receive the V-Safe text yesterday to report this. **

                                                It&#39;s a week after I received my first dose, my left outer arm below the injection site has a red oval swelling that is about 2 1/2 inches long and 2 inches wide with a faint red narrow tail of about two inches extending down my arm.  The swollen area is warmer than the rest of my arm. My arm started bothering me last night when I was sleeping; it woke me,  just felt funny.  When it nagged at me today I scratched and then thought to look at my arm.  I noticed I had scratched a few times before because the scratch marks had scabs.  My arm doesn&#39;t hurt though and it does not affect my regular activities.  I was anxious because I did not know if it would lead to more swelling.  Now I have read about  &#34;COVID arm&#34; so I will stop worrying.  Thank you.

                                                It started with my arm hurting, even my fingers on the left arm. Then my temperature began to climb to 101.7 within 20 minutes, accompanied by chills.  I was very cold--freezing hands and feet. Could not get warm. Then headache started. Migraine intensity no matter what position I assumed. My joints began to hurt, every joint --knees, elbows, back, even fingers-- so it was difficult walking or moving. Even my teeth hurt where I had had dental work the precious day.   All I could do safely was lie in bed with many pillows to hold my head up. I was also nauseous, and a bad case of post nasal drip developed. I could not  rest properly all night--I took one baby tylenol  every four hours (my usual dose) but it did not help.  Finally at 8:00 AM the fever began to subside slowly till to 98.7 and the head ached/ joint pains are  slowly dissolving while I am writing this. I normally don&#39;t run fever and the last time I had the flue was 40 years ago! I have never been this sick in my life.

In  a couple of minutes I felt very light headed.   While scheduling my second dose, I started feeling  strong pressure inside my head.  I didn&#39;t not feel any pain, just a lot of pressure.     When measuring my  blood pressure (usually, in my case,  it is 120 X 80)  I was told my high number was at 178 x 80.   After resting for some 20 minutes, I was fine again and drove home.    I felt a bit strange  for a couple of hours.

By 9 PM I also had a severe headache with eye pain and dizziness and started to have chills and fever. The chills and fever lasted during the night even with the use of tylenol and ibuprofen. The highest the fever was 100.6. On 02-11 continued with ear problems, headache and eye pain and dizziness. Also at about 10 AM I thought I had an episode of hallucinating when I saw a man walk into our house. When I asked who he was he disappeared. I have had no more episodes like this. This morning I continue with headache and eye pain, dizziness and ear problems. My left arm  at the site is pink about quarter size and itches.  The symptoms are less painful than 02-11-21.

On 27 Jan 2021, she was taken to the emergency room where her oxygen saturation was low, but the fever was gone.  She was placed on oxygen, and blood work had elevated troponin. The patient was diagnosed with pericarditis and she was kept overnight. On 28 Jan 2021 she had atrial fibrillation and the medical team couldn&#39;t convert her chemically.  She was stabilized on 30 Jan 2021 and she was feeling much better.   Treatments of these events included oxygen and ibuprofen.    The events, fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, feeling much worse, couldn&#39;t take food, couldn&#39;t get up from bed, bloodwork with elevated troponin, pericarditis, and atrial fibrillation were considered Recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67 year old female who experienced serious unexpected events of feeling abnormal, decreased appetite, bedridden, elevated troponin, pericarditis, and atrial fibrillation, and a serious expected event of fever. The events began 6 days after first dose of mRNA-1273. Treatment with ibuprofen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I received this vaccine at a walk-in-clinic, called STAT Med.  About 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt nauseated but finally managed to sleep.  The next afternoon on February 23 I became very ill with vomiting and diarrhea all at the same time.  I nearly passed out several times.  First responders arrived and found my blood pressure to be about 70/30.  Got in ambulance and given fluids.  Arrived at hospital around 5:15 pm.  Got more fluids and numerous blood tests, none of which were very remarkable.  My WBC was 17 but nothing else was wrong.  Left hospital at 9:00.  Physician assumes Covid vaccine cause these side effects.

                                                In addition to recognized side effects, approximately 24 hours after injection, I experienced sudden-onset severe pain in my right shoulder that traveled through my biceps and into my elbow. On a scale of 1-10, I?d rate the severity as a 10. This lasted approximately 15 minutes.   Over the ensuing 5 days I had noticeable but tolerable intermittent right arm pain. Then beginning on the 10th day following injection, I experienced sudden and severe right shoulder pain that traveled down my biceps into my elbow again. I&#39;d rate the pain at a 9 on the same scale. This time however, the pain started around 11 pm and did not subside. I tried sleeping but couldn?t. I got up and spent the rest of the night holding my arm to immobilize it, however that did nothing to stop the pain. It was about 5 am when I finally took 50 mg diclofenac and in about 2 hours the pain subsided to a tolerable 4 on the same pain scale.   As the day wore on, the pain increased again to a level 9 without medication so I continued with 50 mg diclofenac every 8 hours over the following 4 days and knocked it back to a level 3. This pain has occurred in my right shoulder, biceps, elbow, forearm and even my fingers and intensifies toward evening. I have been able to tolerate the pain without medication at about a level 3 for the past 2 days. However, I take a 50 mg tab of diclofenac an hour or 2 before bed as the pain intensifies toward evening. This has allowed me to sleep through the night.   In addition to the arm pain I developed muscle weakness in my right biceps about 3 days ago and am unable to lift my right arm above my head. The pain is not what prevents the movement. It?s as though my arm is not receiving the nerve impulse to move. Taking all of this together, I?d say that immunization appears to have triggered Parsonage Turner Syndrome. As I understand this immune-mediated syndrome, several events can trigger it, including immunization. I experienced this phenomenon one other time, approximately 2 years ago but did not correlate it to a vaccination at the time. This time it?s too apparent. I wonder how many other reports you?ve received that are like this and whether the vaccines will trigger the same reactions. I also wonder now whether I should receive a Moderna ?booster? if needed in the near to long term. I have no interest in going through this event a

                                                one hour after injection, became very groggy, sleepy, could barely make it home, half hour driving.  Went in slept rest of the day.  That night ran fever of 103 pain all through body, chills, couldn&#39;t warm up.  couldn&#39;t eat, just drank water Respiration quick and short. Scary all night long..  Next day fever of 102 aching, bone pain, extreme soreness in arm, couldn&#39;t walk without falling..  Stayed in bed, did not eat, no appetite.  Third day fever broke somewhat in night.  Sweating, fever down to 101, still weak and uncoordinated. Still short of breath just walking.  I had a bad case of Covid-19  in July of 2020 and asked if this would aggravate it.  Was told no.  It actually felt like I had a case of it again.  The pain has been really awful.  I still do no want to eat on the third day.  Still having chills.

(Normally, I only awaken  once or twice a week and then it&#39;s only once per night). The third time I felt a little &#39;foggy&#39;, but I went back to sleep. I woke up ~8:30 am and got up to take my shower. While brushing my teeth, I felt like I was going to faint. I made it back to my bed (~10 feet away) just in time, threw myself on the bed and stayed there ~ 4 more hours. I drank water often during that time (that my husband brought the water to me.  At ~1:00 pm  I felt strong enough to go downstairs. I was okay the rest of the day, just tired. The next morning I felt 100%.

                                                RN was staffing a Covid clinic at HS. One of our other nurses gave her the 1st Moderna vaccine at 1:45 PM on 2/12/21. At 1:55 PM, the nurse who had given her shot noticed that patient was pale, and said she was not feeling well. Her BP was 179/110, and she said she usually has low BP. She c/o of &#34;feeling hot and was having difficulty breathing.&#34; She was seen by our medical director. After 30 minutes, her BP was 120/82. She said she ?felt a little better and called her sister to pick her up.? Later that evening, patient texted me saying I didn?t feel well when I got home, had trouble focusing literally and had a crying jag and felt shaky on the inside. I kept hydrating, took 25 of Benadryl and slept for 2 hrs., now feel close to normal. It was definitely a reaction to the shot-just weird!? Patient texted me on 2/13/21 that ?the FDA thinks one vaccine may be enough for 80?90% effectiveness, so I might not get the 2nd dose? On 2/15/21 patient texted, ?My PCP thinks what I had was a side effect &amp; recommends taking Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Tylenol before the 2nd injection, and doesn?t seem to be worried about it!?   On 2/19/21, I received a text from patient at 5:28 AM as she was scheduled to staff a Covid clinic that day, beginning at 7:30 AM. She said, ?I have been up for a couple hrs w/severe eye pain and can?t hardly open my eye but it hurts to close it too! At 10:37 AM she texted, ?I just got home from eye doctor and was prescribed drops 4X/day. Apparently, there are pin holes in my sclera &amp; cornea which hurt so bad I had lavender cold pack on all day &amp; couldn?t stand the light. It is a corneal abrasion &amp; I have no idea why that would happen suddenly?. The following day, she texted me a picture of her L arm injection site which she said was ?very itchy and hot! Not painful-? It was about 6 inches in diameter, red, inflamed,  delayed cutaneous rx.

About 40 minutes later I had severe pain in my neck, back, and shoulders. I have had 3 herniated discs in the past and the pain from this was much worse than that pain.  About the same time I felt a headache coming on that just got worse as the night went on. I decided to go to bed and try to sleep, however, the pain was so great that I could not lay down flat or sit up. I spent the night walking the floor. During the night I vomited several times. I also developed jaw pain, earaches, and a sore throat.  But the worse part was that during the night I started to feel the sensation of pins and needles being thrust into my legs, ankles, arms, and hands. I never did however have a fever. I finally was able to fall asleep at about 5AM and slept for several hours. When I woke up the pain was mostly gone and I was just left with no energy at all so that I could hardly lift my head off the pillow. I stayed in bed the entire day and the next day I was fine.

Pain persisted to lower back and both hips for several days. Took Ibuprofen 600mg 3 times a day but did not last during the night. Pain would wake me up. After several days pain moved to just left hip and radiated down the back of my leg to the knee the radiated to lateral calf. On Monday 3/1/21 went to my PCP because the pain was not improving and at night it woke me and I was awake for several hours. Walking didnot increase the pain but sitting would. My PCP felt it was related to my Covid Vaccination. She changed my NSAID to voltarin 2 times a day,  because the ibuprofen was not long lasting and she started a muscle relaxer for night time, Tizanidine 4mg. I don&#39;t feel the voltarin is as effective as the ibuprofen as the ibuprofen resolved the pain but for only 4-5 hrs. I will stop tthe voltarin and return to the ibuprofen. Muscle relaxer is helpful.

                                                Pt reported the day after her vaccine, 3-2, she was delirious and did not remember that day. She went to bed and slept most of the day. On 3-3 she woke up with a red rash on her trunk and extremities. The rash did not itch and was not painful. She took Benadryl and on 3-4 the rash was fading.  Spoke with husband to get more info on 3-2 since patient did not remember. Husband stated that patient woke up slurring words, not completing sentences and repeating herself. Husband put patient back to bed and she continued to sleep for most of the day. Husband called PCP and they recommended her to go to the hospital but they did not. Husband states on 3-3 patient was back to normal except for the rash. Husband also stated that the patient has had this happen before, the slurring of the words, and confusion. They did not call and report to the neurologist. Recommended to call and go over this reaction with the neurologist and get the ok for the second dose and will need to provide a letter.

                                                5 hours after vaccine I began to feel as if a RA flare was beginning.  I was totally exhausted, joints in my hands began to swell and so painful that I needed to wrap them in heating pad.  It was painful just lifting a cup of tea.  By the time I went to bed my neck was also hurting.  Woke several times due to pain.  By morning I just feel drained and want to rest.  Site of injection is sore but nothing bad.  I wish I had known this would be causing such a severe RA reaction.  I doubt if I will be getting the 2nd dose.

                                                About 20 hours after the shot, I was exhausted, and had a headache.  I could not function or think clearly.  My head really hurt.  Temp 97.3   By  the next morning, the headache had lifted but the fatigue remained for another day.  That day,  I made several significant errors when copying email addresses and forwarding email info to group members.  Fast forward to March 6.  Very tired and hard to focus.  Felt worse on March 7 but kept pushing myself. March 8, I couldn&#39;t function and sat in a chair a lot of the day.  My head hurt and I noticed a red hard and hot area over the injection site.  My temperature was elevated to 98.8 which for me is 1.5 to 2 degrees elevation. Then it all made sense.  Today, March 9, I&#39;m feeling better, but very tentative about how much to do.  At least well enough to fill out this form.  I can think clearly and I am able to function.

                                                At approx 2 pm Monday, March 8, 2021 I was shopping for clothes.  I was having difficulty breathing through my mask and asked employee if they had a mask I can have.  When I took mine off to use theirs, I was surprised it wasn&#39;t my usual KN95 on me as those are more difficult to breath through.  I felt labored in breathing from that point.  I left the store to get home quickly.  I was also experiencing rapid heart rate\great nervousness and was assuming that because I purchased a large diet coke one hr before that, that the caffeine was causing this.  However, I&#39;ve never experienced this event.  Within 3 minutes of my home, I started experiencing what seemed to be shortness of breathe.  it lasted about a minute.  I considered going to ER.  But went home.  Shortness of breathe stopped and I looked on google how to reduce caffeine reaction.  I ate handful of peanuts for protein, but had odd indigestion.  Kept drinking lots of water to flush out.  Was doing many deep breathing exercises. Nervousness and rapid heart rate lasted about 2 hours.  I  was back to normal by evening.  Scary as I never experienced difficulty with a regular surgical mask.  Never experienced such a severe reaction to a caffeine beverage.  Never experienced that shortness of breath.

I have barely slept Sat, Sunday, Monday or Tuesday night because of the intense pain. I couldn&#39;t raise my are at all until yesterday I could slowly raise from my elbow to my hand. Today, 3-10 I can finally raise the upper part of my arm very slowly with some pain. It still hurts constantly but is getting better than it had been. I just can&#39;t sleep because of the pain. I have taken muscle relaxers, tylenol and ibuprofen but nothing helps.

I took Acetaminophen every 8 hours through to 8:00 AM March 10.  I was too weak to prepare meals and I live alone so I ate only 8 or 10 cookies throughout the day as they were easy to grab and get back to bed.  Had moderate sweating episodes throughout the day and through the night of March 9/10.    Still felt sore when I woke up at 8:00 AM on March 10, 2021.  Took about 2 hours for me to get myself comfortable being upright and able to dress and move about.  Waited for Acetaminophen to work.

Fluctuated all day long between 99.1 and 100.2; never going lower or higher. Fever broke on its own approx 6pm. 5. Feb 14 No Fever. Felt pretty good. No headache; muscle still very tight and sore but still working with it. Tiredness but went about my daily activities. Took nothing for the muscle pain.  6. Feb 15 No Fever. Over did it on the 14th. Did nothing all day. This is the day the injection site became very swollen red and extremely itchy. Started ice cold compresses to relieve that irritating itch. This reaction lasted thru day 7. By day 8 the extreme itchy and swelling was gone. First day to bed by 7pm. Slept all night until 5am. 7. Feb 16 Day 4 after vac. No fever. I picked up my activity slightly from the day before. Tired. To bed again at 7p. Slept until 5:40am. 8. Feb 17 Day 5 after vac. No fever. Felt real good. Energetic! Had pretty much a normal day yet careful to not over do. 9. Feb 18 &amp; 19 Days 6 &amp; 7 after vaccine. HORRIBLE. Woke up with a splitting headache both days! No fever! The following happened all on the left side of my head and face. a. Left eye left corner painful. No twitching. Tight. b. Left side of face on cheek above where my mandible has been deteriorating since 2016 with associated bone infection that has been subsided since Dec 9, 2020 a blemish appeared. Not a pimple. But a blemish that had opened sometime during the night bled a little and had scabbed over. There was nothing there before I went to bed. c. A BLISTER had formed on top of the left side of my scalp. It was extremely sore. 10. Feb 20 Day 8 after receiving vaccine EVERYTHING was gone as though nothing happened, the splitting 2 day headache, the 2 day painful left eye, and the 2 day painful blister on my scalp. The blemish on my cheek was clear in 3 days from appearing on Feb 18th. Please note that I had not taken any medicine to alleviate any of these side effects. I allowed it to run its course. Also, the last 2 days of side effects beginning on the 18th and 19th  were so severe (to me) I felt compelled to report my side effects. End of side effect reporting.

I am very tired which is a blessing because I have slept for most of the day.  I have had chills and sweating off and on, going from cold to hot.  I am somewhat nauseated.    I have taken four Ibuprofen so far.   I continue to drink clear liquids, mostly water.  I am eating very lightly and sleeping.  I have cancelled all activities.

Headache, nauseous, felt like I had a stomach virus because was shaky, weak  and sweaty, temp on Sunday morning, the 28th,  was 100.6. Slept fitfully most of the day. Tried to eat chicken noodle soup about 2:30 pm but threw up at 6:00 pm. On Sunday night, woke up at 2:30 am and recognized my stomach felt fine but still had headache. When I woke up Monday morning between 9 - 10:00 am felt fine but was still weak and shaky. As I ate on Monday, I felt my strength come back and had more energy.

It was difficult to do anything when arriving home, went to bed. I was better the next morning (today) but my brain is still fogged.

Mild soreness around the injection site and warm in rash area but no big deal. I have not taken any over the counter meds with the exception of 1 Tylenol tablet (500mg) on Saturday evening to counter other reactions which occurred about 8 hours after injection (mild headache and medium fatigue, and a &#39;bit off&#39;). That was gone by Sunday.  The only thing that still remains is the tender arm with warm rash. While it doesn&#39;t seem to be getting worse, it is not resolving yet.

Upon rising around 3:00 pm the following afternoon to use the bathroom, feeling very weak, passed out in the bathroom for just  a second or two.  Felt nauseous.  Husband picked me up and put me back in bed.  Registered low fever of 99.6.  Took 2 Tylenol which seemed to alleviate the headache about 50%.   Stayed in bed for balance of day.  The Monday following the Saturday of the vaccine, neck was very sore to the touch on both sides underneath my ears.  Could not lift head without aid.  Remained in bed the balance of the day.  Tuesday morning, felt good enough to get out of bed and resume regular activities but still only about 90%.

Loss of appetite and &#34;tingling&#34; as well as elevated blood pressure and &#34;wierd&#34; feeling irregular heart rhythm.  This lasted exactly 5 days.  6th day, fortunately the other symptoms seemed much better, but now occasionally there is a &#34;tingling&#34; sensation throughout my entire nervous system... in other words I feel it in my chest, arms, legs.  There has been no dizziness associated with any of these symptoms.  Had I felt any difficulty breathing I would have immediately gone to the hospital or emergency room, but that never occured.  I told my husband, I felt (based on what you hear) like the symptoms were &#34;covid&#34; but no fever, no nausea and no lung issues... just really strange pain.  Today, 17th of March, I am feeling better (I have also been off work), but I am concerned as I am scheduled in less than 10 days for a second moderna vaccine, and I am uncertain what to do.

My arm is weak and cannot raise, lift or rotate it above the elbow.  Very difficult to maintain sleep with a throbbing arm. I have been taking Alleve and it helps but the pain is still there just milder. Muscles are not sore but something is aching deep in bone/joints. I went to the Kinesiologist who told me the rotor cuff is the issue. He did an pressure point &#34;adjustment&#34; and the pain subsided for a day or two and now I&#39;m back to being in pain during any level of movement again.  I believe that my injection was given too high in my shoulder and caused SIRVA. I even took a picture of where the injection site was given.  If needed I can provide it to you.

Laid back down in bed, worse headache she has ever had and does get migraines.   She did have the size of about an egg with a rash on the arm itself.  She was disoriented, had chills and clammy, felt like she wanted to throw up but did not, fatigue.  The intense headache lasted until this morning 3/18/21.   She took 600 mg of Ibuprofen initially and then 500 mg every 4-6 hours of Tylenol, which helped.  The headache is pretty much gone, small fever, able to walk better this afternoon.

By 1 p.m my lower lip felt tight, when I looked in the mirror around 3 p.m. I noticed my lower lip was  swollen.  My husband says it was swollen and purple. By bedtime, the swelling in the lip had gone down. About 3 am, I was awoken by shivers going through my whole body. My feet and hands were like ice cubes. I curled up and stuck my head under the covers, but keep shaking. Got up about 5 am, and stood by the fireplace. Heavy shaking stopped by 7am. I continued with lighter shivers through the morning. Temperature taken at noon showed low grade fever of 99.4 ..  Took Tylenol and felt better. Not much of an appetite had toast and chicken noodle soup to eat, lots of water. Following day I felt back to normal.

I was laid down, cold compress. It came in waves over a period of 20 minutes. I was given a few sips of water. When it did not resolve I was taken to the ER and given IV fluids.  The doctor said I had an adverse reaction to something in the vaccine. The chief of Infectious disease thought I had a vaso vagel response.  While I am nervous to get the second vaccine , I will go forward and get it..

I called in sick. My left arm symptoms lasted about 5 days. After the swelling went down, I continued with body aches, fever and cough. I tested negative for COVID on the 30th. My husband tested positive on the 3rd and my job advised me to test again on the 5th and I was positive. Around the 10th, until 2 or 3 days ago, I&#39;ve had SOB with exhaustion and brain fog. Three days ago, I had a tele appt with  and received antibiotics. I now have sinus infection, secondary to COVID.

                                                I started noticing about an hour 1 and 1/2 later, I had chills. I was extremely achy with pain throughout my body. I felt like I was getting a bad case of the flu. I was very lethargic. The site itself was inflamed and warm. I couldn&#39;t function, so I went to bed and let my boss know I was having some sort of reaction. From that point I wasn&#39;t well. I eventually tested positive for COVID and now I have a sinus infection. The swelling at the site started to go down about 5 days later and my symptoms we residing as well for my arm itself. I still had body aches, fever, cough, brain fog, respiratory and sinus issues. I also had intermittent mild nausea.  Symptoms were alleviated  about a week ago.  I still have symptoms, but they are residual. I was on antibiotics prescribed by Dr. via Telemed.

I felt very anxious which is not typical for me, I have had several other vaccines with no reaction in past. I had left the facility following 15 minutes of monitoring and took off my mask in the car. I looked in mirror because my face felt so warm. My husband was with me and symptoms did not worsen so we went home which only took 10 minutes and after another 30 minutes it did not subside so I took a low dose of liquid Benadryl. This eventually relieved my symptoms. I took another low dose at bedtime also. I slept through the night and had no further problem the next day. Thus  I did not contact a physician or the facility.

I was having difficulty catching my breath and unable to burp or clear the liquid.  After three tries, I was able to clear the airway and was able to breathe well.  I also checked my blood pressure which was 163/83.  I had phlegm in my throat and could clear it with drinking water.  After approximately 40 minutes of checking and rechecking my blood pressure and drinking water, I was able to sleep until 9:00 am.  It is now 24 hours from the injection and I feel much better.

That subsided, then I had persistent itching at the injection site.  That subsided but now have large, hard red patch the size of a tangerine at the injection sight that is slightly itchy and tender.  Have been experiencing slight nausea on and off, mostly in the mornings. Six days after injection I was feeling light-headed, dizzy and like I was just going to faint or fade away.  Still have those symptoms on and off, but they are not as strong.

                                                I felt foggy and disoriented and tired within a half hour of receiving the vaccine.   I felt pain in my arm traveling to my underarm.  After an hour I felt like the inside of my skin was prickly and tingly, my face was flushed and burning.  I was so tired I had to lay down.  I just stared into space.  There was ringing in my ears.  My heart rate was a good 20 beats per minute faster than normal.  By bedtime, my face was slightly swollen and I was unable to read because the letters were jiggly.  I had a traveling headache from the side to the top of my head through my eyes.  My breathing was more rapid and shallow.  I felt intermittent chest tightness. And pain.  The next morning, I felt better, but the prickly skin continued and my chest and back were  sore.  I had intermittent cramping in my feet and was sore in my joints.  My arm was very tender.  I was still tired and my heart rate was still elevated.  I did not sleep well and got up frequently during the night to walk around.  By the third day the prickly skin was almost gone, but I have had cramping in my chest and feet.  I am very tired.  I still have an occasional traveling headache.

                                                Patient awakened in the morning with pain and swelling in the right knee with marked tenderness laterally and local swelling in the same area.  Over the next 12 hours she developed a moderate synovial effusion of approximately 20 cc with pain in the knee becomeing generalized and had trouble walking and decreased range of motion consistent with the effusion. .  The pain seemed to subside somewhat later in the day but she still had trouble walking.  On the second night of 2/6/2021 she was able to sleep but had continued discomfort, swelling and difficulty walking on 2/7/2021.  The pain became even worse during the night of 2/7/21 and she was unable to sleep.  In the early morning  she took 5 mg hydrocodone and got some relief.. She continued to have pain and swelling through the day.  By the evening of 27/21 she was somewhat better.  The morning of 2/8 21 she awakened with less pain, less effusion, and was able to walk better.  She slept well that night.  On the morning of 2/9/ she awakened with no pain.  The effusion was gone and the knee felt stiff but no longer was painful.  By afternoon she was walking without pain and complaining of slight stiffness.    The only other side effect was pain at the injection sight for 2 days which was mild to moderate.  The R knee never felt warm and was never red.  .  I have an infrared camera and the temps recorded on the right knee were no higher than the left knee.  No other joints were involved and she had no recent right knee injury.  No chills, fever, nausea or other problems.  No headache, No myalgias. No vision or auditory prob.ems.  The sense of smell remained normal.  She is my wife and I was considering getting a CBC, Sed Rate, C-reactive protein and possibly an arthrocentesis and evaluation of the fluid.  Since she improved markedly and quickly no tests were done.  I will report any follow-up problems.   It just seemed very strange to have a painful swollen joint with no redness or warmth that was fairly severe and then almost totally resolve within 24 hours between the 3rd and forth day.  .

                                                Headache for 3 days, cognitive problems that lasted for 2.5 weeks.  I would frequently drop items held in my hands, had difficulty typing on a keyboard, had problems with tasks such as sewing , doing crossword puzzles and remembering things. For example, for many years I would do the  crossword puzzle in ink and be able to complete it.  During this time, I could only finish about 1/3 of the puzzle and then give up in frustration.  Another example: I have been using a Nutribullet to grind coffee beans once a week for years.  I had trouble assembling it for use.  I tried to screw on the top having it face the wrong side.  I could tell this was not correct but it took a minute to figure it out. I did not seek treatment since these things seemed subtle and I did not think clearly enough to think of that option! The symptoms have slowly resolved over a 2.5 week period.  I will not get the 2nd dose because of this reaction.

                                                I woke  up at 3:30 a.m. February 11.  I noticed I had wet the bed (which I haven&#39;t done for 60&#43; years) and felt very weak--afraid to move for fear I would pass out.  I had no pain and no indication of heart attack or stroke.  After 5-10 minutes I walked to the bathroom where I had diarrhea and vomited a small amount. I stayed on the stool for some time because I felt too weak to safely get up.  I did go back to bed after 15 minutes or so.  I got up again with diarrhea an hour or so later. I got up at 9 a.m. feeling  a lot better but still weak.  Took it easy the rest of the day and had regained most of my energy by evening.  I think I may have suffered a seizure of some kind resulting in the wet bed and extreme weakness.

The next morning I woke up feeling awful, I had a fever of just over 100 and chills, vomiting and diarrhea, body aches and a medium headache. This lasted the full day. I couldn&#39;t eat or drink anything...kept coming back up and out... really awful. When I had Covid-19 back in March although I had a fever for 10 days, I had none of these symptoms... I just lost my sense of taste and smell for 7 months.

By 9:00 p.m. I was shaking from chills (despite being bundled up under a blanket), so I took my temperature -- it was 100.5 degrees orally.  My normal temperature on that thermometer is 97.6 degrees.   That night, I kept waking up every two hours or so and was very uncomfortable.  THe next day I felt very lethargic -- unable to do anything other than make myself something to eat.  I took two naps, one in the morning, and the other in the afternoon (that was about two hours).  I felt slightly better by around 8 p.m.  That night I slept somewhat better and felt myself break into a sweat during the night -- so I guess that is when the fever broke.  The next day (today) my temperature was back to normal and I feel okay.  Throughout the now three days, the arm where I got the shot was painful, but gets less so each day.

So hard, I still felt cold, but this wasn?t shivering,  I wanted to go to get in warm water.  I was shaking so bad I couldn?t take my clothes off.   I got in with clothes on, I was getting delirious.   My whole body was contracting so hard I couldn?t sit in the tub flat, my but cheeks contracting with all muscles.   I found myself in the night with a sticking hat soaked in water to cover my face.  I could not have called for help when the muscle contractions  were going on.  That lasted I think 30-45 minutes.  I was groggy on the 20th all day but getting much better.   I was very excited for vaccine and would do it again, but wanted to report what I consider pretty rough side effect, so you could make note of it.

                                                Patient experienced dizziness and high blood pressure (140s/100s) and tongue tingling. Patient was monitored for 30 minutes and the dizziness improved. We gave her a bottle of water to drink and crackers and she said she felt better. The tongue tingling went away as well before the 30 minutes ended. Her blood pressure was retaken before she left and it remained in the 140s/100s. She said this is higher than her normal but it could be due to anxiety.

I had to take Tylenol every 4-5 hours the next day or the fever returned.  The fever and bad headache lasted 24 hours. The chills and shaking stopped within 2 hours of first being awoken by them.    48 hours after the vaccine I developed a redness on my arm about an inch from the injection site. It grew in diameter to 4 inches. It was very hot to the touch and itchy. Today is day 6 from getting the vaccine and it is finally starting to fade and is not hot to the touch today. I am assuming it will disappear with a day or two.   I researched on the computer and saw that it is being called &#34;covid arm&#34;.  I did not seek any medical attention knowing that the vaccine could cause these issues.

Then, about a week after the injection (Thurs. 2/25/21) I developed a red rash (approx. 2&#34; X 4&#34;) at and extending below the injection site. Plus my arm began aching.  Rash and aching worsened for the next two days through Sat. 2/27/21.  I took ibuprofen Sat. evening in order to sleep. By Sunday 2/28 the aching had mostly subsided and the rash gradually faded by 3/2.

Couldn&#39;t stop shaking.  I couldn&#39;t lift my arm past my waste.  Felt awful on Friday and I ended up running 101.8 fever.  I had a headache that day.  The fever finally broke on Saturday and I just felt weak and my arm still hurt. Today, Sunday, I suddenly have a big bright rash at the injection site on my arm, 6&#34;x3&#34;.  During the first one my arm hurt terribly, felt flu-ish, very low grade fever and ended up with &#34;COVID arm&#34; a big rash 8-9 days later at site of injection.

Oxygen was 97, heart rate 74 and BP was 132/72. Saturday woke up with pounding headache, knuckles on right hand still hurt. Slept better but woke up with red splotches/rash around injection site. Itchy, warm to touch and sore when pressed. Sunday, rash still there and still tired. Monday knuckles still sore on right hand, not so bad on left. Rash seems to be going away, but area still warm to touch and sore.

I was feeling really woozy... glad to be home.. I felt fine &amp; happy.. except for the woozy feeling and started feeling loopy...like I had drank a couple drinks..Not thinking correctly..This lasted for at least 4 hrs then less for 2 hrs.. then I went to bed . woke up the next morning foggy headed ,,till about afternoon. along with a verY sore arm  and a huge lump at the inj site ..also it did hurt when I got it..both the needle and going in. The soreness left after 2 days the bump took longer. And I still have a bruise where I got it.  I did learn 1 thing,,DO NOT TEXT AFTER THE SHOT if you feel like this,,,,, didn&#39;t make much sense at all..And I didn&#39;t remember half of what I said till the next day and reread it,, ..Like texting while drinking...ugh. but I didn&#39;t feel bad except for my arm and little headache. I googled and saw where others had the same feeling ...loopy woozy after .

Itching progressed,  made me nervous because I am allergic to other things and its the same symptoms. As my temperature would change slightly, no fever, but elevated for me I feel uncomfortable. Persisted into the week. Made appt with my immunologist. Put on weeks worth of antihistamines; night and day. It did help and gradually help. The itching lasted for quite a while,  2nd dose was recommended to take a antihistamine before vaccination. No itching with the second dose.  RASS test in a month

                                                Began with stabbing pain in left shoulder that woke me up every 2 hours all night long. Progressed to massive migraine headache in a wide band across my forehead.  Found fluid pooling in a channel from my armpit past my elbow; rubbed on it and raise arm until it went away. Muscles in left arm stopped working; couldn&#39;t move my arm; put left arm in a sling.  Started feeling like I was burning up with fever, but body temperature was normal 98.8 degrees. Several hours later was having sudden chills and found body temperature had risen to 102 degrees F.  Developed high blood pressure for me. The lymph node in my neck were swelling, armpit tender to touch, and left breast tender to touch too.  Started icing the back of my neck to take down temp. Put ice on my shoulder to try to cool the pain.  I was very frightened and worried that: (1) got sepsis bacterial infection from shot (2) got bad lot of Moderna or (3) Moderna vaccine sat out at room temperature too long and had gone bad.  48 hours after the 2nd dose and after icing, symptoms started to ease.

I now have constant tinnitus and am having my hearing checked next week because I feel I have hearing loss.   The fatigue is debilitating.  I start to feel better and another wave hits me.  I was advised by my doctor to not take the second dose.  The tinnitus is getting louder.  It causes anxiety.  I don?t know how I am going to live with it.

Couldn&#39;t move my left arm at all without sharp pain.  Had to keep arm in position like it was in a sling for about 15 hours.  After 15 hours could move it slightly, but couldn&#39;t lift arm, button shirt, lift milk carton. Each day, it improves slightly and I can move it more. But today, 3/12/21, it still isn&#39;t back to normal and there are still sharp pains if I make the wrong move.  2) Large red oval patch on left arm appeared on 3/5/21 in the evening.  It was slightly swollen with itchy bumps (like poison ivy) for about 12-15 hours. After that, itch and swelling were gone, but a flat red patch remained for about 3 days.

                                                Abdominal red rash warm to touch ( NO itching or blistering)  Centerline Neck red rash warm to touch (NO itching or blistering) It developed approximately 28 hours after 2nd Covid-Moderna vaccination.  I also was sick to my stomach, achy and very fatigued.  Slept most of that day. Next day the rash was larger in area and more inflamed.  Benadyl 25mg taken  @ 1pm and 9pm that day.  Also at 9pm H2 blocker and Ibuprofen 400 mg taken before bed.  By day 3 rash on my abdomen was gone but still had rash on neck.  As of today it is gone.

Then, yesterday, 03-12-21, I noticed that the site was warm to the touch and there is a red rash around the site along with swelling/a tight lump in the site, sensitivity as well as continuation of the itching.   Avoided sleeping on the site due to tenderness.  Upon waking today, 03-13-21, attention was drawn to the site because of the itch and sensitivity; the lump also seems to be a bit bigger.  I did sign up with the v-safe site this morning to follow-up. Not sure of next step....

The next morning I had flu symptoms so I took acetaminophen every six hours, drank a lot of water,and rested throughout the day. Next day the body pain and chills are gone but still feel tired.

After the second vaccination, my arm became very sore during the day.  When I went to bed at 11pm, I was unable to sleep for about 45 minutes because I was shivering and unable to stop.  I added additional clothing and finally managed to stop shivering and sleep.  My sleep was restless all night, with bad dreams, a headache, and neck pains.  My  watch indicated that my sleeping heart rate was higher than average throughout the night.  After showering at 7am and forcing myself to carry on, I felt better later in the morning and all symptoms were gone.

                                                In the evening, I guess around 9 p.m., after I filed last report  vac site started itching with pain and hardness and swelling in area around shot site, that had practically disappeared over previous two days, suddenly increased a lot (on your scale it would be halfway). At 3 am March 11 the itching was so severe it woke me (would be near the top of your scale). Also an arthritis reaction Type 3 delayed serum allergy was quite noticeable in joints. I took Benadryl and an hour later a prednisone tablet from a bottle that expired three years ago. Neither symptom worsened after that and were better in the morning and diminished over the next couple of days. Except the following two evenings the significant itching around vaccination site returned around 9 pm (but not as bad as the scary 3 am episode). I didn?t take anything else for it by mouth, but I put some triamcinolone acetonide over the area of the shot and that stopped the itching enough to sleep. Arm soreness continues but is minor.

These symptoms went away within approximately 5 minutes. The next morning I woke with a slight headache which didn&#39;t last very long. I had significant discomfort in the left arm at the injection site.  It felt like someone had inserted a balloon in the muscle.  It hurt to raise my arm to 90 degrees and above my head.  I became less aware of it about 9:00 pm the following night.  I called my doctor to report the side effects and it was recommended that I take 2 extra strength tylenol.  I still feel some discomfort at the injection site.

Starting the next morning after the vaccines, I had a horrible headache especially in my forehead and upper neck.  I very achy, much more than normal, my arm was very sore.  My temperature usually runs about 97.1 and during the night it spiked to 99.1.  I also had no appetite.  It takes a lot for me to realize I don&#39;t feel well because I don&#39;t feel that great anyway, but I definitely did not feel well.  I slept very little that night. By the next morning I felt much better and was back to &#34;normal&#34; by midafternoon.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At ~10 minutes into my 15 minute &#34;observation&#34; period post vaccine, I became extremely dizzy and weak; feeling as if I would fall out of my chair.  I gripped the chair with both hands and put my head down between my knees. 2 EMTs that were on-site came over and talked to me; put me into a wheel chair and took me to their &#34;tent&#34; area in the gym and had me lay down on a cot.  They kept me under observation (completing blood pressure, heart rate, pulse-ox, and temp monitoring) for ~1 hour/15 minutes.  I was somewhat recovered, and wanted to go home. They told me I should contact my doctor for evaluation before returning for the second dose, scheduled for 4 weeks out.   An EMT walked me to my car.  I drove myself home.  I continued to experience continuous (but milder) dizziness and weakness for the rest of the day,  mostly recovered by the following morning. (I also experienced typical side effects of soreness at the injection site, starting later that first day; and mild headache and fatigue the following day).

Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).

                                                Five minutes after the shot I felt lightheaded and funny. Then my heart started to beat hard.  It didn&#39;t last too long and by the time I told the nurse she checked my pulse and said it was strong but normal. They watched me for 30 min. I felt better, but ever since then I have had flutterings of the heart.  I called my doctor who said it was nerves and to take the second shot. About ten days later I went to Urgent care who did a electrocardiogram and said it was normal, they didn&#39;t catch the flutterings.  They told me it was nerves and to take the second shot. 14 days after the shot I took Claritin D which seemed to calm the heart.  I am taking it every day now, until I&#39;m sure the flutterings are gone.  I&#39;m pretty sure I had an allergic reaction and I will not be taking the second shot unless you can assure me I should. I called my doctor again and was told they weren&#39;t seeing sick people, go to a heart specialist, although they didn&#39;t recommend one.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid last March.  I received my first vaccine March 3 of this year.  I got a temperature of 103 degrees,  I was nourish , my muscles, Joints and bones hurt so much I couldn&#39;t lift myself out of bed without extreme pain.  The chills I got made me literally shake.  My arm where I was given the shot, I couldn&#39;t lift it.  Even the other arm hurt bad.  My mouth hurt, my teeth hurt, my gums bleed for four days after and the teeth hurt too for that length of time.  My stomach was itchy but no rash.  I felt like I had the virus again minus other issues I had when I did have it.   I&#39;m scheduled to receive my second dose March 31 and I&#39;m very very nervous about it.  I don&#39;t think people who had the virus, especially those who had it very bad like myself, should get vaccinated.     It took 2 weeks to recover from all the pain.   HELP!

Although my range has improved, it has been almost 2 weeks and my left arm/shoulder hurts, aches, and is still painful. It interrupts my sleep. (This was a different experience from the 1st Moderna shot.) Treatment includes ice/heat, advil, and a massage.

Extreme weakness for the rest of the day with chills, some body aches, a little nausea. 3/15, 7 AM--woke up after 9&#43; hours of sleep and felt great. Drank water, took the dog for a walk (about an hour). Returned to my house and was talking to a neighbor when I was overwhelmed with lightheadedness and nausea, told her I needed to sit down and suddenly passed out. Came to in about a minute, had a cut in my head from hitting the concrete and could not stand without feeling dizzy. An ambulance was called and I was transported to the local hospital. Was given fluids and anti-nausea medication in the ambulance.

The morning of 3/11/21 I woke up sweating with a fever and this very strange feeling was rolling through my body, from my head, down to my toes, then back up to my head and on and on.  I took my temperature and it was 100.5 F. Also, I had begun breaking out in a few hive-like red welts on my legs, arms, stomach, back,  maybe 8 to 10, hard to tell,  but strange looking, unusual,  and uncomfortable.  Then around that Wednesday, the 16th, my urine was brownish and smelled smoky.  I had not taken any supplements in days. The next day it was beige, smoky, then the next day bright yellow.  The next day it went back to normal. More welts.   EXTREME exhaustion.  Then  on  the 18th I developed chills and more itching and welts. One on my face.  One or two on my scalp.  More around my waist, arms, neck, and legs.  I am still having intermittent chills and hives/welts, and EXTREME  tiredness.  I have a cold sore in my mouth or throat, I can&#39;t tell exactly where.

                                                Got the vaccine, and about 24 hours later she started to feel an ache in her front left tooth.  She was wondering if this was due to the vaccine or not.  She was unable to lift her arm as well.  In a couple of hours it was real sore and she kept hitting it with her tooth.  Her upper gum was then tender and could not touch it.  She then could not chew on the front left tooth, and even hurt with touching of her tongue.  As the night progressed more teeth were tender, and the lip was also more tender.  She started to get a headache and then all of her joints were starting to hurt.  The next morning, Friday morning she had no energy at all, just felt terrible.  Her face was now swollen, as well as her upper lip.  That night it was getting worse adn worse and her gums were so itchy and all the teeth on the left side felt loose.  It then reached her jaw and then the swelling went to her eye.  She called her PCP, and put on antibiotics, to take a antihystamine and a steroid.  Told her to go to the ER if it did not gete better.  It was horrible by Monday morning, she went to UC and had an abscess in her tooth.  They put her on penicillin, told her not to take the other antibiotics.  By Tuesday morning the swelling had gone down, and the swelling in the gums were also gone, and the teeth were also better.  The abscess was also feeling better.  She had no issues with her gums and teeth prior to this.  By the time she finished the penicillin she was fine.  She went to the dentist and they could not find anything wrong with her, and informed her that it was proof that the vaccine was doing it&#39;s job.

Went away in a minute or two.  During the day felt a little off, took shower, had dizziness again.  Had to sit down in fear of falling over.  Since then I have  had slight bouts of minor dizziness.  Just an unsure overall feeling that something isn&#39;t quite right. It is now Thursday, still feeling weird.

                                                The delayed reaction began on March 24, 2021 in the early evening.  My right arm (bicep and injection site area) began to itch and break out in a rash.  I applied over the counter hydrocortisone and took a Chlorpheniramine Maleate 4 mg allergy tablet.  The site continued to itch throughout the night and woke me up several times.  Upon rising on March 25, 2021 I looked at my arm and the top of my shoulder and the rash had spread and there were large red hives that were hot to the touch, itching, swelling, and painful.  I decided it was time to call my Dr. and make an appointment. I was not able to see him and was referred to his colleague.  I went to see her at 11:30 a.m. She diagnosed the rash as a Moderna Delayed Reaction.  She prescribed a prescription strength Hydrocortisone Cream to be applied3 times daily  and Chlorpheniramine Maleate 4 mgs. since I am allergic to Benadryl every four hours. As of today, March 26, 2021 the rash has improved but still has the intense itch that travels down my arm and up.

Her arm was sore and she could not sleep on her arm. She woke up this morning w/ 101.7 fever, achy. and loss of appetite.   She took  acetaminophen which would bring her fever down but when it wears off the fever goes back up.  So far she has had two doses of acetaminophen.   She feels some better and think she is improving.

                                                Arm was sore where shot was given Saturday, 1:45PM March 6. Noticed slight muscle aches that afternoon. By 8PM those effects continued. I went to bed early and awoke in the night with extreme thirst and severe chills. I put on layers and heat was blasting near my head from below headboard.  I had a fever of 104 degrees which went down soon after I removed layers. I recall being very hard to get out of bed when the chills were at their worst so I was in a fetal position to try to stay warm. Sunday, thirst, chills and fever were gone, but I had an intermittent headache, sore arm where shot was given and my other arm!, also muscle aches and tiredness. By Monday, I had muscle aches,  tiredness and light-headedness; Tuesday I had slight nausea and headache a short while, but mainly tiredness. Wednesday, I still had soreness where shot was given, tiredness and light-headedness, but otherwise was feeling better.  I canceled plans Thursday involving heavy physical labor (native plant restoration)  just to rest a bit more. Basically, I had a bouquet of symptoms over several days - grateful not to have had all at once and can only imagine how bad coronavirus must be.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

I stopped by a restaurant to get some take out and must of started feeling disorientated and completely forgot I had this folder with the VSAFE information. I started feeling chills all over my body, I kept taking my temperature it was 95.7, I started having a headache top of my head, the temporal, the back of my neck. They were all over the place. I went to bed and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It was like my brain was going crazy, it wasn&#39;t like an anxious feeling. I finally feel asleep around 4am and kept waking up remembering fragments of valid dreams. The dreams were fragment with such dread and anxiety in them.  It was like a huge wave of depression and anxiety. By about 9am I was fully awake, but my body hurt, my muscles ached I felt fatigued. The chills and headaches were through. I was still having weird racing thoughts. About 10pm it all went away and I slept fine and woke up the next morning and I was fine. My arm is still sore at the injection site but all the other symptoms went away.    Saturday morning I was talking with a friend on the phone, and she reminded me of the folder I received the folder. I completely forgot about this folder. I found this folder later that day and then I tried to access VSAFE. It made me realize how disorientated I was.

Started with severe chills, body shaking, achy all over, head felt like it was going to implode, started to sweat and felt flushed.  Woke up my spouse to get me something to take for headache, etc.  Later that morning could hard lift the Arm, felt a golf ball size lump at injection site and warm to the touch. Was in bed 2 days bcuz it exacerbated my MS.  After that the injection site started itching, with redness.  Lump finally getting smaller.  I took a photo of the injection site which has a red circle the size of my hand.

                                                Evening of shot, sore arm and extreme fatigue.  Following day, tired with ?brain fog?.  Third day, brain fog worsens, depression begins. Fourth day, confusion, withdrawal from interacting with others, worsening depression.  Subsequent days, increasing confusion and severe memory problems. Becoming alarmed at inability to respond and ?find words?.  By weekend, (5 days after shot) suicidal ideation, stopped talking to people (I live alone, but would regularly speak to neighbors and family prior to this episode).  This rather alarming condition finally began to lift about 2days ago.    I have a decades-long history of depression and have taken medication for it on and off since my 30?s. I must say I have concerns about getting a second shot next month because of the major depression as well as memory problems. ( I have been experiencing memory challenges for the last few years, and my Mom died of Alzheimer?s.)

                                                I had the expected very mild soreness at the injection site for several days.  The headaches came on the night after the vaccine and have continued.  Every night I get a headache with onset sometime between 1 a.m and 4:00 a.m. , making it difficult to sleep.  The headache lasted all day on the 25th and 26th, but since then usually clears with morning coffee.  Last night the headache started at 1:00 a.m. (earliest yet) and at 2:00 I took a Motrin and .125 g. Alprazolam and slept okay the rest of the night.  Is this an interplay with my immunosuppression?  I will eliminate the sleep time tea, but I honestly can?t fathom that would be a cause.  Thank you for taking note of this and for responding if you can.

Was taken home by daughter. Lightheadedness continued and some trouble focusing continued and desire to fall asleep. Took my bp ,it was 85/61.pulse 109.I hydrated with 3 bottles of water and ate olives to increase sodium level. an hour later bp was up to 107/67,pulse 67. I continued to monitor my bp through the next 24 hrs. I skipped my blood pressure meds  for that night and continued with them the next day when my pressure was back to normal range. I did not use my epipen.  Would have gone to ER if I was unable to control my hypotension. I am an RN.

The next day injection site began to swell. By the 8th day post injection it was hard to the touch, about the size of a large marshmallow and hard to the touch. No skin discoloration,  but felt warm to touch and very itchy. Used Lanacanevto stop the itch.  Today the 11th, most of swelling is gone and just a little tender to touch. Did not contact anyone medical about this, but a friend said i should report it.

                                                The night of the same day I rec&#39;d the vaccine, my body was very achy.  I did not think to take my temperature, as I was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Dec 17th and I had ONLY common cold symptoms with NO fever.  The day after the vaccine 2/10, I woke early feeling TERRIBLE, I had chills for hours. I took my temperature right away at 7am and it was 100.4.  My regular temp with the forehead thermometer is 97.7 or 97.8.  I had the fever all day and night, I was nausea, I had a very bad headache, body aches and felt completely fatigued.  I went to bed at 7:30pm that night and slept all night. I work without a fever the next day 2/11 but still felt tired and slightly nauseous all day. That night I went to bed at very early.

I fell asleep about 9:15 am on 2-13-2021 for about an hour and woke with fever but could hardly move.  I have had body ache from  being sick with flu before but never where I could hardly move.  I could drink but had no appetite that day.  The fever got to 103 at one point .  Eventually the fever broke about 4:00 am on  2-14 -2021.  The site where the shot was administered was swollen  with a rash that spread out about 5  inches long by 3 inches wide.  I had no side effects at all from first dose.

                                                The injection was painless and I was very happy to finally be able to receive this vaccine.  Evening on the first day began to feel slightly feverish 99.2, body aches, fatigue,  slight ache in my arm at injection site.  This continued into the next day and nights.  No problems at all in days 3 through 6.  In the evening of the 7th days began with fatigue, body aches, fever 99.4, chills.  Did not sleep well that night due to body aches and chills and woke the next morning - day 8 with very red, sore arm just below the injection site that started out in a circle and expanded to about 2&#34; x 3&#34; area.

                                                36 hours later, (approximately), I woke up with a rash. Under the both arms it looked like a sunburn. Across the chest an sides, it was spotty. The right side had more rash than the right, and both sides wrapped around to the back, about 2 inches, on both sides. Less going down the rest of the torso. Took Benadryl, 2-25 mg, 4 hours apart, for a total of 100 mg. 1:00PM, Feb. 26, rash faded significantly.  Also had a dry mouth and a bit of a racing heart, right after being given the vaccination &amp; again when the rashes appeared. However, this could have been anxiety. Both times it went away after walking &amp; deep breathing. Lasted for about 15 minutes each time.

                                                Began not feeling well about 8 hours after my shot. That night I developed a fever (under 100 degrees) and chills. Had some heart palpitations. Next day I still had a slight fever, general malaise, soreness from shot in arm, a few occurances of heart palpitations, sore back. On third day, no fever, but still felt under the weather, with a sore arm plus some hardness in the injection area. Had some palpitations that evening. By the 4th day, felt better in general, but began feeling a very slight numbness on lips and surrounding facial area. Arm still sore with hardness. Better on 5th day. Day 8 &amp; 9 had pains in lower shins. Day 9 I noticed tiny small bumps on upper front and back shoulders and upper arms. They were not hive like and some were itchy. Took some Benadryl that night which didn&#39;t reallly help. Days 10-12 - still have tiny bumps some slightly pink, mostly skin tone, spreading to neck area. Saw my internist on 2/25/21 Day 14 to ask if symptoms related to vaccine shot. He didn&#39;t think the rash was related because it didn&#39;t start away after shot. The continuing ever so slight numbness in lips and surrounding area may be just from anxiety, he said. 3/1/21 - still have occasional slight numbness off and on of lips with &#34;grainy&#34; rash still present.

                                                The second Moderna intramuscular injection  felt different from the first injection.  This one hurt when injected.  About 3:15p.m. that same day, I noticed the arm started hurting.  It later became very painful and I had lost strength in the arm and I could not lift my arm.  This was alarming to me and I thought there may have been nerve damage.  The fatigue, fever and headache came the next day and the arm was painful and unusable.  At 2:30pm  on Saturday, Feb. 27th, I took 3 Aleve to relieve the pain in my arm.  I had hoped to not take anything after getting the vaccine, but I could not stand the pain any longer.  I researched online and read about SIRVA.  I thought that was  responsible for the pain.  The Aleve helped.  By Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021, the pain had abated and I could use my arm.  My fever, fatigue and headache had gone too.  My intention in submitting this is to request that more explicit reactions be listed so that someone like me, living alone, would know that this is a possible reaction and to let it run its course.  This caused me undue stress, on top of feeling lousy and being in a great deal of pain, not the mention my fear of never being able to use that arm again.  That may sound like an overreaction, but until you have had a  limb rendered useless, no matter how hard you try to move it, it is frightening.  I would appreciate any feedback on my experience and I would like to know if others have experieinced this too.  Thank you.

Then she took her temp around 11:00 PM and hers was 100.  Almost the feeling of having the COVID virus all over.  Had night sweats, still doing that.  Joint aching, muscle aching, just wiped out with no energy.  Overall weakness, like a dishrag.  Took Tylenol for the fever.    Still having the night sweats last night but otherwise basically back to normal.

My arm was sore , as expected, and I felt some body aches, and tiredness. It wasn&#39;t until Tuesday that my mouth was feeling numb and the bad taste in my mouth returned. I did not have an appetite to eat. It didn&#39;t seem to bother me as much during the day as nighttime. I would wake up in the middle of the night with a terrible taste in my mouth and nausea. It seemed to be most uncomfortable by Thursday evening and I drank a lot of water all day Friday. I did not eat much on Friday because of the nausea and taste in my mouth. After I did eat something early Friday evening, I became very tired. Today I am better. I do not feel like my mouth is numb, and the bad taste is not completely gone, but I feel better. I will drink a lot of water today.

                                                tingling in ears and chin after injection. By 11:00 pm, 12 hours after the vaccination, I began developing a painful headache and severe body aches and joint pain from head to toe.  It actually hurt to lay down.  I was unable to sleep, even after taking Tylenol.  I spent the day dozing on the couch and by late evening, about 10:00 pm. I began to feel slightly better.  The pain in my shoulders and the area on my upper back beneath my neck felt like one giant connected  muscle with awful pain that was a combination of pressure and tightness.  I slept well that night and woke yesterday (Sunday) without the severe pain.  No headache and only slight discomfort.  Today (Monday) I feel mostly okay but there is still some residual discomfort even after a 3 mile walk this morning.

I slept for about 2 days and couldn&#39;t stay awake.   Headache  started that evening.   I still have the headache  3 weeks later with no relief.   My right cheek and gums hurt so bad too.

                                                the day after the vaccine I slept all day.  Next day felt 100% better.  On the 3rd day I began feeling exhaustion and weakness as though I had been very sick and my body was having difficulty recovering.  20 years ago I had an autoimmune issue (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and asthma that took me about 10 years to get under control. I started getting shortness of breathe and I was concerned I may have gotten COVID, but I since took a test and do not and have never tested positive (about 5 tests).  I had 2 days of Renaud&#39;s incidence when one segment of my right forefinger completely drained of blood, and turned white.  (Same finger both days). It took me 10 minutes of massage and windmills with my arm to bring color back to the finger.  The shortness of breathe continues weeks later and it appears my asthma has returned.  Went to the doctor last week and we are starting with and inhaler to see if that takes care of it.  I have had to use it every day since I got prescription 3/6 - all day the first day, lesser since.  Still shortness of breathe and feeling compromised.    My sister has worse autoimmune problems and MSRA.  After her Moderna vaccine last week she was confined to bed the whole week with her 1st vaccination.  She had not been exposed to COVID that she is aware of. Neither of us ever smoked.  Could be our lungs were already compromised with both parents heavy smokers and growing up where all the smog from the 1960&#39;s would linger. Our breathing would ache from exertion.  A brother, once a heavy smoker, has had emphysema, and serious heart damage from a heart attack, and suffers from a lack of O2.  He has not had a shot yet and we are concerned about his response.

                                                The day after the shot I was tired, groggy and achy. I took two naps and some ibuprofen. In the days following, I experienced severe aches and pains in my upper arms and thighs. This continued and got steadily worse for  two weeks. No fever or loss of taste. I called the doctor and was told people have different reactions, maybe I should get tested for  covid. I did not. Pain continued. I had trouble sleeping, despite constant ibuprofen. I could not turn over in bed. End of the third week I went to an accupuncturist/massage therapist, who has helped me before . I &#39;ve had two treatments and am feeling incrementally better each day. Thinking back on how I feel today--which is still achy, as you might feel with the flu--I realize I was in serious agony for those weeks before treatment. Just prior to the shot, I had been for a full physical and bloodwork and was judged by my doctor to be one of the healthiest people in her practice. I was perfectly fine before this shot.

I was in bed before 9 pm. due to extreme tiredness, and awoke about 40 minutes later with severe leg cramps accompanied by burning sensations throughout leg veins. This lasted about 15 minutes, compared with 90 minutes the month before after vaccination #1. The ensuing 36 hours, through which I mostly slept, had bouts of nausea, fatigue, fever and chills. All these were listed as possible side effects, except leg issues.

                                                Shortly after my second dose of Moderna, I started experiencing pain in my upper left thigh, while sleeping and upon waking.  This pain caused me to have to alter my sleep habit of laying on my left side.  As soon as I stepped on my leg, I felt a shooting pain.  This leg/thigh continues today.  I&#39;ve been able to relieve this pressure with over the counter pain pills and a heating pad.  I&#39;ve started using a walking cane, in the mornings.  The first appointment I was able to secure is June 8, 2021.

                                                My arm became very sore about 20 minutes after the vaccination, and continued to become more sore and painful. I woke at about 3 am the morning after the vaccination with flu symptoms, very similar to a those in a 3-week illness from last March, 2020. Sinus pain and pressure, low fever, muscle aches, weakness. I was the same later that day, the and continued to have a low fever. By the next day those symptoms were gone, but I felt weak and very fatigued, chilled, and slept much of the day. The symptoms of extreme fatigue, feeling chilled, continued until late on Friday evening, the 19th. I am normally a very active person, but the fatigue was frightening, and not something I normally suffer from. From about 2pm on each day after being vaccinated, my energy plummeted, and the extreme fatigue set in and I slept all afternoon each day and then all night, each day feeling okay in the mornings, then boom, extreme fatigue beginning around 2 pm. I have only experience this kind of fatigue once when I had the flu many years ago, and also last March when my doc thought I had Covid, sent me to the emergency room to be tested, but at that time, they were only testing people who had just returned from China. I want to stress, I am rarely ill, I am very active, and to date am on no medications except vitamins. But last March I was very ill for three weeks then about three more weeks were needed for recovery.  My symptoms from this second vaccination have subsided, but with a small amount of fatigue remaining in the afternoons. So, I wonder, from the studies coming out, that I may have indeed had Covid last March, and my immune reaction to the second vaccine was extremely strong. And, possibly I only needed the first vaccination. I filed a Vaers report on my symptoms after the first vaccination, that were also strong, including Covid arm, but subsided about 5 days after that vaccination, a month earlier.

The second day I noticed that I had lost words and names of people, and was having to describe who or what I was talking about.  My brain works pretty well so this was disturbing.  Also having trouble using the computer - fingers keep being in the wrong place or cannot spell or spelling out the wrong word.  Having to look over this pretty well and hope it is understandable.

These symptoms were relentless for 48 hours and then I was very tired, weak and felt shakey inside, as if my blood sugar was too low( it was checked and was not low) for about 10 days. I am still tired but all other symptoms have resolved. It was a very intense, scary set of symptoms.

                                                First vaccine on 1/16/2021, I experienced some numbing of my limbs (arms and legs). It was random and typically didn&#39;t last too long (except one time in my left arm that was quite dramatic and I took Bayer aspirin immediately) but was definitely not a normal experience in my body.  After the second vaccine on 2/15/2021, the next day, I had the expected fever (100.1 to 100.9) throughout the next 2-days, along with no appetite, energy, or strength. I expected it to dissipate but by day 3 &amp; 4, I felt even weaker and more exhausted. As the days turned into weeks (5&#43; weeks now), I&#39;ve experienced severe exhaustion needing to sleep most days 9-13 hours, consistent numbness in my arms (con&#39;t next page) and some w/legs, blurry vision, and very unbalanced. I went from walking several miles a day to barely being able to walk a few blocks due to unbalance, weakness and being out of breath. This has gone on for over 5-weeks now. It feels like I am a long-hauler but without having had Covid. I&#39;ve always been sensitive to drugs, expected to have a reaction, but never imagined something like this would go on for so long.   During this period, I had two Covid tests on March 1 and March 10. Both were negative. The week of March 8, I came down with a good old fashioned cold. PCP asked for the second Covid test and chest x-ray (all clear) on March 10. PCP did lab work on March 5. Everything showed as &#34;unremarkable&#34;.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  I had a fever of 99.5 for 2 days and diarrhea for  2 days.  Fatigue and weakness during the whole week after the vaccine.  I couldn&#39;t eat or drink for 2 days and couldn&#39;t go for my usual walk for 4 days, and even then I wore out.  No desire yet to do anything but sleep. I was diagnosed with a UTI on 03-24-2021, so am having pain from that now, too.  Haven&#39;t had one of those since 2019, so there could be some correlation  there...I just don&#39;t feel well, like I used to.

She experienced this pain the same night of receiving her vaccine, and it disrupted her sleep. She also complained of difficulty breathing up on inhalation, saying that it hurts to inhale.

What surprised me is that the site (about 9 cm round) became very red and very itchy a full week later (01/05/2021) and is still pink and itchy now.  This is not at all serious, and Benadryl cream reduces the itching.  I am reporting it only because it is not listed as a side effect on the documentation or CDC website.

                                                I felt fine until the morning of Jan. 10 (except for very painful arm).  I was awakened early in the morning by severe vertigo (my eyes were blinking rapidly and the room was spinning violently); I was nauseous and couldn&#39;t lie down without the violent spinning re-occurring.  I was very dizzy and exhausted the whole day, unable to function.  The next day I continued to be very dizzy and off-balance, couldn&#39;t work but better than prior day.  Each day, same symptoms have continued but milder.  I called my PCP on Monday, Jan 11.  He told me it sounded like an inner ear problem, probably unrelated to the vaccine and to call him the next day and report my symptoms.  I did (Tues. Jan 12) and reported dizziness was milder but still there.  He suggested I see an ENT doctor.

My arm hurt to the shoulder to touch or move, left breast sore, left knee (artifical replacement) was sore under knee cap.  I took two extra strength tylenol for inflamation and slept for 2 hours.  Woke up in a pool fo sweat, but felt fine! Should I take the second dose?

                                                Started becoming very warm while resting in bed getting ready for sleep. Fell asleep and woke up a little while later sweating from head to toe and trembling. Thinking was hard, but not actually confused. I thought maybe I needed to eat something because occasionally I have low blood sugars (not diagnosed) and get sweaty and nauseated. I wasn&#39;t nauseated but thought I&#39;d try to eat something anyway but couldn&#39;t. The mental fog was very disconcerting. I don&#39;t know how long the sweat lasted but probably not more than 5 minutes. When it started abating, I laid down again and fell asleep. I didn&#39;t have any after effects when I woke up again. This may have nothing to do with the vaccination of course.

                                                Symptoms started on Saturday morning (1/16/2021)  following the shot having been administered the previous day (1/15/2021) at 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon.  Initially, I had a slight, constant  headache and &#34;medium&#34; fatigue.  I dismissed it as not important because it was relatively minor. and I am generally fatigued at the end of a work week.  The headache lasted all day but was fairly low level. I did not sleep well that night but was able to function during the next day (1/17/2021)  without a problem.  I don&#39;t remember if the headache was present that day.  However, on Sunday evening (1/17/2021) (around 6:00 p.m. or so) chills started to go up and down my body and my hands were very cold.  I had no fever.  I added more garments to keep warm and ignored or was distracted by my activities of the evening. Monday (1/18/2021) during the day the chills continued to go up and down my body  intermittently-- not really staying in one place -- but my hands remained very cold.  It should be stated that I prefer colder temperatures; i keep my house between 60-62 degrees in winter and I am able to stay comfortable with a shirt and sweater in that environment.  So, on Monday, the fact that I had chills was remarkable to me. The chills were intermittent. Tuesday (1/19/2021) I worked from home all day and had an electric heater going focused very closely on my body all day.  I was cold but don&#39;t remember having chills.  Tuesday evening the chills returned, along with a significant headache that circled my head (not focused in one spot), my body ached, my eyeballs ached; I had intestinal cramping .and I simply could not get warm due to the constant &#34;full-body&#34; chills. I went to bed with a heated mattress pad on,  flannel sheets, a comforter an d a thick wool  blanket. I could not get warm.  I was not able to sleep at all the entire night due mostly to the (major) physical discomfort and (minor) worry as to what was going on. I DID NOT have a fever. Around 8:30 on Wednesday morning, I was able to fall asleep as the chills had diminished and I was worn out. The body and eyeball aches were still present as was the intestinal cramping. Later that afternoon the symptoms started to diminish and I was able to sleep Wednesday night. I did not eat anything on Wednesday as I was not interested in food due to the discomfort of  the intestinal cramping. I was able to smell food and had not lost my sense of taste.  Thursday morning (1/21/2021,  I finally felt like I could eat and had  some food which tasted delicious to me.  I was able to get warm, had slight headache, cramping was mostly gone, ..I still had (reduced levels) body aches and eyeball aches.  I had no chills.  I was able to consume and tolerate reduced amounts of food.  Friday (1/22/2021) I was tired but able to function and felt as if I was returning to feeling like myself.  Today, Saturday(1/23/2021, I am feeling about 95% myself and relieved to have this behind me.  I am very concerned about how I might react to the second dose of the vaccine.  I am going to consult the local hospital and my PCP there to inquire about the advisability of getting the second dose.

I was fine all night and until two days later. I had the chills and a sore arm. When I awakened Saturday morning my arm was red and warm. I did not feel badly. I have had the redness and slight warmth each day. I went to the dr. on Monday. She thinks it is fine but ordered a low does steroid and oral cream. I decided to wait on the steroid for a few days as I am not feeling badly. My arm is still lightly red and slightly warm. I have no heart palpitations or other side affects. It is not blistery.

Figured this was normal so continued home. For the rest of the that day I felt lightheaded, dizzy and just wonky off and on the entire day. I later felt exhausted, like someone flipped a switch on me, around 3:00 pm and took a nap for 2 hours. After the nap I felt nauseous and like I was going to vomit. I ate dinner and later in the evening, I took some allergy medicine and felt a little better and went to bed.  The next day, Friday, I felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and again felt like I was going to vomit in the morning. I ate breakfast, felt nauseous, started cramping, had diarrhea and was then fine.  No more symptoms after that.  Although my arm is still tender today, Saturday.

I can usually do deep breathing or relaxing to calm my chills, but these would not let up.  It felt like my body was being squeezed.  I was finally able to get up and used a walker to get to the kitchen and took 1000 mg acetaminophen.  Without the walker, which I don&#39;t usually use, I was afraid I would not be able to stand up or would stumble due to my shaking.  By 4 am, the shaking had stopped enough for me to lay back down and I was able to get to sleep.  I had a fever of 99.8 when I woke up.  Later that morning it was 100.8.  By that night it had gone down to 98.7 and the next morning it was my normal 97.6 and I feel great.

                                                After receiving the injection, I was directed by an RN to sit in a chair for 15min in the same room. Five minutes after the injection I felt my upper back  muscles, ribcage area, contract.  The contraction continued around to the front of my chest with next 3 minutes.  I felt tightness with each breath.  The RN who gave me the injection came to see if I felt alright. She informed the charge nurse that my chest felt tight and the charge nurse came to ask me questions.  The charge nurse called the hospital pharmacist to come to see me.  The pharmacist arrived with various medications and talked to me.  He instructed me to do breathing exercises and meditate.  I told him that I was familiar with these techniques and using them.  I also informed the pharmacist that I had a heart attack in 2018 and had atrial tachycardia but I wasn&#39;t feeling any problems with my heart, that it was beating normally.  I also informed the pharmacist of my severe allergies to certain items but I wasn&#39;t experiencing any anaphylaxis that I&#39;ve experienced in past allergic episodes.  The pharmacist left and told the charge nurse to keep me a half hour longer under observation and to call him if I felt worse.  During that half hour, the muscle contractions stopped and I was able to breathe normally.  The charge nurse asked me if I was ready to leave after the half hour was up, I told her I was feeling odd so she said to stay another 20min.   I began to experience intestinal cramping and asked to leave to go to the bathroom.  In the bathroom I had a bout of diarreah that lasted 10minutes.  After that I drove home but was experiencing a headache that started.   The headache lasted for 20hrs. It felt like I was wearing tight hat, squeezing.  Iv&#39;e not had that type of headache before.  My right arm site of injection feels a little warm and is pink but isn&#39;t painful.

                                                Two days after my injection I had extreme shoulder, arm, back, neck and head pain. It lasted until the morning of 1/27. On the 1/31 my arm that was injected swelled up, turned red and itched, with minor pain. I called my doctor after a couple days of feeling bad and she advised me to take acetaminophen 2 tabs every 6 hours. It barely lessoned the pain. I went to the doctor this morning because my employer recommended that I did and she said that my arm looked like I had cellulitis.

                                                At 5 am on Friday 2/5/21 I was having chills but I had been sweating and my sheets and pillow case were wet. I took my temperature and it was 99.7 and then I took it again later when I started feeling much worse and my temp at 10am was 101.8. I took Tylenol and I went to sleep. I woke around 12:30pm and I was freezing to death! I had a horrible headache! I had chills and fever. every joint and bone in my body ached. I had a floating feeling in my head. I felt real unbalanced and very strange feeling like I was underwater. I would not have felt safe driving or standing up. I drank fluids, and I took my temperature around 3pm and it was 101.1 and I took more tylenol. I had no appetite. At 6 pm I took more tylenol. I went to bed at 11pm and the next morning I was feeling the same way. I had a low temp of 99. I still had no appetite. I went to bed that night (saturday night) I woke up every hour on the dot feeling very sick. I stayed in bed all day sunday as well. I started feeling better as the day went on. I noticed 2 red circles nickle sized on my arm about 3 inches below where I got the shot. I noticed it saturday and its still there. I feel fine today 2/8/21. its very hot to the touch.

                                                She woke me at about 4:15am and told me she was freezing, she was shivering in the bed even though she had a blanket on, so I went and got her another blanket and put some socks on her feet. She went back to sleep until about 6:30am when she woke up and said she felt like she was burning up, so I took 1 blanket and her socks off. I took her temperature at 6:45am and it was 100.2 degrees,  so I went to the store to buy her some Tylenol. I gave a cracker and a Tylenol with a glass of water. She went back to sleep until 9:45am, when she woke back up and I took her temperature, it was at 99.7 degrees, she ate another cracker and drank some water and some Diet Coke. She went back to sleep and at 11:35 she woke up and told me she was hungry so I made her some chicken noodle soup and 1/2 of a hotdog. Her temperature at that time was 98.6 degrees. Basically she was in bed the whole day and couldn?t do any of the things that she normally would do. She feels some what better today, no fever, but still has body aches and pains. Her arm is still bothering her and she has a rash at the injection site.

It was 184/125 and my heart rate was through the roof. I think it was around 135. I was pale and felt funny!   After around 15 minutes I felt better. My heart rate and bp started coming down but the emt&#39;s advised me to go by ambulance to the ER and be checked out. I was fine once I got to the ER. they did a 12 lead EKG and I waited three hours to see a doctor who discharged me and advised against getting the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up at 2:15 a.m. feeling pains in my chest middle and extending through to my upper back.  The pain encompassed the span of my upper chest and back from one arm to the other.  I experienced very rapid heartbeats that I could feel throbbing from my head to my chest.  I was hesitant to move or rise from my bed because of the pain.  At 3:40 I called 911.  They did an EKG and I was told that my heart was fine.  My blood pressure was 180/90.  I chose not to go to the hospital but to call my doctor when his office opened up at 9:00 a.m. in approximately 5 hours.  My doctor had me come into his office.  I had another EKG which was fine and he sent me to have a Cat Scan. the same day which was also fine.  My doctor spoke to me and said that he felt that this was due to side effects of the vaccine.  I doubled up on my Acid Reflux medicine, taking 80 mg daily for  four days through Monday 2/22/2021.  I could not sleep well for three days after the vaccine experiencing pain in my chest and could not breathe deeply without feeling it.  Then I steadily improved and today I can take deep breaths with little pain.  I also experienced muscle pain in my left shoulder and neck but used Mineral Ice on my neck and was relieved in one day.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First symptoms appeared about 8PM the evening of the shot - a feeling of being weighted down, with extra difficulty in moving about.  I went to bed early and when I woke up I had a fever of 101.5 accompanied by chills, body aches, nausea, fatigue, brain fog, and headache.  Over the course of two days, my temperature ranged from 101.5 to 103.  After two days my fever broke during the night.   I did not want to take fever reducing medication in case it interfered with the immune response, but I did take 1 dose each of Tylenol and Motrin over the course of the 2 days.  Still felt a bit sluggish on the 3rd day and continue to have brain fog 6 days later.

                                                I felt the injection fluid go into my arm with pain and a few hours later my arm pain was so severe I could not even move my arm without excruciating pain. I could not sleep or lay down. I had to pack my upper arm with ice for 72 hours. I have had flu shots before and never had a painful reaction that brought tears to my eyes for 72 hours.   I don&#39;t know what size the needle was used on me, but it almost felt like it hit the bone. I am a thin person.  It probably did not hit the bone, but it felt like the fluid was forced into the muscle. My husband did not have this same reaction, so I don&#39;t know if it was the person who gave the shot, or wrong needle size or what made my arm hurt like it was hit with a hammer.  I now have slight itching at the shot site and there is a bump the size of a mosquito bite.

                                                With shot # 1.  Intense pain in the vaccinated arm, extending from hand to left, back shoulder blade starting a couple hours after the shot.  Unable to sleep. Day two, used ice pack to attempt to move the arm, which only wanted to stick next to the body and not move.  Attempts to use the arm were excruciating, so nothing worked on that level.  Continued icing throughout day 2.  End of day 2, took an Aleve and continued to ice the shoulder.  Day three, took an Aleve; no improvement in the morning, then saw some improvement throughout day three, but not to the point of being able to use the arm.  Total focus was on that arm.  Day 4, pain improved to being able to use the arm for small tasks.  Day 5, pain [but for injection sight] gone.  Shot #2.  Effects were entirely different but equally intense.

There was no pain or discomfort but my leg felt warm to the touch.  Within an hour, the redness had spread to cover all skin between my knee and ankle, however, by noon it was back to normal.  At 2:30 am, Mon., 2/22/21, I awoke with abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, and overall feeling poorly.  There were two episodes of diarrhea in the next 8 hrs but abdominal pain disappeared.  There were several sharp bursts of headache pain but this pain also disappeared  in the next 8 hrs.

I checked my blood pressure &amp; it was 199/105,   10 minutes later 197/101. I went to ER arriving at 10 am.  Had EKG, blood work, chest xray, covid quick test.  All ok. BP stayed very high until 12:30 pm then started to go down.  After about an hour bp went back up to 188/99.  I was given a pill to lower pressure but it didn&#39;t  lower.  Finally given a dose of metroprolol &amp; pressure went down. Was released from ER at 3:45 pm.   Today, 3/1/2021 BP is still high,  166/87.   Went to cardiologist 3/1/2021, was told they were having these type issues lately.  No problem with EKG, blood work.  Gave me another BP pill to try for 2 weeks to try lower BP.

It would come and go throughout the afternoon and evening.  I was only able to sleep about 5 hours and the itching woke me up and continued throughout the fourth day.  I looked this up on the internet and found that massaging and exercising my arm help.  The injection site had been sore  the first three days, it was less swollen, sore and warm to the touch by the fifth day but there were three red patches around the injection site. All symptoms gone on the sixth day but a very mild itch is appearing occasionally today which is the seventh day. I also experienced itching after the first shot (Lot 042L20A) but it was very mild and went away by the fourth day.

On February 14 woke up with My whole arm aching. About three days after that extreme pain in my upper arm. That did not go away with two versions of anti-inflammatory drugs. Was referred to an orthopedist for a possible shoulder injury. His diagnosis was cervical pinch nerve. He referred me to a neurologist. I am now on medication that has somewhat reduced the pain in my arm but it has not gone away completely. I had my second shot on March 3 and the next day the pain in my arm intensified I near the spot of the first injection. The second injection I took in my right arm. I am also experiencing today March by brain fog. My arm my right arm is sore much like a flu shot. Other than that I had no symptoms as mentioned in many publications after you get the second shot.

On day 5, my left arm began itching (to the point of awakening me from a night&#39;s sleep) and by day 7, a red swollen hot and itchy area about the size of an orange appeared and the skin was very dry and coarse to the touch.  The itching continued for days with the red area increasing in size to encompass about three-fourths of my upper arm.  While the area increased in size, the itching and swelling decreased and  by day 15, it was all gone,  (I took pictures of it on 2/21 and 2/25 to document.)

Next day Sunday,  my arm was really sore. I had chills off and on all day plus a fever of almost 100 at times. Felt a little strange, hard to explain. No energy, just the blobs. Spent a few hours in bed during the day which was Sunday. The next day Monday, I felt much better. Today 3/9/21 I am back to normal. I was not too worried because I had heard a lot of people had issues with the 2nd dose. First dose, no problems except a sore arm for a day or two.

No sleep, hot and cold flashes, significant aches esp. in legs (even my eyeballs hurt!).  Pain resolved by AM.  Next day arm got a bit itchy.  3 days later arm itched like I had poison ivy and  fingers / hands had pain and joint swelling.  Used a prescription steroid cream on arm and that resolved itching.  Hands, fingers took 10 days to return to normal.  All in all 14 days to recover completely from 2nd Moderna Covid shot.

                                                The pain started at 9:00 pm, a 4 on a pain scale of 1-10. By 1:00 am I could not sleep at all; the discomfort had shot to an 8 with a radius of pain around the injection site and arrows of pain that shot down my arm to my wrist and up to my neck. I had lost most of the movement in my right arm. Raising my arm no more than 10 degrees triggered intense pain. I research Covid vaccines and learned that the shot should be administered with the needle going into the arm at a 90 degree angle. My vaccine was administered at almost the top edge of my shoulder! I waited until 8:00 am to take 400 mg of Advil to keep it from inhibiting antibodies. I took more every six hours until this morning when my pain toggled between an 8 and a 9, and it was clear that the Advil wasn&#39;t working.

Too someone tylenol and went back to bed and slept for a few hours and woke up feeling the same and my temp was the same, around 7:00am.

I slept off and on during the day. The next day March 14th I woke up around 6:30 am and felt a little better and took my temp and it was down to 99.4.

I did test temperature, but read 98 which is normal for me up to 98.3.; I did not have a headache but could definitely feel extra pressure; my body aches were about even all over body, not stronger at shot site probably because I relaxed before shot and stayed resting  in my car for 30 minutes before driving away; I did not have swelling or any redness at the vaccination site; I have had a dry mouth which wakes me up a night even thought I have taken Biotine .  It usually lasts the whole night.  I did drink extra water during day as well as at night.  I have had nausea but did not vomit for about 8 days.    I lack energy and am still experiencing fatigue.  I continue to swim laps and areobics at least one hour every day.

She reported 4 days later that she started itching very badly over entire body. She tried taking anti-histamines with the reccomendation of her physician Dr.  She tried Benadryl, followed by Zyrec, and Allegra, and Pepcid with no relief for a couple of days. The itching was so bad she could not sleep and affecting her also during the day. She had another appointment over video with Dr.  again. Dr. prescribed on 3/12 a prednisone taper to take if needed. She advised to try to wait 14 days if she could to make sure the vaccine would be effective. She was still itching on 3/16 and started the Prednisone taper. She called this morning and she is still itching at the end of the taper on 3/23. The prednisone provided some temporary relief but now that the taper is almost done the itching is returning very severely. She reports itching on hands, feet, ankles, armpits, back, head, and scratching with some bleeding.

He assisted me in getting back into our home, gave me baby aspirin, asked me questions as to his middle name, of which I  just starred back at him. I can remember him asking me questions, and  I was wondering why my brain was not responding.   My gait  had already returned to normal as I could take the steps into our home with no problem.  My brain fog lasted approx 30-35 minutes. He did bring me to our local ER , where tests were negative but I did stay overnight.

                                                First symptom was  tightening of throat on 2/18/2021 not closing nor sore just tightening.  That lasted 48 hours.  Joint pain started after throat dissipated on Friday 2/19/21.  Joint pain was progressive from shoulders for several days, then  knees for a day, then tops of one foot for one night, then it moved to my hands.  I had swelling where I could not close my hands. I had severe and exstremely painful joint pain in  both hands that kept me up at night and unable to pick up things or close my hands.  I used ice packs for some relief. It would sometimes calm down somewhat for hours and I would think it was over and then it would come back . The hand symptoms lasted from 2/23/21  through 3/5/21 when pain began to slowly calm down.  I had one hand that would not close into a fist for one day 3/6/21 when pain was much less. By Sunday 3/7/21 most symtoms were much less with symptoms dissipating all together.  I have had no recurrence since the weekend of 3/6/21 of any symptoms.

In the morning I could not touch my wrist, move it without extreme pain. The pain level was a 10/10.  I made an appointment with a doctor but was not able to be seen until February 24.  I took advil, wrapped it in an ace bandage with no relief.  Around 4:00 pm on 1/27/21, I realized that the pain was gone.  I tried moving my wrist and was able to.  After that I had complete motility and no pain.  Is this related to the vaccine?  I&#39;ve never experienced this before.

I had no pain at the injection site and did not need any medication.  I ate dinner and went to bed at 10:30 pm.  I awoke at 1:30 am with pain in my mouth.  I had had a temporary bridge put in my upper right side of my mouth on Tuesday, 2/9/21.  I had had no pain from that dental procedure till 2/13/21 at 1:30 am.  I needed to take an Advil to relieve the pain.  After 20 minutes the pain was gone.  This pattern of waking at night with pain has continued since that night.  I called my dentist today and reported what was going on.  He told me to get in touch with the CDC and file a report.  He reported that he has heard of this pain occurring in other dental patients after having received the vaccine.

Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, passing out, unsteadiness, slurring words, fell into a deep sleep, tingly feeling in her upper right arm, felt like equilibrium was off, legs felt heavy and fatigue, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71 year old female subject, with history of epilepsy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness after first dose of mRNA1273 (Lot# unknown).

I then noticed body aches &amp; chills. After about 45 minutes I went to bed, still chilled. After lying down the chills became rather violent, more like spasms or seizures and lasted about 15 minutes. Finally they stopped and I had a fitful nights sleep due to body aches &amp; headache. On awakening I still had discomfort, took Ibuprofen, and it is still ongoing at this time (2:30 pm) but seems to be going away. Primary feeling is now weakness &amp; fatigue

Knew immediately that the symptoms were gone.

About 24 hours after my vaccine the flare up began in both locations.  I used my normal treatments of Peppermint and Frankincense essential oils throughout the rest of the afternoon and evening, but it did not work.  The pain only kept increasing and both areas became very inflamed.  By 10:00 p.m. I was unable to use my thumb to support a glass of water and soreness began to develop in the base of the finger next to the index finger.  I finally took an Aleve which began to relieve the severe pain within about an hour.  The severe flare up was better in the morning, but it has been a week and the discomfort is still there.  I bought Voltaren and hope this will get my joints back to normal, which is mild flare ups when the weather changes.

It went away in four days, but then returned with a lot of itching a few days later. it got redder and bigger and the site also was warm to touch and swollen. I put ice packs on it to help with the itch, along with benedryl gel. it was difficult to sleep because of the itch. It is still getting bigger as of today. I did not go to the doctor. I followed what it said to do on the internet. The itch may be calming down some. I don&#39;t know if I should get the 2nd vaccine. Please let me know.

I took 2 500 mg tylenol at bedtime.  I woke up about 1:30 a.m.  Soreness in my back was so bad, it hurt to touch it or lay on it.  I also had chills to the point of shaking and added 2 extra blankets and took another 500 mg tylenol.  On Thursday, the day following the vaccine, I continued to have chills, had no appetite and had a headache. The soreness in my back lessened throughout the day and by 7:30 pm had almost disappeared.  I woke up at 1 and 2 am on March5 dripping wet(I assume from fever breaking).When I got up at 5am on the 5th, all adverse symptons were gone and I ate normally.

I went to take 2 Tylenol and could barely hold the Tylenol bottle or glass with water.  I put a blanket on the bed and heavy pajamas and went back to sleep.  Shaking subsided.  The next day I slept all day and felt like I was run over with a truck, my temp was 99.4.. The next day I felt fine.

                                                1st dose 1/29 reaction gave me little dime-sized red bumps all over my body and a lot of itchiness. I had 2 larger brown  places on my body that were oval shaped about 1 inch across and it was crusty and had liquid and blood coming  from it. One was under my left breast and at the base of my spine. I had to get a mammogram because I had brown and bloody discharge from my left nipple. It looked like someone had painted bright red paint around the nipple. Dermatologists said it was mild duct ectasia bilaterally benign, nipple dermatitis, left nipple bloody discharge, and an eczamatatious rash. Right breast had a brown bump on the areola to the side of the nipple. 03/03/21 second dose: Sore arm, Fever of 100.9 next day that lasted all day. fatigue and a headache. I also had dizziness especially when I lie down or get up. fever went down and then I developed a rash on my body that made it look like I was sunburned all over my body. not spots, just redness all over. I felt pretty weird. it was an itchy rash that stayed about 24 hours, then changed into a spotty rash that traveled to my inner arms and inner thighs. The next day it traveled down my legs to my ankles. It went away mostly after a few days. I do still have spots that look like bites that are quarter-sized brown crusty spots. then I have eczema patches on my forehead. Its flaking and itching and is too sensitive to wash with soap. Also, my right eyelid has 3-4 places that has welt on it so much so that I cant see well from the eyelid, and under eye being swollen.

                                                I had my 2nd dose of Moderna Vaccine on 3/4/2021 @ 8:40 AM. By 2 PM I experienced extreme fatigue for the remainder of the day. Unable to perform simple tasks like preparing dinner. On 3/5/21, I woke with a fever of 100.4 F, and general flu like symptoms: Killer headache, body aches, cold chills. My fever didn&#39;t rise above 100.6 F and the headache was untouchable with Tylenol or Advil. On 3/6/2021, My fever was gone but my left arm at the injection site was very red swollen and very warm to the touch. Just when I thought everything was OK, Yesterday 3/7/2021, I had a bout of diarrhea from about 10 AM until 3 PM only to be followed by swollen glands of my neck on the left side, it was so painful to turn my head, swallow and speak. There was no fever. Today, 3/8/2021, I can speak, and turn my head without discomfort, swelling is down, but when I swallow I still have some mild pain. My reason for telling you all if this is that I believe the symptoms of diarrhea and swollen neck glands ( only on the left side, injection side) are not listed anywhere that I could find. Has any one else reported similar symptoms? Thank you for your time and all you do!

However I felt as though I could not expand my chest wall. So I waited a moment and after 2 attempts I was able to expand my chest wall. This symptom has improved and is occurring less frequent, but it is still there. It feels as though I have to think the process of taking a big breath through. Over the following days I experienced pain in my joints and muscle aches. On day 2 I began to experience severe pain at he old surgical site on my lower back. The pain radiated down my right leg which is the same leg that was involved when I injured my back it got so The pain also went into my right hip. It got so bad that on day 3 my daughter came to stay with me until  I could walk upright and my pain began to resolve.  I was able to walk again by day 4. However, the pain in my leg still is restricting my movement and my ability to stand up and walk again.  I require some assistance to stand from a squat or sitting..

                                                In the days and weeks after receiving the Moderna vaccine, I had a variety of headaches as follows: Shooting pains in the back of my head on the right side and behind my ear; pain on the right front side of my head, usually while sleeping and waking up from the pain; one episode of waking up with pain on the left side of my head, temple, teeth and side. The headaches continue to this day, March 10, 2021, one month after receiving the vaccine. I reported the headaches to my GP, but he advised me to still get the second dose, scheduled for March 13, 2012. I am cancelling that appointment because of the headaches.

                                                Patient was seated for approximately 10 minutes post-vaccination when she alerted the technician that she was not feeling well. I approached patient and asked her to describe her symptoms. She reported feeling &#34;weird&#34; near and around her mouth. Her heart was racing and she was feeling very anxious - similar to the sensation of a panic attack which she has a history of experiencing. I took her blood pressure and it was reported at 197/120. Due to the high blood pressure and signs of potential allergic reaction I called 911 immediately. Medical services arrived and provided medical care and took her to nearest hospital. The only known thing to have been provided to the patient was an injectable diphenhydramine and EMS did report that she was getting a rash on her stomach by the time they arrived and decided to transport her.

She had pain in lower back so much so that she couldn&#39;t sit comfortably.  The next day she had bubbling and rolling stomach.  The next two days she had severe diarrhea, then a spot on her face (cheek).  The next day she had pain in her right foot and couldn&#39;t walk on it for a while.  Her shot was administered in her right arm and she has a history of anaphylaxis with a Penicillin shot.  She hasn&#39;t had anymore symptoms for about a week as of 3/15/2021.

Headaches eventually decreased.  On 3/14 thru to the morning of 3/15,  slept constantly.  Was awake for a a total of about 4 hours during this time.  No apetitite.   Around 10am on 3/15, thought I was feeling better and started to drive to an appointment.  Had to turn around because I was dizzy and went home to take yet another nap.  By 4pm on 3/15, all symptons were gone

She no sooner said to wait 30 mins, I turned to look at clock and bam! everything hit at once.   I was told to go to ambulance on site. They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

Blood test, leg ultrasound normal. Today i still have pain, headache, no appetite. This vaccine is the culprit.

                                                Began to feel feverish around or slightly before 9:30, when chills &amp; shivering began.  Could not sleep due to shivering.  Got up around 1 AM to go to bathroom- was VERY weak &amp; needed help.  Also while getting to bathroom began to lose control over kidneys and was urinating involuntarily.   Had urge to to go the bathroom again around 3;  30.  This time could NOT walk at all &amp; was once again urinating involuntarily.  Tried to just go back to bed, but did not seem to have any control over my body.  Around 4:30 I got as comfortable as possible on the floor &amp; slept  off &amp; on until around 8:30.  When I woke up I was able with  help to get back into bed. I had continued to urinate involuntarily during the time I was sleeping prior to 8:30.   The symptoms seemed to gradually subside after this point.  Called Neurologist,  thinking that my radiation induced nerve damage was involved in my reaction and she agreed.

Continued for couple days, By third night, awaken with pain in forearm area, not able to straighten without pain. Continued throughout day, by night progressively worse, could not sleep, no strength in hand to open medication bottle. Still could not lift arm, when moved arm even slightly, lots of pain. Doctor discussed multiple differrntisld. Diagnosed tendinitis of right triceps which may have been aggravated by injection. Suggested treat with 1000 mg of Tylenol or 800mg of Motrin.  Treated several days with Tylenol. Pain subsized, however, can still feel sometimes (uncomfortable) in forearm.

                                                My reaction to the vaccine was: Complete and utter fatigue, going from the bed to the bathroom and back felt like I had run a marathon, I had brain fog, headache and a temperature.  I ached all over and my vision was somewhat affected.  The idea of eating took too much energy.  No one I have talked to had a reaction like mine.  I believe there is a connection between my reaction and the Valley Fever.  I would like to know if other Valley Fever survivors had similar reactions.  After 36 hours like that, I feel much better.

Took Tylenol which did not improve any symptoms.  Got headache and had that with the arm in the pain all night long.  Woke up totally drenched by sweating, and went to the bathroom and felt dizzy yelled for her husband and passed out, and her husband caught her while passing out and woke up on the floor.  On the Thursday she was in her recliner the entire day, had nausea, fever, chills, headache, continued with the pain of the arm in a vice, which lasted all day long.  Her husband forced crackers and water down her as she had no appetite either for 3 days.   She felt so fatigued and her head was not clear.  She slowly gradually improved, and yesterday 3/18/21 she feels her head fogginess has improved, and her arm is gone as she has been exercising with a band.  It is a little sore but otherwise fine.  The excruciating pain lasted for 2 full days.   She put some Lidocaine and it possibly helped.  She called her doctor and they told her to exercise the arm, and to take more Tylenol, which she had tried which did not improve anything.

By Monday (1/18), I had a really bad sore throat, chills and a fever. I had a fever for 26 solid days. My lung capacity was 98-99% the entire time. On Wednesday (1/20), I contacted my doctor and he had me to come in to get tested for COVID. The next day, I got my results and they were positive. It got worse from there and I was admitted to the hospital due to my sodium being low. I was also losing a lot of weight. I was hospitalized for 3 days in order for them to get my sodium up. I also had burning and tingling on the sole of my feet, which they attributed to my lack of sodium. My symptoms lasted for weeks. I have a lot of congestion, but they can&#39;t seem to locate the source. I&#39;m also having issues with my BP, which just started to decrease on 3/21. I was also diagnosed as anemic, which I&#39;ve never had an issue with. I also have a hard time concentrating. I also have spine issues, so I&#39;m not sure if my knee pain is from that or the COVID.

Fell off the couch I was sleeping on and was unable to get up due to muscle weakness. Had my son come over to get me up off the floor.    I&#39;m feeling somewhat better today.  I&#39;m able to walk and get up from a sitting position.  Still feel a little brain scrambled.  Unable  to concentrate long enough to read the paper.

Then 7 days after the vaccine, she experienced severe pruritis that actually woke her from sleep and had been scratching the area. It has now on day 8 become much more indurated and has grown in size, even during today.

I also had ringing in my ears. I felt like I was going to pass out. It scared me.  I put on my brakes and started to pull over but by the time I started to pull over, the dizziness was slowly starting to clear up.  I had a &#34;foggy&#34; feeling in my head for about a half hour after so I went to my friend&#39;s house and sat down and drank some water. Then I went home.  I have had no incidents since then.

I called 911. while waiting I placed ice on the back of her neck and she began to respond, as she began to become more responsive she defecate all over herself. I checked her blood sugar it was 159.  The ambulance arrived, they checked her vitals said they were ok, they gave me the option of monitoring her at home or going to the ER. I chose to monitor her at home. Monday all day she still had a fever complaining of headache, joint pain and pain in the arm she received the vaccine, at times she became very delirious, nothing she said made sense. . Her doctor said she had a seizure and offer to place her on seizure medication. I gave her two  500mg Tylenol   she has an appointment on March 7th for the second dose but I am afraid to give her the second dose.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, described seeing a dog in the corner of the room - a hallucination. She then said she was feeling overall unwell.  Over the subsequent 30 minutes, she described a severe headache, nausea, itching, and had trouble answering basic questions. Paramedics were called, who conducted an evaluation, which noted dizziness, vision trouble and uneven arm weakness. Paramedics determined she needed further evaluation at a hospital, and was taken to Hospital.

These were the most severe manifestations I have ever experienced. Since I have previously had anaphylaxis, I am more worried about the reactions.  I was not able yo sleep at all due to the strong pain.  I do feel better this morning, but nowhere near ok.

Pain under Left Shoulder Blade radiates to Left Arm outter under muscle / roves to wrists / roves to shoulder muscle by neck. Comes and goes during the day. Wakes me up at night.  Initally it was severe pain subsiding to an ache still roving never stationary. I manage it with Supplements of Tumeric.

                                                Received #1 dose as stated.  Next day, 1/27/21, 9:00am , had mild joint pain to both legs, &amp; arms, &amp; slightly tired.  Shortly after that , while driving, had nausea, &amp; muscle aches to legs &amp; arms.  Reaching family members home, could barely carry bags with each arm, due to pain in joints, and to muscles, getting worse.  Through the next 6 hrs. had moderate to severe pain to joints, &amp; muscles &amp; gradually severe fatigue. Took 1 Tylenol 650 mg for pain.   Also, checked temperature thru out this time, with only mild 99.5 temp.  Vaccine site gradually became swollen, with increased pain.  Was doing work on computer, but could not continue, so left for my home, &amp; went to bed, to sleep.  Lt.  Arm started becoming red, with severe soreness &amp; swelling by 1/28/21, 2 days after vaccine.  Vaccine was given very high on my arm, almost shoulder area.  All Symptoms continued for about 10 days, including  to vaccine arm, which continued with redness &amp; soreness for 2 weeks.   My physician was notified.   She advised NSAID before #2 dose, but I already take NSAID daily (Meloxicam), so don&#39;t think I can take another NSAID.  I have been taking Tylenol 650mg at least twice a day, for increased joint &amp; muscle pain, since vaccine.  My 2nd dose, originally scheduled for 2/23/21 has been rescheduled to 2/27/21 due to no vaccines available.

                                                I was perfectly fine after the vaccine, except for a sore arm. On day 3 I noticed my tongue starting to swell and lips tingling. It got a little worse and I felt it moving towards my throat, and then it stopped. This only lasted maybe a couple of hours, and not more than three hours. I had not eaten anything since the day before, so knew it was not food related. I didn?t associate this reaction to the vaccine until I searched online, and found that tongue swelling and facial paralysis could be common. I was also tired that day. On day 4 I had none of those symptoms but was very tired and did not feel myself; little energy, somewhat lethargic.

It got worse and worse to the point my whole body was shaking.  I felt nauseous and thought I might throw up from the pain (I didn&#39;t).  At 1:00 am I took a 5mg Oxycodone pill.  I got a little relieft at about 1:45 am.  The spasms started coming in waves.  At 3:15 am I took another dicyclomine and again used the heating pad.  At about 4:30 am, I was able to fall asleep.  This is absolutely the worst spasming I have ever had.

Went to the bathroom, urinated, took Tylenol and went back to bed. Woke again at 2:00 a.m, still chilled, and tried to stand up and my legs wouldn&#39;t hold me. I managed to lift myself to my feet and clutching furniture get to the bathroom, with complete loss of bladder control on the way. Took more Tyleonol, drank more water, put on clean pajamas but couldn&#39;t lift my knees to step into them, had to put them on the floor and pull them up. Went to sleep eventually. When I woke at about 5 a.m., all was completely normal. No fever, legs fine, usual bladder control.

                                                Right arm began itching on Saturday, March 6, 2021, which is  11 days after the COVID shot.   During the night of March 6, right shoulder and upper right arm ached most of the night making it very difficult to sleep.  When I got up the morning of March 7, upper shoulder of right arm had a large red rash (about 4&#34; in diameter) and another red rash (about 2&#34; in diameter) was on my right arm just to the left of where the COVID shot was given.    The rash was very itchy and my upper right arm felt warm.    Applied hydrocortisone cream which slightly relieved the itching but not the redness.

That night her arm was in the 9-10 range for pain.  She hasn&#39;t been able to sleep due to the pain.  The next day she took Tylenol but did not help with pain. She had a strange taste in her mouth and also loss of appetite.  On 3/6/2021  she started getting a back ache.  She tried taking Ibuprofen which helped some with swelling in her arm but not the pain.  On 3/7/2021 she started getting a headache, brain fog and saying her words backwards.  She is very upset with the lack of warning that she was given at the time of the getting the first dose of the vax about being in this type of pain afterwards.  She said she was not prepared for this.  She has to have help doing everything and lives alone. Today the arm pain seems to slightly be improving but her back is still hurting.  Pt contacted her PCP.  They only instructed her to take Tylenol and not to ice it.  She contacted the Public Health Dept they told her to take Ibuprofen and to ice it.  She is getting conflicting information and doesn&#39;t know how to treat it.

Restless night, low grade fever. Progressed within 48 hours to epigastritis, intractable nausea?started Omeprazole on 3/11.  Exhaustion lasted until Day 10 when I began to feel better and the nausea finally lifted. I do not want to go through this a second time but an asking you for guidance. I desperately want released from house confinement and separation from my children and grandchildren. Please help me with a decision of whether of not to take the second dose.

I could not stand or walk.  I am reporting this because it is outside your normal prediction on the timinh of side effects.  You need to add this vaeiation to your public information. I panicked and called the Nurse Hot Line -they told me to call 911 and go to the ER.. So I called another Nurst HotLine and they ld me to call 911 and go to the ER.  Instead I simply slept for 35 hours and I am fine.  Please mention in your information that in some cases,  a reaction can occur up to 12 days later,  Btw there is nothing in my medical history to otherwise explain the incident.

                                                On March 13, about 18 hours after my second shot, I arose to find myself with a fever of 100.5 degrees, headache, serious fatigue and severe body aches from my neck to my knees in every area in which I have had past surgeries and repairs (neck, back, wrists, hip and left breast [lymph nodes removed due to cancer]).  Most of that first full day I spent in bed sleeping, arising only around 6 p.m. for a bit of soup for dinner.  By 9 p.m., I was back in bed and slept through to 9 a.m. on March 14.  When I arose on March 14, the fever, headache and fatigue were gone, but the severe body aches remained in my hip and leg areas and became worse as the day went on.  I alternately tried ice and heat to relieve the pain, but nothing helped. I could not sleep either. Finally, at around midnight, I took to extra-strength Tylenol, which finally kicked in an hour later and I slept until 8 a.m. on Monday, March 15.  I had no symptoms when I awoke and continue with only a bit of fatigue.

The itching, burning, and aching associated with this rash interfered with my sleeping for two nights.  The injection site itself turned black.  Both of these problems began to clear up after 4 days.  The rash is faint pink now, and the injection site bruise is now yellow in color. The only other symptom I had was a severe headache for 2 days which was resistent to Tylenol.  The headache has cleared up.

                                                Four hours after receiving the first dose I experienced  substantial swelling , redness, heat, and a very heavy upper left arm. I was unable to sleep on that side for a week. The redness , swelling and heat lasted 14 days. My doctor looked at my arm on day 11 , and was surprised seeing the bright redness and feeling the heat 11 days after vaccination. The full healing  finally occurred on day 15. Hence  I opted not to get the second dose since the reaction might be far greater.

                                                I had the slight headache and sore arm when I first woke up, but it didn?t keep me from working in my studio.  By noon I realized my head was hurting more and I was making mistakes, so I quit for the day.  No soon had I cleaned up and left my head started really banging and I felt like I had a really bad sunburn all over.  I didn?t want anyone or anything to touch me.  Even the clothes I was wearing irritated my skin.  I had to lay down and felt nauseous,, and I had a steadily increasing fever.  For someone who rarely breaks 97 F on my oral thermometer, reaching 101 was not expected.  I was confused and not making sense.  For example I told my husband he was the cat calling the canary black. He laughed at my mixed metaphor, saying you mean the pot that calls the kettle black.  I dozed, but didn?t really sleep.  Around midnight I realized the headache was easing up and my temperature dropped to 99.5F.   When I woke in the morning the temperature and headache ere gone and all that remained was about a 6 inch diameter red ring around the injection site, but the episode was basically over.  Thanks for listening.

                                                She got the vaccine, and they asked her to stay for the 15 minutes and she was fine, but when she went out onto the street she started to have a few seconds of feeling faint but did not.  That feeling passed and was able to walk home and was getting vertigo.  She had a sore arm the next day, very fatigued and exhaustion.  Three days later had redness appear on the arm and then had headaches, and insomnia that night.  Her eyes were burning as well.  A day later had irregular heart beat and then six days later had the red line, raised in a circle that lasted one day.  She then continued to have the itching and then became a rash which was traveling under arm and onto her chest.  She then went to the city UC and was spreading to her breast, and started to subside.  Since then she has been having on and off headaches, on and off itching of both of her arms, as well as her scalp and other parts of her body.   As  a child had a history of hives.  When she went to the UC they did an EKG due to the irregular heart beat and did not want to go to the ER during the pandemic.  He gave her one Benadryl and 3 Ibuprofen which she only took one of, as she has a lot of allergies.  She has been taking Zyrtec 5 mg for the itching when she has it, which works for her.  The symptoms are subsiding, and has transient rashes on the vaccine arm, and on the right arm still have a few areas and still itching on and off.

Began having muscle spasms in lower back using different muscle to reposition and for ADLs. Finally was able to see doctor 3-12-21. Given scripts for Tramadol and muscle relaxant. Had follow up appointment with Sports Medicine MD to receive a steroid injection in Left shoulder. Diagnosed with SIRVA (Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration) I now require Physical Therapy. I am unable to use my arm per MD and PT. I have difficulty dressing, cooking, routine housekeeping, etc. While I feel better since the injection, I am terrified the pain will return. I live alone and was unable to sleep, drive, dress, cook or do any ADLS including wash my hair or dress. The pain was completely debilitating. Even after the steroid injection, I have physical therapy and MD appointments, daily exercises and instructions to not use my arm.

My husband took me to the hospital ER and that evening I was checked in because my BP was 225/105 they thought I was have a stroke.  At the hospital, I had the first CT head w/o contrast, then a head neck CT scan and I was admitted into the hospital. The follow day they did an electrocardiogram, then an echocardiogram,  renal and duplex test, chest x-Ray MRI brain w/o contrast. There was no pain headache or body aches, then I was starting to remember what I had done the day before. A neurologist came into explain the results and all tests were negative, but I was diagnosed with Fibral Muscular Dysplasia, but because they didn?t have enough data, he couldn?t say that it was because of the Moderna vaccine. I was released 24 hours later. My BP went back to normal 120/70 3 days later.

                                                A rash started developing about within a day or two of the vaccination. By day 4 or 5, the rash was spreading and appearing in other areas including scalp. By day 6, I was in complete distress. Saw Dermatologist on Day 6 and was prescribed Prednisone and increased antihistamines up to the day of the second injection scheduled for Feb 5, 2021. By today, Day 10, the rash has mostly receded while I continue meds prescribed. I believe that I had Covid early on starting March 28 accompanied by sudden fatigue, nausea, fever, chills, body aches, no appetite, for the first few days, then developed hives all over face and head until my eyes were swollen shut. My doctors, both derm and primary, didn&#39;t want me to be tested or come in or go to the hospital, perhaps because so early on in the pandemic, little was known and they feared if it wasn&#39;t Covid, I would contract it in those circumstances. They again prescribed creams and antibiotics and prednisone.  I don&#39;t remember how the rash side effects lasted but I continue to have scalp problems since. I did not have a cough, but did experience instances of shortness of breath 7 to 10 days after the onset. The fatigue, body aches and brain fog continued for  months. I was feeling much better by the time I got the vaccine and then returned to the rash symptoms I had had before.

Saw my primary and she said it could be they gave it too high and irritated the shoulder joint.  She is concerned about &#34;frozen shoulder&#34;.  It wakes me in the night and no position lasts without pain after 30-45 seconds.  Take one extra strength Tylenol before bed and administer Sagely 250 mg. BD cream on upper arm and part of neck where pain exits.  Last night I drank 3 glasses of red wine so I could sleep a few hours and today I have had no pain!   little weakness and I&#39;m trying not to aggravate it, but hopefully the site pain is resolving.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

I could feet the sides of my chests getting tight - felt like pressures were building up with swelling.  I did not have problems with breathing.  About 10 minutes later I could feel my lips swelling, but stopped after about 10 minutes.  In the evening, felt nausea.  Did not feel well for two days.  Got a little better on the third day but not completely well.  Completely recovered on the fourth day.  Should I get the second shot?  I am afraid it might be worse on the second shot if what I was feeling were due to allergy.

                                                During first 12 hrs after injection, I noticed only redness, mild discomfort and itching at injection site.  By 12 hrs later, I began to experience fever, chills, nausea, headache, muscle and joint discomfort, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue.  This lasted all night.   The day following injection I still had a fever (102) and chills and redness on arm had increased in size; also headache (predominately in both eyes).   I slept a lot during that day.  Day 3 low grade fever persisted. Used Tylenol with good results.  By day 4 feeling much better!!  Redness at injection site increased but less itching and discomfort. Regaining energy.

It kept waking me up on that night 2/3. I tried not to lay on my left side and I was getting chills like you get when you get the flu, so that lasted for about 30 hours after I had my vaccine. And then about 2:30-3:00 in the afternoon all of the adverse symptoms/reactions I was having just stopped. The only other thing I want to say is that I wasn&#39;t hungry at all, i could taste and smell but I didn&#39;t want to eat anything. I had soup and everything else but I had no appetite.

She reported she began to have a rapid heart rate (which went away that evening) and elevated blood pressure. She normally takes a BP med and took an extra 1/2 pill that evening. Her BP was up to 178/101 and came down to 124/78. She reports she is still not feeling well (but BP is within her normal range). She reports she will contact her PCP. I advised her to go to the urgent care and she wants to wait to see her PCP.  She agrees to go to urgent care or ER if condition worsens.

                                                Day of vaccine  headache, fatigue, soreness 2nd day 2/13/21  Had issues sleeping and felt uncomfortable.  In early a.m. hours, felt dizzy, feeling of sick stomach, and fainted in the bathroom.  Paramedics were called by my spouse and they worked with me, then was transported by  Ambulance to emergency room where they ran tests and released me the same day.  I was told by the doctor that apparently my blood pressure decreased too fast causing me to faint.

                                                Awoke at 1:34 AM and my left foot hurt.  I had a marble-size lump and a few small lumps on the vertical bone above my heel that were tender to the touch.  My foot on top was slightly swollen and shiny and red on the side and both were tender to the touch.  I massaged my foot and went back to sleep.  When I awoke the marble-sized lump was much smaller.  I got up, ate, and in the afternoon after research, I realized it was gout and I had tophi for the first time ever.  I had my first gout flare in November 2003 without tophi, and never had another flare until 2/14/2021!  I walked and suddenly my Achilles? tendon hurt and my heel hurt a little.   I took 2 Colchicine and took one more an hour later.  It seemed much better and didn?t hurt but some of the pain returned.  I couldn?t sleep until 4:05 AM and awoke around 6 according to my Fitbit watch.  I contacted my doctor and he said to take one Colchicine every day until the pain is gone.

(A trip from my bed to the bathroom was difficult.)  This proceeded to severe nausea (I retched into the. toilet bowl a couple of times and came close to vomiting).  I dosed in bed and the severity of the symptoms eased, but I really haven&#39;t felt completely over it until today (2-22-2021).

                                                I am not 100% certain of this event being related to the vaccination with the Moderna COVID19 shot or not.  However, in the interest of completeness and for investigative purposes, I am reporting to you the event in relation to the vaccination as the patient reported to me.  She received the vaccination on 2/14/2021 and became very confused.  She had significant left arm swelling much worse than when she had her first vaccination.  Her husband brought her to the emergency room and she was eventually discharged, but she went on to develop significant hypertension and she reported that her blood pressures were normal prior to the vaccination.  She had an emergency room visit in which her systolic pressures were well above 240.  She revisited the emergency room and had elevated blood pressures of 240 and was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy and later found to have posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or PRES.  We have started the patient on medications, and started laboratory work-up for secondary hypertension and her blood pressures have improved with treatment.  We discussed the case with the neurologist, who suggested that we repeat MRI scan to make sure that her punctate lesions noted on MRI on this admission on 2/25/2021, have resolved.  It was advised that if they had not resolved that we should call neurology again.  Hypertensive encephalopathy is rare and press syndrome as a result is also rare.  It is for this reason that I am reporting this event as again, I am not trying to mislead anyone or distort information, but should this be an adverse effect of the vaccine I wanted to make sure that this was reported as the patient&#39;s history prior to the vaccination and developing this complication post vaccination are temporally related at a minimum.  The patient is a known smoker but quit on the 14th of this month.

                                                After 15 min. (4:10 p.m.) I left the Dr. office to go to the store in the same  town.  While there (about 4:15 p.m.) I started a bad headache, neck hurt and feeling &#34;strange&#34;.  While waiting in the check out line I felt hot and weak.  After a few min. when I got home  ( about 5:15 p.m.)  my face felt tight and I became itchy on all parts of my body except not as much on my legs.  The next day  the headache was not as bad but still itchy especially on my face, head and back.  My arm was not any more sore than with a flu shot.  The next day the headache was gone, the arm was not sore, but I was still itchy.  The itching would come and go for about a week.

Chest felt very heavy and I became lethargic, not able to take a deep breath.  Left work and became a couch potato the rest of the day and evening.   Today symptoms about the same.  Breathing still a problem and although it does not feel good, I am forcing myself to take an occastional deep breath. Did not report to work.

If I tried to in my sleep the pain would awaken me. The next day after my shot at about 10 AM I began to feel wonky (dizzy) and tired.  For the entire rest of the day I had to literally lay around which is unusual for me as I&#39;m very active. I was too tired to do anything--extreme fatigue. The night was the worst.  I had a fever and sweats and  horrible  dry mouth.  I woke up about 3 times an hour throughout the night because of the dry mouth and had to drink water.  I drank three 16 fl oz bottles of water.  I had to urinated 5 times in the night. [normal for me is I never wake to urinate.   I go to bed about 11 pm and wake up at 7.  Today I feel normal except my arm is still tender from the shot.

                                                On the morning of Feb 2, it felt like a switch went off in my head. I felt spacey and disconnected. I went for a walk and felt better but tired. I then started to feel anxious and tired the next day. The third day I not only felt anxious but agitated. This seemed very similar to being on Prednisone. That day I called my doctor and took Ativan. We waited another week to see if the aniety would go away. It did not and I am currently on Lexipro. I walk almost everyday and it really helped with the onset of anxiety after the shot. However, F Feb 14 I felt chest pressure while walking which I had never felt before. After returning home, I went to the ER. All tests were negative for a heart attack. I am hesitant to get the second dose. I am currently seeing a cardiologist to determine what may have caused the event.

She attributes this to her vaccine. Immediately after receiving the vaccine she felt completely fine without any side effects. One night ago she began to feel like she was getting an ear infection with some pain and pressure to her right ear. Today, she noticed some swelling to the right side of her neck. She also feels dehydrated as she has not been eating or drinking much. Additionally, she endorses some agitation last night.

                                                Gross muscle and tendon and cartiledge pain.  I have bad side effects from taking motrin, ipuprofen, asprin, etc.   I did camomile, a couple of times did the colchicine in case the shot ingredients were making that click in....  but aspects of this was worse.  And I did some CBD during the day sometimes.   Still did the gaba and CBD at night.   Sometimes the pain was so bad it burned.   Bad heache that got worse with concentration, extremely dry eyes that eye drops didn&#39;t help, gastric  problems worse than I&#39;m used to, ate less.  I worried about long term leftover inflammation.    things are much better now, but still get the heache at a lower level off and on.   From old injuries, my muscles are weaker because I&#39;ve rested too much.   My need to sleep was extreme and I was taking long naps during the day and sleeping at night.   That happened even when I wasn&#39;t taking the daily time CBD.   It has been three weeks now and the pain is 99% gone.   I can concentrate better.  Etc.    I also want to report something many of my friends are reporting... and that is a sense of euphoria after the shot.  I also had that.  BUT I know that that can be caused by a kick into effect of hormones.   And I think one or more of the ingredients are apt to cause that (like the hydrocarbons/plastics).  they can serve as synthetic hormones.   People are thinking that the euphoria was psychological because of relief.   I know better and I want this explained to people.   It is not ok to let them believe this.

                                                The shot hurt when administered, didn&#39;t feel the first one. About 2 minutes after shot, felt light headed and like the shot contained adrenalin or epinephrine. That subsided by the time I left the site, although I remained slightly light headed all evening. Went to bed at 10:00 with an extremely sore arm, beginning of body aches and fever of 99.3. Awoke at 1:00am with 101.9 temp, extreme muscle and joint pain, and every time I moved anything, even a finger I would feel the sensation of a chill or slight electric shock. Urinated every hour from 1:00am and 5:00 am. When I awoke at 5:00 I was so weak, nauseated and dripping sweat I barely got my dog fed and let out for the morning. The nausea passed quickly but I thought I was going to have to lie down on the floor during that wave.Went back to bed, slept until 7:00 and was pretty much a zombie until 6:00pm last night(March 10) when all exhaustion and muscle pain disappeared and I have been fine since then.

I felt great the next morning.

I went to bed at 9:00 pm bundled up with numerous blankets, clothes, etc.  . My neck, lower back ached then a terrible headache set in.  I took motrin, acetaminophen then an Aleve migraine pill.  The migraine pill seemed to be the only thing that helped with the headache.  I was too tired, sore and weak to get out of bed until 11:00 the next day -  The headache returned about 3:00 p.m on Saturday   so I took another migraine pill.  Needless to say I was extremely fatigued and probably confused.  On Sunday morning I had multiple bowel movements - my ibs had been under control until this.

Saturday February 27, 2021 experienced muscle weakness and pain. This progressed into the inability to stand or walk.  Seemed to migrate up the ankle and into the legs.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 13 Feb 2021, the patient received the first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch# 007M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the night of 13 Feb 20212, the patient experienced arm hurt a little bit and she felt fatigued.  In the early morning of 14 Feb 2021, the patient went to the bathroom.  On her way to the bathroom,  she felt confused and had overwhelming nausea.  She lost consciousness and banged her head on the cabinet.  Within second, she regained consciousness but felt extremely weak.  She could not recall how she got back to her bed.  The patient said she was cold and clammy at that time and she never got back to sleep.  During the day on 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt a throbbing pain on the arm where she got the injection.  She was not sure whether that was due to the injection or due to her fall when she lost consciousness.  She could barely move the arm.  Then she took a nap in the afternoon and was able to recover from her lack of sleep that night.    Treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown (although her doctor advised her not to get the second dose given the reaction she had).  The outcome of the events was resolved on 15 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Additional information has been requested.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded

                                                On  Sunday 2/14, pt notes that she experienced chills and &#34;just felt out of sorts.&#34; On 3/15 at 1:30pm, she was scheduled for a wellness exam with her primary care provider. She notes that when staff took her vital, they were concerned because she seemed short of breath. Pt notes that she is overweight and does have dypsnea on exertion at times, but staff were concerned because she had been at rest for some time and they considered the shortness of breath unusual. Pt reports that her blood pressure was normal and her O2 sats were running 97-98% on room air. However, her pulse was 150. An EKG was done and the physician voiced concern over how long her pulse had been elevated. She was transferred to the ED,  where per her report another EKG showed that she was in  atrial flutter. Pt reports that she was treated with IV Cardizem and given and IV bolus of magnesium.  At approximately 4:30pm, a CT with contrast was completed to rule out blood clot or PE. A third EKG done in the ED revealed that she had returned to normal sinus rhythm. She was discharged home at 6:30pm.  Pt reports that she was seen for follow up on 3/20. At that time, her physician ordered repeat labs - CMP, potassium, magnesium, and thyroid - all of which were normal per her report. He changed her medication from baby aspirin 81 mg to Zarelto 20 mg, noting that she is at high risk for stroke. Cardiology has been alerted and she has an ECHO scheduled . Since her discharge from the ED, pt has been monitoring her pulse daily and it have ranged from 66-72 bpm/

For next 24 hours I was deathly sick at my stomach.  Dry heaves.  Fever and chills.  Could barely raise my head.  Couldn&#39;t even eat a cracker.  Then my arm started hurting, got big long red knot,hurt down the inside for about a week.  I was sick like this for almost 48 hours.  I was exhausted, so tired.  This lasted for a week.  After the first week, every afternoon I would get exhausted and have to stop and rest.    First shot effected my breathing, causing rapid breathing, like I was anxious.  Had a headache.  My heart beat fast for about 20 hours.  Then all of it stopped.  Several days later I got a round red hot knot that stayed about a week or two and was really sore.

                                                After Moderna Dose #1 Within one day of vaccination the person experienced extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, joint achiness, headache, and nausea.  She felt feverish and chilled but had no fever.  She noted nightmares , hard to focus, eye sensitivity, abdominal pain and about 10days after vaccination had an episode of thick saliva and drainage so that she had to sleep upright.  These symptoms progressed for about a week and then slowly resolve completely by about 3 weeks post vaccination.     After Moderna Dose #2  - RN spoke with client 1 week after dose #2. Within one day of vaccination she experiences intense fatigue, headache on day 2, light sensitivity, body aches in joints and muscles, her arm felt hot, swelling of her breasts, no appetite, and abdominal pain, She did NOT experience any rashes or itching or difficulty breathing.  Her symptoms were so incapacitating that she could not do any of her ADL&#39;s and could only relieve her pain by lying down in bed all day.  As soon as she tried to move around the intense joint pains returned and she had to lie down.  Normally she treats her arthritis with Colchicine as needed but received no relief.  After a few days she did try one dose of Allegra (antihistamine) with some relief.  Resting by lying down in bed for a week has been her only relief.  She did not indicate any allergies to PEG.

                                                I had aches all over 2 days after 2nd vaccination on 4/5/21.  Within a week, I had constant pain in my left knee and a little in my right.  I&#39;m in constant pain which is not relieved with Tylenol, ice or heat compresses, epsom baths, light exercise, or stretching.  At night I have trouble sleeping because my knee is so painful.  Several times I&#39;ve almost fallen.  My lower back is also bothering me because I can&#39;t walk normally and am putting even pressure on my knees, legs, and back.  Prior to the second shot, I was having this kind of ongoing pain.  It has severely limited my ability to get around and I often use a cane so I won&#39;t fall.

He said that she was watching television and he was on a conference call and he noticed she walked into a wall and he asked if she was okay and starting stumbling across the room and when he touched her she felt very heavy and said that one side of her face was drooping.  He got her back into the chair and called 9-1-1.  She was so agitated at the hospital that the husband does not know what they gave her and they kept her for a week.    They finally got her under control.  They discharged her from there and she that was all that they could do with her.  They brought her home with nurses assistance and her paranoia was evident, hallucinations were very evident. They said that they tried to do a CAT Scan and an MRI and they said that she did not have a stroke.

Finally they memory care facility told them to come a take her to the hospital and they had moved their hospice patient&#39;s as she was screaming and disruptive and they could not handle her anymore.     They thought she was suffering from Lewy body dementia at one point.  They were going to have her tested for that and they could not do it on Saturday when she passed for genetics and missed those timelines and could not do it.

                                                My left arm was sore a couple of hours after the injection. It continued to get worse throughout the day. That night had a hard time sleeping as it was painful and kept waking me up. I believed it would just get better on its own. It is now 2 days after the vaccine and again another restless night of pain. It is not getting better but seems to be moving down my arm. The injection was at the top of my shoulder, it is uncomfortable about 3 inches down my arm. I broke my shoulder In April of 2019,  It feels just like that  as I try to move my arm around.

                                                Typical expected side effects but were very SEVERE and UNable to function normally- headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Dizziness, Chills, Cold Sweats, Pain and soreness especially in lower back, and throat hurt when swallow.  These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

                                                By the late afternoon/early evening  I had developed a rash that covered my body from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head.  The rash was clearly visible but not bumpy.  It was extremely itchy.   I took Benadryl and soaked in an Epsom Salt bath several times that night as I was unable to sleep due to the intense itching.  The next morning (Saturday) I called my doctor and was prescribed a steroid to combat the itching  but was told not to take it until Monday so as not to interfer with the antibodies my body was obviously producing in response to the vaccine.  I was also instructed to start taking  one Zyrtec tablet each morning and two Benadryl tablets each night.  On Monday morning (01/25/2021) I began taking Methylprednisolone (4mg Dospak 21s) which relieved the itching.  At this time the rash is greatly reduced and the itching has almost stopped.  I will continue the meds until the  dosage is completed.

Day 8, arm itchy and red around the injection site.  Warm to the touch. Day 9, more redness and larger area. Size of a silver dollar.  Talked to the nurse at a local gym. Suggested a clinic. I Saw a Nurse Practioner at a clinic. She thought perhaps it was an insect bite as the red area was about 4 inches below where a &#39;normal shot&#39; would be given. Prescribed cream and antibiotic. I didn&#39;t take it.  Took Benadryl (pill). Improving after 1 hr of taking Benadryl.

                                                Approximately  84 hours after administration, I had severe vertigo when prone.  This included a strange sensation of my head floating and an odd sense of loosing consciousness.  The vertigo was awful, and I could barely stand.  This lasted each evening for about 6 night.  It subsided in the morning, after I felt more stabilized in walking.

Red area on sot arm by that evening - next day (2nd day after shot) developed red rashes by  outside of each breast, larger spot by left side (where shot was given), spot on left side of my neck also.  Not a raised or bumpy rash at all, not sore or itchy.    Called advise nurse to determine taking a benedryl was ok and took one last night.  This morning rash less noticeable but still there - also new little mark on inner left elbow.  Feeling fine this whole time, just concerned because I haven?t read of this reaction much for second Moderna.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the Maderna vaccine my head started hurting which I reported to the doctor on site. She talked to me and said I was ok to go. My headache pain persisted all day and into the next. For the pain I took Tylenol and Advil. The pain has not let-up since the day of my vaccination. In addition to the head pain, I started sneezing and had terrible eye irritation with burning and watering. These side effects are still persisting. The worst, however, is the severe head pain which only settles down when I sleep. I am sleeping only 3-4 hours at night now. I wake up for a bathroom break at 3-4 A M and can&#39;t go back to sleep. My head pain starts after I get up every morning about 1/2 hour to an hour. My doctor recommended taking Extra Strength Tylenol and Advil alternating them and an antihistamine. Functioning day to day and making decisions has been very difficult. But, the pain is the worst!!!

We sat her down and asked her if she had ever felt this way before and she stated that once she had a medication that made her break out in a rash that started out with tingling but eventually got worst. Nurse at this time recommended to patient that she should stay for 30 mins for further observation, patient refused. When questioned patient denied itchiness, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms except for tingling. Nurse offered benadryl prior to her leaving and she agreed, dose administered at 1058. At 1100 patient left the premises. At 1445 Nurse called patient with CDC recommendation that she does not receive her second dose of Moderna per her reaction. Patient stated that she wants to continue with receiving her second dose because as soon as she &#34;took off her tight brawl&#34; the symptoms went away. Patient does not believe symptoms were related to vaccine. Patient denied having any further symptoms; rash, shortness of breath, or further tingling at this time.

It was early in the morning and she thought it was in the middle of the night.  Her husband had to help her to walk with the walker, and was out of her head. She has not been able to walk since Monday afternoon about 4:00. She is now just today able to get to the bathroom. She has taken Extra Strength Tylenol, Trazedone and Klonopin so she could sleep as she has not been able to. She has never experienced anything like this in her life due to the pain. She is a little better today, she gets dizzy when she gets up but still in the bed. She called the doctor yesterday and spoke to the nurse who told her to go to the ER but did not as her husband cannot help her much as he has prostate cancer.

                                                Following the vaccine, within 3 minutes her bottom lip got numb, then her tongue swelled and then her eyes got fluttery uncontrollably, dizziness and weak.  They had her lie down in a recliner.  Her BP was 190/110.  She did not need an EPI pen and within 15 minutes her lip became unnumb, and her tongue swelling receded, was still a little thick, and her face was swollen, was red and flushed.  So they waited 30 minutes, her BP was not coming down, sent to the ER and observed for 3 hours and slowly her BP came down, all her other symptoms subsided and she was able to drive herself home.  Last night 2/25/21 she had great itching on her chest, which has since stopped.  Her tongue is still a little swollen, about 20% still feels thick.  When she left the hospital her BP was 146/86.  She has not taken anything for the symptoms just her regular routine medications.   She did feel tired and spacy feeling, and has been off of work since Wednesday as she could not focus to go to work.

Was told to wait another 15 min and was given water and snack to elevate blood sugar in case it had dropped (I do not have diabetes or history of sugar drops).  When I stood to leave, I stumbled in the hall and was told to stay and blood pressure was taken, which was elevated to about 170, which I had taken as I do daily, before I arrived and it was 119/60.  This was done at hospital by nurse. It was taken again, and it had gone down to 145, and I felt well enough to leave and drive home.  Stayed home, and vertigo was obvious, have had years ago, not recently, so I knew it was side effect.

                                                It stared out with just stiffness in my legs and back. Then at night I couldn&#39;t put my legs down they hurt and my shins felt like I had shin splines.  This lasted about a week or more. I went to a Dr. because my left knee and shin were hurting so bad.  The Dr. was not sure and did a Doppler to see If I had a Blood clot in my left knee but I didn&#39;t. She put me on an antibiotic, that I really didn&#39;t need I don&#39;t think. I took that for  a few days and stopped because it wasn&#39;t helping any. On the 14th I went to see another Dr. and he put me on Prednisone, at this time I could barley walk my right hip was hurting so much. I was taking little bitty steps.  The prednisone has been helping, it&#39;s allowed me to walk and to function. I was to the point it was getting so bad. I&#39;m still having some stiffness, my left elbow gets inflamed at times, my left hand and knuckle swell and get stiff at times too. It seems to move around at effect different places.  The medication helps me move better, I have been off work for 7 weeks, I plan to go back and try half days.

My usual temperature is 97.7.  I had severe neck ache and head ache extreme fatigue,  and was bed ridden for 4 days.  My fever started to decrease on the third day.   I had roving pains which lasted 3-4 hours in each place:  first the right back above the waist where the kidneys are, then just below my right breast, then the left side of the top of my head.  Throughout I had to have a wet cloth on my head.  About a week later I had a relapse.... my temperature rose to 98 and I had the same headache place and neck ache at the bottom back of my head along with extreme fatigue and brain fog.  It lasted at least two days.   Of course as expected my arm was sore, but very swollen like a goose egg,  red, and impossible to move.    I still feel the same fatigue, and have to go to be very early but have insomnia and extreme anxiety.

I sat for 30 minutes. At 12:20 the nurse said my face looked red. she took me to another area to take my blood pressure and said my face looked red and blotchy. at 12:25 2 more nurses came back and asked me how I was feeling and I told them my throat was getting scratchy and tight and felt like it was closing off. the inside of my mouth started feeling tingly/prickly and my tongue felt thick. My throat started closing off more and my lips started getting tingly and prickly. I started losing my voice as my throat was getting really constricted and I was getting shaky. At 12:30 a nurse gave me a half dose of epinephrine and called for an ambulance. At 12:40 the ambulance took me to the ER in the city. Then at 12:50 I arrived at the ER and they took me back and hooked me up to BP and O2 monitors and did blood tests. I was there until 3:30 pm that day. My BP was going up and down the whole time and I was very shaky. ER Doctor told me to NOT take the second vaccine dose and prescribed me an EpiPen.

                                                I had a slight anxiety feeling like fast heartbeat during my 15 minute wait time but not alarming. I left and continued my day but felt increasingly itchy and hours later developed a few hives.  I took a Zyrtec and after a few more hours it all went away,  For the next few days I had tiredness, joint pain and some chills. Completely better after a week.

The roof of mouth had a strong burning sensation then the top lip and area above top lip went numb and tingling.   Arm pain which improved with massaging and swinging arm.  Within 3 hours of the vacination, most of numbness and tingling gone from upper lip and above upper lip.  From time of vacination, I drank at least one glass of water an hour and swung and massaged arm as needed.   Within five hours, almost all  adverse symptoms were gone..I was left with a slight headache across forehead and back of head. Slept well that night; no fevers.  Morning after shot, slight headache but fine. But by 8:30 a.m. I was very, very tired.  Arms and legs felt almost too heavy to move or lift, and I felt a little &#39;out of it&#39;.  Slept 1 1/2 hours.  No energy, sat around entire day, drinking about 6 glasses of water.  No energy and tired rest of day.   Next morning all symptoms except slight headache were gone so I worked in the yard for about an hour.   My temperature was normal during the entire experience.

                                                Started to hurt just like any other shot. Never subsided. That night and continuing, I could not sleep on that side. My daughter, who got a shot at the same time, called me on 3/12/2021 to see if I had a rash like she did, so I went and looked in mirror. Rash from  shoulder to almost elbow. I called  today and sent photo.

                                                27 hours after vaccination, a copious, non-stop rhinitis began. I used up an enormous amount of Kleenex, was miserable, and my nose became very sore. The nasal fluid was clear. I had no nasal congestion, no sore throat, no sneezing, no cough, no fever (98.4F all day). I tried 25 mg of diphenhydramine after about an hour of this?zero effect. By 11:30 p.m. I was desperate, and l found a cold &amp; flu nighttime product in my cabinet: each tablet contains 325 mg acetaminophen, 10 mg dextromethorphan HBr, 6.25 mg doxylamine succinate, and 5 mg phenylamine HCl. I took 2 tablets and slept 8 hr uninterrupted. The rhinitis was gone when I woke up.

Saturday had a killer headache, severe muscle aches, extreme fatigue, dizzy and brain fog. The next day I had all of the same but less. Ate dinner night of the vaccine but did not eat or drink anything besides water again until 2 days later at 2pm as I had no appetite. When I ate my stomach hurt a little. I was tired for about 4 days and little appetite.

                                                I started with a dull ache in my right upper arm about a week after the injection.  I did not think there was any correlation between the shot and the arm pain.  It was not in the joints.  It traveled to the lower arm.  I could not lift heavy things.  The pain is not constant, but it continues at night when I am relaxed to a throbbing type pain.   After 2 weeks it went to my left upper arm and then has just been in the elbow joint of the left arm.  It only aches when I move it around a lot or lift.  The pain has continued until today with no improvements in either arm.  I am not in excruciating pain, but I have a hard time lifting objects with my right arm, and turning it a certain angle is more painful at times. I did not strain my arm in any way that I can remember around the time I first experienced pain.

BP was taken later and was 205/155-59. My normal is 117/70. Surprisingly, this high BP did not dissipate on it&#39;s own.  IT lasted a total of 26 days but gradually the highs lowered. Headaches woke me at night. (Facial flushing with high BP was first noted by a neurologist years back and I was found to have surges of nor-epinephrine. I was tested for a pheochromocytoma but that was negative. I normally have small self limiting surges for 4-5 hours once every month or two. I do not need medicine with those. I have longer surges after steroid injections I get for bursitis.

                                                Within 1 minute I started feeling a rush in my throat and a metallic taste, then a tingling in both arms.  That subsided for a minute or two, then started again with a flush feeling down my body.  Nurse took blood pressure 140/80.  Breathing fine. Heart rate fine.  Flush feeling started again, and blood pressure dropped  to100/70.  I was then given 50 mg of Benadryl and an ambulance was called.  My blood pressure stabilized but I was very shaky.  It was recommended that I go to the hospital for observation for a couple of hours, which I did.  I only had the flush feeling once at the hospital.  I was released after two hours.

Her husband reported that she was well until the evening following her vaccination (1/08/2021) at which time she became agitated.  The following day she became very fatigued and unresponsive, taking only sips of water.  The only medical attention they sought at this time was a home health hospice nurse as the patient had been on hospice.  Her condition spontaneously improved without treatment after 3 days and 6 days after her vaccination she was at her normal baseline.

                                                After the shot, I went home and felt fine.  I did some housework (cleaning) for about thirty minutes, then sat to rest .  Shortly thereafter, I began feeling pain in my left arm.  The pain became more severe as the day progressed until it was very severe and movement of my arm was limited.  The pain progressed throughout the night and also moved into my shoulder.  I got very little sleep even after taking Tylenol and trying heat and  ice applications.  Now, on the third day I am still having pain and am unable to lift my arm or move it outward without severe pain.  I am definitely hindered in my movement and use of left arm.  This is disturbing as I am an artist and need both arms to do my work.

Blood pressure rose to 170-190 over 110 and would not go down.  Doctor advised I go to the E.R. for assessment, which I did. Blood pressure remained elevated for days . Noted the systolic was higher , mostly in the 80&#39;s.  I do not have hypertension BP this morning  in the 120&#39;s over 70.  Needed Alprazolam to calm my anxiety since.  Not every day. Very concerned about having the second dose. Doctor has advised me to only drink water the day of shot, take a tranquilizer an hour before and has given me BP med to take if my BP goes over 150.

These are the results  My blood pressure, normally ~119/71p51, spiked to 185/90p56, 2nd test was 166/80(?)p62, 3rd test was 175. Head felt pressure. Body felt chills alternating with heat. Chills with lack of energy persisted for 2 days. Blood pressure on 1/27 was: 98/62p44, 102/51p43, 98/62p44, 94/57p50.

                                                Zero discomfort at injection site or for 4 hours after, but at almost exactly 4 hours &#43;one minute, upper portion of left arm became unusable. Could not lift arm, or support even as much weight as a tissue.  Could not pull pants up. Needed help changing clothes. Unable to sleep that night. Symptoms persisted through next day, but began to resolve very gradually 24 hours after onset. By day 4, arm was back to normal. However, 7 days after injection,  woke up with arm unusable again. Same time progression -- arm non-functional and extremely uncomfortable (not excruciating, but very intense)  for about 24 hours. Another night of no sleep. Gradual improvement over 3 days. Pain was largely confined to muscles in upper arm, but radiated partially up left side of neck, and occasionally down into lower arm.  A small price to pay for not getting the virus though! No other aches, pains, fever or nausea.

                                                chills and fever beginning on Jan 29 around 1PM and continuing through the night.  Bedtime temp 99.9; waking temp 97.4 which is normal for me.  Did my normal breakfast Jan 30 followed by a 4-mile walk and felt fine.  Mid-day temp 97.8 so no worries.  Bedtime temp 100.1  plus ice cold hands and feet. Had profuse sweating during night but would experience feeling cold.  Waking Jan 31 temp 99.3.   Rested during day. Mid-day temp 98.6.  Bedtime temp 99.9 with chills through the night.  Feb 1 awakening 98.7.  The lingering side effects that interfered with my regular routine began to alarm me so I emailed Dr.  Because of the window of time we were in relative to the inoculation, he is viewing it as an extended side effect and advised to watch for other symptoms.  To date I have no other symptoms yet these chills and fever have continued all day Feb 1 and Feb 2.  Beginning Feb 1 I have kept a log of hourly temperatures.  I have not taken anything to attempt to bring down the fever.  On Feb 1 my temperature began to rise at 1PM with 99.0 and by bedtime it was 100.5.  On Feb 2, today, I rose with 99.2 and ranged to 97.8 which seems aberrant because the other temps are all in the 98&#39;s or 99&#39;s.  The chills in the morning and early afternoon do not seem as noticeable as the ones in the evening.

Woke me around 3:00 AM, lasted 2 days. 3rd day felt washed out and hollow, head still feels swollen.  Unable to move out of bed for 2 days due to pain. Drank lots and lots of water to flush out of system. Am in between doctors right now  and was to out of things to call anybody.  Don&#39;t really want the 2nd vaccination due to the more severe effects 2nd doses are having on others. COVID symptoms twice in my life is more then enough.

No headache, no actual pain on body or at shot site. Just achy.

                                                Woke up about 1:00 am in delirium and feverish. No control over thought process or able to get up. Managed to get out of bed at 9:00 am but was so weak could barely make it up a flight of stairs. And when I did ended up in bathroom vomiting. Laid on floor to get some strength back. Went back to bed and slept restlessly until 4:00 pm.  Still feverish and weak but not as bad as earlier. Ate some cold grapes and went back to bed until the following morning. Tried to stay hydrated and took ibuprofen several times. My upper arm was red and blotchy for 3 days. Overall I?d say the severest part of the event lasted 48 hrs and another 24 hrs of tiredness and nausea but not vomiting.

At 1;00PM  I woke up and stood up out of bed and collapses onto the floor.  I was unable to get up.  I found my phone which had fallen onto the floor.  I was shaking so bad I kept dropping it.  I looked and my phone and was  unable to figure out how to make a call.  The screen did not make sense.  Eventually I was able to call my daughter who decided to call 911.  The paramedics came, picked me up  off of the floor and helped me walk to the living room.  My legs kept giving out like I was going to fall again.  They were asking questions but I was unable  to answer coherently. I was so confused.  My brain was not working.  They took me to the hospital where I was admitted and many tests were done.

                                                As her husband, and caregiver since 2017, when she was diagnosed with dementia (I believe she had symptoms long before that) I noticed a very observable increase in the severity of her symptoms of confusion, memory loss, not being able to stay focused, disorientation, anxiety, agitation, anger, depression as a direct result of the second dose of the covid vaccine  The change was very noticeable and has not gotten any better. This appears to be a permanent escalation in the severity of her symptoms. I would say she has advanced  a stage to stage 5. We are now considering adding a new drug for her to take to try and level things out.   She also appeared to have a slight fever for 48 hours after.

                                                I began having a reaction on the evening of 2/19 with a sore arm and scratchy throat. The next morning, I developed shaking chills, slight nausea, headache, and low grade temp 99-100. I also noticed swollen glands and muscle aches and pain in my back. That lasted about 28 hours. After that I had nerve pain in my neck and all my teeth were painful. I went to bed. I have fibromyalgia so I thought that I may be triggered into a flare. The acute symptoms subsided in a few days, but I then had  intermittent sudden nerve pain, cold spells and hot flashes, a recurrence of irritable bowel like symptoms, with occasional diarrhea (uncharacteristic for my IBS-C). I had to visit my osteopath (for osteopathic manipulation) twice in two weeks for the pain.  She suggested that my symptoms were more than a typical flare and that I should report to VAERS. Yesterday, 3/9 I began to feel exhausted. Last night I had severe systemic  itching that kept me awake much of the night. Today the fatigue continues along with temperature dysregulation. I have contacted my PCP and am awaiting an appointment confirmation.

                                                Night following shot, I slept badly and felt cold all night.  When I wanted to get up to go to the bathroom around 5:30 AM, I could not get myself off and out of the bed.  It was like my legs wouldn&#39;t work. When I was finally up, I had no control of my bladder and urinated all the way into my bathroom. When I was done on the toilet, I started to stand up and lost my balance. I tried to reach for the door jam but missed and fell backwards onto the toilet and sat hard and hit my back very hard against the top of the toilet.  I helped back to bed by boyfriend but had to get up several more times that morning and had the same weakness in my legs and no control over my bladder. My boyfriend had to leave to go home, so I called my sister to come and stay with me in case I couldn&#39;t get up again. One she was here, I ate a small amount of roast chicken and slept most of the afternoon. I slept thru the night and felt stronger the next day. I felt very tired and sleepy for the next couple of days, but (3 days later) am now feeling and moving in a more normal manner.
