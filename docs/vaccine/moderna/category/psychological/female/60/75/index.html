When I woke up a few hours later, I noticed that I had a very bad headache and all-over body aches, and I felt like I had the flu.  Weak, nauseous and extremely tired.  I went to bed and slept through the night, when my alarm woke me at 7:00 am on Tuesday, January 5, I got up to use the bathroom and felt all the same symptoms from the night before, only worse.  I noticed that I had a rash on my left arm below the injection site.  I called in sick and went back to bed.  I slept from approximately 7:30 to 2:00 pm on January 5.  I felt a little better upon awakening, but had a very bad headache and no appetite.  The other body aches seemed better.

                                                Severe arm pain at the site of the injection  which started 24 hours after injection and persisting through today - day 9  postvaccine. The pain is lateral upper right arm and descends inferiorly toward the elbow. No redness or swelling at the site.  I&#39;m having great difficulty with sleep because of the pain.  The pain is aggravated by  motion.  The pain is helped somewhat with ibuprofen 200 mg every 6-8 hours.

Around 1115 she was still dizzy, stated she didn?t have much to drink or eat, so we brought her water and a snack.  No hx of diabetes. 1120 she looked flushed, and now had tingling in her left arm.  Took her BP 140/70, HR 70,  temp on her forehead 97.1.   1130 she continued to have a strange feeling in her arm from her shot site to her left hand, and up her neck.  Vaccinator counseled her to take an antihistamine once she gets home. Patient called her husband and her son who would take 40 minutes to come get her. She began to exercise her left arm, and began to feel better. She left with her family at approximately 1:00, still a little dizzy, no longer flushed with less discomfort.  We called her at 7;15 pm and she reported that symptoms had resolved.  Took Zyrtec. Extended observation and sent home.

                                                I feel issue is more related to injection error, Injection site was above the deltoid. I have had steroid injections in other shoulder and this is the sensation I felt during injection. The rn also told me &#34; You have tough skin&#34; after the intense pressure started. I worked the night before injection. I went home to sleep. woke around 2pm with intense pain in my left arm, I could not shift position or move my arm. with out excruciating pain. I used heat, aleve,  tylenol &amp; biofreeze. By saturday,  i could easily move left arm from elbow down, but extremely limited from shoulder. today i have most of my range of motion, but still have dull ache and pain restrictions. This pain is in my shoulder, not my arm or deltoid. . On thursday, pain was constant, roaring throb 7/10  shoulder to shoulder blade, almost to spine in back and down to elbow , then 9/10 with any movement.   Today is ache 2/10 just in my shoulder, with 5/10 with some movement. I had to call into work 1/7. I am scheduled tonight. I am an ICU RN.

I had to stop working that day and the next day. The headache was unrelenting. I went to bed with a heating pad on my head. Typically my body temp is 97.3 it went up to 98.1 I took Ibuprofen and Benadryl around the clock for the next 10 days. Day 8 &amp; 9 were the worst. My arm looked like an orange at the site of the injection; it was red/inflamed, induration &amp; itched. The welt size 2&#34; x 1&#34;. My headache was intractable, severe chills with teeth chattering, nausea, GI turbulence. It was a horrible 48 hours at which time I was again not able to work. I finally felt better on day 10. On day 14 my arm finally looked like it had not had an injection in it.

                                                From the date of the vaccine given I only had a sore arm for a couple of days.  Nothing then until day 7 then I started to feel run down and noticed a lymph node on my left chest at the clavicle.  It was large .  I wasn&#39;t thinking about my vaccine at all at that time.  I made an appointment with the PAC and he was concerned about it and had me do an ultrasound and blood work.  The ultrasound showed nodes measuring 4-16 mm concerning for lymphoma or just reactive. Then I had a ct and the  impression was indeterminate left axillary lymphadenopathy.  For the next 7 days I was home in bed a lot and was not able to take call as scheduled at my work place.  They hurt and I also developed a rash on the injection site, the back, the scalp and neck.  It itched and was annoying.   As the days progressed my nodes on my chest hurt and I could feel them as well as my groin  and abdomen.  January 28 my left arm started burning and hurting when I stretched it out to do activities or work.  February 1 a lymph node appeared in my inner elbow space I confirmed this with my Dr. that it was a lymph node.  It doesnt hurt as much now as before it swelled.  Not drinking extra water on any given day makes them all hurt more.    I felt rotten enough the 7-14 days after I had a covid test and it was negative.  I just found out today that my Covid 2 igG  Sar2 GB was positive on 1/14/21.  My other lab work was perfect

She states that she has a history of adverse reactions to flu vaccines that are anaphylactic like in the past.  She usually premedicates with Benadryl and steroids.  Today she did take 100 mg of Benadryl prior to her vaccination.  Shortly after receiving the vaccine, she did feel like her throat was getting a little bit tight but she did not feel like it was true anaphylaxis.  However she then felt very off.  After this vaccine her throat started to feel tight, and she stated she did not feel well overall.  She did have some tunnel vision and was shaky. At about 1730 her heart rate drops to the 30s, she started feeling itchy, and then she went into a coughing fit and started to feel her throat close. She received 0.3 mg IM epinephrine, 20 mg IV famotidine, 125 mg IV methylprednisone, 0.5 mL of nebulized racepinephrine, and 500 mL NS bolus. She has since recovered and is stable on room air.

                                                I had a sore arm on Sunday night - and Monday it was really sore and couldn&#39;t use my arm at all so I called in sick. Got sick on Tuesday, the January 5th - woke up with a sore throat; hoarse throat; fever; chills; cough - and chest was congested.  Fever came and went. A bit of muscle aches in my chest from coughing so much. I called the DR and they sent me down to the COVID area of my doctor&#39;s office. They did COVID test and told me to go home. On Thursday, they reported that I was negative on my test. I called my Dr  and she told me she had to still be quarantined for 10-14 days. She told me to take my asthma medicine and she told me to take cough medicine (OTC) and take Tylenol if I still need something else. She told me to drink fluids and rest. I went back to work on January 19th, Tuesday. I still have a little bit of congestion and cough.  I had the second dose of the Moderna on January 28th. I had  a sore arm but not as bad as last time.

                                                On February 03, 2021 my arm started itching.  On February 04, 2021 my arm continued to itch with the appearance of three distinct circular areas of bumps (dime sized circles).  On February 05, 2021 I was awakened from my sleep due to my arm itching.  The previous distinct dime sized circles had merged into one large red papule (oval shaped 3 inches long by 2 inches wide).  I contacted Dermatology clinic for an appointment.  In the meantime I applied Hydrocortizone ointment to the area and took a benadryl tablet orally for the itching.  My doctors appointment is scheduled for 02/05/2021 at 10:30 AM.

I continued in this state while the Dr&#39;s at the hospital ran tests.  Around the 16th and/or 17th, after 2-3 days of steroids, I could answer Dr&#39;s questions and recognized family.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the vaccine on Thursday I had a very metallic taste. Shortly after breakfast on the morning of the 25 I had a lump in my throat as though my food didn&#39;t go all the way down. Then, as the day wore on I got more &amp; more fatigued; later in the day my lips were mildly numb. I had no appetite at supper time and started getting a headache along with chills. All day Saturday I had flu-like symptoms, chills (no fever) extreme tiredness and a dull headache and laid under a blanket all day, no energy. Saturday evening around dinner time I started feeling better and Sunday woke up feeling as though nothing had happened other than a dull headache and soreness at the injection site.

Soreness in arm continued for 3 weeks, on and off.  Sometimes it felt like deep bone pain, she described as excruciating.  Sometimes woke her at night.  Did not occur every day.  Some arm swelling.   The injection was given at where she works.   This PHN did not give the vaccine, but patient called to inform of reaction.  We were going to complete this form together, but patient decided she&#39;d do herself.  I am not certain she will, so am sending the info I was told.  She received 2nd injection 3/1/2021.  Side effects seem less vigorous, by report, so far this time.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

                                                She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.  Then her arm started hurting to the point that she could not move it.  On Thursday, 3/25/21 she was tired but functional.  Then around 5:30 PM she started feeling really strange, odd, felt faint, got hot/cold, her heart was racing.  She laid down as she was at a friends house, they checked her BP, blood sugar and her temperature and they were all normal at that point.  Around 8:00 PM she got the nausea that would not stop and took Zofran.  Around 9:30 she started throwing up.  She then tried Phenergan and was not able to keep that down yesterday.  Then she started running a temperature, and called her doctors office and told her what to look for and to call back if things got worse.  They then got worse, called them back and then around 8:00 AM on Friday they told her to go to the hospital.  When she got to the hospital they started checking things as her fever was higher, her liver enzymes, her thyroid, her kidneys, iron just started going off the page.  Her fever then kept getting higher and higher and at one point it was documented at 104.8, and felt like her organs hurt.  11 days prior to this visit she had just had labs done and everything was normal.  So due to the new findings everything was all elevated, so they checked her for an infection, COVID which was negative, but the intensity of the symptoms got to the point they were unbearable.  She stayed in the hospital for 4 days, and the doctor came in and noted that she had a severe reaction to the vaccine.    They told her to stay longer than the 15 minutes as they had some issues today, and told her that they had to call a medic for 4 other people that passed out, which made her wonder if they had a bad batch or not, and wonders how many people from that day got sick as well.     She still has the most dreadful fatigue, headache and cannot walk from her house to the mailbox without feeling like she is going to faint and used to walking 2-4 miles daily.  Wonders how long is this going to last and that this will pass and that she will be okay, or is she going to be permanently this way.  She feels like she has a bad case of mono or something and cannot stay up and has to go to bed, and also has bouts of insomnia as well.   The body aches are extreme and is taking pain medicine daily due to these symptoms, which she did not have prior to the vaccine.   She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.

                                                NOT SURE THIS IS EVEN AN OUTCOME OF THE VACCINE, BECAUSE I HAVE HAD THE HEAD COLD AT THE EXACT SAME TIME AS GETTING THE VACCINE ON JAN 31, 2020, BUT THOUGHT I SHOULD REPORT.    1.  HAD A VERY MINOR HEADACHE THE TWO DAYS FOLLOWING THE VACCINE, JUST MILD DISCOMFORT.  FULLY RESOLVED ON ITS OWN AFTER TWO DAYS.  2.  MONDAY, JANUARY 4 WHEN I WOKE UP I FELT &#34;PUFFY&#34; - FEET AND HANDS WERE MILDLY SWOLLEN.  NOTICED MY SHOES FELT TIGHTER THAN USUAL AND HANDS FELT A BIT DIFFICULT TO FULLY CLOSE.  THIS IS FLUID RETENTION, AS IF YOU HAD TOO MUCH SALTY FOOD THE DAY BEFORE, AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS I HAD INGESTED MORE SALT THAN I REALIZED ON SUNDAY.  BUT IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE THAT OCCURRED FOR ME AND MY DIET DOES NOT INCLUDE MUCH SALT OR PROCESSED FOODS.  THEN TODAY MY FEET AND HANDS STILL FEEL PUFFY, SHOES STILL A BIT TIGHT AND HANDS A BIT HARD TO CLOSE SO THERE IS STILL SOME FLUID RETENTION GOING ON.  THIS IS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR ME, I AM QUITE HEALTHY AND HAVE A GOOD DIET AND DON&#39;T RECALL THIS HAPPENING BEFORE.    AGAIN, NOT AT ALL SURE THIS IS RELATED TO THE VACCINE, IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HEAD COLD, BUT AS I AM NOT SURE AND THIS IS UNUSUAL AND HAS OCCURRED AFTER RECEIVING THE VACCINE, I FELT I SHOULD REPORT IT.  THIS EFFECT IS VERY MILD AND I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND IT.

They gave me water and crackers and said try to eat something for second shot. After 30 mins I felt OK to leave. During the rest of the day I had a headache which worsen and next day (1/6/) the same and had that weird out of body sensation off and on. I also had mild achy feeling, fatigue and both hips and shoulders mild pain. I did take this day off from work. These symptoms resolved towards the end of that night. Doing much better today (1/8/21). I aslo had mild swelling and sore at the injection site which I expected like a flu shot. I have not had any reaction to any vaccination prior years.

Call them in 2 days to let them know how she&#39;s doing and also wear a heart monitor because they do not know how to take care of her, Has had vision blurriness in both eyes.

Took off work.  Fever spiked at about noon the day following the vaccine to 100.1  Tylenol then Ibuprofen was taken. By 6:30 am the next morning (today )all symptoms seem to be gone.  I think it may be important to know that I was sick with covid 19 in April/May of 2020 for almost 3 weeks

Due to this we observed her for 30 minutes following administration of vaccine.  About 25 minutes into her observation period she began developing hives on her forearms and wasn&#39;t feeling her normal self.  She denied any respiratory symptoms but was continuously clearing her throat and when asked if she normally did that, she stated that she did not.  Decision was made to take vital signs and administer 50mg of IM Diphenhydramine.  She was agreeable to this plan .  After administering Diphenhydramine, we continued to monitor her vitals and had her stay another 45 minutes for observation.  Hives resolved and vital signs remained within normal limits.  Patient was education on allergic  reactions and she to seek medical care.  Patient verbalized understanding and felt  back to her normal self.

                                                Pt is a pleasant 61 year old female who received Moderna COVID19 prime vaccine dose on 1/15/2021 as part of employee immunization event.  Pt reported upper respiratory viral illness the week prior but determined with medical advice that she was well enough to be immunized on the 15th. Immediate post-vaccination period was unremarkable.  Later that evening pt experienced onset of HA and fatigue which progressed to severe HA, low grade fever (~99 F per patient), malaise, and sore shoulder the following day.  Symptoms gradually improved over the next 2-3 days with HA being the most troublesome and lingering symptom.  Pt used OTC analgesics to manage HA pain. On 1/19/2021, four days after prime dose administration, pt noted a visible lump mid-clavicle, determined to be a severely swollen lymph node.  Warm and tender to touch.  Pt sought medical attention for this the following day, 1/20/2021.  Physician&#39;s assessment: &#34;Pt received the COVID moderna vaccine Friday, left arm.  She is a triage RN at Medical Clinic.  She states yesterday a lump appeared on her LT clavicle area.  Pt reports the lump is tender, &#34;warm&#34; but not red, and no surrounding erythema.  Yesterday had HA and a &#34;weird sensation&#34; radiating to LT ear from the lump.  The lump is now the size of a golf ball, did draw a line under it to see it.  She is able to swallow okay and has no other concerning Sx.  No changes in breathing.  Has had headaches, which have been reported possible side effect from COVD19 vaccination.  This vaccination was given quite high in her arm she thinks as well.  Fever Sunday night, 2 days after vaccination.  Has been taking Tylenol and IBU (not what she does usually) taking with food and has some GI upset.  Did try a cool compress on the lump yesterday which did not seem to help.&#34; // &#34;Can clearly see her soft tissue mass above her left clavicle, with a line that she drove underneath it yesterday when it started to form. There is no redness but is certainly tender to touch. Can still see a little bit of bruise in her arm where her vaccine was given in her left arm which does seem quite high, not two finger widths from the acromion process. Discussed prednisone but she is terrified of this as she was given a Symbicort inhaler not that long ago and felt that the steroid really made her wired. Recommend warm compresses, alternate between Tylenol ibuprofen with food and even topical Voltaren gel which she has at home and Arnica gel to area. Can certainly get CBC CMP for further evaluation. Discussed soft tissue ultrasound if this does not improve, will order this today in case it is needed she can just get that scheduled. She is going to report her vaccine reaction to the link she was given on the paper which I think is appropriate. Hopefully symptoms will improve in the next few days and then can proceed with her second vaccination a month from the first.&#34;  I spoke with patient today, 1/27/2021, to submit VAERS report. She reports swollen lymph node is still visible though size and sensitivity continue to slowly diminish.

Very tired and did not feel well.  Low grade fever was sporadic.   Could not go to work. Called Dr. about symptoms and prescribe antiobiotic of Ceftin for the sore throat..  Sore throat went away after 24 to 48 hours of being on medicine. By day 10 all the skin reactions had calmed down and by day 12 was feeling good.  Dr. wanted me to report to you guys.  He was unsure if I should take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  He seemed confident throughout that this was an immune response to the vaccine.

By that evening, fever ( not checked nor confirmed but probable) 14 hours after the vaccine with rigors. Body aches for 24 &#43; hours after receiving vaccine. plus intermittent headache.   By 36 hours later, still having intermittent fever (100.1 ) with body aches and sheer exhaustion.  I am a nurse in an I.C.U.  I had to call off work today, 48 hours after the vaccine. was received. Mainly for this persistent exhaustion. Also this damn headache still hanging around...mild but irritating. I know none of this is what I would call ADVERSE but my co-workers insist I need to fill out this information so I am. I it 50 hours from the vaccine and I am tired, slow and have to lay down and rest. It&#39;s stupid. My first vaccine was NOTHING . I have not had covid and I don&#39;t plan on it.  :)

                                                I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my PMD office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

                                                I had the injection at 11am., 2am I woke up with a severe headache, body aches, nausea along with 101.4 temp.  This lasted until mid day, then just fatigue.  Wednesday  I got a large fever blister on my lip ( have had history in the past, not in some time though)  Since then I have had an additional  3.  2 very large and not on my lip.  Under by nose and as of yesterday on my lower cheek area. I was given Valtrex 1000mg  take 2 then additional 2.  Because of the frequent out breaks in the past several weeks, I started 500 mg daily.  I am due for my next vaccine on Feb 9th, but I am concerned.  ( I did have Covid 4/15/20 )

                                                IM vaccination was  given in LUE deltoid. On the day of the vaccine felt slightly dizzy and more fatigued. The following day, I developed a painful, enlarged lymph node in left supraclavicular area. The next day I felt overall weakness and tiredness. No fever noted, but I was frequently flushed and had hot flashes with perceived sudden weakness. I had slight nasal congestion and prolonged sneezing spells on the following days. I had to find a place to sit down and remove my lab coat and turn down the heat because of hot flashes at work. I had fecal urgency and loose stool x 2 on 3/5/21. I have mild lymph node enlargement in left neck today (2/6/21) that is not painful. I had pain at the injections site for 2-3 days after the first vaccine injection that awakened me from sleep a couple of times. The second injection was given in the same arm. All of my symptoms are easily managed with Tylenol, Motrin, fluids and rest.

According to my Watch app., the resting hear rate upon waking was 115.. I had a severe headache and generally felt awful. I took Aleve and did deep breathing to try to bring heart rate down. One hour later it was coming down, although still higher than my normal resting rate of 60.  The arm where the injection was given has been extremely sore with a rash, sore enough that it is hard to use the arm. It is now 3 days since the vaccine, my heart rate has been normal. My arm pain is reduced but still sore with a rash. I feel fatigued and foggy. The severe joint pain is less but still present.

It felt very odd and was very scary. I had no tingling  in my lips or in my throat. I could speak, drink water and eat. The sensation lasted approximately 5 hours until it felt somewhat back to normal.  I have my second doze of the Moderna vaccine scheduled for March 5. I am worried about getting it after having this reaction.  Please advise me.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

                                                I had a sore arm at injection site for 3 days, no change in my activity level. On 2/25/2021 my arm became itchy and began to swell.  By evening when I was able to examine the arm the deltoid was swollen to twice it&#39;s normal size and a red diffuse itchy rash approximately 4cm by 6cm.  I took zyrtec and applied ice.  Swelling went down somewhat and itching relieved. 2/26/2021 swelling and itching continued. I iced at 1pm to get some relief.  7:30 feel really run down. will need to ice again to be able to get sleep. I am concerned that a delayed histamine reaction like this may get worse after the next dosage.

Nothing seems to help the pain. Heat seems to help some. But I cannot do activities of daily living without pain. I have been to a chiropractor besides my Primary Care Dr.  Not absolutely sure if it is from the shot but could be a contributing factor.

I was monitored by EMS and given 50 mg IM Benadryl. After 30 - 40 min. symptoms cleared.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen all night and all day and could not get relief.  I missed a day of work because of this. I am still with fever as of 5:55 pm and the body aches and migraine. This was not explained to me. I feel like I did when I had Corona on the worst days. I am really praying that this ends so that I can go back to work tomorrow.

I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

Then progressed to whole body itching. Unable to sleep for two nights. Went to urgent care next morning. Was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg. Itching went away that night and was able to sleep. Next day bilateral hands had numbness and tingling and general dizziness so stopped taking hydroxyzine. Went to family practitioner and was prescribed methylprednisolone dose pack. After starting steroids, by 2nd day (today - 1-21-21), hands continued n/t. Bilateral feet developed n/t. Dizziness continues when standing but goes away when sitting. Balance and gait are unsteady. Difficulty walking from weakness, balance issues, and dizziness.

On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right. I still feel fatigued and I have a full feeling around the area of my right upper abdomen ( liver), I dont have a gallbladder. Otherwise, I am OK. Just wondering about the 2nd dose. Lymph node still slightly swollen above clavicle.

                                                About 9PM after the receiving the vaccine I started had riggers which lasted for about an hour. I couldn&#39;t reach for my phone or call for help. I either passed out or fell asleep. Around 1AM I woke up and checked my temperature 102.7.  Some point after I took some Tylenol but don&#39;t remember when. I finally had to call for help from my family in the morning because I was not able to pee or drink. Tuesday was my fever was still 102.7 with taking Tylenol and Advil it would just go back up.  Tuesday I had Riggers again about 5:30 it only lasted 3-5 minutes. Wednesday my fever went down to 101.4-101.5. Have had difficulty swallowing when the fever is high, did not feel as if I had a allergic reaction or that my throat was sore it was just hard to swallow.  I have a weird bruise on my arm I have clue where I got it. I didn&#39;t urinate for 9 hours. Headache. Pulse OX was at 93-94 for Monday and Tuesday but then it came it up 95-98 yesterday.  As of today I still pretty weak no fever when I woke up.

                                                Awoke at 11pm from a sound sleep feeling unusual but unable to identify anything specific. Checked my O2 saturation with my pulse ox and was 76% with a heart rate of 122.  Used my rescue albuterol inhaler which I haven&#39;t used since October (Fall and Spring are my typical times when I need albuterol inhaler and then not regular use.) Waited 15 mins with no change.  Took a nebulizer treatment of albuterol.  After 30 minutes was getting O2 saturations in the 80&#39;s. With deep breaths after an hour got a reading of 96% but wasn&#39;t consistently staying in the 90&#39;s.  Fell back asleep around midnight and awoke feeling ok.  I did not feel SOB when my saturation was at 76%, but my pulse was elevated to help compensate.

Then 02/01/21 exactly one week later had a strange feeling in my head not a headache not dizzy just felt an unusual feeling in my head of not feeling quite right especially with movement then 2 hours later had a ringing in my ears have no ear infection noting unusual im an RN and would report any other conditions. then  that evening i began feeling itchy at my injection sight but i was just iching it though my clothes and wondered why i&#39;m so itchy on my shoulder I really didn&#39;t think about the shot as it was 7 days later. The itchy feeling continued so I went to the bathroom took my shirt off and saw a rash which i will include pictures of the rash if I could. i was alarmed and concerned about the big rash and the papules sticking up.  It&#39;s now the next day 02/02/21 I still have a big rash on my arm it&#39;s about 6 inches long 3 inches wide red elevated.  I googled it and it said it was the covid arm or something.  I am willing to provide pictures

                                                I had a positive Covid test 10/26/2020 with severe symptoms (every symptoms except SOB)that lasted for 1 month until 11/27/2020.  I received Moderna Covid vaccine on 12/31/202 @ 12:30 pm.in my left deltoid.  Fifteen hours after receiving vaccine, I was awakened from sleep at 3 am with a pounding headache, this headache continued for days eventually shifting to the left side of my face and head with posterior neck spasms and pain. I had generalized mild body aches, and mild fatigue.  2 nights I woke from sleep completely soaked and had to change my clothes- I did not check my temperature ( the same thing occurred with Covid). Post vaccine:  Left Arm very tender initially.  On day 3, 1/2/2021, I developed increased pain,  swelling with a warm ,red rash at the injection site on my left arm.  By day 5 this area had greatly extended in size, warmth and tenderness.  Day 6, the rash on my arm had disappeared and I am able to palpate a small lump with very, very slight tenderness at the injection site. I had a repeat Negative COVID test on 1/5/2021 I am continuing to have a dull sensation of pain on the left side of my face (as of 1/8/21), still with palpable spasms on the left posterior neck. All other symptoms have essentially resolved. I have not contacted allergist- wondering if I should before receiving 2nd Covid vaccine.

                                                initial symptoms started at ~ 8-12 hr post inj on FRI:  fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain (generalized), back pain from sacrum to occiput, through cranium to behind eyes, nausea, loose stools, exhaustion, arm swelling (6&#34; diameter) with bandaid indented becoming hard (feeling a little like cellulitis).  routinely measure pO2 and body temp--both spiked; resp rate went from normal pattern of 10-12 to 25; night time HR went from low 60&#39;s to the 100&#39;s; pO2 went from 96-98 to 89-91 (Innovo PulseOx)Treated with sleep (slept from 8PM night of shot until 48 hours after the shot), fluids, hot water bottles, arnica (I can&#39;t take NSAIDS), vit C, zinc megadoses;  by ~36 hours post injection I started wheezing and coughing deeply but non productive, both nasal passages were/are open, feels as though phlegm is stuck at bronchi.  By 48 hours, I was feeling better except chest, ribs, head, and neck and was experiencing 1-3&#34; episodes of spasmodic coughing, wheezing, SOB; Occurred every 20-30 minutes and leaving me physically exhausted.  Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

                                                Following my second dose of Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on 2/13/21 I experienced a significant reaction to the second dose: My temperature rose to 102 with headache and arthralgia throughout body that prevented sleep. I was in bed for more than 24 hours due to lightheaded/dizzy/nausea when standing. I fell once when getting back into bed due to loss of balance. Severe symptoms started 15 hours after receiving the dose and lasted approximately 36 hours post dose when my temperature then returned to normal. The next 1-2 days, while I no longer had a fever and symptoms were improved. I was still fatigued and did not feel fully recovered. Treatment during the severe symptoms included rest, icepack to head, Tylenol or Ibuprofen slightly decreased temperature for a brief periods. I informed my physician&#39;s office Dr, of the above reaction and was told to file a VAERS report.

                                                A 63-year-old female with a medical history of Hashimoto?s Disease, on Levothyroxine 88 micrograms (4 days per week) and 100 micrograms (3 days per week), presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of acute onset of severe, debilitating, fatigue, weakness, anorexia and malaise. She had no clear precipitating events, stated that she was in her usual states of health, active, working as an optometrist at a University hospital. Stated that 1 week before symptom oncer she had her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Stated that 24hrs later her symptoms started associated with low grade subjective fever, however her fever disappeared, and she persisted with severe fatigue. She was unable to do her regular activities of daily living and was hoping her symptoms would resolve but upon persistence and given the severity of her complains she presented to evaluation. She denied recently starting any new medications/supplements, or recent change in her levothyroxine dose. There were no headaches, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, recent infectious illness or sick contacts. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s Disease over 10 years prior and had been on the same dose for more than 2 years.   VS were stable and within normal limits, physical exam was only remarkable for weakness on 4 extremities 4/5, lethargy, bradylalia, bilateral ptosis, no focal neurologic deficits, sensation intact. Laboratory workup revealed normal Hb 14.8, normal renal and kidney function, normal cortisol level, TSH normal 3.7, normal FT4: 1.2, normal CPK, negative tox screen. ESR and CRP were performed, and both were found to be elevated ESR 74, CRP 28, at that moment we decided to do immunologic workup showing high titers of ANA &gt;1:320 with a nuclear speckled pattern, and a positive rheumatoid factor 60. At this point a full rheumatologic panel was performed which was negative for anti-Ach receptor Abs, negative anti-CCP, anti- dsDNA, anti-smith, negative anti-Jo1, anti-RNP, negative anti-TPO, negative anti-SCL70, normal C4 and C3 however elevated total CH50 &gt; 60, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Her symptoms of severe fatigue persisted throughout her admission and it was decided to give her a course of prednisone 40mg for 5 days and follow up as outpatient with a Rheumatologist. Repeat workup 2 weeks after discharge showed still elevated ESR at 72, high CRP 17, rheum factor elevated again at 67.  At this point no clear cause was identified as she did not have any symptoms of Sjogren or anything else other than severe persisting fatigue.  Another course of steroids was given and 1 month later she stated that she was much improved and was able to go back to work. Stated that she would not take her second covid MODERNA vaccine dose due to fear of recurrence of symptoms. It appeared that this vaccine triggered a severe inflammatory and autoimmune reaction in this patient with history of Hashimoto?s disease. The association between MODERNA vaccine and development of autoimmunity and inflammatory reaction needs to be assessed.

                                                Tested positive for COVID 19; Hallucinating; Body aches; Fever; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 62 year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed body aches (myalgia), fever (pyrexia), hallucinating (hallucination) and tested positive for covid 19 (SARS-CoV-2 test positive).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 04 Mar 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Mar 2021, approximately 2 days after receiving vaccine, the patient developed body aches, fever and hallucinating. On 07 Mar 2021, the patient tested positive for covid 19.  Treatment information was not reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, the mRNA-1723 does not contain virus capable of causing infection and with the occurrence of SAR-COV-2 test positive after vaccination, is unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).    On 12-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMORRHAGE (Bled down her leg), HAEMATOMA (Hematoma on lower leg), FEELING ABNORMAL (Creepy) and RASH (Rash on legs, hands, wrists, fingers). At the time of the report, HAEMORRHAGE (Bled down her leg), HAEMATOMA (Hematoma on lower leg), FEELING ABNORMAL (Creepy) and RASH (Rash on legs, hands, wrists, fingers) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-059458 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62-year-old female with a serious unexpected event of hemorrhage, and nonserious unexpected hematoma, feeling abnormal and expected rash. Event onset with unknown latency after first dose mRNA-1273. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

                                                Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021 I felt a little strange.  Just not myself. A little dizzy.  Went to work overnight.  Got up at 5 am Friday, Jan 8, 2021.  Still felt odd.  Dizzy. Had to think before I did anything. I stood up from the bed and sat back down again as if I was dizzy and confused.  Drove myself home from work, fed the cats and went right to bed.  I felt very fatigued, had developed a monster headache.  Was dizzy, had chills, body aches, nausea.  I brought  water bottle over to the bed with me but after laying down just could not get myself up to get a drink.  Felt very fatigued.   Slept until 2 pm.  Took my temperature.  It was 101.5.  Had no energy, ate no food, took no meds, just went back to sleep.  Still nauseous, had headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Woke up at 5:00 pm to feed cats.  That?s all I did, and go to the bathroom.  Took my temperature again.  It was 100.9.  Still felt awful:  nauseous, headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Seemed like I could  not get warm.  Stayed in bed and slept.  Saturday, Jan.  9, 2021 I woke up around 7:30 to go to the bathroom.  I fed the cats also.  Still dizzy, moving slow.  My headache was gone, but still felt unsteady.  After feeding the cats,  I went back to bed.  Slept until 12:30 that afternoon.

Within 2 hours, I could not continue to work and went home. Took motrin at home and rested.  The following morning  the headache was mild but the injection site was very painful. No reddness or swelling, not firm but extremely tender to touch. Pain at injection site was present for 2 days then resolved slowly..

Felt swollen, but dont think it was, burning sensation on lateral borders and tip of tongue,extremely dry mouth.  Felt as though it had also been burned, and had a few white spots on tip, reddened borders on lateral aspects also, very scallopededges. Note I do have a fissured tongue but this reaction was unlike any I had ever had from eating certain foods that trigger any tongue response, and had not eaten anything night before to trigger this. Lasted a few days and progressively felt normal after 3-4 days.

                                                About 14 hours after vaccination, I had a (really bad) pulsating headache in a band around my head, body aches (hip flexors, shoulders, back, neck), chills, fever/sweats, and nausea/vomiting (threw up twice, total, about an hour or two apart after not eating for 10 hours - small amount of liquid came up). The nausea/vomiting went away about 4 hours after onset while the other symptoms remained for an additional 42 hours. I also had sinus/eye pressure that began about 22 hours after vaccination and ended with the other symptoms. Could not sleep for the duration because of headache. Very tired/sleepy about 62 hours after injection and was able to nap since headache went away. I still have soreness at injection site about 72 hours after injection.  I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn&#39;t want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days. The next worst was the nausea/vomiting, because, well, nausea/vomiting, and especially because there was nothing to bring up. And, unlike vomiting from bad food or something, you don&#39;t really feel better afterward, just still nauseated. The other symptoms were more bearable. Did not call or see doctor because I had read about these possible side effects and didn&#39;t think there was anything the doctor could do to alleviate them.

                                                I was woken up from sleep at 11:30 with swelling of my tongue.  It was getting hard to breath, so I got ice and sucked on it for awhile, then I put a cold cloth on my face, tried to relax and the swelling seemed ok.  I stayed up all night because I was afraid that it would get worse, At about 9:30a.m. it seemed to be getting back to normal with just a little swelling in the back of my tongue.  I felt terrible for the next three days and still don&#39;t feel great. Sore joints, got chills, headache.  I am not going in for the second shot.

I sat down to tie my shoe and noted Pitting &#43; 3 or 4 edema to BIL Calves.  Redness , warmth in a few areas.  R leg 1&#34; larger than L.  Then  I mentioned it to another nurse and  she said it could be side affect of Norvasc.  I spoke with my PA about it on 2/12 she D&#39;C&#39;d Norvasc and perscribed  Nefidepine 30 mg ER. I have not taken it yet I am monitoring my BP and it is WNL.   The edema less in calves however continues in ankles.  I have gotten MULTIPLE broken capillaries all over my legs.          Long short it has to be a reaction to vaccine.  And it continues almost 2 months after injection.   I can&#39;t wear most of my socks.  It is BAD.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

                                                Seizure; Neurologically confused; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 63-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and  experienced a seizure and was neurologically confused (confusional state).  The patient&#39;s current conditions included epilepsy. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 26-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22-FEB-2021, right before the patient was supposed to get the second dose of vaccine, she had a seizure and was hospitalized. The same day, patient was neurologically confused. The patient underwent different unknown tests including computerized tomography. On 24-FEB-2021, the patient was discharged from hospital.   No treatment information was provided by the reporter.

                                                The person who gave me the shot placed the injection too low on my arm. It should have been up near the shoulder, but instead the person gave it to me down toward the middle of my arm. I knew something was wrong immediately because it felt so warm and disruptive. The doctor on the scene said it was nothing. Nine days later I went to Urgent Care with swelling, hot-to-the-touch, itchy and a huge knot. The Urgent Care Dr. gave me a five-day prescription for Prednisone and also gave me a prescription for hydroXYzine pamoate, which is an antihistimine.

Light adverse side effects right after the vaccine was administered. Remained under supervision for 45 minutes longer instead of 15 min. Within 5 mins, heat rose up to my head causing dizziness &amp; head spin. Then loss of smell lasting for 10 min or a bit longer, then tongue tied hard / swollen for 3 hrs and lasting mildly 1 day after. Severe dehydration. Did not monitor heart beat due to severe fatigue. Took blood pressure rising and falling like roller coaster 2x. I stop and learned to relax and sleep throughout the day to calm the nervous system and the slight fever. Other normal aching pains as pre-described side effects. No nausea, vomiting, no rash as of 1 day after and no difficult breathing. Occasional and short loss of smell carried after 1st day.

                                                Hello, i took the Moderna 1/4 and am scheduled for 2nd shot 2/1. I just wanted to pass on some side effects and i did not go on the agency website which i should have to report them. I had a headache off and on the first week. the first day afterward i had a 100 degree fever as well. I never have sleep issues (falling asleep etc) i had insomnia and could not sleep and didnt sleep well for around a week. What i noticed most though is it really affected my stomach and i was awakened with acid reflux several times. the muscles of my stomach were sore like i had been coughing (but hadn&#39;t) and i had no desire for food, only fruit, light watery things. as soon as i eat anything i have stomach pain digesting. Since last weekend i sleep way too much, even if i set the alarm i turn it off and keep sleeping. I try to walk and get out.  when i wake up it seems my stomach has been really active, i have a horrible taste in my mouth and acid reflux liquid in my through.  Just letting you know; and I have the 2nd shot so fingers crossed i&#39;ll come through all of this. Take care as well. Thanks

On January 16 woke up feeling great and about 3:30 in the afternoon with no warning extreme dizziness and nausea came over me.  Felt so awful, tried to eat something, vomited immediately.   Felt so horrible, had to go to bed, slept on and off throughout the night.  Woke up Sunday, feeling better, not 100%.  I?m concerned if on January 16th was a reaction because it was two full days after receiving the injection.

                                                On Saturday on the 16th I started itching all over my body and my head, dry mouth and my ears were itching as well. On Sunday I noticed the itching  increased after taking my  levothyroxine. The 18th I noticed the same pattern of itching increasing after taking the levothyroxine the dry mouth as continued. Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

Approximately 12:30-1:00 AM on 01/09/2021 woke up, turned my head and experienced room spinning dizziness for about 2 minutes. Had to remain completely still to stop the room spinning.  For the next 2 days (until the morning of Monday 01/11/2021)  I experienced on and off room spinning dizziness at unpredictable intervals.  Usually didn&#39;t last longer than 2 minutes but had to remain completely still to stop the spinning.   Starting on Monday 01/11/2021 had &#34;normal&#34; dizziness along with some flu like symptoms,  headache, tiredness,  soreness/achiness and extreme soreness and pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine shot. I stayed out of work because of the on-going dizziness. These symptoms continued until Saturday 01/16/2021.  I took an antihistamine on Saturday night and finally woke up Sunday 01/17/2021 with no dizziness.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA: I got the vaccine at 11 am on 2/15/21. There were not immediate adverse effects.  By 3:00PM, my arm was becoming very sore. By 8:00 PM, my right arm was extremely sore and overall body aches ensued as I began to feel weak. By 9:00 PM, I felt the need to get into bed and had chills, a severe headache and pain over my whole body, accompanied by shooting burning sensations down both arms into my palms and fingers. I had not taken any medication for the discomfort up to this point.  As time went on, my pain became excruciating, I never felt this kind of pain in my entire body. I had pain in areas I never felt pain before like my arms, hands and toes.  I also had extreme pain in the back of my neck, both shoulders, both arms, my hips and knees. The pain was so intense and throbbing, my headache was severe at my temples and I had chills.  I did not take my temp, but I am sure I had a fever, although I was not sweating. I could not sleep at all and finally broke down at 1:30 am and took an Advil.  There was minimal help with the Advil and I slept on and off over the next 4 hours. Throughout today, the headache, chills and pain continued, but slightly less and I was able to take a 2 hour nap.  I think it important to note that I had more of a reaction to the first COVID shot that most others I talked with and felt an ongoing weakness after the first shot over the course of the month.  I understand that some of my symptoms are part of my body&#39;s reaction to building antibodies, but  with the intensity of my reaction, I have to wonder if there is more going on.

Later sometime in the middle of the night, I wasn&#39;t able to fall asleep as if I&#39;d had a stimulant, and had intense arm pain where shot given, some nausea, some intestinal discomfort, intense pain at temples and behind eyes, overall &#34;crappy&#34; feeling.  Sun., Feb 14, 3rd day after shot: Pains/symptoms same as above with the addition of a low grade fever (99.9), chills, fatigue, no appetite. Tylenol didn&#39;t help. Was able to drift in and out of light sleep. Later in the day, fever and majority of symptoms suddenly &#34;left&#34;,  gradually decreasing until I felt fine again by Sunday evening. No issues Monday, Feb. 15.

The following 24 hours I experienced total insomnia, chills, headache, body ache, shoot pains, extreme weakness, and nausea.  Insomnia lasted 3 nights.  The other side effects began to decrease after 24 hours, but still prominent enough to prevent from actively engage in anything for another 24 hours.  After the third night of insomnia, I thought I had turned the corner.  But I continued to experience headache (I basically never have headache), occasional nights of insomnia (I usually sleep extremely well), and low level of nausea, and fatigue.  Today, 8 days after the shot, after another night of difficulty in sleeping, I woke up with the same headache behind my right eye, nausea, weakness, and fatigue.  This is when I thought to report these side effects.

It took a couple of hours for it to come down to normal. Went to sleep and woke up BP normal and a slight headache.  My arm was sore lasting about 3 days.

                                                48 hours after the injection I began to notice a sore throat before bedtime on Dec 30, but slept well. The next morning, Dec 31, I had acute allergic symptoms that never start so suddenly.  I was having constant Post-nasal Drip, nasal congestion and beginning of cough due to PND.  That night I had a severe sore throat similar to my typical allergic pattern.  I coughed all night and awoke on the morning of Jan 1st with clear severe onset allergies and could not talk without coughing.  That persisted for 4 days, then my allergist prescribed inhaled steroids BID which reduced the nighttime cough, but I persisted with symptoms for 10 days when they slowly resolved and my sense of well-being returned.  I missed 7 days of work, which is atypical for my allergies when I catch them early.  This was an acute flare of typical allergic symptoms that seems to have been triggered by the timing of the immune change from the vaccine at day #2-3 after the vaccine #1 was given.  I  am worried about getting vaccine #2 in 2 weeks and don&#39;t want to go through another flare up of dialing allergies again.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011L20A) intramurally in the left deltoid bursa for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 02 Jan 2021, the patient reported she had been given the vaccine in the wrong location. The vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle. The patient was also experiencing loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and she also can&#39;t sleep. Treatment information was not provided. Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. The event vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle was considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events loss of range of motion, can&#39;t sleep, and pain at the injection site were considered not recovered/not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of 65 year old female patient who experienced non-serious unexpected events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle for mRNA-1273, lot #  011L20A. The patient experienced loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and can&#39;t sleep. Onset latency was not provided.  De-challenge and re-challenge are not applicable. Based on the information provided the events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle, loss of range of motion and can&#39;t sleep are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 as this is due to product administration error. The event of pain at the injection site is included in the known safety profile of the vaccine, hence a causal association cannot be excluded.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

On 1/19/2021, pain on left arm that over time went up to my shoulder to neck and now down to right arm.  Currently neck and right arm hurt more than injected arm.  Pain feels muscular and nerve like (similar to when I had shingles).  Pain is not relieved by Lidocaine 1% patch or with Ibuprofen or Tylenol.  I am not sleeping and am in pain all day.

Was 3 inches by two inches. The arm is now back to normal.  .2. Day 8.  Woke at roughly midnight with extreme heat and burning in all toes.  Quite painful.  Very unusual, as I have never experienced anything like this before.  When pain and burning became overwhelming I took Tylenol.  It helped and I was able to sleep.   The next morning the pain and burning were gone but my toes were, and continue to be quite numb, as is the area of my feet that surrounds my toes.  I can&#39;t fully feel my socks, shoes, sheets, etc.  It feel like I have cotton stuffed in my shoes.  It is hard for me to related the level of heat, burning and pain that happened.  I felt like I could melt a block of ice with my feet.  It was severe. I marked &#34;disability or permanent damage&#34; below because I don&#39;t know if the nerves in my feet will return to normal.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

The lump was hot, bright red, and it was the same size as a mosquito bite.  The lump went after 2 days.   I did not do any treatment.  I have been very tired since the injection, and I have to sleep 3-4 hours during the daytime.   I do not normally have to take a nap during the day.   I am still very tired and am sleeping a lot since the injection.   Normally I am very active during the day.

                                                Shortly after injection I got hot, foggy, felt like tongue was swollen.   Had problems swallowing.  I was scared, but said nothing.  It only lasted a few minutes.   About after an hour of being home, I had an issue swallowing only once.   I don&#39;t know if adverse reaction, or panic attack.  I have my 2nd dose schedule for the beginning of Feb  I will let them know what happened.   Also, quarter size red spot on right arm.   It hurt when touched.   Lasted a couple days.

                                                I felt anxious after the shot, but that night felt ok. Morning was another story. I woke up with pain in my muscles from the waist down and found it difficult to walk. My eyes started to hurt. I had blurred vision. Around 2:00 I went by the mirror and saw that my eyes were blood red. I laid down and rested. About 2 hours later I got up the most of the redness was gone but then I had a headache.  The next  morning a persistent cough and the sneezes started.  The headache would return every time that I coughed or sneezed. It was very painful- as if someone hit me with a hammer.  Even though the pain only lasted a few minutes, it hurt a lot. I sneezed and cough a lot. Finally, Sunday morning I was walking better; however, I felt I had the flu. Normally, I would have gone in and got ready for a sub, but I wasn&#39;t able to. I rested on the couch. Then took a 2 hour nap. Finally, I felt better around 6 pm except for the painful headache that returned every time I coughed or sneezed. It has been a week. I thought the worse would be over by now. I guess I will have to go in and talk to my doctor on Monday because the sneezes and coughs are still quite painful. When will it end?

I believe it  itched enough to disturb my sleep moderately.  The next morning I took a single zyrtec and either due to time or the effects of the antihistamine, my shoulder stopped itching.  My shoulder did NOT become red or show a rash. It is probably insignificant and may be normal for the general population but of all the shots I can remember and I receive a flu vaccine every year, I never had my arm itch significantly near the shot date or after.  It  was not a significant event, but I report it just in case this is unusual.

                                                First I had a burning feeling on my face which began in the afternoon. By bedtime I was hurting all over, terrible headache and could not sleep. I developed a rash, pain, swelling and heat over injection area that was about 6 inches round. I also began to have ringing in my right ear and pain in the right side of my head. All of the symptoms persisted for over 48 hours and as of now four days later I remain with severe ringing in my right ear.

                                                Vaccinated at 1:20 PM on 1/26/2021. Approximately 15 min later I was in the waiting area, the nurse had been pre-notified to watch me for allergic reaction . In 15 minutes my symptoms were fast heart rate, lips burning, dark red facial flushing, ears flushing, and anterior neck flush, body tremors, a rapid response team notified to evaluate me. I was administered a 25 mg  Benadryl tablet per mouth.  I felt stabilized and chose to go to the ER within the building for further evaluation.  Remaining stabilized, had a 4 hour wait until I was seen by emergency staff. My treatment was Solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and Benadryl 25 mg po. I was placed on a heart monitor and a pulse oximeter to check my oxygen levels the entire time I was in the ER. 4 hours prior to being seen by the ER doctors I had a CBC, a BMP blood work, and an EKG. After medications were administered I was observed approximately 1.5-2 hours. I was discharged with a 5 day medicine regimen to follow. Prednisone 40 mg per day; Pepcid 40 mg per day; Benadryl 25 mg every 6 hours. On 1/27 I chose to take the Benadryl 25 mg only because I had received the Pepcid and Prednisone the previous night late. On the 28th I took the medicine as prescribed but only took Benadryl every 12 hours. I felt Benadryl 4 times a day would not be handled well with my body. On 1/30 I was able to take the Pepcid and Prednisone but had to discontinue the Benadryl due to waking up with a spinning sensation upon opening eyes and a loss of equilibrium upon walking. I completed my medicine regimen on 2/1. Today 2/2 I woke up with symptoms of watery eyes, flushed face, mild facial itching, after drinking one cup of full caffeine coffee developed an increased heart rate and nervousness, was medicated with Benadryl 25 mg po at 10:00 AM along with my blood pressure medicine and potassium. Also at that time my blood pressure was 150/80. Three hours later my blood pressure had come down to 130s/60s but felt extreme weakness and felt the need to lay down and rest with legs elevated.  I continue with my day with increased heart rate with activity, so I have remained inactive for the rest of the day.   Also on 6:00 AM on 1/27 I was awakened with a heart rate In the 160s, I called 911, paramedics came 5 minutes later. On arrival my heart rate had instantly went down to the  112-120 range. The paramedics explained they have been treating COVID patients and have seen this a lot, we discussed going to the hospital but I felt I was stabilized and didn&#39;t need further treatment.   Also upon discharge from ER visit they had me get 2 epi-pens and I now have 2 epi-pens available at home.

These symptoms continued through the night. The next morning I had severe fatigue and had to call in sick to work. This continued all day and into the next night (36 hours after the shot). Overnight (40 hours after the shot) I had a low-grade headache. After 48 hours most of these symptoms subsided. Right now (54 hours after the injection) my arm is still slightly sore.

                                                I had the shot at 12:30pm.  I went bed about 10pm, and woke up to my right arm having a series of tiny shooting pain tingling (at specific spots, as if it were a pin prick traveling up and down my arm; pinging randomly across the arm). This  was accompanied by an extreme desire to scratch/itch my arm where the pin pricks were being felt. I found myself scratching my arm in my sleep. There didn&#39;t seem to be a discernable rash of any color, but by the next day, i was seeing slight welts at various points along my upper and lower outer arm. I would feel a sharp pin-prick/tingle and instantly would feel the urge to scratch it. The scratching continued -- but not consistently. Sometimes for an hour or two at a time, seemingly coming out of no where. The arm was fine and then I&#39;d wake up or be jolted by the sharp pin prick accompanied by the insane desire to scratch my arm.   These &#39;spells&#39; of tingling and itching have continued until today (one week and one day after getting the #2 Moderna shot.  I have managed this with Benedryl (it worked by addressing the itching somewhat and provided relief from the tingling - it made me sleepy); anti-itch creams (soothed the skin topically), ice (to take the sting/itch sensation away) and calamine lotion (didn&#39;t really work). Tonight (1/8/2021 I cannot sleep. Although the itching and sensations seem to be intermittent, I have woken up the last couple of nights with intense itching and tingling to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep  Usually Benedryl calms everything down, but tonight it isn&#39;t helping at all and I am crawling out of my skin.  I have not gone to my Primary Care Physician, but will call and go in tomorrow.

At about 4 hours after I smelled smoke and dirty dish rag smell. That didn&#39;t last. Other symptoms started 12 hours after given shot. It was immediate like turning on a light switch. I slept until 5:30 the next day, 2/3/2021. Was able to eat a bit of soup and went back to sleep until next morning. I was able to go to work on 2/4/2021 but experienced some weird brain fog and fatigue. On 2/5/2021 my arm had a large red ring around injection site and hives below it. I remained fatigued and lack of appetite for 4 days or so.

After the 15 minute wait, I proceeded to my car.  When I removed my mask, I saw that my cheeks and nose were very red.  By the time I arrived home (about 30 minutes after being vaccinated) the redness had gone down considerably.  I did not even know that this was considered an adverse effect until I saw it online a few weeks after my vaccination.

                                                Three days after receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine I developed severe radiating low back and leg pain and inflammation and pain in my right knee .  I also developed a persistent pain in my right hand and thumb along with &#34;trigger finger&#34; type symptoms in my hand where it clenches up and I cant open my hand up without using force. At times the pain is so bad I am unable to walk normally  and also unable to utilize my right hand to open or hold things.  In the 22 days that have passed since the shot the symptoms have not subsided and are effecting my ability to get around and carry my normal activities of daily life.

                                                About 6 PM the day I received the vaccine, the arm started to become extremely sore. It was achy feeling and it radiated down to my wrist. This lasted until Sunday and it started to fade. Today it is just some soreness left at the injection site. I was taking OTC Acetaminophen 500MG between 100 MG for pain. It was difficult to sleep due to the pain. I was also putting cool compresses on it.  The pain worse when I was trying to clean my car and shovel the snow. However the cold compress and stretching did help with some of the pain. I also felt agitated for different periods times after vaccination, I felt like my hormones were out of whack and I wanted to &#34;bite someone&#39;s head off&#34; this lasted for about an 1 hour or so. I also had mild headaches.

Sometimes dull throb, sometimes sharp pain usually on left side (same side as vaccine shot). Sensitivity to light. When pain is sharper causes indigestion and nausea. Pain goes away if I take  ibuprofen, but always returns and persists overnight. I don&#39;t like taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen more than once a day or for continuous days. Acupuncture worked for a short time. Affects my ability to concentrate and work on computer or watch TV. What other natural treatment will help? How much longer will this last?

                                                First, extreme upper arm discomfort after nursing student had difficulty stopping the bleeding.  Then, within 5 minutes, felt somewhat dizzy as pain radiated across shoulder, up spine and neck, into jaw and right ear.  Then, horrible jabbing pain under shoulder blade, followed by a feeling of extreme compression from site of injection to wrist.  Checked every 10 minutes or so by nurses for 50 minutes.  They said that redness first was up arm then down arm.  Once light headedness improved, I left for work (remote teaching from home).  By 3:20, I found it hard to focus, the throbbing under my shoulder and compression feeling of my arm increased with diminished feeling in right hand.  Usually 97.2 temperature but ran low-grade temp of about 99 degrees for 3 to 4 days.  Sleepless night first night with increased pain and discomfort, i.e., no new symptoms but all symptoms increase with difficulty turning neck and head.  Area around injection warm for several days, with swelling first 24 hours, resolving over a few days; still dark black and blue today, 8 days later.

                                                Injection on  Wednesday at 3 PM. No immediate reaction. However, a few hours after the shot my left arm (at the injection site) was sore and swollen.  That evening it was painful and disrupted my sleep. The next morning (Thursday) I was somewhat feverish. By the mid-morning my fever was up to 100.4, and by the late afternoon it was up to 101.4. I felt exhausted -- too exhausted to even write an email. I had chills, backache,  and slept nearly the entire day (~8 hours). Based on this, I would call this day a 4 in terms of severity.   The next day (Friday), my fever had declined to 100.2 but was still elevated, but now I had a backache (lower back), and I was still weak. However, I could get out of bed for about 10 minutes without too much difficulty. I slept for about 5 hours during the day. This may also qualify as a 4.  On Saturday, my fever had declined further to 99.4, and my energy level was somewhat better.  Even so, most of the day was spent in bed, but I slept less during the day than on the previous days (about 3 hours). The main thing that was a problem on Saturday besides being weak was a headache. This is a strange thing because I rarely have had headaches in my life.  This is a pounding in the front of my head, only occurring when going from an upright position into a seated or supine position. Most of the headache disappears in about 30 seconds.  Overall I would say Saturday was a 3 in terms of severity. Today (Sunday) my temperature seems to be normal (98.6) -- though this is a full degree above what is normal for me. However, the headache has become worse -- it was hurting me while sleeping, and woke me up from the discomfort.  I still have the backache, and I am still weak. It&#39;s only 6 AM here so I cannot comment on how the rest of the day will go.

Body felt &#34;electrified&#34;. 2nd vaccine - 4 hours after receiving the vaccine I got aches and pains. This progressed over the next several hours to: 1) my skin felt like it was on fire; 2) followed by chills and shaking; (all night); 3) hallucinations; 4) extreme fatigue to the point I felt like I was buried in cement and couldn&#39;t get out of bed to go to the bathroom.  At one point I thought about calling an ambulance but my mind was unable to figure out how to do that.  24 hours after injection: 1) headache, mild body aches and some feeling of skin burning.

                                                Patient received her COVID-19 Moderna vaccine this afternoon.  She then started &#34;feeling strange&#34; a few minutes later, requesting fresh air. She was monitored outside for 30 minutes. Her O2sat remained &gt;96%ile the entire time. Her HR remained in 60s-70s. Her initial blood pressure was elevated at 210s/140s and improved to 140s/110s with calming relaxation techniques.  She did have brief jerking episodes of her lower extremities intermittently. They were suppressible. She remained conscious the entire time and maintained good eye contact.  At minute ~20 post-vaccination, she endorsed not remembering why she was there, requesting to stand up. She stood up with support and then sat back down. Repeat BP was elevated to SBP 200s.  Decision was made to continue observation in Urgent Care as her blood pressure was still elevated and she still appeared anxious. She was speaking in full sentences and was drinking water without assistance.  She was placed into wheelchair and brought to Urgent Care. However, during UC triage, she  reportedly informed nursing that she didn&#39;t want to be in the enclosed observation room in UC, that she wanted to go home. Her partner wheeled her outside to the patio. When nursing went to go find her, the patient had eloped.

My 2nd dose was on 2/25/2021. Exactly 2 weeks later on 3-11-2021 at 11am I went into a full seizure and my husband called 911. I was not aware of my surroundings until 3/12/2021 at 10am. I spent 4 days in  Hospital .  MD and several other Neurologists  reviewed and tested me for seizures. I had no history and my tests came back with no reason or conclusion for having a seizure. The COVID vaccine had been the single only change in my life. I also had NO pre existing condition to  have a seizure. I was so sick after the first vaccine 01/28/2021 that I did not think I should get the 2nd dose but I did. For over 30 years I have gotten my flu vaccine every year with no issues. I will never ever get a COVID vaccine again.

The level of pain was terrifying....and lest you think it&#39;s just that I can&#39;t handle pain, I&#39;ve given birth to 5 children without any pain mediation whatsoever.  I am still in the depths of an autoimmune flair-up where severe pain in my joints and muscles occur.  I continue to feel significant fatigue.  I also continue to experience some level of &#34;brain fog&#34; (the inability to follow though streams for long, read more than a few sentences at a time, inability to stay mentally organized).   Mild nausea and inability to digest well continues since the day of the vaccine 3/15.

                                                She got her vaccine, and started out with the sore arm, but she was sitting in the bathroom sometime after 11:00 preparing to do a peritoneal dialysis exchange and blacked out.  She grabbed onto the towel bar on the wall and fell hitting her left hip, left ankle and left upper arm.  She does not remember too much after that, but that she was in and out of consciousness until about 12:30 PM Saturday when she remembered being alert but nothing made any sense to her.  Her son came in and found her on the floor, she could not get up, she had a skin tear on her right elbow and she had been incontinent of bowel and bladder.  He started to ask her the orientation questions and got them all wrong, but she knew that she was confused and disoriented.  She could not get up on her own, called the paramedics and they took her to the hospital.  The confusion and disorientation lasted into early Sunday morning 3/28/2021 at about 3:00 AM when she started to answer questions appropriately.  As the day went on things got better, but still exist to this point today 4/6/21.  It was more severe as she came out of the confusion.  She has brain fog, inability to sequence thoughts, a little bit of expressive aphasia.  She had two CAT scans and an MRI that were negative for subdural or CVA&#39;s.  I had urine specimen and blood cultures to rule out a UTI or sepsis and those were negative.  Her kidney labs were normal.  She ABG&#39;s drawn and those were normal.  They placed her on oxygen and she sat for 3 days and then they released her to home.     Today, she is still having the brain fog, still the not able to sequence thoughts, general fatigue.  She is black and blue from shoulder to elbow due to the fall.

Woke in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and had horrible vertigo actually bouncing off the walls. Took Meclizine and benadryl for relief. Wondering what my immune system will do on the second dose!

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  For the first 8 days, I experienced no reaction to the vaccine.  On day 9, I developed a rash on my right arm surrounding the vaccination  site. I was also flushed and my eyes were red.  And, I experienced diarrhea.  I began taking Benadryl 25mg  every 4 hours during the day (and took zolpidem only at night). In the subsequent 4 days, In addition to the rash, I experienced minor headaches and body aches (not unusual with my Fibromyalgia) so I added Tylenol 500 mg every 6 hours. The rash remained the same. Today is Day 5 and I awoke feeling better and the rash is the same size but not as vibrant. I used a cortisone cream on the rash today and only took Benadryl once when I began to feel lousy at the end of my work day.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA,   after waiting 15 minutes after vaccine, I left and stopped at a restaurant for a plate to go home, went home and began eating,  after awhile  i became very nauseated and seemed to not taste my food, but that was intermittent.  about 2-3 hours later i became very ill with hoarse cough, bad headache, low grade temp of 99.6 ...this continue thru the night, not letting me get much sleep, next day, Thursday, my left arm was so very sore i couldnt lift it, but the pain went across the top of my back to top of my right arm...couldn&#39;t raise either arm.  Friday continued to feel the same sickness, nauseated, headache, off and on low grade temp and pain  in arms and upper back. I was taking 800mg Ibuprofen 3 times a day and it would ease off headache a little, but nothing  would stop for long.  I was just miserable. had heard the 2nd vaccine could cause such problems, but not the first...therefore, I am a little frightened of getting the 2nd vax. I tried to call the triage nurse at the VA to  ask her about it, but never could get thru to her.  Sent message saturday night to PCP, and was told to go to this website and put in info.

                                                From my diary about the events of yesterday and today:   I will try to relate what happened to me yesterday.   I received my second Covid vaccination a few days ago and perhaps the following is related, but I?m not sure.  I think I felt fine yesterday morning, and decided to scrub my tub. I was mostly finished when I felt dizzy and went to lie down around 1pm.  A friend texted me asking if I was free for a chat, but I wanted to rest a little and did so, texting her when I awoke.  I did feel out of sorts when I awoke, and was aware that I had had some dreams, but texted her anyway.  We agreed to have a call at 2pm.  While on the call, I felt I was struggling with the conversation.  I was trying to tell her of my experiences with a recent part-time job (which I quit) and couldn?t remember names of people I worked with or certain events that I wished to convey.  I still can?t remember names of people with whom I worked, and it was just one week ago that I left.  I suddenly felt really out of it and nauseous, and struggled to tell my friend I needed to get off the phone.  I could not remember her name, to tell her this (and I&#39;ve known her for 40 years)!   The next few hours are a total fog.  I know I was having dreams of a sort, but I was not asleep.  There are maybe 2 hours that I can?t account for. It is most troubling to me that I can?t account for this time, but I know something was happening with my brain and while I was having these dreams or hallucinations, I was not asleep. I remember having to think really hard about what my son-in-law?s name was ? note that I live with this person.  I did not seek medical care, but feel like this information could be related to the Covid vaccine, and may be important to you.  It was my night to cook, and I had a really hard time keeping up.  I did manage to pull most of a meal together, but right before I was done, I needed to call my daughter to finish it.  I was unable to eat anything myself, and only wanted a drink.  I felt really nauseous and unsteady, although my thinking was a bit more clear by this time.  I?m not sure when the numbness in my toes and fingers on one side of my body (right side) started, but as of this afternoon, both are still numb and weak.  It is 1:00pm and I am still having trouble remembering some things, and that few hours of the afternoon from yesterday are completely lost to me.  I have like a shadow hanging above one eye. I am seriously thinking I have had some sort of a neurological event.  As of 3:00 today, my right hand and right foot are still numb, although my thinking seems to be clear.

Woke up so got up to take evening meds and brush teeth. Had vertigo and moderate nausea. While brushing teeth, I fainted. Came around quickly - was on bathroom floor. Took only one of my medications - the one to prevent migraines and went back to bed. Continued with body aches and chills on and off through the night. In the morning I had worsened vertigo and nausea, but this is typical of my vestibular migraines and I think that was what was going on. I called in sick to work, took one of my  pills for treating migraines and basically slept all day. I do not get migraines often - usually

Immediately felt a little lightheaded during the 15 min window afterward but was able to ambulate independently with walker just afterward.  After taking a nap, she woke with a headache, chills, a little shaky and feeling very tired.  She was able to eat and take Tylenol at the time.  For the rest of the day, she felt under the weather.  The next morning she was very weak, unable to ambulate and tachycardic prompting nursing staff to send her to the hospital for assessment.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

I took 2 tylenol and took a 3 hour nap.  When I woke I had several questions about events of the day that I did not recall.  Plus my daughter was with me and kept asking me if I was ok during prior to nap time.

                                                evening of 2/25 started to have some chills but no chills when I woke up the next day.  on 2/26 in the evening there was an increase in joint pain.  I took 400mg ibuprofen at bed time.  During the night I woke up due to the pain and noticed that I had been sweating.   I took 400mg around 3am and went back to sleep.  Woke at 6AM on the2/27and still had joint pain but not as painful as the night before.  Couple hours later while taking a shower I noticed that my left arm at the site of the vaccine had a large red blotch.  It  did not itch or was painful but it was somewhat warm.  At that point I called my primary drs office and was advised to go to urgent care.  At Urgent care my arm was examined by a doctor and he ordered a Covid test and prescribed doxycycline as he felt I had cellulitis.

Immediately after ingesting the cookies, I developed irritated throat, felt as if my throat was burning, developed coughing, throat felt funny. This lasted for the entire day. Throat looked inflamed for 2 days. This was after my first dose, so I am praying it was a reaction to the cookies and not the vaccine.

I was ok the next morning, I thought I was going to be alright, then Saturday my temperature went up to 104.6 and I could not get it to go down. was taking Tylenol every 4 hours and it would not go down.  I was shaking so bad. I was trying to do my chores and I could not physically do anything. I could hardly walk, I could not even go get some water. I felt disoriented. It was my own house that I lived for 24 years and I felt disoriented. I could not remember where the kitchen was. It lasted until about 8PM Sunday evening. Then I started feeling like a human again. I was able to walk to the bathroom by myself. My husband made me a bowl of soup that was the first time I ate since Friday. By that time I was coherent, was able to take a shower and around 10PM I went to bed and slept until 8AM Monday morning, I woke up like nothing had happened.

                                                I was given my first Moderna vaccination at Pharmacy on February 26, 2021.  I noticed at the time that the needle was open and not covered but didn&#39;t think anything about it.  Later that evening my arm was sore.  Knew that was to be expected.  Within 2 days my upper arm was beet red and swollen beyond recognition.  Finally after 10 days of pain I went to Urgent Care in and saw a doctor there.  My arm was indeed infected.  Doctor gave me prescription for Amoxicillin &amp; Clavulanate Potassium 875 mg.  Take one twice a day.  Was also given Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment USP 0.1% to put thin layer on arm twice a day.  Today is Monday March 8th and the redness, swelling and infection has moved down to my elbow and as far as pain is concerned it&#39;s a 5 out of 10.  It&#39;s starting to affect my fingers too.  Elbow area is now red and very swollen and HOT!  I&#39;m going to try to get into my regular doctor today to see if she can help me.  I can&#39;t sleep it hurts so bad.

On the same day, I began to have difficulty with my vision , especially in the left eye, a headache and all my joints began to ache. I was also very tired. The symptoms progressively got worse  over the following two weeks and included a couple of episodes of heart rhythm irregularities . During the third week, the headache, eye issues and joint pain began to resolve but the tinnitus is debilitating and prevents me from mentally focusing or sleeping.

These symptoms went on for 2 weeks, until I had to do my routine lithium level on 3/18/21.  I was toxic at 1.7.  Have been on lithium 40 years and have never been toxic.  My doctor sent me to ER, where they gave me fluids and potassium.  When checked in ER, my BP was 214/87.  I never have high BP - 120/80 is normal.  On discharge, my BP was 194/79.  Saw my doctor ASAP on advice of ER.  My doctor put me on amlodipine for BP which I started today.  He said I had essential hypertension and heart rate is irregular.

The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID-19 and concomitant medication included Vitamin B12.  On 24-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011A21A) intramuscularly on left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 25-FEB-2021, one day after receiving mRNA-1273, patient started to experience sore arm.  On 26-FEB-2021 patient had severe severe ice pick headache, it felt like the biggest wasp in the world stung her head. She states that it was so painful, and it scarred her. Patient claims she searched it up and it was the cranial 7 nerve from her temple to the back of her head that was on fire which lasted for 5 minutes.  The next day 27-FEB-2021 patient states the headache was gone however the nerve still throbbed a little and she was afraid to go to sleep that night. She then woke up that same night with severe ice pick headaches that were slamming into her head.  On 28-FEB-2021 the patient took protective measures and got up early and did not experience anything on that day. On 1-MAR-2021, she accidentally touched her husband&#39;s forehead with her head lightly and had the most severe ice pick headache (like hot lava running through that nerve for 20 minutes). It alleviated when she took two Advil&#39;s.  The next morning 2-MAR-2021 the patient nerves felt like little electricity lines zapping through constantly. Patient had looked up Bell&#39;s Palsy within our clinical trials and when she went to the doctors on 3-MAR-2021, they said the wrinkles in the right eye was very smooth compared to the left but her eyes were not drooping), doctors believed it to be Bell&#39;s palsy and prescribed her Gabapentin, and Zovirax.  Since then her ice picks have left but there is still nerve pain. She feels like the cranial 7 nerves are still on fire. All her headaches happened in bed while laying down. Patient states that the headaches feel dangerous and feel like they will cause her permanent damage. Patient still feels pressure in her brain and is scared there may be swelling in her brain.  Treatment medications included Advil, Gabapentin, and Zovarax.  Seriousness criteria included medically significant events.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.    Outcome of the event sore arm, severe ice pick headache, felt like the biggest wasp in the world stung her head,  nerve pain, afraid to go to sleep, most severe ice pick headache/headaches happened in bed while laying down/headaches feel dangerous, patient nerves felt like little electricity lines zapping through constantly/still feels like cranial 7 nerves are on fire were considered recovered but bell&#39;s palsy, wrinkles in right eye was very smooth, patient feels pressure in her brain/scared there may be swelling in her brain and heart muscle is a little sore were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Headache is consistent with the known safety profile of he vaccine.

                                                I received the vaccine yesterday 1/6/21.  Today, 1/7/21, I went for my walk this morning and felt off balance/swayed to the right a bit at one point. I don&#39;t think lightheadedness precipitated this, but it unnerved me.  I steadied myself and finished the walk without a problem. I checked and surface/pavement was uneven. My temp is 97.5 and I feel fine now but am just a little nervous that is a possible reaction to the vaccine. I had a reaction to the second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine 10 yrs ago, I fainted in early morning hours after getting up to go to bathroom.  I had received the second dose at about 11:30a the day before, and developed flu like symptoms by afternoon with a fever and ended up dehydrated which I think contributed to my fainting at about 3a when I got up to void.  I had a concussion and was treated with IV fluids at the local ED.

                                                Patient appeared nervous upon receiving vaccine. Patient reported trouble swallowing ( has a history of radiation therapy on throat). When asked if breathing was restricted, patient was able to take long breaths with minimal additional effort. Shortly after, patient appeared to be close to passing out (not completely awake and alert), eyes dilated. The pharmacist who administered the vaccine then administered one dose of the epinephrine (Epi-pen LOT:0FM353/eEXP:NOC 21) while the staff member kept the patient stable in her chair. The facility was instructed to call 911. At 11:49 AM (7 minutes later), symptoms began to improve and the patient became more alert. EMS arrived around 12:00PM to take patient to hospital--patient refused and was back walking around the facility 5 minutes later. No further issues were reported with this patient (pharmacist administering the vaccine left the facility around 1:15PM)

Started getting sick to her stomach all evening, started throwing up last night beginning at 11:00 PM, throwing up bile.  Today having fever of 101, didn&#39;t take anything for it, but down to 100 now.  Took 2 Tums and had such achy joints and sat down in a chair and could not get up from the chair.  Took some Tylenol and that helped, but freezing cold.  Didn&#39;t sleep all night.  Has not notified her doctor of the symptoms, just calling us.

                                                When my fingers touched something cold they would feel weird and lose their color. The first time (1/21) was minor (one finger) and the second time was (1/23) and all the tips of my fingers of my right hand turned colorless when I touched something cold. 1/24 my toes tingled when I walked and happens when I go for a walk. The finger symptom seems to be diminishing. I have never had either of these things happen before I had the Moderna vaccine. My doctor told me not to have the second dose which is due on 1/30/2021.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after injection, felt an unusual sensation up my right arm, neck, into left ear. While driving home my face became warm, after arriving home face/cheeks extremely red/flushed.  Have a picture taken at 3:54 for documentation. Not sure if from anxiety, but felt jaw tightness and a thick tongue.  No itching, swallowing problems etc.   lasted approximately 15 minutes. By 4:57 pm redness had faded.   Picture documentation. 9:15 pm had right ear pain and mild reddened of right cheek.   Picture documentation.

It itched during the night and upon rubbing it, I felt a lump. The morning of 1/29, arm was red, rash, hot, itch, lump, and this is approximately 2-3&#39; below the injection site - interestingly around my small pox vaccination scar. By mid-afternoon, all symptoms were worse and I did not feel &#34;right&#34; and felt lethargic. I contacted by phone my PCP office and sent pictures. They said &#34;delayed inflammatory response&#34; to injection. I took Aleve and Benadryl at bedtime and it is better today but certainly not gone.   ** I did not receive the V-Safe text yesterday to report this. **

I was very cold--freezing hands and feet. Could not get warm. Then headache started. Migraine intensity no matter what position I assumed. My joints began to hurt, every joint --knees, elbows, back, even fingers-- so it was difficult walking or moving. Even my teeth hurt where I had had dental work the precious day.   All I could do safely was lie in bed with many pillows to hold my head up. I was also nauseous, and a bad case of post nasal drip developed. I could not  rest properly all night--I took one baby tylenol  every four hours (my usual dose) but it did not help.  Finally at 8:00 AM the fever began to subside slowly till to 98.7 and the head ached/ joint pains are  slowly dissolving while I am writing this. I normally don&#39;t run fever and the last time I had the flue was 40 years ago! I have never been this sick in my life.

About 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt nauseated but finally managed to sleep.  The next afternoon on February 23 I became very ill with vomiting and diarrhea all at the same time.  I nearly passed out several times.  First responders arrived and found my blood pressure to be about 70/30.  Got in ambulance and given fluids.  Arrived at hospital around 5:15 pm.  Got more fluids and numerous blood tests, none of which were very remarkable.  My WBC was 17 but nothing else was wrong.  Left hospital at 9:00.  Physician assumes Covid vaccine cause these side effects.

                                                In addition to recognized side effects, approximately 24 hours after injection, I experienced sudden-onset severe pain in my right shoulder that traveled through my biceps and into my elbow. On a scale of 1-10, I?d rate the severity as a 10. This lasted approximately 15 minutes.   Over the ensuing 5 days I had noticeable but tolerable intermittent right arm pain. Then beginning on the 10th day following injection, I experienced sudden and severe right shoulder pain that traveled down my biceps into my elbow again. I&#39;d rate the pain at a 9 on the same scale. This time however, the pain started around 11 pm and did not subside. I tried sleeping but couldn?t. I got up and spent the rest of the night holding my arm to immobilize it, however that did nothing to stop the pain. It was about 5 am when I finally took 50 mg diclofenac and in about 2 hours the pain subsided to a tolerable 4 on the same pain scale.   As the day wore on, the pain increased again to a level 9 without medication so I continued with 50 mg diclofenac every 8 hours over the following 4 days and knocked it back to a level 3. This pain has occurred in my right shoulder, biceps, elbow, forearm and even my fingers and intensifies toward evening. I have been able to tolerate the pain without medication at about a level 3 for the past 2 days. However, I take a 50 mg tab of diclofenac an hour or 2 before bed as the pain intensifies toward evening. This has allowed me to sleep through the night.   In addition to the arm pain I developed muscle weakness in my right biceps about 3 days ago and am unable to lift my right arm above my head. The pain is not what prevents the movement. It?s as though my arm is not receiving the nerve impulse to move. Taking all of this together, I?d say that immunization appears to have triggered Parsonage Turner Syndrome. As I understand this immune-mediated syndrome, several events can trigger it, including immunization. I experienced this phenomenon one other time, approximately 2 years ago but did not correlate it to a vaccination at the time. This time it?s too apparent. I wonder how many other reports you?ve received that are like this and whether the vaccines will trigger the same reactions. I also wonder now whether I should receive a Moderna ?booster? if needed in the near to long term. I have no interest in going through this event a

I woke up ~8:30 am and got up to take my shower. While brushing my teeth, I felt like I was going to faint. I made it back to my bed (~10 feet away) just in time, threw myself on the bed and stayed there ~ 4 more hours. I drank water often during that time (that my husband brought the water to me.

                                                RN was staffing a Covid clinic at HS. One of our other nurses gave her the 1st Moderna vaccine at 1:45 PM on 2/12/21. At 1:55 PM, the nurse who had given her shot noticed that patient was pale, and said she was not feeling well. Her BP was 179/110, and she said she usually has low BP. She c/o of &#34;feeling hot and was having difficulty breathing.&#34; She was seen by our medical director. After 30 minutes, her BP was 120/82. She said she ?felt a little better and called her sister to pick her up.? Later that evening, patient texted me saying I didn?t feel well when I got home, had trouble focusing literally and had a crying jag and felt shaky on the inside. I kept hydrating, took 25 of Benadryl and slept for 2 hrs., now feel close to normal. It was definitely a reaction to the shot-just weird!? Patient texted me on 2/13/21 that ?the FDA thinks one vaccine may be enough for 80?90% effectiveness, so I might not get the 2nd dose? On 2/15/21 patient texted, ?My PCP thinks what I had was a side effect &amp; recommends taking Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Tylenol before the 2nd injection, and doesn?t seem to be worried about it!?   On 2/19/21, I received a text from patient at 5:28 AM as she was scheduled to staff a Covid clinic that day, beginning at 7:30 AM. She said, ?I have been up for a couple hrs w/severe eye pain and can?t hardly open my eye but it hurts to close it too! At 10:37 AM she texted, ?I just got home from eye doctor and was prescribed drops 4X/day. Apparently, there are pin holes in my sclera &amp; cornea which hurt so bad I had lavender cold pack on all day &amp; couldn?t stand the light. It is a corneal abrasion &amp; I have no idea why that would happen suddenly?. The following day, she texted me a picture of her L arm injection site which she said was ?very itchy and hot! Not painful-? It was about 6 inches in diameter, red, inflamed,  delayed cutaneous rx.

About 40 minutes later I had severe pain in my neck, back, and shoulders. I have had 3 herniated discs in the past and the pain from this was much worse than that pain.  About the same time I felt a headache coming on that just got worse as the night went on. I decided to go to bed and try to sleep, however, the pain was so great that I could not lay down flat or sit up. I spent the night walking the floor. During the night I vomited several times. I also developed jaw pain, earaches, and a sore throat.  But the worse part was that during the night I started to feel the sensation of pins and needles being thrust into my legs, ankles, arms, and hands. I never did however have a fever. I finally was able to fall asleep at about 5AM and slept for several hours. When I woke up the pain was mostly gone and I was just left with no energy at all so that I could hardly lift my head off the pillow. I stayed in bed the entire day and the next day I was fine.

                                                Same night vaccination received pain to lower back, waist level, both sides and also to both hips. unable to sleep or get comfortable to return to sleep. Pain persisted to lower back and both hips for several days. Took Ibuprofen 600mg 3 times a day but did not last during the night. Pain would wake me up. After several days pain moved to just left hip and radiated down the back of my leg to the knee the radiated to lateral calf. On Monday 3/1/21 went to my PCP because the pain was not improving and at night it woke me and I was awake for several hours. Walking didnot increase the pain but sitting would. My PCP felt it was related to my Covid Vaccination. She changed my NSAID to voltarin 2 times a day,  because the ibuprofen was not long lasting and she started a muscle relaxer for night time, Tizanidine 4mg. I don&#39;t feel the voltarin is as effective as the ibuprofen as the ibuprofen resolved the pain but for only 4-5 hrs. I will stop tthe voltarin and return to the ibuprofen. Muscle relaxer is helpful.

                                                Pt reported the day after her vaccine, 3-2, she was delirious and did not remember that day. She went to bed and slept most of the day. On 3-3 she woke up with a red rash on her trunk and extremities. The rash did not itch and was not painful. She took Benadryl and on 3-4 the rash was fading.  Spoke with husband to get more info on 3-2 since patient did not remember. Husband stated that patient woke up slurring words, not completing sentences and repeating herself. Husband put patient back to bed and she continued to sleep for most of the day. Husband called PCP and they recommended her to go to the hospital but they did not. Husband states on 3-3 patient was back to normal except for the rash. Husband also stated that the patient has had this happen before, the slurring of the words, and confusion. They did not call and report to the neurologist. Recommended to call and go over this reaction with the neurologist and get the ok for the second dose and will need to provide a letter.

My arm is weak and cannot raise, lift or rotate it above the elbow.  Very difficult to maintain sleep with a throbbing arm. I have been taking Alleve and it helps but the pain is still there just milder. Muscles are not sore but something is aching deep in bone/joints. I went to the Kinesiologist who told me the rotor cuff is the issue. He did an pressure point &#34;adjustment&#34; and the pain subsided for a day or two and now I&#39;m back to being in pain during any level of movement again.  I believe that my injection was given too high in my shoulder and caused SIRVA. I even took a picture of where the injection site was given.  If needed I can provide it to you.

My husband tested positive on the 3rd and my job advised me to test again on the 5th and I was positive. Around the 10th, until 2 or 3 days ago, I&#39;ve had SOB with exhaustion and brain fog. Three days ago, I had a tele appt with  and received antibiotics. I now have sinus infection, secondary to COVID.

I felt like I was getting a bad case of the flu. I was very lethargic. The site itself was inflamed and warm. I couldn&#39;t function, so I went to bed and let my boss know I was having some sort of reaction. From that point I wasn&#39;t well. I eventually tested positive for COVID and now I have a sinus infection. The swelling at the site started to go down about 5 days later and my symptoms we residing as well for my arm itself. I still had body aches, fever, cough, brain fog, respiratory and sinus issues. I also had intermittent mild nausea.  Symptoms were alleviated  about a week ago.  I still have symptoms, but they are residual. I was on antibiotics prescribed by Dr. via Telemed.

I felt very anxious which is not typical for me, I have had several other vaccines with no reaction in past. I had left the facility following 15 minutes of monitoring and took off my mask in the car. I looked in mirror because my face felt so warm. My husband was with me and symptoms did not worsen so we went home which only took 10 minutes and after another 30 minutes it did not subside so I took a low dose of liquid Benadryl. This eventually relieved my symptoms. I took another low dose at bedtime also. I slept through the night and had no further problem the next day. Thus  I did not contact a physician or the facility.

                                                16 hours after the injection, I was awakened with needing to vomit.  I had only clear liquid which I coughed out.  I was having difficulty catching my breath and unable to burp or clear the liquid.  After three tries, I was able to clear the airway and was able to breathe well.  I also checked my blood pressure which was 163/83.  I had phlegm in my throat and could clear it with drinking water.  After approximately 40 minutes of checking and rechecking my blood pressure and drinking water, I was able to sleep until 9:00 am.  It is now 24 hours from the injection and I feel much better.

Could not belch or fart wind out of stomach.  Drinking or eating caused pain.

The area is below the injection site.  Otherwise, feel kind of low flu-ish. Felt fine first week.  Then on day 7 rash and feeling off.  Maybe an immune response.

That subsided, then I had persistent itching at the injection site.  That subsided but now have large, hard red patch the size of a tangerine at the injection sight that is slightly itchy and tender.  Have been experiencing slight nausea on and off, mostly in the mornings. Six days after injection I was feeling light-headed, dizzy and like I was just going to faint or fade away.  Still have those symptoms on and off, but they are not as strong.

                                                Headache for 3 days, cognitive problems that lasted for 2.5 weeks.  I would frequently drop items held in my hands, had difficulty typing on a keyboard, had problems with tasks such as sewing , doing crossword puzzles and remembering things. For example, for many years I would do the  crossword puzzle in ink and be able to complete it.  During this time, I could only finish about 1/3 of the puzzle and then give up in frustration.  Another example: I have been using a Nutribullet to grind coffee beans once a week for years.  I had trouble assembling it for use.  I tried to screw on the top having it face the wrong side.  I could tell this was not correct but it took a minute to figure it out. I did not seek treatment since these things seemed subtle and I did not think clearly enough to think of that option! The symptoms have slowly resolved over a 2.5 week period.  I will not get the 2nd dose because of this reaction.

I couldn&#39;t eat or drink anything...kept coming back up and out... really awful. When I had Covid-19 back in March although I had a fever for 10 days, I had none of these symptoms... I just lost my sense of taste and smell for 7 months.

My normal temperature on that thermometer is 97.6 degrees.   That night, I kept waking up every two hours or so and was very uncomfortable.  THe next day I felt very lethargic -- unable to do anything other than make myself something to eat.  I took two naps, one in the morning, and the other in the afternoon (that was about two hours).  I felt slightly better by around 8 p.m.  That night I slept somewhat better and felt myself break into a sweat during the night -- so I guess that is when the fever broke.  The next day (today) my temperature was back to normal and I feel okay.  Throughout the now three days, the arm where I got the shot was painful, but gets less so each day.

We gave her a bottle of water to drink and crackers and she said she felt better. The tongue tingling went away as well before the 30 minutes ended. Her blood pressure was retaken before she left and it remained in the 140s/100s. She said this is higher than her normal but it could be due to anxiety.

                                                Sent: 3/4/2021   7:55 AM Subject: Non-Urgent Medical Question                    For a full week now, I have been battling diarrhea and a very hyperactive stomach and intestines. Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

Flushing disappeared, lump in throat 98% better. Refused further treatment and drove home,  Was OK thereafter.

I went to bed and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It was like my brain was going crazy, it wasn&#39;t like an anxious feeling. I finally feel asleep around 4am and kept waking up remembering fragments of valid dreams. The dreams were fragment with such dread and anxiety in them.  It was like a huge wave of depression and anxiety. By about 9am I was fully awake, but my body hurt, my muscles ached I felt fatigued. The chills and headaches were through. I was still having weird racing thoughts. About 10pm it all went away and I slept fine and woke up the next morning and I was fine. My arm is still sore at the injection site but all the other symptoms went away.    Saturday morning I was talking with a friend on the phone, and she reminded me of the folder I received the folder. I completely forgot about this folder. I found this folder later that day and then I tried to access VSAFE. It made me realize how disorientated I was.

Started with severe chills, body shaking, achy all over, head felt like it was going to implode, started to sweat and felt flushed.  Woke up my spouse to get me something to take for headache, etc.  Later that morning could hard lift the Arm, felt a golf ball size lump at injection site and warm to the touch. Was in bed 2 days bcuz it exacerbated my MS.  After that the injection site started itching, with redness.  Lump finally getting smaller.  I took a photo of the injection site which has a red circle the size of my hand.

                                                Evening of shot, sore arm and extreme fatigue.  Following day, tired with ?brain fog?.  Third day, brain fog worsens, depression begins. Fourth day, confusion, withdrawal from interacting with others, worsening depression.  Subsequent days, increasing confusion and severe memory problems. Becoming alarmed at inability to respond and ?find words?.  By weekend, (5 days after shot) suicidal ideation, stopped talking to people (I live alone, but would regularly speak to neighbors and family prior to this episode).  This rather alarming condition finally began to lift about 2days ago.    I have a decades-long history of depression and have taken medication for it on and off since my 30?s. I must say I have concerns about getting a second shot next month because of the major depression as well as memory problems. ( I have been experiencing memory challenges for the last few years, and my Mom died of Alzheimer?s.)

                                                I had the expected very mild soreness at the injection site for several days.  The headaches came on the night after the vaccine and have continued.  Every night I get a headache with onset sometime between 1 a.m and 4:00 a.m. , making it difficult to sleep.  The headache lasted all day on the 25th and 26th, but since then usually clears with morning coffee.  Last night the headache started at 1:00 a.m. (earliest yet) and at 2:00 I took a Motrin and .125 g. Alprazolam and slept okay the rest of the night.  Is this an interplay with my immunosuppression?  I will eliminate the sleep time tea, but I honestly can?t fathom that would be a cause.  Thank you for taking note of this and for responding if you can.

                                                Dizzy,lightheadedness within minutes. Was told I could stay longer if needed but all they had was the same epipen that I had. Was taken home by daughter. Lightheadedness continued and some trouble focusing continued and desire to fall asleep. Took my bp ,it was 85/61.pulse 109.I hydrated with 3 bottles of water and ate olives to increase sodium level. an hour later bp was up to 107/67,pulse 67. I continued to monitor my bp through the next 24 hrs. I skipped my blood pressure meds  for that night and continued with them the next day when my pressure was back to normal range. I did not use my epipen.  Would have gone to ER if I was unable to control my hypotension. I am an RN.

The next day injection site began to swell. By the 8th day post injection it was hard to the touch, about the size of a large marshmallow and hard to the touch. No skin discoloration,  but felt warm to touch and very itchy. Used Lanacanevto stop the itch.  Today the 11th, most of swelling is gone and just a little tender to touch. Did not contact anyone medical about this, but a friend said i should report it.

                                                The injection was painless and I was very happy to finally be able to receive this vaccine.  Evening on the first day began to feel slightly feverish 99.2, body aches, fatigue,  slight ache in my arm at injection site.  This continued into the next day and nights.  No problems at all in days 3 through 6.  In the evening of the 7th days began with fatigue, body aches, fever 99.4, chills.  Did not sleep well that night due to body aches and chills and woke the next morning - day 8 with very red, sore arm just below the injection site that started out in a circle and expanded to about 2&#34; x 3&#34; area.

                                                36 hours later, (approximately), I woke up with a rash. Under the both arms it looked like a sunburn. Across the chest an sides, it was spotty. The right side had more rash than the right, and both sides wrapped around to the back, about 2 inches, on both sides. Less going down the rest of the torso. Took Benadryl, 2-25 mg, 4 hours apart, for a total of 100 mg. 1:00PM, Feb. 26, rash faded significantly.  Also had a dry mouth and a bit of a racing heart, right after being given the vaccination &amp; again when the rashes appeared. However, this could have been anxiety. Both times it went away after walking &amp; deep breathing. Lasted for about 15 minutes each time.

                                                Began not feeling well about 8 hours after my shot. That night I developed a fever (under 100 degrees) and chills. Had some heart palpitations. Next day I still had a slight fever, general malaise, soreness from shot in arm, a few occurances of heart palpitations, sore back. On third day, no fever, but still felt under the weather, with a sore arm plus some hardness in the injection area. Had some palpitations that evening. By the 4th day, felt better in general, but began feeling a very slight numbness on lips and surrounding facial area. Arm still sore with hardness. Better on 5th day. Day 8 &amp; 9 had pains in lower shins. Day 9 I noticed tiny small bumps on upper front and back shoulders and upper arms. They were not hive like and some were itchy. Took some Benadryl that night which didn&#39;t reallly help. Days 10-12 - still have tiny bumps some slightly pink, mostly skin tone, spreading to neck area. Saw my internist on 2/25/21 Day 14 to ask if symptoms related to vaccine shot. He didn&#39;t think the rash was related because it didn&#39;t start away after shot. The continuing ever so slight numbness in lips and surrounding area may be just from anxiety, he said. 3/1/21 - still have occasional slight numbness off and on of lips with &#34;grainy&#34; rash still present.

                                                The second Moderna intramuscular injection  felt different from the first injection.  This one hurt when injected.  About 3:15p.m. that same day, I noticed the arm started hurting.  It later became very painful and I had lost strength in the arm and I could not lift my arm.  This was alarming to me and I thought there may have been nerve damage.  The fatigue, fever and headache came the next day and the arm was painful and unusable.  At 2:30pm  on Saturday, Feb. 27th, I took 3 Aleve to relieve the pain in my arm.  I had hoped to not take anything after getting the vaccine, but I could not stand the pain any longer.  I researched online and read about SIRVA.  I thought that was  responsible for the pain.  The Aleve helped.  By Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021, the pain had abated and I could use my arm.  My fever, fatigue and headache had gone too.  My intention in submitting this is to request that more explicit reactions be listed so that someone like me, living alone, would know that this is a possible reaction and to let it run its course.  This caused me undue stress, on top of feeling lousy and being in a great deal of pain, not the mention my fear of never being able to use that arm again.  That may sound like an overreaction, but until you have had a  limb rendered useless, no matter how hard you try to move it, it is frightening.  I would appreciate any feedback on my experience and I would like to know if others have experieinced this too.  Thank you.

                                                I did not feel ok starting Wednesday , symptoms increased daily with Saturday being the worst.  Tired, feeling warm Friday and Saturday, exhaustion increasing Wednesday until Saturday, the worst day being Saturday, and headaches.  I felt more flu  like symptoms on Wednesday and Thursday and not so noticable on Friday and Saturday.  About 8/9 pm on Saturday I felt fine, like you snapped your fingers and all the side effects were gone.

She experienced this pain the same night of receiving her vaccine, and it disrupted her sleep. She also complained of difficulty breathing up on inhalation, saying that it hurts to inhale.

What surprised me is that the site (about 9 cm round) became very red and very itchy a full week later (01/05/2021) and is still pink and itchy now.  This is not at all serious, and Benadryl cream reduces the itching.  I am reporting it only because it is not listed as a side effect on the documentation or CDC website.

                                                I felt fine until the morning of Jan. 10 (except for very painful arm).  I was awakened early in the morning by severe vertigo (my eyes were blinking rapidly and the room was spinning violently); I was nauseous and couldn&#39;t lie down without the violent spinning re-occurring.  I was very dizzy and exhausted the whole day, unable to function.  The next day I continued to be very dizzy and off-balance, couldn&#39;t work but better than prior day.  Each day, same symptoms have continued but milder.  I called my PCP on Monday, Jan 11.  He told me it sounded like an inner ear problem, probably unrelated to the vaccine and to call him the next day and report my symptoms.  I did (Tues. Jan 12) and reported dizziness was milder but still there.  He suggested I see an ENT doctor.

                                                Symptoms started on Saturday morning (1/16/2021)  following the shot having been administered the previous day (1/15/2021) at 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon.  Initially, I had a slight, constant  headache and &#34;medium&#34; fatigue.  I dismissed it as not important because it was relatively minor. and I am generally fatigued at the end of a work week.  The headache lasted all day but was fairly low level. I did not sleep well that night but was able to function during the next day (1/17/2021)  without a problem.  I don&#39;t remember if the headache was present that day.  However, on Sunday evening (1/17/2021) (around 6:00 p.m. or so) chills started to go up and down my body and my hands were very cold.  I had no fever.  I added more garments to keep warm and ignored or was distracted by my activities of the evening. Monday (1/18/2021) during the day the chills continued to go up and down my body  intermittently-- not really staying in one place -- but my hands remained very cold.  It should be stated that I prefer colder temperatures; i keep my house between 60-62 degrees in winter and I am able to stay comfortable with a shirt and sweater in that environment.  So, on Monday, the fact that I had chills was remarkable to me. The chills were intermittent. Tuesday (1/19/2021) I worked from home all day and had an electric heater going focused very closely on my body all day.  I was cold but don&#39;t remember having chills.  Tuesday evening the chills returned, along with a significant headache that circled my head (not focused in one spot), my body ached, my eyeballs ached; I had intestinal cramping .and I simply could not get warm due to the constant &#34;full-body&#34; chills. I went to bed with a heated mattress pad on,  flannel sheets, a comforter an d a thick wool  blanket. I could not get warm.  I was not able to sleep at all the entire night due mostly to the (major) physical discomfort and (minor) worry as to what was going on. I DID NOT have a fever. Around 8:30 on Wednesday morning, I was able to fall asleep as the chills had diminished and I was worn out. The body and eyeball aches were still present as was the intestinal cramping. Later that afternoon the symptoms started to diminish and I was able to sleep Wednesday night. I did not eat anything on Wednesday as I was not interested in food due to the discomfort of  the intestinal cramping. I was able to smell food and had not lost my sense of taste.  Thursday morning (1/21/2021,  I finally felt like I could eat and had  some food which tasted delicious to me.  I was able to get warm, had slight headache, cramping was mostly gone, ..I still had (reduced levels) body aches and eyeball aches.  I had no chills.  I was able to consume and tolerate reduced amounts of food.  Friday (1/22/2021) I was tired but able to function and felt as if I was returning to feeling like myself.  Today, Saturday(1/23/2021, I am feeling about 95% myself and relieved to have this behind me.  I am very concerned about how I might react to the second dose of the vaccine.  I am going to consult the local hospital and my PCP there to inquire about the advisability of getting the second dose.

I was fine all night and until two days later. I had the chills and a sore arm. When I awakened Saturday morning my arm was red and warm. I did not feel badly. I have had the redness and slight warmth each day. I went to the dr. on Monday. She thinks it is fine but ordered a low does steroid and oral cream. I decided to wait on the steroid for a few days as I am not feeling badly. My arm is still lightly red and slightly warm. I have no heart palpitations or other side affects. It is not blistery.

                                                After I waited the required 15 min. before I could leave, my husband and I went to our car and I started to feel lightheaded and dizzy. Figured this was normal so continued home. For the rest of the that day I felt lightheaded, dizzy and just wonky off and on the entire day. I later felt exhausted, like someone flipped a switch on me, around 3:00 pm and took a nap for 2 hours. After the nap I felt nauseous and like I was going to vomit. I ate dinner and later in the evening, I took some allergy medicine and felt a little better and went to bed.  The next day, Friday, I felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and again felt like I was going to vomit in the morning. I ate breakfast, felt nauseous, started cramping, had diarrhea and was then fine.  No more symptoms after that.  Although my arm is still tender today, Saturday.

                                                Woke up at 3 am with the worst chills I have ever experienced.  I can usually do deep breathing or relaxing to calm my chills, but these would not let up.  It felt like my body was being squeezed.  I was finally able to get up and used a walker to get to the kitchen and took 1000 mg acetaminophen.  Without the walker, which I don&#39;t usually use, I was afraid I would not be able to stand up or would stumble due to my shaking.  By 4 am, the shaking had stopped enough for me to lay back down and I was able to get to sleep.  I had a fever of 99.8 when I woke up.  Later that morning it was 100.8.  By that night it had gone down to 98.7 and the next morning it was my normal 97.6 and I feel great.

                                                After receiving the injection, I was directed by an RN to sit in a chair for 15min in the same room. Five minutes after the injection I felt my upper back  muscles, ribcage area, contract.  The contraction continued around to the front of my chest with next 3 minutes.  I felt tightness with each breath.  The RN who gave me the injection came to see if I felt alright. She informed the charge nurse that my chest felt tight and the charge nurse came to ask me questions.  The charge nurse called the hospital pharmacist to come to see me.  The pharmacist arrived with various medications and talked to me.  He instructed me to do breathing exercises and meditate.  I told him that I was familiar with these techniques and using them.  I also informed the pharmacist that I had a heart attack in 2018 and had atrial tachycardia but I wasn&#39;t feeling any problems with my heart, that it was beating normally.  I also informed the pharmacist of my severe allergies to certain items but I wasn&#39;t experiencing any anaphylaxis that I&#39;ve experienced in past allergic episodes.  The pharmacist left and told the charge nurse to keep me a half hour longer under observation and to call him if I felt worse.  During that half hour, the muscle contractions stopped and I was able to breathe normally.  The charge nurse asked me if I was ready to leave after the half hour was up, I told her I was feeling odd so she said to stay another 20min.   I began to experience intestinal cramping and asked to leave to go to the bathroom.  In the bathroom I had a bout of diarreah that lasted 10minutes.  After that I drove home but was experiencing a headache that started.   The headache lasted for 20hrs. It felt like I was wearing tight hat, squeezing.  Iv&#39;e not had that type of headache before.  My right arm site of injection feels a little warm and is pink but isn&#39;t painful.

                                                She woke me at about 4:15am and told me she was freezing, she was shivering in the bed even though she had a blanket on, so I went and got her another blanket and put some socks on her feet. She went back to sleep until about 6:30am when she woke up and said she felt like she was burning up, so I took 1 blanket and her socks off. I took her temperature at 6:45am and it was 100.2 degrees,  so I went to the store to buy her some Tylenol. I gave a cracker and a Tylenol with a glass of water. She went back to sleep until 9:45am, when she woke back up and I took her temperature, it was at 99.7 degrees, she ate another cracker and drank some water and some Diet Coke. She went back to sleep and at 11:35 she woke up and told me she was hungry so I made her some chicken noodle soup and 1/2 of a hotdog. Her temperature at that time was 98.6 degrees. Basically she was in bed the whole day and couldn?t do any of the things that she normally would do. She feels some what better today, no fever, but still has body aches and pains. Her arm is still bothering her and she has a rash at the injection site.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up at 2:15 a.m. feeling pains in my chest middle and extending through to my upper back.  The pain encompassed the span of my upper chest and back from one arm to the other.  I experienced very rapid heartbeats that I could feel throbbing from my head to my chest.  I was hesitant to move or rise from my bed because of the pain.  At 3:40 I called 911.  They did an EKG and I was told that my heart was fine.  My blood pressure was 180/90.  I chose not to go to the hospital but to call my doctor when his office opened up at 9:00 a.m. in approximately 5 hours.  My doctor had me come into his office.  I had another EKG which was fine and he sent me to have a Cat Scan. the same day which was also fine.  My doctor spoke to me and said that he felt that this was due to side effects of the vaccine.  I doubled up on my Acid Reflux medicine, taking 80 mg daily for  four days through Monday 2/22/2021.  I could not sleep well for three days after the vaccine experiencing pain in my chest and could not breathe deeply without feeling it.  Then I steadily improved and today I can take deep breaths with little pain.  I also experienced muscle pain in my left shoulder and neck but used Mineral Ice on my neck and was relieved in one day.

I went to bed early and when I woke up I had a fever of 101.5 accompanied by chills, body aches, nausea, fatigue, brain fog, and headache.  Over the course of two days, my temperature ranged from 101.5 to 103.  After two days my fever broke during the night.   I did not want to take fever reducing medication in case it interfered with the immune response, but I did take 1 dose each of Tylenol and Motrin over the course of the 2 days.  Still felt a bit sluggish on the 3rd day and continue to have brain fog 6 days later.

I could not sleep or lay down. I had to pack my upper arm with ice for 72 hours. I have had flu shots before and never had a painful reaction that brought tears to my eyes for 72 hours.   I don&#39;t know what size the needle was used on me, but it almost felt like it hit the bone. I am a thin person.  It probably did not hit the bone, but it felt like the fluid was forced into the muscle. My husband did not have this same reaction, so I don&#39;t know if it was the person who gave the shot, or wrong needle size or what made my arm hurt like it was hit with a hammer.  I now have slight itching at the shot site and there is a bump the size of a mosquito bite.

                                                With shot # 1.  Intense pain in the vaccinated arm, extending from hand to left, back shoulder blade starting a couple hours after the shot.  Unable to sleep. Day two, used ice pack to attempt to move the arm, which only wanted to stick next to the body and not move.  Attempts to use the arm were excruciating, so nothing worked on that level.  Continued icing throughout day 2.  End of day 2, took an Aleve and continued to ice the shoulder.  Day three, took an Aleve; no improvement in the morning, then saw some improvement throughout day three, but not to the point of being able to use the arm.  Total focus was on that arm.  Day 4, pain improved to being able to use the arm for small tasks.  Day 5, pain [but for injection sight] gone.  Shot #2.  Effects were entirely different but equally intense.

I checked my blood pressure &amp; it was 199/105,   10 minutes later 197/101. I went to ER arriving at 10 am.  Had EKG, blood work, chest xray, covid quick test.  All ok. BP stayed very high until 12:30 pm then started to go down.  After about an hour bp went back up to 188/99.  I was given a pill to lower pressure but it didn&#39;t  lower.  Finally given a dose of metroprolol &amp; pressure went down. Was released from ER at 3:45 pm.   Today, 3/1/2021 BP is still high,  166/87.   Went to cardiologist 3/1/2021, was told they were having these type issues lately.  No problem with EKG, blood work.  Gave me another BP pill to try for 2 weeks to try lower BP.

On February 14 woke up with My whole arm aching. About three days after that extreme pain in my upper arm. That did not go away with two versions of anti-inflammatory drugs. Was referred to an orthopedist for a possible shoulder injury. His diagnosis was cervical pinch nerve. He referred me to a neurologist. I am now on medication that has somewhat reduced the pain in my arm but it has not gone away completely. I had my second shot on March 3 and the next day the pain in my arm intensified I near the spot of the first injection. The second injection I took in my right arm. I am also experiencing today March by brain fog. My arm my right arm is sore much like a flu shot. Other than that I had no symptoms as mentioned in many publications after you get the second shot.

He assisted me in getting back into our home, gave me baby aspirin, asked me questions as to his middle name, of which I  just starred back at him. I can remember him asking me questions, and  I was wondering why my brain was not responding.   My gait  had already returned to normal as I could take the steps into our home with no problem.  My brain fog lasted approx 30-35 minutes. He did bring me to our local ER , where tests were negative but I did stay overnight.

In the morning I could not touch my wrist, move it without extreme pain. The pain level was a 10/10.  I made an appointment with a doctor but was not able to be seen until February 24.  I took advil, wrapped it in an ace bandage with no relief.  Around 4:00 pm on 1/27/21, I realized that the pain was gone.  I tried moving my wrist and was able to.  After that I had complete motility and no pain.  Is this related to the vaccine?  I&#39;ve never experienced this before.

I had no pain at the injection site and did not need any medication.  I ate dinner and went to bed at 10:30 pm.  I awoke at 1:30 am with pain in my mouth.  I had had a temporary bridge put in my upper right side of my mouth on Tuesday, 2/9/21.  I had had no pain from that dental procedure till 2/13/21 at 1:30 am.  I needed to take an Advil to relieve the pain.  After 20 minutes the pain was gone.  This pattern of waking at night with pain has continued since that night.  I called my dentist today and reported what was going on.  He told me to get in touch with the CDC and file a report.  He reported that he has heard of this pain occurring in other dental patients after having received the vaccine.

She felt tingly in her upper right arm and it felt like her equilibrium was off, and legs were heavy.  The patient was very fatigued.    Treatments of these events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, passing out, unsteadiness, slurring words, fell into a deep sleep, tingly feeling in her upper right arm, felt like equilibrium was off, legs felt heavy and fatigue, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71 year old female subject, with history of epilepsy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness after first dose of mRNA1273 (Lot# unknown).

I used my normal treatments of Peppermint and Frankincense essential oils throughout the rest of the afternoon and evening, but it did not work.  The pain only kept increasing and both areas became very inflamed.  By 10:00 p.m. I was unable to use my thumb to support a glass of water and soreness began to develop in the base of the finger next to the index finger.  I finally took an Aleve which began to relieve the severe pain within about an hour.  The severe flare up was better in the morning, but it has been a week and the discomfort is still there.  I bought Voltaren and hope this will get my joints back to normal, which is mild flare ups when the weather changes.

                                                The injection site itched a little from the beginning. It went away in four days, but then returned with a lot of itching a few days later. it got redder and bigger and the site also was warm to touch and swollen. I put ice packs on it to help with the itch, along with benedryl gel. it was difficult to sleep because of the itch. It is still getting bigger as of today. I did not go to the doctor. I followed what it said to do on the internet. The itch may be calming down some. I don&#39;t know if I should get the 2nd vaccine. Please let me know.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   When I went to bed the night of the vaccine, I noticed some soreness in my back muscles and left arm.  I took 2 500 mg tylenol at bedtime.  I woke up about 1:30 a.m.  Soreness in my back was so bad, it hurt to touch it or lay on it.  I also had chills to the point of shaking and added 2 extra blankets and took another 500 mg tylenol.  On Thursday, the day following the vaccine, I continued to have chills, had no appetite and had a headache. The soreness in my back lessened throughout the day and by 7:30 pm had almost disappeared.  I woke up at 1 and 2 am on March5 dripping wet(I assume from fever breaking).When I got up at 5am on the 5th, all adverse symptons were gone and I ate normally.

She no sooner said to wait 30 mins, I turned to look at clock and bam! everything hit at once.   I was told to go to ambulance on site. They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

                                                I felt fine at first and it lasted until I stared coughing Saturday (1/16), I thought it was just post-nasal drip. By Monday (1/18), I had a really bad sore throat, chills and a fever. I had a fever for 26 solid days. My lung capacity was 98-99% the entire time. On Wednesday (1/20), I contacted my doctor and he had me to come in to get tested for COVID. The next day, I got my results and they were positive. It got worse from there and I was admitted to the hospital due to my sodium being low. I was also losing a lot of weight. I was hospitalized for 3 days in order for them to get my sodium up. I also had burning and tingling on the sole of my feet, which they attributed to my lack of sodium. My symptoms lasted for weeks. I have a lot of congestion, but they can&#39;t seem to locate the source. I&#39;m also having issues with my BP, which just started to decrease on 3/21. I was also diagnosed as anemic, which I&#39;ve never had an issue with. I also have a hard time concentrating. I also have spine issues, so I&#39;m not sure if my knee pain is from that or the COVID.

I went and had breakfast and then i got the chills, then i started sitting up but i felt awful so i went back to bed and dizziness weakness headache, redness around injection site.  My whole left side felt like it was achy and almost like it was numb. I lost bladder control, I had a couple of accidents.  I stayed in bed until next day, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t eat. Got up Saturday, not feeling good, queasy, diarrhea but not as bad as Friday. Every time i would try to do something i would fall asleep. went and had covid test for surgery. Sunday I felt better but not to par. Today i feel the best so far.  Put antibiotic cream on injection site because it was itching, and it is still hard and warm to touch.  Today i have a small cough that I didn&#39;t have before.

Then 7 days after the vaccine, she experienced severe pruritis that actually woke her from sleep and had been scratching the area. It has now on day 8 become much more indurated and has grown in size, even during today.

I also had ringing in my ears. I felt like I was going to pass out. It scared me.  I put on my brakes and started to pull over but by the time I started to pull over, the dizziness was slowly starting to clear up.  I had a &#34;foggy&#34; feeling in my head for about a half hour after so I went to my friend&#39;s house and sat down and drank some water. Then I went home.  I have had no incidents since then.

Shortly after that , while driving, had nausea, &amp; muscle aches to legs &amp; arms.  Reaching family members home, could barely carry bags with each arm, due to pain in joints, and to muscles, getting worse.  Through the next 6 hrs. had moderate to severe pain to joints, &amp; muscles &amp; gradually severe fatigue. Took 1 Tylenol 650 mg for pain.   Also, checked temperature thru out this time, with only mild 99.5 temp.  Vaccine site gradually became swollen, with increased pain.  Was doing work on computer, but could not continue, so left for my home, &amp; went to bed, to sleep.  Lt.  Arm started becoming red, with severe soreness &amp; swelling by 1/28/21, 2 days after vaccine.  Vaccine was given very high on my arm, almost shoulder area.  All Symptoms continued for about 10 days, including  to vaccine arm, which continued with redness &amp; soreness for 2 weeks.   My physician was notified.   She advised NSAID before #2 dose, but I already take NSAID daily (Meloxicam), so don&#39;t think I can take another NSAID.  I have been taking Tylenol 650mg at least twice a day, for increased joint &amp; muscle pain, since vaccine.  My 2nd dose, originally scheduled for 2/23/21 has been rescheduled to 2/27/21 due to no vaccines available.

                                                I was perfectly fine after the vaccine, except for a sore arm. On day 3 I noticed my tongue starting to swell and lips tingling. It got a little worse and I felt it moving towards my throat, and then it stopped. This only lasted maybe a couple of hours, and not more than three hours. I had not eaten anything since the day before, so knew it was not food related. I didn?t associate this reaction to the vaccine until I searched online, and found that tongue swelling and facial paralysis could be common. I was also tired that day. On day 4 I had none of those symptoms but was very tired and did not feel myself; little energy, somewhat lethargic.

It got worse and worse to the point my whole body was shaking.  I felt nauseous and thought I might throw up from the pain (I didn&#39;t).  At 1:00 am I took a 5mg Oxycodone pill.  I got a little relieft at about 1:45 am.  The spasms started coming in waves.  At 3:15 am I took another dicyclomine and again used the heating pad.  At about 4:30 am, I was able to fall asleep.  This is absolutely the worst spasming I have ever had.

                                                RN administered injection incorrectly into the bursa, not IM. This resulted in extreme pain and inability to move arm. Began having muscle spasms in lower back using different muscle to reposition and for ADLs. Finally was able to see doctor 3-12-21. Given scripts for Tramadol and muscle relaxant. Had follow up appointment with Sports Medicine MD to receive a steroid injection in Left shoulder. Diagnosed with SIRVA (Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration) I now require Physical Therapy. I am unable to use my arm per MD and PT. I have difficulty dressing, cooking, routine housekeeping, etc. While I feel better since the injection, I am terrified the pain will return. I live alone and was unable to sleep, drive, dress, cook or do any ADLS including wash my hair or dress. The pain was completely debilitating. Even after the steroid injection, I have physical therapy and MD appointments, daily exercises and instructions to not use my arm.

                                                Minor soreness the day of the vaccine but have had continued are pain at the injection site and surrounding muscles for almost three weeks.  Saw my primary and she said it could be they gave it too high and irritated the shoulder joint.  She is concerned about &#34;frozen shoulder&#34;.  It wakes me in the night and no position lasts without pain after 30-45 seconds.  Take one extra strength Tylenol before bed and administer Sagely 250 mg. BD cream on upper arm and part of neck where pain exits.  Last night I drank 3 glasses of red wine so I could sleep a few hours and today I have had no pain!   little weakness and I&#39;m trying not to aggravate it, but hopefully the site pain is resolving.

                                                Patient arrived to observation room around 11am following vaccination with Moderna dose #1, no distress noted, sitting in back of room. Around 11:05am, patient was seen by observation RNs as putting head down into hands and started to wave for assistance. Per patient, she felt hot, light-headed and  faint. Patient&#39;s lower extremities were elevated on adjacent chair and 10LPM 02 administered via bag mask. Vital signs measured: p64, R22, BP120/76, 02:99%. Patient stated she felt mild &#34;scratchiness&#34; in her throat, which dissipated in less than 5 minutes. No presence or reports of angioedema, wheezing, shortness of breath, hypotension, rash/redness.  Benadryl was drawn up and prepared in case of need for administration, Epipen also nearby. After about 20 minutes of sitting with legs elevated and O2 flowing, client reports feeling better, no longer feeling &#34;scratchy&#34; throat. Patient states she was anxious to receive vaccine and thinks symptoms are due to anxiety. Patient&#39;s husband present and assisted patient to car around 11:30am. No further intervention needed.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

On 2/2/21:  symptoms included fatigue, chills, and fever and night sweats and increase in sleep time.  These symptoms also occurred on the day following the 2nd dose. As on the day following the 2nd dose,   I self medicated on the evening of 2/2 with one ibuprofen/acetaminophen (125mg/250mg) tablet .   No significant symptoms on waking on 2 / 3 / 21 other than mild fatigue.

                                                Patient reported she began to feel bad on her way home after receiving the vaccine (she had waited at the clinic for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine and felt fine at the clinic).  She reported she began to have a rapid heart rate (which went away that evening) and elevated blood pressure. She normally takes a BP med and took an extra 1/2 pill that evening. Her BP was up to 178/101 and came down to 124/78. She reports she is still not feeling well (but BP is within her normal range). She reports she will contact her PCP. I advised her to go to the urgent care and she wants to wait to see her PCP.  She agrees to go to urgent care or ER if condition worsens.

In early a.m. hours, felt dizzy, feeling of sick stomach, and fainted in the bathroom.  Paramedics were called by my spouse and they worked with me, then was transported by  Ambulance to emergency room where they ran tests and released me the same day.  I was told by the doctor that apparently my blood pressure decreased too fast causing me to faint.

                                                I am not 100% certain of this event being related to the vaccination with the Moderna COVID19 shot or not.  However, in the interest of completeness and for investigative purposes, I am reporting to you the event in relation to the vaccination as the patient reported to me.  She received the vaccination on 2/14/2021 and became very confused.  She had significant left arm swelling much worse than when she had her first vaccination.  Her husband brought her to the emergency room and she was eventually discharged, but she went on to develop significant hypertension and she reported that her blood pressures were normal prior to the vaccination.  She had an emergency room visit in which her systolic pressures were well above 240.  She revisited the emergency room and had elevated blood pressures of 240 and was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy and later found to have posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or PRES.  We have started the patient on medications, and started laboratory work-up for secondary hypertension and her blood pressures have improved with treatment.  We discussed the case with the neurologist, who suggested that we repeat MRI scan to make sure that her punctate lesions noted on MRI on this admission on 2/25/2021, have resolved.  It was advised that if they had not resolved that we should call neurology again.  Hypertensive encephalopathy is rare and press syndrome as a result is also rare.  It is for this reason that I am reporting this event as again, I am not trying to mislead anyone or distort information, but should this be an adverse effect of the vaccine I wanted to make sure that this was reported as the patient&#39;s history prior to the vaccination and developing this complication post vaccination are temporally related at a minimum.  The patient is a known smoker but quit on the 14th of this month.

                                                Injection hurt going in and pulling out. Soreness excruciating at 10:30 pm. Couldn?t sleep. Felt really tired starting at 10:30   At 8am had 100.7 fever. Felt weak, fluey and lightheaded. Legs wobbly when getting out of bed. Stayed in bed til 3 pm when  Temp 99.7. Started feeling better at 6 pm.   Got up. Arm still sore. Next day still felt light headed but temp normal. Developed a sore 2x3 inch bump on inside of my left arm that is sore. Doctor said injection hit a blood vessel and I have a hematoma   Injection site soreness almost gone   Inexperienced young girl gave me vaccine. Really hurt unlike the first shot which didn?t even hurt. Think she needs more training on how to administer injections

After a few min. when I got home  ( about 5:15 p.m.)  my face felt tight and I became itchy on all parts of my body except not as much on my legs.  The next day  the headache was not as bad but still itchy especially on my face, head and back.  My arm was not any more sore than with a flu shot.  The next day the headache was gone, the arm was not sore, but I was still itchy.  The itching would come and go for about a week.

That night had a hard time sleeping as it was painful and kept waking me up. I believed it would just get better on its own.

The injection was at the top of my shoulder, it is uncomfortable about 3 inches down my arm. I broke my shoulder In April of 2019,  It feels just like that  as I try to move my arm around.

                                                Typical expected side effects but were very SEVERE and UNable to function normally- headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Dizziness, Chills, Cold Sweats, Pain and soreness especially in lower back, and throat hurt when swallow.  These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

                                                By the late afternoon/early evening  I had developed a rash that covered my body from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head.  The rash was clearly visible but not bumpy.  It was extremely itchy.   I took Benadryl and soaked in an Epsom Salt bath several times that night as I was unable to sleep due to the intense itching.  The next morning (Saturday) I called my doctor and was prescribed a steroid to combat the itching  but was told not to take it until Monday so as not to interfer with the antibodies my body was obviously producing in response to the vaccine.  I was also instructed to start taking  one Zyrtec tablet each morning and two Benadryl tablets each night.  On Monday morning (01/25/2021) I began taking Methylprednisolone (4mg Dospak 21s) which relieved the itching.  At this time the rash is greatly reduced and the itching has almost stopped.  I will continue the meds until the  dosage is completed.

Day 8, arm itchy and red around the injection site.  Warm to the touch. Day 9, more redness and larger area. Size of a silver dollar.  Talked to the nurse at a local gym. Suggested a clinic. I Saw a Nurse Practioner at a clinic. She thought perhaps it was an insect bite as the red area was about 4 inches below where a &#39;normal shot&#39; would be given. Prescribed cream and antibiotic. I didn&#39;t take it.  Took Benadryl (pill). Improving after 1 hr of taking Benadryl.

                                                Approximately  84 hours after administration, I had severe vertigo when prone.  This included a strange sensation of my head floating and an odd sense of loosing consciousness.  The vertigo was awful, and I could barely stand.  This lasted each evening for about 6 night.  It subsided in the morning, after I felt more stabilized in walking.

Red area on sot arm by that evening - next day (2nd day after shot) developed red rashes by  outside of each breast, larger spot by left side (where shot was given), spot on left side of my neck also.  Not a raised or bumpy rash at all, not sore or itchy.    Called advise nurse to determine taking a benedryl was ok and took one last night.  This morning rash less noticeable but still there - also new little mark on inner left elbow.  Feeling fine this whole time, just concerned because I haven?t read of this reaction much for second Moderna.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the Maderna vaccine my head started hurting which I reported to the doctor on site. She talked to me and said I was ok to go. My headache pain persisted all day and into the next. For the pain I took Tylenol and Advil. The pain has not let-up since the day of my vaccination. In addition to the head pain, I started sneezing and had terrible eye irritation with burning and watering. These side effects are still persisting. The worst, however, is the severe head pain which only settles down when I sleep. I am sleeping only 3-4 hours at night now. I wake up for a bathroom break at 3-4 A M and can&#39;t go back to sleep. My head pain starts after I get up every morning about 1/2 hour to an hour. My doctor recommended taking Extra Strength Tylenol and Advil alternating them and an antihistamine. Functioning day to day and making decisions has been very difficult. But, the pain is the worst!!!

We sat her down and asked her if she had ever felt this way before and she stated that once she had a medication that made her break out in a rash that started out with tingling but eventually got worst. Nurse at this time recommended to patient that she should stay for 30 mins for further observation, patient refused. When questioned patient denied itchiness, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms except for tingling. Nurse offered benadryl prior to her leaving and she agreed, dose administered at 1058. At 1100 patient left the premises. At 1445 Nurse called patient with CDC recommendation that she does not receive her second dose of Moderna per her reaction. Patient stated that she wants to continue with receiving her second dose because as soon as she &#34;took off her tight brawl&#34; the symptoms went away. Patient does not believe symptoms were related to vaccine. Patient denied having any further symptoms; rash, shortness of breath, or further tingling at this time.

                                                She got home and after 3 hours she started seeing things, and talking nonsense. Every bone in her body was hurting. It was early in the morning and she thought it was in the middle of the night.  Her husband had to help her to walk with the walker, and was out of her head. She has not been able to walk since Monday afternoon about 4:00. She is now just today able to get to the bathroom. She has taken Extra Strength Tylenol, Trazedone and Klonopin so she could sleep as she has not been able to. She has never experienced anything like this in her life due to the pain. She is a little better today, she gets dizzy when she gets up but still in the bed. She called the doctor yesterday and spoke to the nurse who told her to go to the ER but did not as her husband cannot help her much as he has prostate cancer.

                                                Following the vaccine, within 3 minutes her bottom lip got numb, then her tongue swelled and then her eyes got fluttery uncontrollably, dizziness and weak.  They had her lie down in a recliner.  Her BP was 190/110.  She did not need an EPI pen and within 15 minutes her lip became unnumb, and her tongue swelling receded, was still a little thick, and her face was swollen, was red and flushed.  So they waited 30 minutes, her BP was not coming down, sent to the ER and observed for 3 hours and slowly her BP came down, all her other symptoms subsided and she was able to drive herself home.  Last night 2/25/21 she had great itching on her chest, which has since stopped.  Her tongue is still a little swollen, about 20% still feels thick.  When she left the hospital her BP was 146/86.  She has not taken anything for the symptoms just her regular routine medications.   She did feel tired and spacy feeling, and has been off of work since Wednesday as she could not focus to go to work.

Was told to wait another 15 min and was given water and snack to elevate blood sugar in case it had dropped (I do not have diabetes or history of sugar drops).  When I stood to leave, I stumbled in the hall and was told to stay and blood pressure was taken, which was elevated to about 170, which I had taken as I do daily, before I arrived and it was 119/60.  This was done at hospital by nurse. It was taken again, and it had gone down to 145, and I felt well enough to leave and drive home.  Stayed home, and vertigo was obvious, have had years ago, not recently, so I knew it was side effect.

                                                It stared out with just stiffness in my legs and back. Then at night I couldn&#39;t put my legs down they hurt and my shins felt like I had shin splines.  This lasted about a week or more. I went to a Dr. because my left knee and shin were hurting so bad.  The Dr. was not sure and did a Doppler to see If I had a Blood clot in my left knee but I didn&#39;t. She put me on an antibiotic, that I really didn&#39;t need I don&#39;t think. I took that for  a few days and stopped because it wasn&#39;t helping any. On the 14th I went to see another Dr. and he put me on Prednisone, at this time I could barley walk my right hip was hurting so much. I was taking little bitty steps.  The prednisone has been helping, it&#39;s allowed me to walk and to function. I was to the point it was getting so bad. I&#39;m still having some stiffness, my left elbow gets inflamed at times, my left hand and knuckle swell and get stiff at times too. It seems to move around at effect different places.  The medication helps me move better, I have been off work for 7 weeks, I plan to go back and try half days.

                                                Within 1 minute I started feeling a rush in my throat and a metallic taste, then a tingling in both arms.  That subsided for a minute or two, then started again with a flush feeling down my body.  Nurse took blood pressure 140/80.  Breathing fine. Heart rate fine.  Flush feeling started again, and blood pressure dropped  to100/70.  I was then given 50 mg of Benadryl and an ambulance was called.  My blood pressure stabilized but I was very shaky.  It was recommended that I go to the hospital for observation for a couple of hours, which I did.  I only had the flush feeling once at the hospital.  I was released after two hours.

                                                After the shot, I went home and felt fine.  I did some housework (cleaning) for about thirty minutes, then sat to rest .  Shortly thereafter, I began feeling pain in my left arm.  The pain became more severe as the day progressed until it was very severe and movement of my arm was limited.  The pain progressed throughout the night and also moved into my shoulder.  I got very little sleep even after taking Tylenol and trying heat and  ice applications.  Now, on the third day I am still having pain and am unable to lift my arm or move it outward without severe pain.  I am definitely hindered in my movement and use of left arm.  This is disturbing as I am an artist and need both arms to do my work.

Blood pressure rose to 170-190 over 110 and would not go down.  Doctor advised I go to the E.R. for assessment, which I did. Blood pressure remained elevated for days . Noted the systolic was higher , mostly in the 80&#39;s.  I do not have hypertension BP this morning  in the 120&#39;s over 70.  Needed Alprazolam to calm my anxiety since.  Not every day. Very concerned about having the second dose. Doctor has advised me to only drink water the day of shot, take a tranquilizer an hour before and has given me BP med to take if my BP goes over 150.

                                                chills and fever beginning on Jan 29 around 1PM and continuing through the night.  Bedtime temp 99.9; waking temp 97.4 which is normal for me.  Did my normal breakfast Jan 30 followed by a 4-mile walk and felt fine.  Mid-day temp 97.8 so no worries.  Bedtime temp 100.1  plus ice cold hands and feet. Had profuse sweating during night but would experience feeling cold.  Waking Jan 31 temp 99.3.   Rested during day. Mid-day temp 98.6.  Bedtime temp 99.9 with chills through the night.  Feb 1 awakening 98.7.  The lingering side effects that interfered with my regular routine began to alarm me so I emailed Dr.  Because of the window of time we were in relative to the inoculation, he is viewing it as an extended side effect and advised to watch for other symptoms.  To date I have no other symptoms yet these chills and fever have continued all day Feb 1 and Feb 2.  Beginning Feb 1 I have kept a log of hourly temperatures.  I have not taken anything to attempt to bring down the fever.  On Feb 1 my temperature began to rise at 1PM with 99.0 and by bedtime it was 100.5.  On Feb 2, today, I rose with 99.2 and ranged to 97.8 which seems aberrant because the other temps are all in the 98&#39;s or 99&#39;s.  The chills in the morning and early afternoon do not seem as noticeable as the ones in the evening.

At 1;00PM  I woke up and stood up out of bed and collapses onto the floor.  I was unable to get up.  I found my phone which had fallen onto the floor.  I was shaking so bad I kept dropping it.  I looked and my phone and was  unable to figure out how to make a call.  The screen did not make sense.  Eventually I was able to call my daughter who decided to call 911.  The paramedics came, picked me up  off of the floor and helped me walk to the living room.  My legs kept giving out like I was going to fall again.  They were asking questions but I was unable  to answer coherently. I was so confused.  My brain was not working.  They took me to the hospital where I was admitted and many tests were done.

This appears to be a permanent escalation in the severity of her symptoms. I would say she has advanced  a stage to stage 5. We are now considering adding a new drug for her to take to try and level things out.   She also appeared to have a slight fever for 48 hours after.
