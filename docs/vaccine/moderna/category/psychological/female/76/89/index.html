                                                One week after receiving the vaccine shot, my left upper arm from should down began to itch.  Slight red, under the skin &#39;rash&#39; could barely be seen.  The individual spots did not seem to be the specific irritant.  The arm around the shoulder was somewhat achy and tight feeling.  I was able to sleep through the night after rubbing on Sarno-anti itch lotion.  Could not get comfortable on my left side, with the shoulder area hurting.

                                                Began to have slight wheezing and coughing on Wed afternoon, the day after getting the shot.  Thursday wheezing and coughing increased and woke me up during the night several times.  Cough was productive with clear sputum.  Friday felt very tired all day and coughing and wheezing increased substantially, producing shortness of breath upon any exertion, like going up and down the stairs.  Very tired.  Began to think I&#39;d have to go to see the Dr. because wheezing was significant with every breath.  Cough was racking, increasing through the day into the evening.  At 10 p.m. I began to wonder if I&#39;d make it through the night without calling the rescue squad.  Couldn&#39;t take a deep breath or speak a whole sentence with out a coughing jag.  Then, suddenly about 11:30, it just ceased.  The tightness in my chest went away, the coughing with every inhalation stopped and I could take a deep breath.  It was a bit stunning.  Because I had pulmonary embollisms about ten years ago, my lungs have been a weak spot in my body with bronchitis occurring frequently.  I hadn&#39;t seen reports of this side effect of the vaccine, so I thought I&#39;d report it.  This morning, Saturday four days after the shot, I am breathing much better, not coughing, and do not have any wheezing.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 025LZ0A) intramuscularly in her right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient experienced heart beating very fast and feeling uncomfortable; it lasted for a few hours. She stated it was atrial fibrillation, she had a diagnosis of this, and it only lasted a few hours. The patient also stated that her blood glucose was 150, which was higher than normal.  Treatment for the events was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, increased blood sugar, was considered not resolved. The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and feeling uncomfortable, was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76 year-old female patient with a significant medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and non-serious unexpected events of Discomfort and Blood glucose increased. The events occurred one day (same day) after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 025LZ0A. Treatment was not reported. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the event a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes were considered strong confounders.

                                                The following day after my injection, I had bright RED hives all over my body except for my face and hands.  It was very uncomfortable.  I tried to calm my skin with lotions.  As the days progressed, the color receded and all of my skin started to peel.  It was terrib ly itchy and difficult to wear clothing. It took about a week for it to calm down, and the peeling continued for another week.

She could hardly walk to the bathroom due to the muscle weakness and fear of falling.  She tossed and turned all night long.  She got up and her temp was 99.8, and she was told not to go to PT this morning.  She is being treated for a frozen shoulder.   She feels dehydrated and is drinking water, and going to drink Ginger ale and crackers due to the nausea.

                                                Periodic pressure  and tightness across chest and diaphragm especially on day of vaccination and following 2 days. Rapid heart beat followed by afib that was not terminated with normal medications. Dizziness and shortness of breath. Hospitalized with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It resolved after getting two injections of a medication called diltiazem in the emergency department, after which I was monitored overnight in the hospital. Underwent stress test and echocardiogram - results  normal. On the day I write this (March 1) continue to have  shorter periods of rise in blood pressure and heart rate,  diaphragm tightness, insomnia and lethargy.

My muscle in my chest just tightens and is hard as a rock. and then it goes away.

Was quite concerning but did not call doctor although I sure thought about it. I was wondering if I was actually infected with Covid- 19. Shot was Tuesday 2: 30 PM, felt a bit better by Thursday but arm still hurt even on Friday arm was red and swollen down to my elbow. Saturday fine. I thought someone should know about this as lost of my friends also had difficult reactions. But this was the first time I saw an opportunity to respond.

She was tossing and looked like she was trying to get up. He was talking to her and she wasn?t answering him. She was having trouble breathing. Took her to the hospital right away at 7:30 pm. They put her into a comma with a respirator. Finally went from emergency room to ICU on Monday. Then on Wednesday they took the respirator out and I spoke to her ? told her we all love her and she could only say hoarsely ?terrible, terrible.? They said she might get moved to regular floor. But then Wednesday night couldn?t breathe again and put the respirator back in. Thursday morning husband had it removed and she died that evening at 10:51 on February 25.

                                                I received my injection on 1/25/2021 I had my second COVID shot, everything went well, I just had a little pain and swelling and was fine. About 7 hours later i got up from chair and i was dizzy and my balance was off and i almost fell into table. I didn&#39;t feel right. I went and sat back down and i was very tired and i started getting headache. I called my daughter and a nurse she knows told me to take extra strength Tylenol 500 mg take 2 every 6 hours. I started at 730 and went until 130. I slept on and off and got up Tuesday and my arm was still hurting. I was very tired and had no energy. When i got up later in the afternoon i had extreme chills. It was 83 degrees in Florida nd i turned heat up to 84 and i was still shaking. I got under covers and had a fever it was 100.8. Went to sleep that night and fever broke. Got up Wednesday and felt a little better, still had headache and tired. Decided to take a shower. I noticed my left arm where the injection was was all red. 6-7 inches long and about 5 inches wide which i never saw before. after shower I called my PCP I contacted the nurse said she thought it was normal and if there was no  change to call her back on Friday. my arm is still red and warm i went to sleep but couldn&#39;t sleep. I saw an article about COVID arm rash seen after Modern vaccine and now i know that&#39;s what I had. I feel better after I read it in the magazine today and it said it will only last a week. This should be listed as a side effect so nobody else wonders what it is. I drank so much water because it said to drink plenty of water and i tried to use arm as much as possible.

It is now Jan 30, 2021 and the area is still itching, tho less, and is still hot.  There is a 1/4&#34; wide reddish ring in a circle of about a 3&#34; diameter around the shot site.  Today I put a cold compress on it and was surprised that as soon as I took it off after about 10 minutes it was still hot.  I am worried about having the 2nd shot in the same place.

My left  knee replacement felt like it was in a vise,  This  was a  short lived event with some residual feeling in the knee in the morning.   3 days after injection  10:00 pm 1/30/2021- I noticed a small rash on my left abdomen near the navel, this rash moved quickly to the left and soon covered entire left abdomen, moving to the groin area then down left inner thigh.  I took a Benazepril and went to bed. During the night I woke up several time with a strong pressure in left bowel area. Changing position seemed to help and went back to sleep. woke up about 5 am and checked the rash which was mostly gone except for the original spot where it began.  The rash and pressure seemed to be restricted to front left side below waist area. It is now 11:00 am 1/31/2021 and I am feeling fine, very little residual rash at initial site.   I had not read anything about delayed reactions as late as 3 1/2 days after the injection so wanted to report this event.

On an unknown date post hospitalization, the patient tested positive for Covid-19.  Treatment drug administered included Tylenol, Azithromycin, Promethazine, 325mg aspirin, and Vitamin D.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, like not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, confusion, loss of balance, renal failure, severe urinary tract infection that was septic, and Covid-19 positive test were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the event of COVID-19.  The event of COVID-19 is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-033912:

                                                Mom became agitated. Would not sleep. Stayed continuously awake for approximately 40 hours.  Could not be redirected. So tired she was swaying on her feet, but could not be convinced to lay down.  After 2 days we were able to get 50 mg Trazadone from our doctor.  After sleeping for 6-8 hours she then did another 24 hours awake. We upped the dose to 100 mg.  By this point the event had started to pass.    During this time we also noticed mom was running a low fever in the morning. 99.5 - 100.5. It would go away in the afternoon.  During this time mom was hallucinating - having conversations with people who were not there.  Mom&#39;s hearing declined during the event as well.   As of 2 days ago mom&#39;s temperature seems to be back to normal in the morning.  This &#34;event&#34; has impacted mom&#39;s mental and physical decline.  She seemingly overnight now needs help showering and toileting, and sometimes dressing.  (This kind of decline is common for dementia.  Each time over the past 5 years that mom has had some physically stressful even such as hurting her foot or getting a bad stomach virus,  she has come out the other side degraded)  The reason I&#39;m reporting this is that the behavior changes were sudden, seemed to peak, and then subside.  There is a correlation with the second moderna shot, and so I though it was important to report.

Patient has been hospitalized twice over the past 2 weeks. Treatment for the events included steroids and amlodipine.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcomes of the events were considered not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The events are probably related to the Prolia injection received by the patient, which is known to cause these side effects.

HR 185, BP 90/57.  I continued to monitor and over next 90 minutes my HR went to 165 then 175, back to  165, and my BP got as low as 57/37 and everything in between that low and 90/57.  After about 90 minutes both HR and BP stabelized to 112/90.  I have never had any heart issues.  I have felt fine since then.

I took Benadryl, Claritin and Pepcid ( these were meds previously recommended for my daughters allergies). It took about 30 mins after the meds to be able to swallow comfortably without coughing. The rash however lasted three weeks. I has a telemedicine consult with my allergist who was hesitant to advise the second shot.

I could not even turn over in bed without my  whole body hurting. I don?t know if I had a fever or not.  I was so tired, but shaking with chills and body hurting I couldn?t go to sleep.  Put more blankets on and took 2 Tylenol.  I was able to eventually go to sleep.  I felt better in the morning but was very tired during the day.   It felt like I had covid again.  I had the same symptoms then.  I tested positive for covid November 27 at a rehab/nursing home where I was sent  after foot surgery.

The patient&#39;s medical history included Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included levothyroxine sodium.   On 08 Jan 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20-2A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Jan 2021, the reporter states the patient went into a sharp decline, diarrhea, nausea, headache and sleeping 24 hours a day.   A few days later, the patient was not eating much and did not recognize her husband or family.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol, emergency room visits, and nursing care center placement.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed diarrhea, nausea, headache, sleeping 24 hours a day, not eating, and didn&#39;t recognize husband or family, were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 78-year-old, female patient with a medical history of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, who experienced unexpected events of diarrhea, hypersomnia, decreased appetite, confusional state and expected events of nausea and headache. The events of diarrhea, nausea, headache and hypersomnia occurred 5 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20-2A) and, the events of decreased appetite and confusional state occurred unspecified number of days later. Treatment for the event included paracetamol, emergency room visits, and nursing care center placement. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Alzheimer&#39;s disease is a confounding factor too. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Admitted to hospital for acute on chronic respiratory failure following covid vaccination.  (patient significantly fatigued, slept most of the day after vaccine, not on BIPAP as needed)  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  patient is a 78 y.o. female with a history of oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and persistent atrial fibrillation who presents today with general malaise.  She received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccination yesterday and complained of fatigue, body aches, and general malaise all day.  Later in the evening she noticed that her blood oxygen level was low.  She denies having any more shortness of breath abnormal.  She has had no vomiting, headache, or chest pain.  On arrival she was noted to be febrile and required 6 L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  She usually uses 2 L nasal cannula at baseline, occasionally increasing it to 3 or 4 with exertion.  She also had elevated troponin levels and noted leukocytosis.  There was radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  On exam, she is tired and wants to go to sleep.  She is still requiring 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.  Her daughter is at bedside.  Plans are discussed for admission and she is agreeable.   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: * Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Admit to medicine- hypoxic requiring 6 L nasal cannula, utilizes 2 L nasal cannula baseline Hypoxia appears to be secondary to robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Increased hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure Will repeat troponin level in the morning, daily chemistry and blood count, will treat congestive heart failure as below     CHF (congestive heart failure) (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Transesophageal echocardiogram from October 2020 noted preserved left ejection fraction, and had no evidence for diastolic dysfunction Radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure, normal BNP, elevated troponin with an increase of 18 at the 2 hour mark, will recheck in the morning As this is her 2nd hospitalization since that echo with hypoxia and concern for CHF, will obtain repeat echocardiogram Received 80 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department, will continue 40 mg IV Lasix 2 times a day Daily weights, 2 L fluid restriction Patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. I think this is due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure that was brought on after she was sleeping most of the day without her BiPAP. She says she got her COVID-19 booster shot and felt so tired she slept all day. She did not think she needed her BiPAP during the day even if she was sleeping. She has not had a recent sleep study. Patient is diuresing and will likely be able to discharge tomorrow.

Did not feel well by bedtime, and a bit fuzzy-headed. Next day, I was fuzzy-headed, body stiff and achy, very tired, upper arm excruciatingly  painful. All symptoms began to clear significantly by evening, and back to normal by the following morning (2/10).

                                                After the second shot, I expected mild side effects and experienced some: mild headache, sore left arm around injection site, fatigue, brain fog. I was walking to my garage with a small package of papers when suddenly my lower back spasmed sharply. The pain was intense. I thought it would subside so I managed, with difficulty, to make it into my car. When I was seated in the car, the spasms subsided. I considered not driving to my two errands but decided that I felt well enough seated in the car to drive and deliver the papers to my tax preparer  and the carful of donations to Goodwill. At the tax office, I called an assistant to come to the parking lot to pick up the papers, which she did. At Goodwill, one of the attendants emptied my car. When I got home at about 10:50, I had to call my husband to help me into the house. I spent the next several hours in agony (11 on a scale of 1-10) with spasms, punctuated by absolutly not moving. The spasms were so bad I could not breathe. My doc prescribed a muscle relaxer, then the next day prednisone, which has helped. Today I will have an mri to determine if the spasms herniated a disc.

                                                Day of injection arm a little sore. Next day (Friday) felt perfectly fine and spent the day at home doing usual house cleaning and laundry. Felt fine in the evening and Saturday morning was extremely fatigued, loss of equilibrium, and elevated blood pressure. This condition remained for a few days and on Tuesday my pressure was somewhat down and I saw my doctor. He suggested that since I was doing a little better had NO other symptoms such as fever or chills or muscle aches I would be better in time. It was a rough week feeling so unlike my self but I pushed through. I see the doctor again on Tuesday the 26th. I have never had any reaction to any other vaccine such as flu or shingles vaccine at any time. I am an active woman who exercises and walks to the beach near my home frequently every week. I am anxious about the second dose of the vaccine. I have an appointment on Thursday, February 4th. Hopefully all my strength will have returned by then. I feel like I&#39;m still only 80% back to normal. I have spoken to a young woman who called me back. I would like very much to speak with a medical person who can give me some feedback on my response to the vaccine. That would be reassuring that I am not alone with these side effects. Thank you.

THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

Then had this vaccine, no reaction initially, came home, feeling fine but an hour later had flushing in her left ear, just creeping over to her eye and the side of her face.  This lasted for about 15 minutes and left the feeling of something not quite right around her eye.  Nothing compared to her reaction in November from a tetanus booster.  Still has the feeling but not an adverse reaction.  Then at 10:00 PM all of a sudden her face went really hot, and presumed she had a fever, started feeling badly.  Started walking around the house, took Tylenol.  That feeling lasted for about 30 minutes and resolved.  Went to bed and did not feel anything but a funny feeling.  All symptoms have subsided except for a weird feeling around her eye.

She waited and as she was leaving she fell to the floor and hit her head.  The other patients around her said it looked like she slipped, but when speaking to her it seemed that she had become dizzy and fell.  I spoke with her after she fell, she did not loose conscienceness, but was disoriented.  She did know what day it was, who she was and where she was.  She said her head hurt and she could move all her limbs.  I asked the store director, to call for an ambulance.  I sit with her for a few minutes and talked to her, then asked store director to stay with her until the ambulance arrived.  They arrived and spoke with her and decided to transport her to the hospital.  Later that day, her sister in law came by and said she was doing fine and had been released.  The doctors indicated they thought she because dizzy due to dehydration

Her cheeks were swollen, she felt that maybe her tongue was as well.  She got the liquid Benadryl and let it stay there and it helps that feeling.  She had taken the Zyrtec and Singulair the night before.  She did the inhaler puff in the morning, the feeling did not go away.  She then took the Ventolin and it seemed to calm down.   The symptoms then went away and didn&#39;t come back, and thought that she was ok.   She felt bad for about a week and a half like she wanted to sleep all the time, but did what she had to do.  She is fine now.

The second day she shaking and jerking, couldn&#39;t hold on to anything.  Her blood pressure was up and down that day. She said she felt like she was dying and then she vomiting where she bruised both elbows on the toilet bowl due to the jerking movement she was experiencing.  She took a nap and woke up confused.  She was hallucinating saying she felt like she went from a small box to a blue box to red box and didnt recognize her room.  Her sitter said her eyes were glazed but was able to recognize her sitter at that time.  Blood pressure dropped so the sitter then called EMTs where they checked her out.  Vital signs were good but she declined to be transported to the hospital via ambulance.  The third day she was feeling some better where she was able to eat and get a sponge bath.  Fourth day she was better so was able to shower.  She states she is better now with just a little soreness and redness around the injection site.   Pt has contacted her PCP and spoke with the nurse about her symptoms.

                                                My mother received her vaccine at 12:40 on 2/2. She waited longer than the fifteen minutes and she seemed fine. We left the facility and on the way home, approximately 45 after she received the vaccine, she began slurring her words ands was confused. The slurring lasted for 2-3 minutes The confusion continued. I brought her the ER where she was immediately taken in for  a CT Scan. She later had an MRI, and met with a Cardiologist. She later had an EEG at the request of a Neurologist. She spent three nights in the hospital.  All tests showed no acute signs of stroke, etc.

My right arm was very red, warm and itchy. (Ten days after receiving my first vaccine my left arm became warm, red and itchy for about several days). On the 3rd day the discomfort began to diminish. Today I am fine.

That night I didn&#39;t sleep at all. So that night I called the doctor and I went to the doctor Friday morning, and was diagnosed with the worst case of Shingles she had ever seen. She prescribed prednisone on a taper, Valtrex (generic) 1 gram tablet 3x daily for one week, and topical ointment (flutisone propionate) .005 strength twice daily, and 500 mg tylenol every six hours.

Dr there glanced at my arm and said it was an infection  and gave me antibiotic, Cephalexin 500mg, 10 days.  Feel really bad but maybe better today and that  is after tramadol and tylenol. Headaches. Tylenol helps.. now afraid to take 2nd shot.

When we were going home they told me I was swerving, all over the road and they told me to stop, they would drive, I said no, i don&#39;t trust anyone with my car. We got home, I remember changing into my nightgown and was texting someone and I suddenly I stopped. After that I was unresponsive. I would not answer anyone, they said I looked pale and stared into the air. They called my children and they came and emergency personnel was called. I was taken to a hospital and they transferred me to another hospital. I stayed there for 3-4 days. After going home it took me some days to be able to walk without assistance. I wanted to say I had covid in May (1st time) and September (2nd time) . I still do not have taste or smell back from the covid. I can only eat 3 or 4 bites and then I am done.

                                                Seizure like episode on 1/12/21, one week after vaccine, last 1.5 hours, consisting of both eyes twitching and clenching/spasm of right hand and arm.  EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

                                                Called at 8 am this morning to inform me of a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She received the vaccine on Tuesday, 1/19/21. The next day she noted the back of her tongue on the R side was swollen. On Thurs, 1/21/21, she reports she woke up with the back of her tongue swollen on both sides such that she had some trouble speaking and needed to be very careful with chewing so she would not bite her tongue. She stated she also had drippy sinuses and an earache which then woke her up several times during the night last night. Today she reports the tongue swelling is only to the back R side of her tongue. She continues to have ear pain. She states she had not reported the symptoms to anyone before her call because she had not felt the symptoms were life-threatening. I asked her if she had taken any benedryl, and she stated the only medication she had taken was her analgesic herbal supplement. She states she has never had a vaccination reaction in the past. I advised her to call her PCP and be seen, which she was able to do. After she was seen, she called and stated while the clinician was looking at her tongue, it started to have shooting pains when she moved it to the right. The clinician stated her tongue and throat were not visibly swollen, noted no swollen lymph nodes, and noted no ear abnormalities.

Second night was normal. No pain but felt wide awake and alert. Almost like I had a small dose of adrenaline. No high or nervousness. Quite normal except for the fact that it wasn&#39;t daytime! Check online and saw that Pfizer had sleeplessness as a side effect but not Moderna. It was not an &#34;adverse&#34; event for me...rather fascinating since I&#39;ve never had anything like that before.

                                                I video chatted with her Thursday after receiving the vaccine. My mom was in poor health but she was talking in complete sentences and responded appropriately. She was upright in bed and made eye contact. She smiled and denied pain. By Sunday, she was extremely weak and unable to sip water with a straw. Her health had changed dramatically and rapidly. She moaned in pain and was very fatigued. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the week and she stopped talking and was constantly sleeping. They started antibiotics for the oozing cancer lesion and then morphine for pain and end of life care. She passed away on January 22nd which was 15 days post vaccination.

I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

The red site itched and hurt a bit when touched.  (Note: I took a Benedryl pill and put some Cortozone-10 ointment on the circle the second day after the injection when the circle appeared.) That day and the next the tissue within the red, 3-inch diameter circle got progressively harder - it felt as firm/hard as a golf ball. (I took another Benedryl pill the third day after the injection, but switched to Benedryl ointment, which worked better for the itch than the Cortizon had.)

                                                Several days after receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine for COVID 19, I began have pain in all the joints in my hands, shoulder.  Unable to use my hands due to excruciating pain.  The pain began  3-4 days after the 2nd shot, starting in 2 of my fingers and progressively moved to all the joints in all of my fingers, wrists and my shoulders.  In addition there is swelling. I have very little use of my hands, requiring assistance to care for myself.  I have never had joint pain in my hands before.  The pain has continued for 2 weeks non-stop.  At the doctors recommendation I have been taking Tylenol for Arthritis, however this does not alleviate the pain, only reduces some of the discomfort.

Back in the middle of February the patient had a high-grade small-bowel obstruction ended up with laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.  She was extremely deconditioned.  She came to swing bed here and states here for about 2 weeks.  She thought she was ready to go home and be successful at that time.  Unfortunately, she has gotten home and found that she can barely take care of herself.  She is extremely deconditioned.  She thinks she just needs to be built up for another week or 2 and then could be very successful at home.  She does have a friend that is helping her, but is worried about getting so weak that she end up hurting herself.  I saw her yesterday in the office and thought that another swing bed stay a might be in order.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (also treated with 5 days of Remdesivir) in January 2021 and Lumpectomy. Concomitant products included NICOTINAMIDE, PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE, RIBOFLAVIN, THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (VITAMIN-B COMPLEX), ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN-C), VITAMIN D [VITAMIN D NOS], ZINC, APIXABAN (ELIQUIS), CARVEDILOL, ATORVASTATIN and LETROZOLE for an unknown indication.    On 03-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 04-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (hit her head and blacked out) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FEELING ABNORMAL (feeling awful), MALAISE (not felt well ever since), DECREASED APPETITE (don&#39;t feel like eating), COVID-19 (feeling the same symptoms as she did when she had covid), TASTE DISORDER (taste not the same), HEADACHE (headache), FATIGUE (Fatigue), MYALGIA (mucsle aches), NAUSEA (slight nausea) and INJECTION SITE LYMPHADENOPATHY (problem with a lymph node in that arm). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (hit her head and blacked out), FEELING ABNORMAL (feeling awful), MALAISE (not felt well ever since), DECREASED APPETITE (don&#39;t feel like eating), COVID-19 (feeling the same symptoms as she did when she had covid), TASTE DISORDER (taste not the same), HEADACHE (headache), FATIGUE (Fatigue), MYALGIA (mucsle aches), NAUSEA (slight nausea) and INJECTION SITE LYMPHADENOPATHY (problem with a lymph node in that arm) had not resolved.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment information included was acetaminophen for headache. The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.

That evening she started feeling really bad and knew she was having a shingles flair again.  Reports she was nave able to finish her shingles vaccine series because she developed shingles a week after her first vaccination.   She was still within the 6 month period to wait to get the second dose when this occurred.  She called her doctor who advised her it was ok to take her antiviral for the shingles and that she could still get her second injection for the COVID vaccine.

                                                The injection did sting, but didn&#39;t think anything about it. For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

When asked what her sx were, she stated fatigue.  She was well the night of the shot, Thur. and Fri. but became tired on Sat. and Sun.  I went through other sx with her such as h/a, fever, n/v, muscle aches, weakness and she said she experienced none of those.  I questioned her about eating and drinking and she said she ate and drank water.  She seemed fine so I told her to call her doctor if she was worse or the fatigue persisted or call 911.  She agreed.  Two staff from clinic called her Mon. and Tues, (1/18 and 1/19).  On Tues. she may have had sl slurred speech.  She was found deceased on

It looked like there were 2 giant hives on my my arm (bigger than a nickel). Took 1 Benedryl (25mg), which didn&#39;t help. Hardly slept due to itching, and soreness to the touch. I can&#39;t wear a blouse with a sleeve. Today (Sunday 1/24), the redness came together into 1 big red blotch, measuring  2&#34;x3.5&#34;. Hot to the touch, and very sensitive. I feel pain into my shoulder blade area and where my arm meets my body in the front. Also, pain going towards my elbow. Ice / cold packs make it feel better. I will call for Dr. appointment tomorrow (Monday morning).

Could hear her heart pounding and racing really fast.  Laid down and after 45 minutes to an hour was still racing, so laid back down and when got up the 2nd time her heart was still beating fast but not as bad as when it first happened.  Gradually the symptoms subsided.  Not having problems now.  Did not feel very good Saturday or Sunday, but today is feeling fine.  The first day was the worst.

In addition to the  fast and hard heartbeating for 20 minutes in the evening, I should tell you that I decided to take my Blood Pressure before retiring.  I usually have low BP at about 125/68 or so.  That night I took it and it was  182/160.  I decided that HAD to be wrong so I took it immediately again and the next time it was 165/82.  I decided that this must be anxiety and went to bed.  My son suggested that I should report all this to you anyway.

                                                Five days ago, patient received her 2nd COVID vaccination.  Following that she had myalgias and some sedation/confusion.  She apparently stumbled and struck her head.  She did not lose consciousness.  She did recover from her symptoms by the next day.  She has some soreness on her scalp in the scratch but no significant hematoma.  However, she then developed some swelling and redness beneath her eyes.  She is here to evaluate that.  She she is back to her normal self.  Comments: Patient has ecchymosis in swelling beneath both eyes and the bridge of her nose.  It is nontender.  Scalp-minor area of tenderness in the right vertex.  There is a slight abrasion on the skin.  No signs of hematoma.   Assessment / Plan: 1. Contusion of scalp, initial encounter   Contusion right scalp-I suspect patient&#39;s lungs are delicate skin informed a small hematoma.  The swelling and bruising and 5th settle down into her eye sockets.  I reassured patient that this will resolve the next 1-2 weeks.  I believe patient had some severe myalgias and fatigue after a COVID shot.  I do not think this is a longstanding problem.  Expect her to get back to her normal self.  Patient did have COVID-19 approximately 3 and half months ago.  I told her that people have more significant reaction to the COVID vaccine after having had the illness.  At this point, I do not agree need further workup.

On 25 Jan 2021, the same day as the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Patient reported that she initially had an &#34;extreme reaction&#34; with severe, flu-like symptoms, headache, fever, disorientation, nausea and dehydration.  She reported that she had a fever within three hours of receiving the vaccination. She stated that she suffered extreme vomiting for three and a half weeks along with ongoing headache, fever and cramping.  On an unknown date, she was in the hospital, or ER, where she received medication for nausea and intravenous medication for dehydration (unknown if hospitalized}.  She reported eight hours of pain/cramping in her lower abdomen, and again, stated that she was severely dehydrated.  (The duration of hospitalization or ER visit was not reported).  At the time of reporting, she said that her symptoms were ongoing, however, much less severe.   Treatment included was nausea medication (patient did not remember the drug&#39;s name), intravenous (IV) medication for dehydration, IV antibiotics and dicycloverine.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.

I asked her what was going on and she said to help her, that she can&#39;t breathe, and that she thinks she is going to die. We administered a dose of Epinephrine and shortly after she said she was feeling better but she was shaky/jittery. EMS was called simultaneously and they arrived shortly after.

I slept through the rest of the night but awoke feeling extremely weak and confused. As a result, I spent the day in bed. I had no appetite, as well. The next day, I had coughing bouts off and on and still don&#39;t feel myself.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   On 14 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had no pain or soreness, but the area was a little tender if you pushed, and she waited one hour in the hospital afterwards.  As the patient was getting ready to leave, she felt a little lightheaded.  She was driven home, she ate lunch and then worked in the yard for a little bit. As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again. Consent given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, Afib started to act up, blacked out and hit forehead on the door jamb, were resolved on 15 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, area was a little tender and had some bruising near eye, were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 84 year old female patient with medical history including atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, her medical history of heart condition and medication she took could remain a confounder.

I then used the toilet and started walking back to bed (less than 20 feet away). About halfway there, I I realized something was wrong. The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground right next to my bed. On the way down I think I heard crashing into wood furniture. I don?t know how long I was blacked out; it might have been 10 minutes. I managed to get up onto the bed and felt something wet on my pillow case. It was blood coming from a deep laceration on my chin. My doctor told me to go to urgent care. They sent me to the emergency room. I was kept overnight for observation and give three stitches in my chin. I have felt woozy ever since, but all the tests administered in the hospital showed no damage.

It looked like she was on the toilet, and it looked like she fall getting her off, she was still wet, she still felt warm. I called the ambulance and immediately  began CPR. When EMS arrived they took over the CPR and transported her to the Hospital. The EMS was there for about 40 minutes and used an machine to preform the compressions. She was pronounced deceased at the hospital.  No autopsy was done.

                                                Two days after her second Moderna vaccination (administered on 2/25/2021) she developed lesions on her neck.  We took her to an urgent care clinic on 3/2/2021 and they diagnosed her with a shingles outbreak more than likely as a result of her vaccination.  She did not have any reaction to her first Moderna vaccination four weeks earlier.  She was prescribed an anti-viral.  She is more comfortable now but her cognitive and physical abilities have declined significantly.  She is also having significant sleep issues which have also contributed to her cognitive and physical problems.

Has had diarrhea for the last 3 days, nausea and generally feeling bad.  The first week had a lot of drowsiness, had fogginess as far as thinking.   The first few days took Tylenol and did not take anymore as her daughter said it contained aspirin for the pain.  Still having the headache, feeling like she is not thinking real good.  About a month ago had blood work and everything was perfect, no problems.  Due to the fact that she is still having these reactions 2 weeks from the injections wanted to report it.

                                                My mother has experienced a severe reaction to her vaccine. Diagnosed with brain encephalopathy probably caused by molecular mimicry in response to the Covid vaccine, she is now being treated as an inpatient at the Clinic.  She was fully independent- living alone, mobile, with excellent cognitive function.  On January 21, 2021 she received her 1st Moderna vaccine. Subsequently family noticed small balance changes, slight fine motor coordination changes (handwriting, etc) and a little forgetfulness not previously seen. Everything was chalked up to her being 89 years old.  She remained independent and relatively fully functional.  Patient is now unable to stand without assistance, leans backward when trying to stand, has developed a spastic tremor bilaterally in her arms, and her cognition is completely altered.  Hallucinations, memory loss, can follow some directions but not all, speech clear but inappropriate.  This declines DAILY. As of March 7th, she could not identify immediate family members in a photo. These changes have all occurred within the past few weeks and appear to have an acute underlying cause not related to age.    Medical staff are looking at an autoimmune encephalitis picture based on the antibodies developed from the vaccine attacking the tissue in the brain and spinal cord that resembles the small piece of the vaccine.    She is currently at the Clinic affiliated hospital. At this time, family is contacting Clinic main campus to request further investigation.   Photographic evidence of rapid decline available, but not able to attach to this form:   Available are three pictures of a log patient keeps with her vitals that she was doing every day.  1. Personal log of vital signs pre Covid vaccine/dose 1 - you can see the handwriting is concise, clear, and orderly.   2. Personal log of vitals after Covid dose 1 on Jan. 21 - slight changes in the handwriting and orderliness but still ok.  3. Personal log of vitals after Covid vaccine dose 2  Feb. 17 - note the illegible handwriting, missing entries, and no spatial awareness of line alignment.  Available are three photos of crossword puzzles she does every day.    1. Puzzle dated Feb.12. Demonstrates her ability to accurately fill most answers with clear writing.   2. Puzzle dated Feb.19 shows an ability to fill in only a couple answers with obvious handwriting changes.   3. Puzzle dated Feb. 21 shows inability to complete, and a strange discrepancy between ability and inability- note 29 across and 18 down.  Patients outcome is undetermined as diagnosis/treatment and prognosis are ongoing.
