                                                Developed a severe headache within 2-3 hours of receiving vaccine. Took 2 Tylenol. Headache abated but did not resolve. Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

Slight red, under the skin &#39;rash&#39; could barely be seen.  The individual spots did not seem to be the specific irritant.  The arm around the shoulder was somewhat achy and tight feeling.  I was able to sleep through the night after rubbing on Sarno-anti itch lotion.  Could not get comfortable on my left side, with the shoulder area hurting.

                                                When I woke up to use the bathroom I was ataxic and had nystagmus. A while later I became nauseous. I took a baby aspirin because I was afraid I was having a stroke. This lasted about 5 hours. Then I developed a head ache just behind my nose. The headache subsided in the mid afternoon, but I was wiped out and slept most of the day. Today (the next morning) I feel fine, just a little tired.

Pt was feeling much better and talking within ten minutes.  We stayed with the patient and monitored her continuously until her observation time was complete and when she left with family she was alert, oriented, and said she felt much better.  Instructed patient and her family to give us a call if they had any further questions or concerns and to go to the ER if any serious reaction symptoms occurred.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 025LZ0A) intramuscularly in her right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient experienced heart beating very fast and feeling uncomfortable; it lasted for a few hours. She stated it was atrial fibrillation, she had a diagnosis of this, and it only lasted a few hours. The patient also stated that her blood glucose was 150, which was higher than normal.  Treatment for the events was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, increased blood sugar, was considered not resolved. The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and feeling uncomfortable, was considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76 year-old female patient with a significant medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and non-serious unexpected events of Discomfort and Blood glucose increased. The events occurred one day (same day) after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 025LZ0A. Treatment was not reported. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the event a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s medical history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes were considered strong confounders.

I tried to calm my skin with lotions.  As the days progressed, the color receded and all of my skin started to peel.  It was terrib ly itchy and difficult to wear clothing. It took about a week for it to calm down, and the peeling continued for another week.

                                                When I woke on the 19th I was trying read my bible and I couldn&#39;t concentrate and I was really cold. I went to back to bed and slept most of the day. I was really cold and fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. I took some Tylenol. I woke up about 3:30 AM Saturday and my back, arms and my head were all hurting and I took some Tylenol and went back to bed. I woke up about 6AM and was covered in sweat.  I didn&#39;t want to do anything Saturday, I rested most of Saturday and Sunday. Today the 22nd I am back to my normal self.

They put her into a comma with a respirator. Finally went from emergency room to ICU on Monday. Then on Wednesday they took the respirator out and I spoke to her ? told her we all love her and she could only say hoarsely ?terrible, terrible.? They said she might get moved to regular floor. But then Wednesday night couldn?t breathe again and put the respirator back in. Thursday morning husband had it removed and she died that evening at 10:51 on February 25.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, stated she was sneezing and coughing few days before receiving her first dose vaccine. Concomitant medications reported included iron, metolazone, nicardipine, simvastatin, torsemide, levothyroxine, glimepiride, apixaban, potassium chloride, acetyl salicylic acid, and donepezil 5mg.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 032L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The route of administration was not provided.  On an unspecified date in Jan 2021 after receiving the first dose vaccine, the patient experienced not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, and didn&#39;t want to get up.  On 25 Jan 2021, the patient was losing her balance and confused. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with renal failure, as well as, severe urinary tract infection that was septic.  On an unknown date post hospitalization, the patient tested positive for Covid-19.  Treatment drug administered included Tylenol, Azithromycin, Promethazine, 325mg aspirin, and Vitamin D.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, like not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, confusion, loss of balance, renal failure, severe urinary tract infection that was septic, and Covid-19 positive test were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the event of COVID-19.  The event of COVID-19 is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-033912:

When I got of bed the following morning I felt so weak, woozy and light headed that I was afraid I would fall.  I slept all day but by that evening I began feeling better and by the following day (day 2 after the shot) I felt normal except that my arm was still sore. It is now day 3 and my arm is still slightly sore but not limiting my use and is steadily getting better.

                                                The first day felt fine, the next day when she got up in the morning she didn&#39;t feel well, but felt well enough to put a roast in the crockpot.  Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

I could not even turn over in bed without my  whole body hurting. I don?t know if I had a fever or not.  I was so tired, but shaking with chills and body hurting I couldn?t go to sleep.  Put more blankets on and took 2 Tylenol.  I was able to eventually go to sleep.  I felt better in the morning but was very tired during the day.   It felt like I had covid again.  I had the same symptoms then.  I tested positive for covid November 27 at a rehab/nursing home where I was sent  after foot surgery.

The patient&#39;s medical history included Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included levothyroxine sodium.   On 08 Jan 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20-2A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Jan 2021, the reporter states the patient went into a sharp decline, diarrhea, nausea, headache and sleeping 24 hours a day.   A few days later, the patient was not eating much and did not recognize her husband or family.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol, emergency room visits, and nursing care center placement.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed diarrhea, nausea, headache, sleeping 24 hours a day, not eating, and didn&#39;t recognize husband or family, were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 78-year-old, female patient with a medical history of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, who experienced unexpected events of diarrhea, hypersomnia, decreased appetite, confusional state and expected events of nausea and headache. The events of diarrhea, nausea, headache and hypersomnia occurred 5 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20-2A) and, the events of decreased appetite and confusional state occurred unspecified number of days later. Treatment for the event included paracetamol, emergency room visits, and nursing care center placement. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Alzheimer&#39;s disease is a confounding factor too. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Admitted to hospital for acute on chronic respiratory failure following covid vaccination.  (patient significantly fatigued, slept most of the day after vaccine, not on BIPAP as needed)  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  patient is a 78 y.o. female with a history of oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and persistent atrial fibrillation who presents today with general malaise.  She received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccination yesterday and complained of fatigue, body aches, and general malaise all day.  Later in the evening she noticed that her blood oxygen level was low.  She denies having any more shortness of breath abnormal.  She has had no vomiting, headache, or chest pain.  On arrival she was noted to be febrile and required 6 L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  She usually uses 2 L nasal cannula at baseline, occasionally increasing it to 3 or 4 with exertion.  She also had elevated troponin levels and noted leukocytosis.  There was radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  On exam, she is tired and wants to go to sleep.  She is still requiring 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.  Her daughter is at bedside.  Plans are discussed for admission and she is agreeable.   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: * Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Admit to medicine- hypoxic requiring 6 L nasal cannula, utilizes 2 L nasal cannula baseline Hypoxia appears to be secondary to robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Increased hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure Will repeat troponin level in the morning, daily chemistry and blood count, will treat congestive heart failure as below     CHF (congestive heart failure) (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Transesophageal echocardiogram from October 2020 noted preserved left ejection fraction, and had no evidence for diastolic dysfunction Radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure, normal BNP, elevated troponin with an increase of 18 at the 2 hour mark, will recheck in the morning As this is her 2nd hospitalization since that echo with hypoxia and concern for CHF, will obtain repeat echocardiogram Received 80 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department, will continue 40 mg IV Lasix 2 times a day Daily weights, 2 L fluid restriction Patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. I think this is due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure that was brought on after she was sleeping most of the day without her BiPAP. She says she got her COVID-19 booster shot and felt so tired she slept all day. She did not think she needed her BiPAP during the day even if she was sleeping. She has not had a recent sleep study. Patient is diuresing and will likely be able to discharge tomorrow.

THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

She waited and as she was leaving she fell to the floor and hit her head.  The other patients around her said it looked like she slipped, but when speaking to her it seemed that she had become dizzy and fell.  I spoke with her after she fell, she did not loose conscienceness, but was disoriented.  She did know what day it was, who she was and where she was.  She said her head hurt and she could move all her limbs.  I asked the store director, to call for an ambulance.  I sit with her for a few minutes and talked to her, then asked store director to stay with her until the ambulance arrived.  They arrived and spoke with her and decided to transport her to the hospital.  Later that day, her sister in law came by and said she was doing fine and had been released.  The doctors indicated they thought she because dizzy due to dehydration

Her cheeks were swollen, she felt that maybe her tongue was as well.  She got the liquid Benadryl and let it stay there and it helps that feeling.  She had taken the Zyrtec and Singulair the night before.  She did the inhaler puff in the morning, the feeling did not go away.  She then took the Ventolin and it seemed to calm down.   The symptoms then went away and didn&#39;t come back, and thought that she was ok.   She felt bad for about a week and a half like she wanted to sleep all the time, but did what she had to do.  She is fine now.

She said she felt like she was dying and then she vomiting where she bruised both elbows on the toilet bowl due to the jerking movement she was experiencing.  She took a nap and woke up confused.  She was hallucinating saying she felt like she went from a small box to a blue box to red box and didnt recognize her room.  Her sitter said her eyes were glazed but was able to recognize her sitter at that time.  Blood pressure dropped so the sitter then called EMTs where they checked her out.  Vital signs were good but she declined to be transported to the hospital via ambulance.  The third day she was feeling some better where she was able to eat and get a sponge bath.  Fourth day she was better so was able to shower.  She states she is better now with just a little soreness and redness around the injection site.   Pt has contacted her PCP and spoke with the nurse about her symptoms.

                                                My mother received her vaccine at 12:40 on 2/2. She waited longer than the fifteen minutes and she seemed fine. We left the facility and on the way home, approximately 45 after she received the vaccine, she began slurring her words ands was confused. The slurring lasted for 2-3 minutes The confusion continued. I brought her the ER where she was immediately taken in for  a CT Scan. She later had an MRI, and met with a Cardiologist. She later had an EEG at the request of a Neurologist. She spent three nights in the hospital.  All tests showed no acute signs of stroke, etc.

EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

                                                Called at 8 am this morning to inform me of a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She received the vaccine on Tuesday, 1/19/21. The next day she noted the back of her tongue on the R side was swollen. On Thurs, 1/21/21, she reports she woke up with the back of her tongue swollen on both sides such that she had some trouble speaking and needed to be very careful with chewing so she would not bite her tongue. She stated she also had drippy sinuses and an earache which then woke her up several times during the night last night. Today she reports the tongue swelling is only to the back R side of her tongue. She continues to have ear pain. She states she had not reported the symptoms to anyone before her call because she had not felt the symptoms were life-threatening. I asked her if she had taken any benedryl, and she stated the only medication she had taken was her analgesic herbal supplement. She states she has never had a vaccination reaction in the past. I advised her to call her PCP and be seen, which she was able to do. After she was seen, she called and stated while the clinician was looking at her tongue, it started to have shooting pains when she moved it to the right. The clinician stated her tongue and throat were not visibly swollen, noted no swollen lymph nodes, and noted no ear abnormalities.

Second night was normal. No pain but felt wide awake and alert. Almost like I had a small dose of adrenaline. No high or nervousness. Quite normal except for the fact that it wasn&#39;t daytime! Check online and saw that Pfizer had sleeplessness as a side effect but not Moderna. It was not an &#34;adverse&#34; event for me...rather fascinating since I&#39;ve never had anything like that before.

My mom was in poor health but she was talking in complete sentences and responded appropriately. She was upright in bed and made eye contact. She smiled and denied pain. By Sunday, she was extremely weak and unable to sip water with a straw. Her health had changed dramatically and rapidly. She moaned in pain and was very fatigued. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the week and she stopped talking and was constantly sleeping. They started antibiotics for the oozing cancer lesion and then morphine for pain and end of life care. She passed away on January 22nd which was 15 days post vaccination.

I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

                                                Several days after receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine for COVID 19, I began have pain in all the joints in my hands, shoulder.  Unable to use my hands due to excruciating pain.  The pain began  3-4 days after the 2nd shot, starting in 2 of my fingers and progressively moved to all the joints in all of my fingers, wrists and my shoulders.  In addition there is swelling. I have very little use of my hands, requiring assistance to care for myself.  I have never had joint pain in my hands before.  The pain has continued for 2 weeks non-stop.  At the doctors recommendation I have been taking Tylenol for Arthritis, however this does not alleviate the pain, only reduces some of the discomfort.

Back in the middle of February the patient had a high-grade small-bowel obstruction ended up with laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.  She was extremely deconditioned.  She came to swing bed here and states here for about 2 weeks.  She thought she was ready to go home and be successful at that time.  Unfortunately, she has gotten home and found that she can barely take care of herself.  She is extremely deconditioned.  She thinks she just needs to be built up for another week or 2 and then could be very successful at home.  She does have a friend that is helping her, but is worried about getting so weak that she end up hurting herself.  I saw her yesterday in the office and thought that another swing bed stay a might be in order.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (also treated with 5 days of Remdesivir) in January 2021 and Lumpectomy. Concomitant products included NICOTINAMIDE, PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE, RIBOFLAVIN, THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (VITAMIN-B COMPLEX), ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN-C), VITAMIN D [VITAMIN D NOS], ZINC, APIXABAN (ELIQUIS), CARVEDILOL, ATORVASTATIN and LETROZOLE for an unknown indication.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment information included was acetaminophen for headache. The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.  Based on the current available information a temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded. Headache, fatigue, myalgia, nausea and injection site lymphadenopathy are consistent with the product safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information a temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded.

That evening she started feeling really bad and knew she was having a shingles flair again.  Reports she was nave able to finish her shingles vaccine series because she developed shingles a week after her first vaccination.   She was still within the 6 month period to wait to get the second dose when this occurred.  She called her doctor who advised her it was ok to take her antiviral for the shingles and that she could still get her second injection for the COVID vaccine.

                                                The injection did sting, but didn&#39;t think anything about it. For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

When asked what her sx were, she stated fatigue.  She was well the night of the shot, Thur. and Fri. but became tired on Sat. and Sun.  I went through other sx with her such as h/a, fever, n/v, muscle aches, weakness and she said she experienced none of those.  I questioned her about eating and drinking and she said she ate and drank water.  She seemed fine so I told her to call her doctor if she was worse or the fatigue persisted or call 911.  She agreed.  Two staff from clinic called her Mon. and Tues, (1/18 and 1/19).  On Tues. she may have had sl slurred speech.  She was found deceased on

Could hear her heart pounding and racing really fast.  Laid down and after 45 minutes to an hour was still racing, so laid back down and when got up the 2nd time her heart was still beating fast but not as bad as when it first happened.  Gradually the symptoms subsided.  Not having problems now.  Did not feel very good Saturday or Sunday, but today is feeling fine.  The first day was the worst.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   On 14 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had no pain or soreness, but the area was a little tender if you pushed, and she waited one hour in the hospital afterwards.  As the patient was getting ready to leave, she felt a little lightheaded.  She was driven home, she ate lunch and then worked in the yard for a little bit. As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again. Consent given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, Afib started to act up, blacked out and hit forehead on the door jamb, were resolved on 15 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, area was a little tender and had some bruising near eye, were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 84 year old female patient with medical history including atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, her medical history of heart condition and medication she took could remain a confounder.

The whole prior she kept saying I am just not right. On the 2/7/21 she a COVID test done, a nurse came to her house and preformed. On the morning of the 8th patient was on the phone with someone else and patient asked this person to call me and go check on her. Within 5 minutes I was over at her house, and I found her on the floor, she on her belly facedown. It looked like she was on the toilet, and it looked like she fall getting her off, she was still wet, she still felt warm. I called the ambulance and immediately  began CPR. When EMS arrived they took over the CPR and transported her to the Hospital. The EMS was there for about 40 minutes and used an machine to preform the compressions. She was pronounced deceased at the hospital.  No autopsy was done.

                                                Two days after her second Moderna vaccination (administered on 2/25/2021) she developed lesions on her neck.  We took her to an urgent care clinic on 3/2/2021 and they diagnosed her with a shingles outbreak more than likely as a result of her vaccination.  She did not have any reaction to her first Moderna vaccination four weeks earlier.  She was prescribed an anti-viral.  She is more comfortable now but her cognitive and physical abilities have declined significantly.  She is also having significant sleep issues which have also contributed to her cognitive and physical problems.

She also reported extreme fatigue once she got home (felt fine at the pharmacy during the observation period). She also states she was so fatigued she didn&#39;t remember driving home and had to crawl from her front door to her bed and that she was in bed fatigued for 2 days. She has recovered from the fatigue but is still experiencing tingling in the tip of her tongue, which she hasn&#39;t experienced before receiving the vaccine.

Came home, did not feel bad, day and half later started feeling bad, as  well as kind of like a cold with drainage to her throat, a little coughing.  Has had diarrhea for the last 3 days, nausea and generally feeling bad.  The first week had a lot of drowsiness, had fogginess as far as thinking.   The first few days took Tylenol and did not take anymore as her daughter said it contained aspirin for the pain.  Still having the headache, feeling like she is not thinking real good.  About a month ago had blood work and everything was perfect, no problems.  Due to the fact that she is still having these reactions 2 weeks from the injections wanted to report it.

                                                My mother has experienced a severe reaction to her vaccine. Diagnosed with brain encephalopathy probably caused by molecular mimicry in response to the Covid vaccine, she is now being treated as an inpatient at the Clinic.  She was fully independent- living alone, mobile, with excellent cognitive function.  On January 21, 2021 she received her 1st Moderna vaccine. Subsequently family noticed small balance changes, slight fine motor coordination changes (handwriting, etc) and a little forgetfulness not previously seen. Everything was chalked up to her being 89 years old.  She remained independent and relatively fully functional.  Patient is now unable to stand without assistance, leans backward when trying to stand, has developed a spastic tremor bilaterally in her arms, and her cognition is completely altered.  Hallucinations, memory loss, can follow some directions but not all, speech clear but inappropriate.  This declines DAILY. As of March 7th, she could not identify immediate family members in a photo. These changes have all occurred within the past few weeks and appear to have an acute underlying cause not related to age.    Medical staff are looking at an autoimmune encephalitis picture based on the antibodies developed from the vaccine attacking the tissue in the brain and spinal cord that resembles the small piece of the vaccine.    She is currently at the Clinic affiliated hospital. At this time, family is contacting Clinic main campus to request further investigation.   Photographic evidence of rapid decline available, but not able to attach to this form:   Available are three pictures of a log patient keeps with her vitals that she was doing every day.  1. Personal log of vital signs pre Covid vaccine/dose 1 - you can see the handwriting is concise, clear, and orderly.   2.
