                                                The patient came to the Emergency Room at approx 3:30 am on 02/03/2021 with pain in right arm (same arm the COVID vaccine had been administered in approx 12 hours earlier) and feeling generally unwell. Patient was concerned about possibility of gout flare or that something was wrong with her arm. Elevated blood pressure was noted; this was attributed to anxiety.

After 2nd dose of the vaccine she seemed to be doing ok but gradually declining and less and less to be able to do for herself, it slowed down greatly after the vaccine. There was a gradual decline, but on May 2 she woke up and was semi conscious and said she thought she was dyeing and was in pain and discomfort and was taken into the ER and she was DC&#39;d and started hospice and two days before she passed she got the hospice care. My mother was in a semi coma and could not communicate properly.  Many test were done at the hospital during her stay even though they never identified what the cause was. At the last ER visit they diagnosed her with pneumonia

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Dementia.   In February 2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. In February 2021, received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced DEMENTIA ALZHEIMER&#39;S TYPE (acute Alzheimers) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), DEMENTIA (had mild dementia but towards the end it seemed to have exacerbated) (seriousness criterion medically significant), HYPOTENSION (blood pressure became very low) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CELLULITIS (experienced cellulitis in her legs) (seriousness criterion medically significant), COVID-19 (Diagnosed with COVID a week later) and MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (she couldn&#39;t even remember anybody). The patient died on an unknown date. The reported cause of death was death was acute alzheimers. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. At the time of death, DEMENTIA (had mild dementia but towards the end it seemed to have exacerbated), CELLULITIS (experienced cellulitis in her legs), COVID-19 (Diagnosed with COVID a week later) and MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (she couldn&#39;t even remember anybody) outcome was unknown and HYPOTENSION (blood pressure became very low) had resolved.            Treatment included unspecified pressors. No concomitant medications were reported. Patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in FEB-2021. Caller did not know the exact dates of administration of the two doses. Patient was then diagnosed with COVID a week later. Patient did not have much of a reaction to the 1st dose or any symptoms from COVID. She then received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in middle of FEB-2021, per the caller. In the end of APR-2021 or beginning of MAY-2021, patient experienced cellulitis in her legs. Her blood pressure became very low and she was hospitalized for treatment. She was put on pressors. She recovered from it and was sent back to her assisted living facility. However, on 25-MAY-2021, she passed away at the assisted living due to acute Alzheimers. Patient had mild dementia but towards the end it seemed to have exacerbated, where she couldn&#39;t even remember anybody. Her diagnosis at the time of death was acute Alzheimers.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-034532 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: This is a 91-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna) (batch unknown) who experienced exacerbation of her DEMENTIA, ALZHEIMER&#39;S DEMENTIA, HYPOTENSION and CELLULITIS after her second dose of vaccine, leading to her death from ACUTE ALZHEIMERS.  Advanced senior age also could be attributed to the development of the events. It is unlikely, that the events are related to the vaccine based on long standing illness of DEMENTIA. . Very limited information has been reported at this time. Further information is expected.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: death was acute Alzheimers

The EMT and paramedic summoned me and after arriving at the observation area  and ascertaining the patient&#39;s symptoms i asked the medic to administer the .3ml of epinephrine via EpiPen which he then did. Responding paramedics then arrived and took over assessment and treatment of the patient.  An ambulance had previously been called and the patient remained stable with slight improvement in the sense that she became less anxious and frightened.  She exhibited no urticaria or angioedema.  Vital signs included initial B/P of 183/95 with improvement to 176/76 and 99% pulse ox .  Patient was transported to hospital and per daughter was released about 2 hours later.

She had a rash on her arm that received the shot and it ran from her spot of injection to her elbow.  It was hot with the rash for about 5 days.

The day of her vaccine, she seemed very tired. The next day, she was exhausted. She had a hard time doing her normal activities. No fever. It was much more challenging for her to walk. She just couldn&#39;t get moving. It seemed to stay the same. I noticed she was having a harder time doing everything. Suddenly, her comprehension seemed to change. Within a week, she went from mild cognitive deficits to full blown cognitive impairment: not knowing how to take her pills, how to wash hands, how to use her watch/fitness tracker, to not removing her bottle cap to drink water, to having a hard time communicating. I called the Pharmacist where she had the vaccine, and they told me that this was not uncommon after the vaccine. They had been getting lots of similar calls. They haven&#39;t given out any second shots yet, and were not looking forward to it after everything they&#39;ve been hearing.  This is very frightening.!!!! Our Mom cannot be left alone now.  How long will this last????!!!!

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 04-Feb-2021, Electrocardiogram: normal (normal) heart was operating properly.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Patient was taking unspecified blood pressure medication concomitantly.  Following the administration while the patient was in the clinic, she began to feel itchy, very funny and real strange. At this time the EMS on site were concerned and preformed an electrocardiogram (EKG) on the patient to make sure that the heart was operating properly. It was deemed that it was and the patient was then sent home. After that time no other side effects were present but the patient did eventually have to go into the hospital for a Pacemaker Surgery that was believed to be unrelated.

                                                My mom received her first Moderna Vaccine on 1/22/21. Late on 1/23 her face began to swell so the staff called the ambulance to come take her to the hospital for what they thought was an abscessed tooth. ER doctor said there was an infection and that she needed to be seen by an oral surgeon. On 1/25/21 I took my mom to Dr., her oral surgeon and after the examination he advised that there was no abscess but an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. He suggested Benadryl. I gave her benadryl and the swelling started subsiding. From this point on her gums and teeth hurt. Her eating habits started to decline. She received her 2nd Moderna vaccine on 2/19/21 and from that point on she could no longer chew or brush her teeth because the pain was so severe. She passed on 3/19/21.

                                                About an hour after receiving her 2nd dose, she went to a restaurant and ordered her favorite shredded beef burrito. After only a few bites, she experienced non-stop &#34;burping&#34; and swallowing any liquid became impossible. We were at a useless ER hospital from 2-6 pm when they finally saw her and said they did NOT have any means of looking down her throat.  Long story short -- the next day I drove her to another Hospital. We were there from 2-8 p.m. The Dr. removed a bolus at 7:15 p.m. - 7:45 p.m. and he said &#34;everything looks good&#34;. HOWEVER -- my mom continued having &#34;esophagus&#34; issues from that time on. And ALSO, on April 4, she told me, &#34;I don&#39;t feel good&#34; and she proceeded to fall asleep on her couch and did NOT WAKE UP for about 6 weeks except to use the bathroom, take her morning and evening pills and eat a tiny bit of soft foods. I can&#39;t think of any other reason for this bizarre &#34;sleeping&#34; except for that 2nd Covid shot. I&#39;ve taken her tour GP 2 times since then and all blood work comes back normal. And a few visits to the ER within the last 3 months only showed  she&#39;s had another UTI within 6 weeks  and her swollen lower legs/feet can only be cured with lack of gravity. Weeks ago I took her to her annual checkup with her heart doctor and he said her blood pressure was on track. So as of today, I am waiting a call-back from hospice to see if I can get someone to help me with her bathing, etc. at home. Just wanted to tell somebody that since her second dose of Moderna Covid vaccine, it&#39;s been downhill for her and it&#39;s hard for me to believe the cause can be anything other than that 2nd vaccine.

The patient&#39;s grandson reported back to the assisted living director that the patient was diagnosed with asymptomatic pneumonia, was transferred to the ICU and passed away in the night.

Nearly everyone in the retirement home was extremely ill after the second dose; most of the administrative staff went home sick; skeleton crew pulled double shifts caring for residents with extreme &#34;blow-out&#34; diarrhea and debilitating nausea. One patient reported temporary paralysis. Men complained of sore arms but women couldn&#39;t get out of bed. We were prepared with prophylactic anti-emetic meds and avoided diarrhea. However, patient had headaches and nausea for a week; refusal to eat/drink put patient at risk for dehydration and kidney issues; fasting  exacerbated confusion and put patient at risk of harm (wandering, falling, etc.) Patient is still lethargic and confused, has started eating again but only minimally, a few bites. Strongly regret vaccinating.
