                                                The patient came to the Emergency Room at approx 3:30 am on 02/03/2021 with pain in right arm (same arm the COVID vaccine had been administered in approx 12 hours earlier) and feeling generally unwell. Patient was concerned about possibility of gout flare or that something was wrong with her arm. Elevated blood pressure was noted; this was attributed to anxiety. She was evaluated, given 500 mg Tylenol, and discharged since the pain was decreasing and blood pressure was stabilized. Patient instructed to follow-up with physician.  The next day,  on 02/04/2021, the patient arrived at the Emergency Room by ambulance; cardiac arrest was the chief complaint. The patient&#39;s daughter stated the patient had been &#34;feeling generally poor and then suddenly collapsed.&#34; Daughter described &#34;gurgling respirations&#34; and being unresponsive. 911 was called, police arrived within 5 minutes and initiated CPR. Epinephrine, atropine, lidocaine and bicarb administered after arrival to Emergency Room.  Shockable rhythm never demonstrated. Patient never recovered spontaneous respiration or movement.   The death was called at 23:04. Coronary artery disease with cardiac arrest is the cause from the ER records; the coroner is putting COVID-19 vaccination in Part 1 of the death certificate.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination the patient began to feel a tightness in the throat and difficulty speaking with a sense of anxiety and fright.  The EMT and paramedic summoned me and after arriving at the observation area  and ascertaining the patient&#39;s symptoms i asked the medic to administer the .3ml of epinephrine via EpiPen which he then did. Responding paramedics then arrived and took over assessment and treatment of the patient.  An ambulance had previously been called and the patient remained stable with slight improvement in the sense that she became less anxious and frightened.  She exhibited no urticaria or angioedema.  Vital signs included initial B/P of 183/95 with improvement to 176/76 and 99% pulse ox .  Patient was transported to hospital and per daughter was released about 2 hours later.

The symptoms have been on and off since then. But the last 5 hours they have been steady. It feels like my heart is in my lungs.   I do have a pacemaker and my Doctor just prescribed Lasix for swelling in my legs. I have not received it in the mail yet.  Does not have the lot number.

                                                My mom received her first Moderna Vaccine on 1/22/21. Late on 1/23 her face began to swell so the staff called the ambulance to come take her to the hospital for what they thought was an abscessed tooth. ER doctor said there was an infection and that she needed to be seen by an oral surgeon. On 1/25/21 I took my mom to Dr., her oral surgeon and after the examination he advised that there was no abscess but an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. He suggested Benadryl. I gave her benadryl and the swelling started subsiding. From this point on her gums and teeth hurt. Her eating habits started to decline. She received her 2nd Moderna vaccine on 2/19/21 and from that point on she could no longer chew or brush her teeth because the pain was so severe. She passed on 3/19/21.
