I didn&#39;t experience any diarrhea or vomiting that night.  The stomach cramps were enough to keep me up for most of the night, but not as bad as food poisoning.  The next morning when I got out of bed I immediately got sick and vomited.  I was very shaky and light headed.  These symptoms continued until about 7 pm on the 30th.

                                                About 1  hour after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19, I started feeling extreme pain in my left shoulder and arm, where the shot was administered. The pain continued to intensify throughout the day and night and was 10/10 on a pain scale. In addition, I began to lose my ability to lift my left arm or use it. It became so weak that I had to use my right hand/arm to pick up my left arm to move it. My left arm was &#39;hanging and drooping&#39; and my left shoulder was very  noticeably lower then my right shoulder. I called my primary care and employee health. My primary care doctor advised me to take advil and go to urgent care if the pain persisted and worsened. I could not sleep at all that evening of 12/29/20 because the pain was so intense and I had to keep picking my left arm up with my right arm to keep re-adjusting to try and get comfortable. The next morning I went to an orthopedic urgent care where I was diagnosed with nerve damage from the shot and prescribed Methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack. The doctor who saw me explained that he could not assess the extent of the damage at this time because my nerves were so agitated and inflamed. He scheduled a follow up visit with me for Thursday, January 7th and stated he will then proceed with an MRI and further investigation to assess the extent of the nerve damage.  During the days that followed my immunization, I was unable to do anything with my left arm and was dependent on my husband to help me get dressed, showered, household chores, etc. It is unknown at this time whether this will be temporary or permanent damage and disability.

                                                I got the shot, didn?t feel it at all so it went good. I went to the bathroom and went pee and got my arm back in my long sleeve shirt under my scrub top. I wasn?t anxious about getting the vaccine. Then I went to sit down and be monitored. After about another minute I felt very weird like a warm feeling going all over my body.  I started pulling my mask away from my face to get a deep breath. Then I broke out in a sweat from head to toe. I think I became pale (I apparently didn?t look good).  I started feeling more ?weird? as I had never felt this way before and I stood up to walk because the nurse there wanted me upstairs near the ED but I was weak so I sat down and had tunnel vision. After that it?s a bit of a blur. After I stopped sweating I got very cold and shaky but vitals were ok.  It scared me because I have never had a reaction before to a vaccine.

                                                1/5/2021 - Day 1:  R) deltoid pain at injection site around 1600, mild headache viewing around 2100 when going to bed. I took ibuprofen prophylactically to prevent pain getting worse.  1/6/2021- Day 2 around 00:00, I was woken up out of bed with severe body aches all over. Mostly to bilateral hip joints and lower. Arm pain and headache were barely noticeable d/t other pain. Pain radiated to arms down to both shins. It hurt to touch skin and took ibuprofen around 0130-0200. It was so bad I couldn&#39;t roll my body up without assistance and I&#39;d need to use restroom for almost 2 hours at this point. Had to call out of work because I knew this pain wouldn&#39;t go away in a few hours in addition to lack of sleep, I knew it&#39;d be better to rest with OTC, rest, And heating pad.  Later this day I was still feeling the same, went to store to get something for body aches. It wasn&#39;t until I was in this store, when my left femur bone hurt so bad I had to grab onto a shelf. I felt my bone was about to break - scary. (My1 st time experience the bone pain symptom) Later at home same day, spent an hour going back and forth to bathroom with large loose/water diarrhea. I slept most of the day, as I was too fatigued to do simple tasks. Went to bed around 21:00 after taking ibuprofen, laying on heated and covered in electric blanket.  1/7/2020 woke up at 05:50 to get ready for work and instantly felt the pain again and headache, I&#39;m usually not so tired after sleeping, so contributed that to same fatigue. Although is not pounding, still dull.  1/7/2021 0900 took my HCTZ, Propranolol, and Potassium. Today the pain is not as high, but better than yesterday. I expect to feel a lot better tomorrow to go into work.

Approximately 2 minutes after sitting down I felt a sensation that can be described as a wave through my body. It only lasted for 10 seconds; however, it was immediately followed by a rapid heartbeat. It almost felt as though I might pass out (I have never passed out before). I alerted a nurse, and she monitored me for the 15 minute duration. After about 2 minutes, I felt &#39;normal&#39; again.

It is painful, burns, stings and has a tingling type feeling. She has not changed medications, no new laundry soaps, she believes the only change has been the COVID vaccine. She also explained what she described as &#34;electricity&#34; the afternoon following the injection. She said the best way to describe it was the sensation as if she put her tongue on a battery however much more intense and throughout her whole body.  She has had extreme fatigue as well as body aches as well.

Within 24 hours of vaccination, she developed a headache that lasted approximately 1 week. Within 36 hours of vaccination, she developed an itchy rash that covered her trunk (abdomen and chest). Upon assessment of her injection site one  week after vaccination, it was extremely red with very defined borders of erythema.

The chills subsided on 1/4/21. The arm pain started to subside 1/6/21, to the point where it was just the area where the shot was administered, but still hasn&#39;t gone away. It still hurts to move that muscle. The pain is worst in the morning, but my arm will loosen up by the afternoon. The pain doesn&#39;t go away completely. It hurts to lift or push if that muscle is involved. I have not been able to sleep comfortably because if it. I have been taking advil and tylenol multiple times a day, as well as trying hot packs on my arm at night.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, January 4. I had a mildly sore arm for the first couple of days following the vaccine, but that was about it for side effects. I noticed my face was a little flushed when I was driving home afterward, but I chalked it up to being excited and nervous and wearing a face mask.  Seven days later, it started to feel itchy around my vaccination site (upper left arm). There has been some mild swelling around the site, in addition to being itchy. The area is also warmer than the rest of my arm or body. For one night, it was uncomfortable sleeping on my left side.  Starting on the 8th day after the vaccine, there is a small amount of redness just above the vaccine site, about an inch and a half wide, a little larger than a quarter.  Here are my doctor&#39;s notes, who I saw on January 12: Patient is a 40 y.o. female who presents for evaluation of rash/ possible injection reaction  involving the left upper arm. Rash started yesterday.. she noted slight swelling, warmth, and itching with pink erythema in a spot just above the area of her arm where she had her COVID injection 1 week ago. She received the Moderna vaccine.   Associated symptoms: no associated symptoms. Patient denies: fever, headache, arthralgia, abdominal pain, nausea, myalgia, decrease in energy level. She did not have significant pain at the time of the injection, and had a mild sore arm the following few days but no other symptoms after the shot. The warmth and swelling began just yesterday, almost a week later. She has reported this to the VARS website. She is employed by public health and is going to work at a covid vaccination site tonight, checking in people who are getting vaccines.  She has a h/o sensitive skin, but no h/o hives or urticaria, no previous injection reactions. She get racing heart from epinephrine but no other known allergies.  She denies dizziness, dyspnea, SOB, cough, or sensation of swelling in throat.  She has been using ibuprofen, cold compresses for sxs with some relief.  Assessment:  Probable injection site reaction, delayed reaction No strong evidence of cellulitis but we discussed signs and symptoms to be watchful for such as increased swelling and redness or tenderness of the overlying skin, fevers, chills, body aches.  Plan:  Medications: Benadryl 25 mg administered in clinic and discussed use of antihistamines to reduce injection site reaction. She can continue use of ibuprofen and cool compresses as well. Avoid over cooling of skin as this may also cause local reaction.  If pain, redness, or other sxs of concern progress she should follow up.  Verbal patient instruction given. Follow up: as needed.   If no further increase in sxs she should be able to receive her second vaccine but would premedicate with Benadryl to prevent local reaction again.

On Tuesday 1/12/21 my arm was hot and had developed a knot at the injection site and continued to itch and hurt, on Wednesday 01/13/21 when I woke up I had a red rash on top of all the other symptoms at the injection site. I have been very tired and had a headache since I got the vaccine. And over the last few days I have felt worse and my joints and muscle ache, I have been nauseas and mild chills with low grade fever.

Racing heart began within the 15 min waiting period but I interpreted as anxiety.  Other symptoms began roughly 3 hrs post-vaccination.  Remedy was to leave work and go home, lay down in bed, and wait.  After a few hours symptoms mostly resolved, but face still feels strange (slight numbness and slight tingling).

When I woke up a couple hours later the intensity had gone down and I went to work. As time passed, the pain/discomfort dulled and by midafternoon I was barely able to notice it (I had to focus on it).

It had minor itching, and she did not report any issues with either her throat or her tongue.   However, the rash kept getting brighter.

She was tired/sleepy as expected, and had her husband come to take her home. Called on 1/15/2020 at 1 pm, she went home last night and crashed for about a 4-hour nap.

                                                This facility staff member received her first dose of the MODERNA COVID-19 vaccine (Lot037K20A/EXP 6/22/21) at clinic at approximately 9:15AM on 1/14/21. She initially answered &#34;no&#34; to any allergies on the VAR but revealed to the pharmacist reviewing the VAR that she had experienced an allergy to food and contrast dye that required an epi-pen and hospital attention. She did not offer additional details and explained that she had tolerated other shots (including the 2020 flu shot) without incident. I advised patient to remain for a 30 minute monitoring period post-vaccination due to history of allergic reaction. Patient presented with some anxiety before the shot and immediately started to complain of feeling &#34;sick&#34; and said she was having trouble breathing due to chest pressure. We advised patient to remove her mask and provided her with water and a trash can though no vomiting occurred. After 15-20 minutes, patient still complained of chest pressure and difficulty breathing. When asked if she was experiencing any itchiness or throat swelling, patient said she did feel some throat swelling so she was given 25MG of Benadryl. After an additional 15 minutes, patient&#39;s condition seemed unchanged (not worsening, not improving) so the facility&#39;s nursing team was called to evaluate patient. Patient said she was still experiencing difficulty breathing and throat swelling so nursing advised use of EPI-PEN and patient consented. I administered a dose of 0.3MG (LOT0FM4066/EXP 02/2022) to the right lateral thigh and nurse called for EMS. Immediately after injection, patient&#39;s eyes fluttered and she seemed to be on the verge of fainting. Nursing checked her oxygen saturation which was 100%. Patient reported no improvement after 5 minutes so another EPI-PEN 0.3MG was administered to the left lateral thigh. Nursing also gave the patient 81MG chewable aspirin due to the patient experiencing a stroke last month. EMS arrived a few minutes after the second EPI-PEN dose and patient was transported to the hospital for evaluation. Facility reported that patient went home that afternoon but did not provide details. Based on my assessment of patient&#39;s symptoms and behavior, I feel it is likely that she experienced either an acute panic attack or anaphylaxis due to vaccine administration. I called the patient today (the day after the incident) and she confirms that she received treatment for an anaphylactic reaction to the Moderna COVID shot and is doing well without any lasting adverse effects.

                                                Severe entire arm pain that began about 2 hours after injection. It became so severe I was unable to move or lift arm without assisting with other arm! The pain was so intense it woke me from sleeping. Advil helped but the pain was still severe for the entire day.  I Have been taking advil around the clock and the pain has improved slightly and is more bearable but its been 48 hours and I still have pain while taking advil.

                                                Patient received her vaccine and was taken to the observation area to be observed for a 15-minute period. In the observation area, she immediately reported &#34;feeling funny&#34; and was noted to be &#34;sweaty&#34;. The advanced practice nurses and pharmacist were called for assistance immediately. She was placed on a stretcher, had her legs elevated, and was moved to a quieter area. She was responsive to commands and her vitals at this time were as follows: blood pressure 96/56 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 96%, and heart rate in mid 60s.  She did not require treatment and within several minutes of lying down on the stretcher felt better. She did not have any rashes or swelling, and she denied difficulty breathing. She was observed for about half an hour in this area and was also evaluated Emergency Medical Services who had been called. It was suggested that the patient should visit the Emergency Department for observation but she refused as she felt better and due to concerns of being exposed to Covid-19. We were able to walk with her escort her to the exit area at the end of the observation period.   We questioned her about potential allergies again and she denied a history of allergic reactions. The advanced practice nurse evaluating the patient suggested this episode was consistent with a vasovagal episode and that anxiety could have also played a role.

                                                By the end of the first hour after receiving the vaccine in my left arm (injection arm) I could not raise my arm any higher than halfway between my side and shoulder-level - probably a 45 degree angle.  There was also a huge lump at the injection site that was really warm - way warmer than usual.  It lasted approx. 4 days.   I also had a 4 day migraine and was really sleepy.   Since the injection, I haven&#39;t slept through the night and I take a prescription sleeping medication.   I just dealt with all of it; it wasn&#39;t severe enough to warrant a Dr&#39;s office visit.

Began with an itchy arm at injection site and thought nothing of it b/c there were not marks. by the end of that Sunday my arm was red and warm with round spots. I took some Cetirizine and used a topical cortisone. Monday morning I woke to two lumps, itchiness, heat, tenderness, sore muscles, headache. I took some APAP and IBU and applied some more cortisone, went about my day with a two hour car ride and a walk. i was stiff through the day so i completed stretches several times through the day. When i got home that night most of my major joints hurt enough that I could not sleep through the night even with Naproxen 440 mg , APAP 1000 mg, Cetirizine 10 mg on board. My arm began to be more swollen, my nervous system began to be off. I had no appetite, was dizzy, felt shaky but when I held my arm and hand out, I did not shake. I have continued on a with Naproxen an d APAP since Tuesday after read not to take PO IBU if had Moderna vaccine.  I have not been able to complete house hold chores, missed three days of work, and been able to be with family.  As of today, January 22nd 2021, thirteen days post injection I still have fatigue, intermittent dizziness, loss of appetite, joint pain, headache with no relief with OTC&#39;s. The redness, swelling, heat have dissipated in left arm at and near injection site.

                                                Got my vaccine early morning.  Left arm where injection site given,  started to become really sore 30 minutes after injection.  I ate breakfast at around 9:30am. Went to my Doctor&#39;s appointment for 1030am, started having mild chills that would come and go. After Doctor&#39;s appointment,  around 1130-12pm, started to feel nauseous and loss of thirst and appetite.  I called the vaccine line at my job at around 2:59pm, but nurse just stated nothing to do right now, to call back following morning.  I knew things would get worse so I made the judgement call to call out this was close to 4pm. My chills started increasing,  despite not having any high temp was 98.9 f. Then around 5pm started having mild joint pain all over my body. Around 7pm joint pain got unbearable,  that I even started to shiver from more chills and pain.  I couldn&#39;t sleep,  except just laying and tossing and turning in bed, I also started having stomach cramping . Finally I fell asleep at around 12:30 midnight,  due to the pain. I finally woke up around 3:30am, took 2 Motrins. Then I woke up around 06:30am with body aches all over. Last night just took sips of ginger ale, didn&#39;t eat anything since 9:30am yesterday.  Finally had a small breakfast at around 7:30am with a glass of water. Still feel warm at times, with body aches, and nausea.  Will call vaccine line again today.

I developed a fever up to 102F over the following few days and severe pain at the injection site. On about 1/18 my ankles started swelling and turning bright red. I took tylenol / motrin not knowing this could even be associated and thinking maybe I overworked my muscles running around at work that weekend. Over the following few days the reaction has become much more severe. I have nodules that are red, painful and flat all over the front of my legs and thighs and continued swelling and pain to my ankles and knees. This makes it difficult to walk. I followed up with a Dr. on health online as I am unable to drive myself to an appointment at an office at this time who diagosed me with Erythema Nodusum and started me on prednisone. I missed 2 days of work with the initial reaction to the vaccine and will miss 3 shifts this weekend as I cannot walk and need to start prednisone&#34;

Began profusely sweating drenching my clothes. Nausea began. Went back upstairs sat on my bathroom floor due to nausea/ dry heave. All of a sudden SEVERE abdominal pain began 10/10. Cried for my husband. Dripping sweat gave me a cold rag and foam large diarrhea began. Still 10/10 pain in abdomen. Felt like my lower abdomen was getting ripped out.  About 45 minutes or so later still 10/10 wanted to go to ER. I could not stand. If I stood my legs and body felt like I wanted to curl in a ball on the floor. He called an ambulance. I was pale as a ghost, no fever, normal vital signs. Went into full reynauds flare from body stress. Ambulance was unable to get oxygen sat and glucose at the time due to flare. Arrived at the ER labs drawn. WBC 10.9 and Glucose 194. I am not or never have been diabetic. Vaccine related. Like a lightswitch all symptoms stopped except sweating hot and cold spells, sore arm and drowsiness. Discharged at 6am

Mild headache began evening of vaccination, advanced to severe headache throughout the next day. Treated with Ibuprofen 24 hours after vaccination. Pelvic/lower back/neck aches began evening of vaccination, around 10pm. Pain was significant enough to cause insomnia during the night and did not improve during the day after vaccination. Pain improved considerably after dose of ibuprofen mentioned above.

                                                Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

I had a low grade fever of 99.9 that went up to 100.0 measured by ear thermometer  I had joint pain and over all muscle pain By the evening I had mucous in nose, post nasal drip and slight difficulty breathing.

I feel like my body is fighting something, I developed a slight sore throat and my head feels heavy and foggy. I&#39;ve continued to take advil.

Was very shaky and my tongue felt itchy and tight; not swollen just tight 12:40p made it home and took Benadryl 1:00p symptoms dissipated, ate a chicken salad sandwich thinking that would help with the jittery feeling. 1:25p The whole body flash came back and the tightness in the tongue increased. 1:27p Called employee health for information on this type of reaction. Wanted to call me an ambulance, I declined. After much discussion they suggested I come back to the vaccination observation room where they have epi, then decided it best that I go to Urgent Care. 1:40 on the way to town I told my husband to take me to the ED instead as my bottom lip felt swollen and tight, and my tongue felt thick like it was a bit swollen too. Was not short of breath, airway did not feel compromised, breathing normal, and heart rate normal. 3:01 Was given 40mg Methylpredinisone (solumedrol) &amp; 20mg famotidine (Pepcid) given- immediate improvement in tongue thickness and swollen lips. 440p 50mg Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 10mg loratadine (Claritin), &amp; 40mg prednisone given prior to discharge 8:20p Top lip started to swell just before my next dose of Benadryl 8:30p Took next dose of Benadryl, once it kicked in had quick resolution of lip swelling 9:00p joint pain started setting in, was uncomfortable but not too painful 1/121 Joint pain is still present but not uncomfortable. Injection arm a little sore, no redness or swelling at site of injection. Swelling of mouth, face and tongue is persistent as it nears the 4-hour mark for 50mg of Benadryl. 1p ate a couple of bites of chicken fried steak, face is increasing in redness and swelling, and mild tongue swelling. At max dose of Benadryl per box states to only take 6 doses in a 24 hour period. 2p Mouth and face swelling not relieved with Benadryl 2:52p checked into ED for 2nd time. 4:08 Given 10mg dexamethasone (decadron), 20mg famotidine (Pepcid), 10mg montelukast (singular) Swelling improved. 5:54p Potassium low on lab work given 40 mEq of potassium chloride 6:00p discharge with scripts for famotidine, epi pen, montelukast 7:00p taken 25mg of Benadryl 8:20p lips feel mildly swollen again. 8:45p next dose of 25mg Benadryl. Did not have complete resolution of swelling but did improve. Mild hives, swelling of hands and feet. 1/2/21 All joint pain is gone, and injection site pain is only noticeable if someone bumps into my arm. 6a 25mg Benadryl &amp; Pepcid 10a 25mg Benadryl 2p 25mg of Benadryl 3:30pm felt fine all day with only mild swelling and redness to hands, ate chicken nachos. Face became very hot (like my face was too close to the oven when I open it), redness from eyes down, lips swollen, mild itchiness too the tongue but nothing too concerning. 4p 25mg Benadryl I strongly believe the exacerbating factor is eating as all times the symptoms increased in intensity I had just eaten. After discussion with Dr. will be cutting out chicken (chicken was eaten before all 3 instances) and all other meats until complete resolution of symptoms and will avoid any inflammatory foods such as nuts, berries and shellfish. 7p 25mg Benadryl &amp; Claritin taken 7:30p ate a banana, no reaction 8p Singular taken 9:30p put Vaseline on my lips, face &amp; ears flamed hot and swelling and redness followed. 9:45p took 25mg Benadryl 10:25p tongue thick feeling 11p took 25mg Benadryl tongue still feels thick 1/3/21 Fevers 101.6 and chills started in the night Face and lips are permanently swollen and red despite all the meds I?m taking.Lymph nodes are all swollen. I?m too afraid to eat for fear of more swelling while my face is already so swollen.

                                                I received the injection around 2:15 pm.  There were no immediate effects. By late afternoon/early evening, my arm was a bit sore and later started to feel warm near the injection site.  However, I otherwise felt fine.  At 9 pm, I suddenly became very dizzy and passed out for several minutes. When I regained consciousness, I felt a little short of breath, which resolved within 20 minutes or so. However, I was also extremely nauseous, which got worse any time I tried to move. This continued for several hours.  I also alternated between being very warm and chills during this time - it was like waves of heat. I did not have a fever. Later, my head began to hurt and I took tylenol to help with that. I also had diarrhea. These symptoms began to gradually lessen after a couple of hours and I was able to fall asleep around 12:30 pm. I woke up hot and sweaty several times throughout the night. The following day, 1/6, I was very tired and had a headache and could not eat much, but otherwise felt much better.

I had COVID-19 disease in September, so I was expecting to have a robust response to the vaccine. I received my Moderna vaccine on 12/29. I developed fever, shaking chills, and terrible body aches about 13 hours after the dose. I felt a bit better in the morning, so I went to work as usual but was still sore with body aches. I developed shaking chills, nausea, and worsening aches at lunch time and left work early because the nausea and chills were so significant. I slept the remainder of the day and by the morning of 12/31 felt well again. My symptoms probably lasted around 24-30 hours total. I did miss a half day of work but otherwise had no significant effects.

If that is any sign of how covid feels, I am so grateful for the shot.  I did not take anything because I wanted my body to fight it off.

                                                I had my first COVID 19 Moderna vaccine Lot: 025J20-2A at hospital. Within about 60 seconds of receiving it, my heart started pounding hard and rapidly and I let a nurse know. She took my vitals and my heart rate was very high, as was my blood pressure. My O2 was fine. I had some tightness and heaviness I my chest. I felt flush in my cheeks, but did not have hives. The nurse said my color was very pale. I was warm, given an ice pack, and then a bit later cold. At one point they wanted me to go to the Emergency Department, which I refused (perhaps stupidly). I&#39;m not sure I was thinking clearly. I was trying very hard to stay calm and relaxed. My blood pressure was very elevated for about an hour and a half. They finally let me go home when I was 140/95 (my usual is 110 over 70 ish). I had some tongue tingling at home, very briefly.

                                                Right at the 15 minute mark I developed a full body sense of warmth followed by tremors and my HR rose from 70 to 138 very rapidly.  My mom was on the phone with me and stated I didn?t quite know what I was saying to her and she became worried.  The RN came by asking how I felt and I told her I was jittery and decided to wait at the site a few more minutes.  The sensation passed after about 3-4 minutes and then I felt ok.  I drove home and showered.  The rest of the night I would get random bouts of tachycardia and felt overall not well.  Also a small amount of chest tightness.  I also noticed things such as climbing by stairs cause me to become winded very fast and my HR would elevate rapidly.  Today I woke up and am feeling almost normal. HR has not been elevated but when I ate I did notice a small amount of lightheadedness.

                                                A day after the shot I was in the shower and started experiencing exhaustion and shortness of breath. I also had tachycardia. I proceeded not to feel well they?re very next day. Then on Friday I was dizzy and a coworker said that I was flushed and I wasn?t feeling well. I proceeded to go see patients and while examining a patient I became very dizzy and lightheaded while bent over and almost passed out when I came up.. at that time I decided to leave work and go to my PCP. Orthostatic?s were positive and EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and an echo is ordered. Echo was normal. Throughout the week I continued to have tachycardia and shortness of breath with any type of exertion. I left work this morning and was tested for Covid because of my symptoms.

                                                On 1/8/21 I had pain in my left ear and a feeling of fluid like an earache, also had a pressure type headache behind my eyes and felt fatigued. I stayed home from work and reported it and was told I could return to work on 1/11 (my next scheduled day) by workplace health. I felt fatigue and eye pressure headaches on and off since. I also felt like I was having vision changes. On 1/14/21 I noticed a small, raised, red area at the injection site. Over the weekend it continued to spread over my arm. It is warm and very mild tenderness to palpation but does not itch. I am also feeling tight muscle pain in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.

                                                When I received the shot, I felt pain radiating down my arm to my wrist.  This continued for about 12 hours after the shot.  I also felt some numbness/tingling in my left hand.  Since this went away within 24 hours, I did nothing extra to treat it.  On the 4th day after the shot (1/19/21), I began to itch.  It started in my arm near the shot site and then spread throughout my left arm, up the left side of my neck, and on the left side of my face.  By the evening, my entire upper body was itching to the point that my skin felt like it was crawling/I wanted to rip my skin off.   I had to take Benadryl in order to sleep.  The itching has continued throughout today and seems worse on the left side of my body.  I cannot take Benadryl during the day as it puts me to sleep.  I cannot be asleep at work, nor can I take off of work in order to stay home to take Benadryl.  The itching is making basic tasks difficult.  I know I will have to take Benadryl again tonight or I won&#39;t be able to sleep due to the itching.  Is there any idea on how long this will last?  Is it safe for me to get the 2nd dose of this vaccine?

                                                Approximately 36 hours of fever of 101, chills, shivering, sweats, aches and pain in every joint in my body, back pain, headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, nausea, difficulty completing my daily work duties and household activities due to pain and not feeling well. This was not much helped by Alleve, therefore I took Tylenol which was mildly helpful. After the first 36 hours, the symptoms lessened in severity and lasted for about another 12 hours. After that, I felt well for several days in a row, then about 1 week later I felt sore, weak, tired and nauseous. This resolved in its own in about 2 hours. I have felt well since then. I am choosing to receive my second dose of moderna vaccine tomorrow, because I would rather experience these side effects then catch COVID ever again. I caught COVID19 in March 2020. With my COVID infection, I was sick for about 21 days with fever of 101 and more, bone pain, body aches, chest pain, back pain, headaches, nausea, shaking chills, sweats, trouble breathing, dyspnea, cough, runny nose, sore throat, pink eye, dizziness, tiredness, ?brain fog? and fatigue. I was not hospitalized. After about 21 days I began to recover, but the first week after my recovery began I was very weak and tired, and spent most of my time sleeping. I was 41 years old at the time, with health problems including well controlled asthma and being overweight. I never wish to experience this again and I am grateful that I am receiving the Modena vaccine. Thank you so much for logging my side effects.

                                                Day after initial shot my arm became sore, red, hot, swollen and hard.  This was in addition to other side effects.  This subsided after 4-5 days. On day 9 after injection my arm became red, and hot again at the injection site.  It was not as inflamed as the initial injection reaction, however very noticeable.  On day 10 I woke at night with vertigo as well.  I was able to fall back asleep after about an hour, and when I woke the next morning the vertigo has subsided. My arm had redness on and off for about 5 more days, seeming to get worse after my shower.  The redness has now subsided completely, however it looks as though I have a minor &#34;bruise&#34; under my skin at the injection site.

Injection site was extremely sore and swollen, to the point I could not even touch the area. This was the left deltoid. Extreme fatigue, I was in bed the entire day sleeping on and off. Overall muscle pain as well.  on 1/2/2021 I was feeling much better, my arm was almost completely improved. Only mild soreness, and only a low grade temp of 99.6.  Since then, on day 5, I seem to have some dizziness but it is goes away quickly.

She was diaphoretic at the onset of symptoms she was able to follow commands and answer questions but that became increasingly difficult. Symptoms worsen and patient started to vomit. Ambulance was called but patient refused to go with them. Felt better approximately 40 minutes after being vaccinated. Left accompanied by her husband.

                                                This is another reaction I experienced. My  left arm started to be sore again  8 days after vaccination, on 1/7/21 (I originally had sore arm on left the first 3 days of vaccination but then it was recovered).  I also feel there is some weakness on my left arm as well.  I wonder if this is a delayed reaction and if it would be permanent? I previously filed  an report on early adverse events-left arm soreness within an hour of vaccination, then spread  across shoulder, in the middle of night, I woke up with whole body muscle ache that lasted till next morning. The next day of vaccination, I was tired , yawning frequently and very sleepy. I slept for 11 hours on the second night of vaccination which was unusual for me. The sore arm disappeared after about 3 days. But 8 days later it occurs again with some weakness on upper left arm.

                                                Thursday night shortly after the vaccine I was exhausted and headed home to go lay down. While driving, I developed a severe headache. I went home and went to sleep really early. Friday morning, woke up, went to work. Extreme lethargy and severe headache. Left work early (2 ish) with joint pain, headache, lethargy. In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and &#34;buzzing&#34; throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled. Still lethargy and dizzy yesterday but no joint pain, no nausea. Now, Monday morning, still dizzy/lightheaded. Symptoms are subsiding, but not gone.

Fever (100.5) and chills within 16 hrs of vaccine; extreme fatigue and mild headache. 48 hours after vaccine: headaches that became a migraine, fatigue continued but less severe than previous day,  and runny nose (no further fever or chills). 72 hours after vaccine:  headache/migraine, but no other symptoms. Migraines resolved once I took my Rx (Maxalt).  **I think it is important to note I tested positive on Oct 14th, 2020; my symptoms were mild/moderate (headaches, runny nose, very mild fever, lost of taste and smell, fatigue; all symptoms resolved after 10 days, with the exception of lost of taste and smell which I still struggle with).

I began taking Benedryl and continued to take Benedryl every 4-6 hours over approximately the next 48 hours. Also, I originally had no injection site reaction, however, on Jan 9th, my right arm began to itch. Upon assessment, I noted a 1.5&#34; diameter red, warm area where the vaccine had been administered. This lasted for three days, and now, January 12th it no longer itches, and looks more like a bullseye that is approximately 2.5&#34; in diameter around where the redness was. I have also noticed that since the vaccine I feel cloudy or like I have a constant mild headache.

                                                On the 1st day, I had a migraine. 2nd day (29th) fever, chills, nausea, vomiting - woke up with it and that lasted about four or five days And I had meds to treat it.. Went to work but had to leave work - acutely ill. When I went home, I had a rash across my abdomen. On the 30th I went to urgent care, I had a rash across my neck when I woke up. Rash kept spreading. They gave me a prescription for steroids and a cocktail of meds to reduce spread of rash. Watched me for 30 min to make sure I wasn&#39;t having airway restrictions and they sent me home. Had it for a week and a half. Went to PCP and came up with an action plan to get my next shot.

I got up tp get ready to go to work, I felt really  light headed while I was brushing my teeth but went in to work. I started felling shortened of breathe and achy. I started feeling  bad and told my Head Nurse and he took my BP and I have a fever. My heart beat was rapid. I went home, slept and had no appetite . The I ended up going to the Hospital  my chest was hurting bad in my lung area, everything about me just hurt I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  They did xray on my lungs, they were clear, my BP was still high, my heart rate had calmed down. They had me sit and relax. The next day I woke up and was ready to put my scrubs on, it was like nothing has ever happened to me. I felt worse with the vaccine then I did when I got the Covid, all I had with Covid headache.  Everything hit so rapid and fast after the shot.

                                                I received my second dose of the moderna vaccine on a Sunday at 10:30 am in my left deltoid.   Symptoms started with chills and swollen supraclavicular lymph nodes around 10:30 that night, and progressed to body aches,  joint pain, muscle pain,  and a low grade fever.   I was unable to sleep due to chills and pain.   The muscle pain would radiate down my arms and legs, and I would sometimes have a pinpoint sharp pain in the bottom of my left foot.  Symptoms persisted the next day, and also included extreme fatigue, nausea, and enlarged and painful axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  The  supraclavicular lymph nodes were large enough to visibly see.   A round rash/redness started around the injection site started on Monday as well.   This also occurred with the first vaccine, but is much larger this time.   Most symptoms had resolved as of Tuesday, except for fatigue and the rash which are still on going.

It took about an hour to stop shivering and feeling warm. the lower back pain got better the next day, but  I still have the headaches the comes and goes. Almost like foggy feeling.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0830. My arm felt sore during the day. In the evening (around 1700), I began to feel muscle aches and pain in my joints (wrists, knees, ankles). I also felt fatigue and brain fog. My injection site (L upper arm) was sore, felt hot to touch and was about 5/10 pain-wise.  I took Tylenol 1,000mg PO and rested for the next 24 hours. The muscle aches and joint pain resolved after 24 hours. However, up to 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt extreme fatigue and could not resume my regular level of activity. After 48 hours, I returned to regular activities.

                                                about 2 minutes after receiving the shot I felt like I was having an allergic reaction in my chest area. My lower esophagus got extremely tight and then it worked its way up to the back of my throat. It felt like there was a lump in the back of my throat, along with burning in my throat. This same reaction also occurs when I eat certain foods I&#39;m intolerant to. I felt very dizzy right after as well. After exactly one hour my throat symptoms went away but suffered from residual effects for the next few days.  The next day I couldn&#39;t lift my left arm(which went away 2 days later), I was out of breath with everything I did, dizzy, muscle cramps, chills, body aches(as though I had the flu) and had extreme fatigue. All of theses symptoms lasted for the next week almost two.

The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

                                                Felt a burning sensation in my hands right after getting the shot.  Went home,  took 2  Aleve and iced my arm for 5 minutes at a time on and off about 4 times.  Hours later,  about 8 pm I was laying down on the couch on my left side for at least 20 minutes.  When I was getting up my upper left arm was very numb and I had a strange sensation on my left side like my blood had pooled over there but it was very numb in the area.  I never have felt anything like that.  The sensation did go away over the course of a few minutes.  Soon after I was having shooting pain in my hands.  It felt like arthritis pain.  This did not last too long but came back here and there.  My lower back started hurting a little bit out of nowhere.  And then when I went to bed I started having random body aches all over.  Like brief shooting pain in different parts of my body.  I did have some dryness, weird sensation in my throat at times. The body aches kept me up until 2 or 3 am.  It was resolved by the time I woke.  I never felt that I had a temperature.  And I was not sick prior so I felt it was a cause and effect from the vaccine.  I took 2 Aleve and I went to work.  Temperature checked at work and I was 97.1,  normal.  Wore a mask all day,  social distanced at work and I had mentioned to my manager upon arrival that I had symptoms/reaction? after my shot.  I did still have some residual,  arthritis type pain in my hands during the day and more so when I got home.  I also felt fatigued when I got home from work but I was half awake most of the night before due to the body aches.  Felt pretty good,  normal on the second day after the vaccine.

                                                I was fine the day of the vaccination.  I started feeling bad overnight - got a headache and arm got sore.  When I woke up in the morning to get ready for work I felt very weak.  I walked into my bathroom and lost conciousness.  I woke up on the floor and had hit my forehead on the tile floor.  I was confused when I got up, and proceeded to get into the shower.  I then passed out again in the shower and hit the back of my head against the shower wall.  My husband found me as I woke up on the shower floor.  He called my doctor and took me to the emergency department on doctors advice.

My hand and wrist does have pain in them at times and does make this bothersome and at times difficult to use at my line of work for the developmentally disabled.  This is the arm that I was given the vaccination in.

I was told it looked like a herpetic keratis (HSV 1 virus) by both physicians. I have a left corneal transplant. I have never had an HSV virus affect my eye in the past. The last fever blister I had was &gt; 5 years ago.  Treated with maxitrol qid, Acyclovir five times a day, Cyclogel bid. Severe light sensitivity resolved after about 24 hours.  On f/u appointment on 1/26/2021 he said that the herpatic lesion was looking better. Eye pain resolved. I am continuing medication.

She had a nurse check her blood pressure and it was 101/65 and her heart rate was 138 bpm.  She felt presyncopal so she went to the ED for evaluation.  By the time she got to the ED, she felt her throat was scratchy, and when she would lie down flat she felt her throat was occluding.  She notes that she is s/p tonsillectomy in 12-2020, and considered whether that was playing a role in her symptoms, but she had not had any of those throat symptoms for 1 week prior to getting her COVID-19 vaccine.  In the ED, she was given IV medications and IV fluids.  ENT was consulted.  Her symptoms got better with medications, she is still experiencing some throat dryness but otherwise is feeling back to her usual self.  She never had any rash, flushing, itching.  She had a little tenderness at the injection site only.  She never had any difficulty breathing, lip/eye/tongue swelling, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, vomiting/diarrhea/abdominal pain.  She did have nausea when she felt vertigo.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine I began to feel light headed, dizzy and my heart rate was climbing. I wear an Apple Watch and notice my heart rate was steadily climbing. I asked the exit secretaries to be seen by a nurse and as they were getting a nurse my heart rate reached 169 and I was feeling faint and beginning to shake. When the nurse came she noticed how white my hands were and my breathing was becoming labored. The nurse called a code white and an ICU nurse and respiratory specialist arrived to assess me. I thought I would pass out and they had me lay on my back with legs up. They tested my blood sugar and were assessing my vitals. My breathing was fast but I was still able to breathe. My heart rate started to slow down but remained somewhat high. they helped me into a wheelchair and escorted me to the emergency department. I was assessed for cardiac concerns and labs were taken. After a couple of hours in the ED the dizziness started to subside but I had excessive thirst and dry mouth and slightly swollen tongue. I had feeling of butterflies in my stomach off an on. My heart rate stabilized and I was cleared to go home after four hours.

I took Motrin and even needed Vicodin for the pain.  No fever or nausea.  This is still better than getting COVID and I am just reporting for data purposes.  I was told that this symptom could occur after the second dose.  Some people are talking about blood type being a factor, I am not sure if that is true, but I am A&#43; if that helps. Vaccine on Friday, Saturday felt horrible and Sunday was back to normal.

I noticed a sensation of racing heat at times, dizziness occasionally, feeling of anxiety, slight headache on day 5. Day 5 also very dizzy.

                                                Within 5 minutes after shot my lips were feeling tingly. at 15 minutes out a co-worker sat by me and I told her about my lips and she commented that I had a large red mark/rash on my neck. I went to the nurse and she asked if I was nervous - which I was. She told me that I should take a Benadryl. I took a single Benadryl.  I went home and was still feeling the tingling sensation and had the rash which had spread onto my chest.  I took another Benadryl about one hour after the initial shot. This reduced the rash and tingling sensation. as it wore off about 4.5 hours later the rash, tingling lips and facial swelling started to appear. I took two more Benadryl and called the on call doctor at my physicians office.  He advised me to continue taking Benadryl until 48 hours after the vaccine, I did this every 4-5 hours including waking during the night to keep up on it. I was also taking Advil at this point to try to help with the swelling and a dull headache that had set in. I should note that I have never had any facial injections or anything like unto it. For 40 hours post vaccine I did this. After 48  hours the symptoms seemed to go away. I did start feeling a metallic taste in my mouth that night and the following night so I took a single Benadryl at bedtime those nights and that seemed to resolve it. I have had a slight cough and congestion on days 3-6 when I woke up in the morning, but that would resolve itself within an hour of being up. The doctor on call that I spoke with the first night did advise me to still get the second dose, but to take some Benadryl ahead of time and to make sure that the clinic has a current EpiPen on site.

                                                Received vaccine on 3/3/21 at 2:30pm. Waited for 20 minutes at pharmacy for allergic reaction. Given the all clear, so headed home. Around 5pm, I started noticing how extremely sore my left arm was, almost as if somebody had hit it with a baseball bat (no bruising, redness, etc., just VERY sore). I also started noticing numbness and tingling in my left arm that traveled down the outside of my arm into my left hand and into my left pinky finger.   As the evening progressed, I lost my appetite, developed a headache, felt extremely fatigued, was dizzy, had muscle and joint aches, had left kidney pain, and began to feel flushed and hot. I took my temperature and it showed I was running a low-grade fever of 98.7F (my normal temperature is anywhere between 96.9F and 97.1F). I went to bed around 9pm.  Around 3am (which is now 3/4/21), I woke up with nausea, and my left arm/hand/finger really experiencing numbness and tingling (it&#39;s as if that portion of my arm/hand/finger was semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was on the verge of throwing up. I broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed and went back to sleep.  Around 5am (still 3/4/21), I woke up again with nausea and my left arm/hand/finger still numb and tingling (semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was again on the verge of throwing up. I, again, broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed. I decided to take a Zofran around 6am for the nausea.  I slept from 8am-12pm on 3/4/21 due to the Zofran. When I woke up, I called the pharmacist at pharmacy to notify them of my symptoms. The pharmacist everything I experienced was normal and should go away in 2-3 days (if they didn&#39;t then contact my regular doctor), that I could take Tylenol for any pain, and I still needed to keep my follow-up appointment for the second shot.  The entire day on 3/4/21 from 12pm until I went to bed around 10pm, I still experienced an extremely sore arm, loss of appetite, slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, muscle and joint aches, left kidney pain, low-grade fever (for me), and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger.  I was able to sleep through the night, and woke up around 6am on 3/5/21. Currently, I am still experiencing an extremely sore arm, fatigue, and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger. I am EXTREMELY concerned about the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger as it does not seem to be getting better.

After another hour at 6:30 pm, I felt a strong headache coming on. Throughout the evening I was drowsy and went to bed early.  In the middle of night, I woke twice due to headaches.  This morning 1/8/2020, my headaches continued even after I took 1000mg of acetaminophen at 11:00am.  That was my first dose of any type of pain medication.  I thought the side effects would go away therefore I delayed taking any pain medication.  I usually do not have headaches and healthy.   My arm is very sore at the injection site as compared to when I received the flu shot in November.   It is almost 2:30pm almost 24 hrs from the injection and my headache continues.

ER doctor said it?s possibly cellulitis and she prescribed antibiotics

I began vomiting shortly thereafter and continued to vomit for several hours. It wasn&#39;t until late the evening after the vaccine that I was able to hold down solid food. The headache continued until the next day and I experienced extreme fatigue (Although that&#39;s likely due to the lack of sleep and vomiting for several hours).

The next day the arm was still very sore and I had very little energy and total body aches.  I self medicated with 600mg of Ibuprofin several times through out the day.  My injected arm was 4 degrees warmer on the surface than my non-injected arm; as measured with an infrared thermometer.   I felt like when I had actually had Covid 91 days prior.  The next day I was about half as bad as the day before, and I was able to return to work on Monday.  The injected arm remained sore for more than a week at the injection site.  I also experienced some swelling of lymph nodes under my arm.

That night I experienced chills, fever, body aches and felt terrible. My left arm was very sore.  The next day I experienced fatigue, body aches and headaches throughout the next few days.

                                                8 days after the vaccine, I developed a blotchy red rash that trailed down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was red, swollen and painful to touch. Mild itchiness noted on that arm. Otherwise, I was fine. Just seemed strange so long after the vaccination. It improved without intervention and was gone within 2-3 days. I did not seek professional help because I read that this reaction was noted with the Moderna vaccine and that it was just considered a mounting immune response and no cause for concern.  However, I still thought I should report it. I have since received the second dose of vaccine on 2/19/21. I had moderate side effects starting on 2/20/21 (lasting 15 hours) of fatigue, chills, body aches, joint pain, headache, generalized body swelling, swelling and pain at injection site and brain fog. I didn?t experience a rash (yet- the vaccine was only 3 days ago). Will update if that changes.

On 2/21 around 9:00am I had a fever of 101F and was very achy, tired and had a mild headache. At 7:00pm on 2/21 I had a fever of 101F and was still achy and had a headache. I took two regular strength Tylenol at 9:30pm on 2/21 and that took the edge off so I could sleep. I woke up on 2/22 feeling better but still had a sore neck and arm. The whole time I had a sore arm starting on 2/20 around 3pm.

                                                Mild dizziness started within 5 minutes. Within 20 minutes my tongue started to swell, but only the front to middle part, not the back part. I was still able to breathe. After 25 minutes, I was unable to stand and nearly passed out twice trying to get to some place safe.  I could not verbally communicate and was lacked strength to move. I started drinking as many fluids as possible with the assistance of family. Symptoms began to subside after 3 hrs. After 4 hrs, I regained strength and was not dizzy if I stayed in place. I continued to push fluids and rested. I needed to be careful not to drink anything too cold as i would develop the chills. The next day, there was no dizziness but I was very groggy. I continued to push fluids. I would develop a headache if I did not drink at 16 oz every hour. The following day, I was still groggy, but was functional and felt okay to drive.

                                                The day of vaccine, I felt a little tired. The next morning, I ended up have a lethargy reaction (9:00 am) - it was like I was a robot and I hd powered down. I couldn&#39;t sleep but I was sitting up and thought I was sleeping. I couldn&#39;t really talk. My co-workers were very concerned. Lasted a couple hours and I went home and I went to sleep and slept about 16 hours . I called off work the third day - I had slept so  much after that night before I had a  (first) gall bladder attack (in the middle of that 16 hours) it was very bad (the gall bladder attack). I had gall bladder attacks occur for the next few days. I ended up getting my gall bladder out last Friday - about a week ago. It was inflamed and full of pus. It was an emergent situation and I was hospitalized 18th and surgery on the February 19th. Lethargy eventually subsided (lasted a handful of hours)  and was then fatigued with no energy for about a week .

                                                On Jan 31 woke up feeling like everything was spinning. Then on Feb I only had it a little spinning on Feb 2 the spinning was so bad ended up er. Said they thought vertigo. That week pulse was going up and blood pressure spikes started. I also started to not see things as clear getting bad pressure in face and forehead. I then had ent do epley maneuver that helped with spinning. However feeling like I wanted to spin would still happen even though I wouldn?t spin. Headaches on and off everyday couldnt sleep right for weeks. Pulse and blood pressure still going up. Then I never had this anxiety that started. Heart doctor put me on a beta blocker that?s been helping. I am 8 weeks from first shot and still not myself. Been on beta blocker for a little over a week starting to feel better bc pressure and headaches are under control. I have been to neurologist also. No one can really explain. I did get the second dose bc doctor said to on Feb 24th. I was fine till I took the vaccine on Jan 27th

Day 2: residual headache (50%), tiredness, weakness, sweating if doing things, residual knee joint pain, sense of smell/taste returned and heightened. Day 3: residual headache (25%), still not 100%, residual knee joint pain. Day 4 (today):  residual knee joint pain (comes and goes). I realize that these are not symptoms of an allergic reaction, but severe side effects.

                                                Patient had chest pain post administration of vaccine.  Patient attributed this to heartburn after eating a large meal just before getting her vaccine (though she didn&#39;t typically get heartburn). Since the pain continued to persist her BP was taken and was 160/110.  Patient said it may also be nerves but she didn&#39;t feel particularly anxious.  She also stated she hadn&#39;t had her BP medication that morning.  Patient took a couple of Tums and her BP was rechecked a few times.  Each time the BP stayed above what the patient said was her normal even without BP medication.  Due to the persistence of her hypertension and chest discomfort she was taken to the ED to be evaluated.  Once patient was in ED she had an EKG, CBC with diff, CMP, and troponin.  Provider eventually ruled it as an anxiety reaction (not cardiac related).

I immediately took 100mg of Benadryl and went to hospital emergency room.  Approximately 30-40 minutes later symptoms started to lessen.  Once at the ER, at the same time symptoms began to resolve, I was given PO Solumedrol and Pepcid.  I was monitored and then discharged with RX for prednisone, and EPIPEN (to use if needed).  No other issues with allergic reaction.  Mild injection site soreness, mild body aches, 99.3 temp persist at 36 hours post injection.

                                                9th, in the late afternoon, I started feeling really cold and I started getting headache and a lot of arm pain. It hurt to reach out to grab steering wheel. I felt very tired. I checked my temperature - 100.5. I got really cold and shivering at about 6:00 pm and I could not warm up for about 2 hours. It went to 101.5. Horrible pounding headache and dizziness. I started having stomach issues and diarrhea but didn&#39;t vomit. That went through the night - I felt like I had the flu. Back of my  neck was really stiff and achy - from shoulders up to the back of my skull. I didn&#39;t sleep much. I woke up completely soaked in the morning. My fever had broken. SUnday, I felt a little better. Dull headache ( it came and went). My temperature would go up and down -96.8 - to 100.1-ish all day. When my temp went up I got a headache and fatigue and down my headache would be better. Rolling every four hours. Monday, I stayed at 99.2 to about 100.2. Stayed at that the whole day. I was really tired. I had trouble thinking and concentrating. My arm was feeling better by Monday. Monday afternoon, about 1:00 my fever went to 100.5 and I called the nurse then. She told me to call my doctor&#39;s office. They sent me to a call to a triage nurse and she advised me to get tested for COVID. So Tuesday morning,  the 12th,at 9:00 am - healthcare clinic - the results were negative for COVID. Tuesday, I was feeling a little better - fever stayed around 99.2 to just over 100 and the headache was dull. I wasn&#39;t quite as tired. Wednesday, I was feeling better - like I could go to work but I didn&#39;t because of my fever the day before. I went to work on Thursday or Friday. The whole next week then I was better and felt fine. I got the second dose February 1.

                                                Following the vaccine I was slightly dizzy, after 25 minutes my chest started to get tight, had difficulty breathing, racing heart rate, some constriction in the throat.  I was taken to the ER, used Proair inhaler on the way to ER to ease breathing,  O2 sat slightly decreased but returned to normal in the ER.  Due to difficulty breathing, I had some increased anxiety which lessened after breathing became easier.  Nebulizer treatment given in the ER.  Benadryl 25mg taken.  Rash on L arm and upper chest, burning and pain in L arm.  Benadryl taken for 2 days due to returning rash and burning in arm.  Nebulizer treatments every 4 hrs on the day of the vaccine due to continued tightness and difficultly breathing.  The following day I had fatigue, slight fever, pain of 7 out of 10 in L arm, headache, neck and muscle pain.  Followed up w/ primary care physician on 12/29/2020, he advised not to take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  L arm pain lessened to 4 out of 10 on 12/30/2020.  L arm pain dissipated on 12/31/2020, but headache, neck pain and fatigue continued through 1/1/2021

I was unable to sleep despite taking Advil 800mg and heat and ice. The next day 1/7 wasn?t any better. On 1/8 I woke up and noticed the left shoulder area was red and warm to the touch. A little over 2 inches in diameter. I went to my Dr office and they diagnosed cellulitis and prescribed Keflex 500mg  3 times a day. I just took the first dose on 1/8/2021 at 2:45pm.

                                                Two hours after the injection, I started to not feel &#34;right.&#34;  My head felt heavy, I was getting a little dizzy and all I wanted to do was to lie down.  By the third hour, my body completely shut down.  I was so tired I had no energy to move, to talk, and even breathing was difficult (not because I couldn&#39;t breathe, just that the effort was difficult).  I was dizzy, nauseous, and lost my appetite.  My temperature was elevated, 98.5, but no fever.  I slept for 5 hours as if in a coma.  Woke up to drink water, felt total-body aches, and slept the rest of the night again getting at least 12 more hours of sleep.  At some point during the night, I had chills so bad my body was shaking uncontrollably.  I had 2 layers of clothes and 3 layers of blankets and could not warm up.  Day #2 (today), I have a tremendous headache, dizzy, nauseous, my heart rate is abnormally fast and I am out of breath.  My resting heart rate is typically upper 50&#39;s and is currently averaging in the 70&#39;s, jumping into the 90&#39;s often.   Sitting up, my heart rate is between 80-100 (which is typically my rate when I exercise).  When I stand up or walk to the other room, my heart rate is around 115-120 (typical of when I am running/sprinting or participating in taxing exercise).  Along with this, I am out of breath as if I am exercising, although I am barely moving around. All I am doing is laying down, only getting up to go to the bathroom and my body feels like I ran a marathon.  Breathing is difficult even at rest.

Additionally, the area where the vaccine was administered (left upper arm) was tender to the touch and red. On the same day, at 5:00pm all symptoms were at an extreme level where I had to lie down to rest, however, the pain of the body aches, headache, and chills made it difficult to rest (sleep) On the morning of Wednesday, January 13 and throughout the day all symptoms were still at an extreme level making it difficult to function (unable to get out of bed, no appetite to eat due to the nausea,  unable to sleep due to the headache, extreme discomfort) these symptoms continued on this level throughout the morning, into the afternoon and into the evening On the morning of Thursday, January 14 all symptoms with the exception of the nausea and headache had subsided The headache and nausea subsided by 11am on Thursday, January 14. I am now feeling better and could eat and function.

The next morning I had a lot of swelling severe heat radiating from the injection site, severe redness and pain. this lasted until Saturday when it appeared to have ben gone, no more redness, nothing.  The following Tuesday morning  January 12th when I woke up I had a terrible headache, body aches sore throat, by noon, I had an itch on my arm where the vaccine was given and discovered severe swelling, itchiness, redness and extreme heat coming off the site all worse than the prior week. I went to urgent care that evening after work and was given prednisone, antibiotics and was told to also take Benadryl. The diagnosis was cellulitis and was also rapid tested for covid which was negative. Physician found me wheezing,  slightly enlarged lymp nodes, a stuffy nose and I was told to get retested if the symptoms don&#39;t improve. I have no headache today but am very groggy still and have a sore throat. The arm is still red, still warm and still has little blisters in the center which is new. I am taking meds as prescribed.

                                                My initial side effect on Monday 1/11/2021, was slight dizziness after about 5 minutes. I was not impaired, and it faded after about 10 more minutes. The next day, the arm that received the injection was very sore and achy.  It was difficult to get dressed, and the ache was located from my collar bone to my elbow of the injected arm. This ache lasted 3 days.  My range of motion has returned. On Wednesday (48 hours post injection) I began to develop an itchy rash on the insides of my arms in the soft tissue area.  I took two benadryl last night and applied benadry cream to the rash.  This morning, 1/15, the rash has spread down my arms onto the back of my hand, and onto my torso.  It is itchy.  Taking more benadryl, and I called my doctor.

                                                On 1/14/ 2021 @ aprox 6pm, the injection site suddenly began burning sensation and had a raised white ring around a red hot center. It began as the size of Suzanne b Anthony coin.  Over the course of a few hours the white rind turned I to a larger knot/lump the size of a silver dollar. I began feeling feverish and the entire arm ached. The itch was intense so I used topical anti itch cream in an attempt to subdue the sensation. It helped slightly. I also began oral antihistamines and a fever reducer , following protocol as if I had been stung by a bee/wasp and experience a similar reaction.  On 01/15/2021  in the am I decided to report my reaction via the V-safe app that was given in the pamphlet at the time of the drivethru clinic. It allowed me to set up my profile and make an initial report, however after an hour had passed my arm had continued to swell, itch, and become painful to use and I was unable to continue my daily activities. The swelling had a strange bruising appearance aprx 4inch in size  so I tried to report it to the app. At that point the app would not allow me to report and just kept sending sign in codes that would allow anything. Over the course of the next few days the app kept sending codes but would not allow for anymore updated reporting.  I decided to email our health department who had provided the drive thru vaccinations on 1/7/2021 and 1/8/2021. Thats was 1/14/2021. On 1/16/2021 a reply was finally received with only instructions to contact my person primary care physican. I do not have health care. health Department did send a link to this reporting form.  Today 1/20/2021 the redness and swelling have subsided leaving a faint 6inch discoloration under the skin. The shoulder joint and elbow joint ache dully and the bicep muscle spasms at times of use. Physically I feel better at the time of this statement. I did take a couple of pictures at the beginning of the reaction of the affected area/arm.  Others in our area on these same dates gave experienced delayed reactions to different degrees as well.

                                                Fatigue hit within a couple of hours; So tired and this was fall in to bed and be out. I slept for awhile - I rested all day the second day. I was getting dizzy and; muscle pain; a lot of joint pain (normally I&#39;m not in a lot of pain and never this tired). I needed a cane to walk I went to work on Wednesday and I had to leave early (11:30). Wed - horrible diarrhea Started getting a little confused and  still had dizziness and joint pain was bad. Couldn&#39;t take care of patients. Went to work on Thursday and I had to leave earlier yet that day - by 9:00 am - Started having chills  but didn&#39;t have fever and still had other symptoms and was getting confused.   Had an excruciating headaches and nausea (no diarrhea but extreme nausea) and that day started light and sound sensitivity - so bad. Was getting scared driving home - and had very slurred speech. Couldn&#39;t drive for a week after that(. My sister was on the phone with me helping me stay alert and drive safely on the way home from work on that Thursday.) Thursday when I got home. - had Telemed visit - Set up appt for a rapid COVID test - and a flu test so my sister drove me and I slept the whole way there. My sister said my speech was slurred; confused in my speech and I felt like that for three days. Both (Covid and flu) tests came back negative. Times when my sister couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying and I slept more than I was awake (Thursday - Saturday was like this). Took Imodium for diarrhea when I had that. For joint pain - I treated it by tramodal 50 mg and I can take it as needed and I usually don&#39;t need it but took it consistently during this time.  What scared me the most was I could feel my Hip Implant  - ball and socket joint from bone all the way to my femur( I had Right implant on Hip on May 2019) - which is healed completely but I felt it at this time. I still can&#39;t lay on my right side without pain - like a deep bone pain.  I was going to call my surgeon today.  January 4th visit with my Dr - for check-in - He gave me a clearance to go back to work on Wed the 6th. I work two days a week; I&#39;m on disability and so have been able to work since then. Right hip pain is still  a lot and bouts of dizziness and still have joint pain. Have to take a minute and a couple of breaths to stand up. Some days I do have to use may cane. Chills are gone.

Felt arm pain and swelling 1 hour after getting vaccinated on day 1 with slight nausea and uneasy feeling till about 5 hours after vaccination. That feeling and nausea stopped, followed by chills and tiredness by late evening on day 1. No medication taken.   On day 2 (1/19/2021) morning felt better with tiredness and chills resolved on its own. However, pain and swelling on right arm increased and persisted till day 3 and then started to reduce drastically from then on.  On day 4, 5, 6 &amp; 7 (1/21/2021- 1/24/2021) felt back to my normal self again. No arm pain. On the night of day 8 (1/25/2021), felt pain on right arm again 2 inches below the injection site. Day 9 (1/26/2021) morning, noticed red colored skin rash about 3 inches wide and 4 inches in length located 2 inches below injection site. Rash was painful and slightly itchy.  Today is day 10 (1/27/2021, and rash still persists.

                                                Just prior to 5P had left arm pain -that traveled to my hand. At 5PM driving and heart rate went 128 - most likely higher (registered on iwatch). This is abnormal for me as my heart rate is typically in high 40&#39;s (marathon runner).  Along with the rapid heart rate felt like throat was closing - like a reaction caused by an allergy.  The rate rate stayed like that for about a minute or two followed by severe chills (chills can be described like when a person comes out of the OR).  I felt like I was coming out of my skin and became dizzy. I became nervous and called 911.  In discussion with the 911 dispatch everything subsided and decided I would continue driving with an intent to going to Hospital.  About 10 minutes later, prior to getting onto I95 the same cycle with increased heart rate followed by chills occurred again for about the same timeframe.  I do not know how far apart the cycle was occurring other than I ended up calling 911 again and Ambulance was dispatched while I was on I95 and I had pulled over.  Approx arrival of ambulance was about 6P Once in the back of the ambulance, I showed no arrhythmia and heart rate was now in the 70&#39;s, however I was still having the chills.  Decided to drive home after waiting about 20 minutes in the back of ambulance with no further issues of the tachycardia. Once I was home I continued with chills and a high fever throughout the night.  The fever did not go away until about 48 hours. The chills went away by the following morning. Thursday and Friday have had chest tightness and the feeling of needing to take large breaths to expand chest.  Continue to have moderate headache.

                                                The vaccine was administered incorrectly.  The IM injection was given too high on the left arm.  The injection immediately caused significant pain in the left shoulder which worsened throughout the day and into the following day.  The significant pain in the left shoulder has persisted and is accompanied by decreased AROM, decreased strength, and sleep disruption.  Treated with Ibuprofen 800mg q8h and ice with minimal benefit.  Saw PCP on 01/29/2021 who recommended continuation of same and ordered a PT referral.

                                                Fatigue - I was unable to work that day. I was so tired. Pain - in my arm to the point that when I moved my arm I felt like I was going to pass out - it hurt that bad. I felt nauseous like I would vomit. I didn&#39;t vomit. Had a headache on day two (I have been having headaches since I had COVID in July 2020). I took Tylenol for that severe headache and that helped and it was just that one day that it was severe.  The worst, was my heart - increased heart rate - anything I did just was difficult on my heart. My heart - was having a hard time - standing, brushing my teeth - was exhausting for my body. That type of exhaustion went on for five days. I was able to feel better by day 11. But my heartrate is still poor. Depending upon what I did - 10 to 30 beats over my normal - just normal work. 40 beats over when I&#39;m attempting a more intense exercise. A slight jog puts my heartrate to 180. My heart rate still hasn&#39;t subsided yet - it is still above average above post COVID ( I had COVID in July of 2020). My heart rate was still at an elevated rate post COVID but worse after the vaccine. I have chest pressure now - like someone sitting on my chest - that started day two after the vaccine. Even when I&#39;m resting, I have chest pressure - it comes and goes and there seems to be no pattern as to why. Didn&#39;t have a doctor visit this second time yet. I treated with Tylenol for the pain at the injection site and for that headache and then I just rested my body.

At approximately 1:00 a.m. on 1/26/2021 I started waking up a lot and couldn&#39;t get comfortable.  I tossed and turned and body aches began and quickly worsened.  My knees, thigh bones, hips, pelvis, lower back, and shoulders all hurt like I had been beaten with a bat.  I took a sick day from work due to the severity of symptoms.  I had no fever, but did have hot flashes periodically throughout the day.  I was dizzy upon standing, had nasal congestion, and sever fatigue, and developed a moderately bad headache later that day.  I went to sleep at 10:30 p.m. on 1/26/2021 and slept through the night.  Upon waking on 1/27/2021, I felt much better.  I still have some lingering fatigue and stiffness but not enough to interfere with my normal routine.  I was vaccinated in my left arm and today, 1/27/2021 I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit that are quite sore.

                                                I got the vacine today.  Unfortunately I did have a reaction, and had to cancel my patient load at work for the day.  They said if you have food allergies you might have one, but I was willing to risk it.  They observed me for 30 min after.  After 15 min it felt like I was having a mild panick attack, but I?m used to that so I just breathed through it.  Coughed a few times.  After 30 min got up and was whoozy/dizzy, but shrugged it off, got my card and walked slowly to my car, drove 5 min home.  By then my hands were shaking hard.  It was like being shot with a crapload of adrenaline.  I called my sister and when I talked I started sobbing.  I don?t know, I just couldn?t stop.  But I knew it was just the adrenaline and if I could calm down, I?d get thru it.  She was awesome bc she kept her voice soft and low when she spoke, which helps.  After 3 hours it has calmed down and I?m just really cold and exhausted and nauseous and only a little shaky.  Being quiet and calm is helping.  Also sitting on a heating pad bc it?s 74 in my apartment and I?m freezing cold.  I?ll be ok by end of day.  I got the Moderna vacine and I?m still glad I did and thankful I could get it....but to those who are getting it...symptoms are that it feels like being shot full of adrenaline, you get a panic attack, but my O2 actually went up, not down.  Chest pain, panting, high anxiety, shaking, nausea, dizziness.

                                                Upon waking the next day I suddenly felt very ill, I was short of breath, had chills and was too weak to care for myself.  I had been diagnosed with COVID in June and was very ill with that.  This felt exactly like I did when I had COVID.   Throughout the day I ran a fever around 102.  My ability to think or care for myself was greatly impaired.  I continue to fight fatigue and brain fog.  I then developed several cold sores outside and in my mouth.  I continue to battle fatigue and weakness but am improving and now back to work.  I do not plan to get a second dose as I am afraid of a stronger reaction that would require emergency care.

Upon removing my bandaid it was apparent that the vaccine was injected just below my acromion.  I have a picture of the injection site.  My shoulder continued to ache (there was no aching in the muscles of my arm). I took Advil 600-80 mg tid and Tramadol 50 mg at night.  The pain woke me from sleep.  It was difficult to get dressed and undressed.  After 9 days of pain I finally took Prednisone 30 mg po.  This improved y pain by 30%.  It became clear that this is likely bursitis.

                                                I am an RN and was working a Covid 19 vaccine clinic for first responders. I took my own 1st administration of Moderna at approx 6:20 then went out to vaccinate/data entry. I noticed I was a little bit shaky and more jittery than normal but I attributed that to getting first vaccination clinic off the ground and problems we were having with computers and login. When I was leaving approx 2 hours later and all settled down I went to my car and noticed small area near front of tongue in R side. I also had small feelings of tingling or what felt like small electric current around edges of my tongue. My throat was sore but I had thought that was from talking to so many vaccinated first responders and having to talk over my n95 mask.  Upon getting home approx 12 minutes later I noticed my tongue had swollen. I was not having trouble breathing. Throat was red but no swelling noted. I took my Zyrtec early and then. 50 mg of Benadryl and it was relieved within 40 minutes. I did not need to seek any medical care and over the counter meds remedied the issue.

The patient&#39;s medical history included migraines and a hysterectomy. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included sumatriptan, naratriptan hydrochloride, and galconezumab.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A) in the left deltoid intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   A pharmacist called stating she received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 02 Jan 2021 at 9:45am in her left deltoid. Immediately after receiving the vaccine, she had facial flushing, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion and choking in the throat that lasted 20 minutes. After a few hours, she stated confusion would come and go, and she had no emotions. The next morning, the confusion was gone. On 03 Jan 2021, she reported having body aches and a fever of 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. She reported chills, body aches, and a lot of pain in the left arm. If she tried to move her left arm, the entire muscle in the left arm hurt.  Treatment for the events included acetaminophen and an antihistamine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was withdrawn.   The events, choking, flushing, vision blurred, were considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events, confusional state, emotional disorder, and dizziness, were considered resolved on 03 Jan 2021. The events, body aches, pyrexia, chills, and limb discomfort, were not considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 48 year old female patient with medical history of migraines, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Choking, non-serious unexpected events of Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, Confusional state, Emotional disorder, Pain, and Limb discomfort, and non-serious expected events of Pyrexia and Chills. The events of Choking, Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, and Confusional state occurred immediately after administration of their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A). The event of Emotional disorder occurred on the same day when the patient received mRNA-1273. The events of Pain, Pyrexia, Chills, and Limb discomfort occurred on the next day of mRNA-1273 administration. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

No fever.  My concern is today is TEN days after vaccine injection and my injection site has a round redness and hardness at the injection site. About 1 inch in diameter. It&#39;s itchy off and on but no pain. It&#39;s hard, red, round, and the skin of it is raised similar to like a hive. I don&#39;t know if this is normal.  Especially because it&#39;s 10 days out from initial injection. I&#39;m due back for 2nd injection on Feb 9th.

                                                I woke up around 12:30 in the morning on the 21st of January with a headache and I took 600mg Advil.  I went back to bed and was restless and still had the same pain, so I took 975mg Tylenol. I continued to feel poorly and pain was increasing, so I used Maxalt x 2 without any relief.  I became nauseated and diaphoretic with increasing pain in my head.  I woke my husband to take me to the ER for relief.  My pain was 8 and all vital signs normal.  1 liter of Saline, Toradol 30mg IV and Zofran got the headache to a 3. I did follow up with my doctor later that day for further eval.  I have not had a headache that bad in 17 years.

This became worse between 1/21/21 through 1/25/21 with intense itching, burning sensation, palms turning red, feeling &#34;lots of cuts&#34; through out my hand and developing small lumps through out my palms and in between my fingers.  This also spread to my feet but not as severe and not as long (a couple of days with intense itching and small lumps).

Prior to the seizure they said that she was &#34;feeling off&#34;, &#34;jittery&#34;, and &#34;misfiring&#34;.  The RN that notified me said that they were checking on her every hour and the last check in was at 1:00 PM. She went to check on her at 2:00 PM when she found her in the hallway very pale/gray, bradycardic, and hypotensive. The nurse said she appeared to be postictal and hallucinating. They immediately called 911 -and she was transferred to the hospital and to my knowledge she is still there. RN will keep me updated.

BP 167/78, o2 sats 100%. Tachycardia lasted about 10-15minutes and resolved to HR 88 and BP 138/78.  Still left with overall weakness, malaise, cold feeling. No other symptoms.  Released from the facility at 6:48am.  Drove 2 blocks to my husband&#39;s workplace (hospital). Had diarrhea x 2, dull diffuse headache, odd feeling and malaise that persisted. Sudden onset of terrible feeling, the need to get to the ER at 8:36am. Had a bathroom visit to urinate. By the time we got to the ER the intense malaise improved. I sat in the ER lobby not wanting to be admitted to the ER (didn&#39;t want to be having a vaccine reaction). I stayed in the ER lobby. Symptoms completely resolved at 9:45am. I stayed there for 30 more minutes to be sure and then drove home with no other symptoms but Left arm soreness. Tachycardia never returned after the first episode. No rash, no itching, no swelling, no dyspnea. Just felt toxic. Then it resolved completely at hour 4.

I felt a lot of pressure behind my nose, but not a stuffy nose. The woozy feeling also brought on some nausea. I felt like I couldn&#39;t focus, like I was in a daze or fog. This lasted throughout the following day. Left arm at sight of injection was sore starting 2 hours after shot, couldn&#39;t raise left arm x2 days. Still sore but manageable. I took a zofran for the nausea.

Arm soreness developed about 8 hours after vaccine, woke next morning with fever 100.9, severe body aches, headache, nausea, weakness and fatigue, decreased appetite.

Took Tylenol throughout the day for the the fever. I awoke 3:30 am today, 1/10/21 with fever 101.5, took more Tylenol, still headache and feel tongue twitchiness  however muscle aches, body aches, nausea, decreased appetite and fatigue have subsided. I took 600mg Advil around 9am today and have been gradually feeling much better as of now 1:30pm. As a side note, I did have COVID 19 illness mildly in March 2020.

                                                Got shot waited 15 minutes, walked to elevator, felt dizzy returned to vaccine admin area.  Headache, vitals checked and were okay.  Continued to feel weird rubbing chest and short of breath but no chest pain.  Decided to take her to the ED.  On the way she passed out and was not responsive still had a pulse.  In ED became responsive, reports numbness in both arms and short of breath.   Received Benadryl complete assessment, doesn&#39;t appear to be an acute allergic reaction.  ECG &amp; vitals were okay. Patient observed for 4 hours and seemed to improve so discharged.

Then on DAY 8, woke at 4:45 am with extreme itching, large 4X3inch red patch developed throughout the day at injection site.  Site warm to the touch.  No fever or other systemic reaction.  Possible racing heart but I am prone to heart palpitations and may have just been anxious about this unexpected side effect.    Significant irritation  lasted for 48 hours, mostly improved after 72 hours, resolving with Benadryl and ice packs to the site.

Then, 6 days after vaccination, area became hot, red, swollen, indurated and extremely pruritic, interfering with sleep, mobility and usual routine.  Affected area was approximately 15cm x 10 cm.  These symptoms remained until January 2, 2021.  On January 2, 2021, the redness and swelling dissipated except for the edges, where there remained a red, irregular ring marking the edge of the affected area.  Area continues to be pruritic. All visual abnormalities have resolved.

She developed redness in the upper chest. Immediately came back and arrived around 16:38. I saw patient around that time and she was breathing well, had a patent airway. Very anxious.

                                                At 2 a.m. on January 10th, I woke up with a high pitched ringing  sound in my head. The sound was constant and disrupts my sleep significantly. It is always present but not as noticeable during the day when there is noise in the surrounding area, however, my job requires a lot of report writing and for that I work in silence. Therefore, the ringing sound is very distracting and makes it hard to focus. I saw my general practitioner, on January 14th at 4:15 p.m.. She cleaned out my right ear and started me on a 6-day steroid. She did not clean out the left ear because it did not appear to have any wax buildup. I began taking the steroid on Saturday January 16th. The ringing is still there but it does seem to be more on my left side than my right now. I went to an ent specialist on January 19th who checked my hearing and said there was no hearing loss. Her recommendations were to call her in a week and if ringing doesn&#39;t go away, she will try another steroid. As of today, the ringing is still present and I have finished the course of steroid.

                                                After receiving COVID-19 Moderna vaccine dose 1 on 1/28/2021, came down with headache and soreness in left arm the next day. Throughout the night on Saturday, 1/31/2021 began having stiff neck and left side, including arm and leg, became weak with numbness throughout. The numbness was mostly felt in fingers and toes of left side. These symptoms continued and progressively became worse throughout the following week 1/31/2021-2/8/2021. In addition to the left side symptoms worsening, numbness and weakness developed in the right side fingers and toes. On 2/8/2021 numbness and weakness in left side became so bad that left leg was very heavy and dragging when trying to walk.  I was unable to work that day and was told to call Employee Health.  Employee Health directed me to go to the Emergency Room. While at the Emergency Room, I received lab tests, XRay, EKG, CT Scans, and MRI of neck. MRI was evaluated by Neuro/Orthopedic Surgeon who diagnosed me with Cord Compression Myelopathy and told me that I needed immediate urgent surgery. ER Doctor, Neuro/Orthopedic Surgeon and Hospitalist all felt that the COVID-19 vaccine could have caused the inflammatory immune response that led to further cord compression.  I had anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery on 2/11/2021. The hope of the ACDF surgery was to stop further progression of the symptoms of numbness and weakness, but was not guaranteed to restore normal function of the left side. I am currently still experiencing numbness and weakness in left side postoperatively.

                                                Neurological response/trigger  - severe leg pain and weakness in both legs. Extremely difficult to walk and not able to climb stairs.  Disrupted sleep (woke up in pain throughout the night). This lasted for a couple of weeks, the worst (debilitating) being 48 hours from initial onset.  I also had difficulty breathing and nausea about 15m after injection which lasted for about 24 hours, then subsided.   I contacted my neurologist, Dr., early next morning, and notified her of what happened and she advised that I increase the dosage of gabapentin until symptoms resolved. After 48 hours, I began to walk without experiencing so much pain and weakness, and it slowly subsided over the course of a couple of weeks. I still experience flares of pain in both of my legs periodically.

I had nausea, vomiting, fever of 103.2, had trouble breathing, felt like someone was sitting in the middle of my chest, left side of my body was numb, weakness, migraine headaches, and muscle aches in neck and shoulder.  I went to bed after I took Tylenol and nausea medicine. I woke up at 4 am the next morning and told my husband to get the girls (our daughters) up and that i needed to go to the hospital. When I got there they did a chest x-ray, blood work and gave me a breathing treatment. I was admitted to the hospital. While I was there they gave me IV fluids and medicine for headaches and nausea medicine. I was released about 2:30 in the afternoon on Feb 26th. I still have muscle aches  and head aches. I have noticed my memory is real short, I have trouble remembering things from yesterday.

I waited 30 min from vaccine time to make sure I was going to be ok. At 5:30 pm on 1/6/21 I noticed I stared itching my right arm around the inside of the elbow. I noticed my vision blurring and I had a sudden onset of a Horrific headache. By 6 pm I was itching very severely. It was as if I was clawing at my skin. I called one of the dr&#39;s I  work with and he called me in a medrol dose pack. I started the dose pack at 8:30 pm on the 6th. The headache continued, I tried motrin, fiorcet, and oxycodone with no relief. I still have the headache but it is not as intense as it was. I was up all night itching and dealing with the headache by the am , my jaw was  visibly swollen and it felt like I had been in a fight. I was not able to go to work on 1/7/21 and could only work 1/2 day on 1/8/21. the itching did not subside much till sat 1/9 but is coming back as I  taper down off the steroids. My last pill was this am. The jaw pain and swelling lasted till sat night and is subsiding daily. I may have to call my pcp and be seen this week.

(total of 20lbs). A few days after getting 1st dose the hot flashes have been relentless; Internal hot flashes literally every 5-10m, daily, consistently throughout the day, even as I fill out this report. Not sure if the dose has anything to do with this starting up again, but I wanted to report it just in case some others report it.  I do not take anything for the flashes. I just seek some form of air conditioning such as a fan. However, the flashes are very annoying as I even get them while sleeping and it interrupts my rest. No sweating though.

                                                I started having a sore arm the evening of 12/29/2021 - continued until am of 12/31/2021; and then I was fine until I had a vertigo episode on January 1 at 07:00 am. I didn&#39;t have cold symptoms but took a Mucinex - and the dizziness continued. Meclizine - my husband went and got it - one tablet and that helped. I was pretty fine the rest of the day. Woke up shortly after midnight - 12:30 am January 2 and I went to look at the clock and everything was spinning - severe episode of Vertigo -took more Meclizine and I propped my head up and went back to sleep eventually and went to Dr the next day - Urgent Care. I continued to take Meclizine every 12 hours; Dr Prescribed Flonaze - Dr saw some clear fluid in both of my ears but nothing that should be causing vertigo. She wanted me to follow up with other my Dr on Monday. January 4th. She checked (my family history has brain tumors) but nothing seemed to indicate that I would not need MRI; but was diagnosed with Vertigo that day. She recommended for me to see a physical therapist to move the crystals to see if they could move them if that was causing it and had two appts that week. But neither times were they able to recreate the Vertigo. At that time I was feeling better and I stopped taking Meclizine and I&#39;ve been fine ever since. Got second dose of the vaccine - two days ago -didn&#39;t feel well - felt under the weather but no vertigo.

                                                Almost passed out after injection. Had immediate disorientation, head pressure, ear ringing, and slight hearing loss. I stayed 1 hour after at facility . The next day disorientation was better. The head pressure was better after 2 weeks. The hearing loss has slightly improved. The ear ringing worsened significantly and is still going on now, 9 weeks later. It has improved some now after seeing an ENT ear specialist. I have been taking medicine to try to help the ear ringing for about 7 weeks. The severity of the ear ringing has gone from an 8 out of 10 in loudness to about a 2. It is not gone and may never go away.

                                                Approximately 28 hours after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced intense pain and immobility in my left arm.  I had soreness as one would expect after receiving the injection but this was different.  I took ibuprofen and went to bed. I awoke several times in the night after rolling over in bed with pain.  I awoke in the morning and could not move my arm. My husband had to assist me in dressing.   That day (two days following vaccine), I had myalgia, neck pain, mild headache, fatigue, and a low grade fever.   My arm continued to be very painful although no swelling or redness.  The following morning (three days following vaccine), although I still had pain and decreased mobility, it was improved.  I am filing this report on the evening of 1/8/2021. Although I am not back to baseline, I anticipate that I will be in the next few days.  I thought it was important to report this given the severity of my symptoms.

                                                I received the shot at 8:10 am and felt nothing.  As the morning progressed, I developed a sore arm, similar to a flut shot.  However, it was worse, and I also felt achy in my neck.  I drove home from work around noon, and I couldn&#39;t even use my arm on the steering wheel.  These symptoms continued and I finally took Tylenol in the middle of the afternoon, and evening going to bed.  I slept horribly and woke up feeling like a train wreck.  I took my temperature. It was 102!  I started taking the Tylenol again.  I couldn&#39;t even raise my arm, either. My arm didn&#39;t hurt if it was just still, but it would hurt if it was touched, and I could not raise it for 3 days.  Despite taking the Tylenol, I felt awful all day and really had to stay bedridden.  I was also very thirsty both the day of the vaccine and this second day.  Saturday morning I woke up feeling better, but as the day wore on, the aches and fever came back.  Sunday was the same as Saturday.  Monday was similar, but better overall.  Today is Tuesday.   My arm still feels a little weird and I cannot completely raise it. I did have the COVID-19 back in March and have antibodies, as far as I know as I have donated to Red Cross 4 times.

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving my injection on Thursday, I noticed my upper lip felt like it was swelling.  Over the next 30 minutes, I felt the same in my lower lip and cheeks.  I took 50 mg of Benadryl at that time.  I slept for nearly 20 hours after that.  On Friday, I experienced severe body aches from head to toe.  I felt somewhat better Saturday.  I woke up Sunday with nausea and dizziness that lasted all day and evening.  I woke up feeling better Monday morning but noticed 2 enlarged lymph nodes above my collar bone and pain from my R deltoid, across my shoulder and into my lower neck.  It is Tuesday and and the lymph nodes are painful to touch and I&#39;m experiencing 5/10 pain in my upper arm, shoulder R side and back of neck and above my R scapula.  I am considering calling my PCP.

I woke next morning to find my left arm at the injection site very swollen, hard, red, rashy, and extremely hot to the touch.  I advised with the nurses at work that morning, and I was told it was a common side affect, but I was still uneasy since I had no reaction until day 9.  I was prompted to call my doctor, which was out of the office, was advised to go to prompt care.  I was treated with a prescription of steriods and antibiotics.  Slept better that night, less hot, hard, rashy, and red next morning.  Still used ice packs during the work day.

After swelling went down I still have the red mark (size bigger than a quarter)  and until yesterday (12 days after shot) the area was still hot. For over a week I felt exhausted, dizzy and hard to focus, a lot due to I&#39;m sure anxiety because  I have had a very difficult time getting answers from anyone.

Kept up and got more pronounced throughout week and started feeling burning sensations in both arms through Feb 15th. Self referred to Neurology on Feb. 16th.  Feb 17th, began to feel worse, spreading to both legs feeling weak, burning sensation, fatigue, and began feeling VERY foggy brained.  Have been sleeping a lot, but legs and arms go from burning sensations, weakness, to cold sensations, and achy right leg thigh muscle, to this moment.  Brain fog and fatigue seem worst in morning.

                                                The patient had gone shopping in the store after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and then returned to the pharmacy after about 10 minutes saying she wasn&#39;t feeling well. She reported feeling hot, that her lips were tingling, and stating she just felt weird. I had her sit in the immunization booth so I could tend to her without and audience. I gave her 10 ml of Benadryl because she mentioned her lips were tingling. I broke one of the instant icepacks for her and had her place it on the back of her neck and put her head between her knees. She reported feeling that her face felt hot, so I broke two more icepacks and had her sit up right and place the ice packs on the front of her neck. I stayed with her in the booth and talked to her until she felt better. I set the timer on my phone for 15 minutes. After 10 minutes she said she was feeling better and wanted to move to the waiting area. She was fine after the full 15 minutes and left our store. I estimate she remained in the store for approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

She felt awful within an hour of vaccination and persisted with symptoms for 2.5 days.  She described it as being out of it, headache, fever, chills, profound body aches, weakness and dizziness with palpitations.  She could not get out of bed for a day.  She literally thought she was going to die given the severity of her weakness.  As quickly as the symptoms occurred, they left her on March 7th, 2021.  She went to work on March 8th and noted similar symptoms to prior ITP flares - petechiae on legs, gum bleeding, fatigue, mild headache.  She also noted dark urine but no frank blood.  Since being admitted and receiving steroids, she is feeling improved and petechiae are lessening.  She also noted mild mouth ulceration to lower lip along with oozing.

My chest felt heavy but I think that may have been slight anxiety because it was a scary feeling and I did not want to be the person who needed EMS assistance.  I rolled down my window, took off my mask and took deep breaths of fresh air.  I slowly started to feel better.  At 30 minutes I felt much better and after an hour I was back to my normal self.

Once in the observation area, cg became nauseous and raised her hand to report.  Cg was sitting in one of the back rows so observation RN came to her.  Observation RN was walking cg to lower level when she experienced syncope and fell forward down several steps and to the right hitting the front of her head and right shoulder on the wall.  Cg was unconscious for approximately 30-45 seconds.  Once alert, cg responded appropriately to questions, but slowly.  Vitals were 120/82 P 107 at 0915 and 150/84 P 96 at 0920.  Cg had 2 events of uncontrollable bilateral arm shaking lasting approximately 5-10 seconds.  Rapid Response Code was called and cg taken to ED at 0940.  C-collar and back board was used to transfer cg from floor to stretcher. Unknown at this time if caregiver was admitted.

                                                Day of Vaccine I had a low grade fever, Injection spot red with little dots, hot to the touch, headache, sleepiness. This went on for 3 days. On Jan. 1, 2021 I started to feel like I was just getting a cold.  Took some cold medicine for 3 days.  But since Jan. 1 all I want to do is SLEEP. I did not get out of bed for 3 days. I now  get up and do what I have to do, but then I have to go take a nap.  I sleep for about 2 to 3 hours then get up and do what I need to then back to bed.  All I want to do is SLEEP!!!  I have gone to see my Doctor and he is telling me that it has to do with the Vaccine. He could not find anything wrong with me.

                                                On 1/5/2021- Pt. noticed left eye lid was starting to swell in the corner of her eye at 1 pm. It then became bigger and started to shut her eye. Her right eye then started to swell around 2 pm and she began to have difficulty talking and swallowing. She was not short of breath but felt like her throat was tightening. She arrived to work at 2:50 pm and informed her boss who sent her to the employee health department. She reported having oral Benadryl and  was going to take that. Anesthesiology evaluated her, felt it was a progressive allergic reaction, and recommended evaluation at an urgent care or ED. She later developed hives, her lower lip became swollen.  She was later evaluated at Emergency Department. She will be able to provide you with information on the doctor, treatment. She was prescribed a course of prednisone and will have allergy testing scheduled. MD indicated uncertain if caused by vaccine.   She missed work on 1/6 due to the ongoing reaction which had improved.

A few days later I felt like I was getting a cold and very sleepy.  I took some cold meds for 3 days and cold symptoms went away.  The only thing that has not gone away is the sleepiness.  All I want to do is sleep and if I don&#39;t get any sleep I get a headache.  I do a few things when I get up then I have to go take a nap, get up do some more and go take a nap. and I can sleep all night long.

Temperature highs ranged from 100.8-101.4, and I felt as badly as when I had COVID-19 in March 2020. I was unable to go to work as scheduled on Friday 1/8 and Saturday 1/9. I am concerned about getting the 2ND DOSE as it has been stated that 2nd dose may create more severe symptoms than the first. PLEASE ADVISE. Also, is there a correlation between having had COVID-19 and having strong &#34;side effects&#34; to the vaccine? Please advise. Thank you!

Certain smells are terrible, some foods very off putting, unable to eat normal amounts of food without feeling like I am going to be sick.  Forgot to eat for 7 hours yesterday (NEVER in my history do I forget to eat).  I feel okay now but my stomach is not feeling normal and my eating habits are not normal yet.  So symptoms have been present from Tuesday to today, being Friday...they are improving but I am nervous about getting a second dose if more people generally have more severe responses with the second dose.  I forgot to list it earlier, I am not able to take calcium supplements. Anything over 50 mg of calcium on a regular basis makes me very sick and blood labs will like thst have been switched with someone else&#39;s.

I was also very tired with a bit of a headache. I teach school, and throughout the day I had very little energy and went to bed early that night. The next day (Wednesday) I felt the same, really wiped out, but also had some gastrointestinal issues and little appetite. Thursday I felt the same. Today is Friday, and I&#39;m still dragging a bit but my appetite is returning. I feel like I&#39;m getting back to normal.

She was tachycardic and hypertensive but was severely anxious as she has a lot going on in life right now and has been anxious all day. EMT offered to drive her to the hospital but she refused and thinks it is due to anxiety. Employee was told if she still feels heart rate and blood pressure are high later today she should call primary care doctor or go to hospital. She left after about 45 mins of being evaluated feeling better but still anxious. Heart rate 119 and blood pressure 150/90.

                                                this is a report of my personal experience I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine Wednesday January 20th at approximately 4:30pm Cox North. The injection was painful, the person administering the injection inserted the needle VERY slowly, and then pressed the plunger VERY slowly. However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt &#34;funny&#34; mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised &#34;bed rest and hydration&#34;) I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up. I was unable to remain upright, but could sit in a recliner at that time. I was unable to hold a bottle of water on my own until approximately 2pm. I had no headache, no fever, no nausea (after the initial 5am experience) but DID experience extreme muscle weakness until approximately 2pm Thursday January 21, 2021. (too weak to chew food) Friday January 22nd, I felt &#34;fine&#34;, but still mild tiredness. ( I was told by our office manager that I should fill out an RL to report my experience)

                                                The first injection I received was from an empty syringe, the healthcare worker told me she didn?t notice it was empty until after she gave it to me and said she would need to inject me again, which she did immediately after noticing the empty syringe. I immediately felt a burning sensation going down my arm but did not have any immediate pain. Approx. 3 1/2 - 4 hrs later, my muscle where I received the injection began feeling very sore. After several days, I used a lidocaine patch on my arm which eased the pain so it was tolerable. However, today is the 11th day of my pain and I have not been able to sleep through the night for the past 3 nights due to excruciating pain that wakes me up and I am unable to raise my arm. The pain and my range of motion for my arm has progressively gotten worse by the day with today being close to unbearable.

                                                It started with a fever of 99.8 (norm is 97.4). I had brain fog. really slow thoughts. I felt like my brain was in slow motion. Big time fatigue. I felt like I was carrying a truck. I also noticed with my MS I am wobbly but I can catch myself but I felt like it was getting much worse. I called my Dr. and she thinks that the vaccine caused a flare-up in my MS. She gave me a prednisone pack. the last dose of prednisone I took, I was still fatigued. I began using a walker because I couldn&#39;t walk safely. I noticed as I tried to get out of my car a few days later I was thrown backwards which caused me to land on my glasses which cut my face and resulted in stitches. I did test but my MS was not in an active flare but they said it could be in a flare because of the COVID vaccine. they couldn&#39;t give me medication because that medication causes heart spasms. I was denied by my insurance to go to rehab. I cant walk and I am currently in the hospital.

I told the nurse.  He asked me to lay down.  I did not get worse.  After 20 min or so I sat up and did not feel worse.  Just stable nausea and dizzy.  I asked if I could leave.  After verifying I had people at home I was allowed to go.  I felt exhausted and nauseous for the rest of the day.  I was confused the next morning about what day it was and had some hives at injection site.  I felt normal after figuring out what day it was.  I walked 8 miles and aside from the hives at the injection site was normal.  One week later I had headache, exhaustion and had an uncomfortable rash at the site.  The rash is still on my arm.    Should I get the second dose?

Rash went away.  SOB lasted off and on for several days. Heart rate was off when I was working out for a couple of weeks.  I work out  so we wear heart rate monitors.  Heart rate did not recover as quickly as normal during my workouts. Took a couple of weeks for this to get back to normal for me.  Just really felt &#34;off&#34; for awhile and not like myself.  Did not feel comfortable getting second shot because of the above symptoms.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Initial injection site symptoms (itching, redness, warmth, swelling, pain) were slowly dissipating.  Approaching 1 wk post injection, however, the itching increased and the next morning (1/5/21), a marked erythemal response began, which continues to advance, along with increased warmth. I&#39;ve also begun to experience temperature swings between hot/cold (as of 1/5/21).

                                                Resident had the COVID vaccine 12/30/2020. 12/31/20,  resident has been in bed all shift. Staff became concerned when resident was not easily aroused. Resident displayed signs of tremors, twitching, confusion, in and out of consciousness, low O2 sats, elevated pulse and fever, fatigue and weakness. Writer called NP. NP stated this is most likely a reaction d/t the COVID vaccine. She gave orders for Benadryl 25mg IM x1 now and Tylenol 1000 mg now. NP also stated resident will not be getting the second dose of vaccine. Will continue to monitor and update NP if worsening symptoms.   After receiving Benadryl and Tylenol at 145pm, resident began to appear as though she was feeling better and was talking to talk, fever had gone down. Tonight resident is not easily aroused, lethargic, continues to have tremors and twitches, almost appearing as convulsions. When asked if she knows where she is or what day it is, resident can properly answer. Resident denies SOB but staff has noted loud squeals while breathing. NP was updated and gave new orders to give Benadryl 25 mg IM x1 if needed and Ok to send resident to ED. Resident currently refuses to go to the hospital. Will continue to monitor. BP 152/112, P 116, T 99.1, O2 87-91. Resident&#39;s O2 at 1205am was 80% on 3LPM. Resident unable to be aroused from sleep by writer. NAR called to assist. NAR could not arouse resident. Writer and NAR attempted to reposition resident and resident&#39;s breathing became more labored. Resident turned back to previous position and writer called on call MD at approx. 1220am. MD returned call approx. 1235am with orders to send resident to ED. 911 called and ambulance arrived about 1245am. History of present condition given to EMTs and they stated resident would be going to Hospital. Writer has attempted to contact Hospital ED x3 but have been unable to get through. An EMT did just call to clarify when vaccine was given, what symptoms have been present and when they started. She said she has everything she should need and she will let Hospital ED staff know to call if they need anything else. Writer will again attempt to contact them though.  Resident&#39;s temp was 97.5 and BG 128. When EMTs arrived they got an O2 reading of 60%. Resident did open her eyes a couple times during transfer from bed to stretcher and while stretcher was going outside but no responses from resident were made.

All mild and expected as possible side effects.  No concerns.  Symptoms continued and by 1/5; all symptoms had move to severe level and are still occurring today 1/8.  Temperature spikes to 102.8; chills, severe headache especially in eye sockets, body aches, and heaviness in chest.  Could not work on 1/7 and only for a bit on 1/8 (working from home).  Became concerned and was flu and covid tested on 1/7;  both negative.  I was retested for Covid on 1/8 and still negative.  I am not sure if maybe I am sick with something else and this is coincidence or if I am just experiencing issues from the vaccine that are a little different from others?

                                                About 11 hours after the vaccination, Monday 01/04/2021, I started getting chills, headache, puking, then muscles aches. I notified my direct supervisor how I was feeling. I woke up on Tuesday morning with the sickness and I called off work. I got into contact with my Doctor, on Wednesday and had a tele-appointment. He gave me three medications, and currently it has lasted for six days, and I am going to try and get an appointment with the doctor on Monday 01/11/2021.

Usual &amp; expected solicited SEs: fatigue, soreness, feeling &#34;off,&#34; transient headache, chills sx Day 2- strong R arm pain, cannot lift R arm.  Metallic taste in mouth and tingling tongue persists.  Also same usual Sx as day 1 plus mild nausea.   Felt really crummy.   Day 3- Still moderately strong R arm pain, can only partially lift arm over head, cannot straighten over head.   Strong fatigue continues, mild nausea.   By this day I recall having some unusual Noc . calf cramping.   Sx certainly improved after 72 hrs but some did continue up to 7 days.   Cramping returned as did odd R ear/jaw/throat nerve pain.  Scratchy throat.  Fatigue persisted, gradually improved.  I believe the non-standard SEs may represent an allergic reaction.  I deem this mild to moderate, as I was unable to perform daily functions at times.  I would like to be able to talk to a professional as to whether a second dose is recommended in my situation.  I am concerned to know if previous allergic reactions suggest increase likelihood of future and possibly worsened reactions.  Note: I have been unable to access my Vsafe reports today to confirm exact time frame.  The above is to best of my recollection.

Left shoulder pain began around 4 pm the same day, unable to raise left upper extremity against gravity without severe shoulder pain.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol immediately after injection and 600 mg of Advil at 9 pm as well as used Ice to decrease swelling and pain.  The pain increased and I was unable to sleep at all secondary to pain.  The shoulder pain has continued and loss of active shoulder range is apparent.  I am stretching and taking NSAIDS as able for the pain.  I have been unable to sleep well since receiving the vaccine secondary to the pain.   Today is day 7 and I am slowly getting back some active range however I continue to increased shoulder and peri scapular pain that limits my ability at home and at work.

                                                within 30 seconds I had a cooling sensation rush across the tip of my tongue, then a sweet taste, then more identifiable as bubble gum flavored.  By 12:45 I noticed I was scratching several areas of my body. Arms, legs, chest, neck, back and scalp and kept clearing my throat.  I looked down at my arm and seen a red welt from my elbow to my wrist in my left arm and a fine red rash beneath skin on right arm.  I looked up at the pharmacist and he said at 12:40 he had already placed a call to have another pharmacist come to look me over.   I then noticed that my heart seemed to be racing and feeling winded.  I figured this was my anxiety and just tried to relax.  The second pharmacist arrived and we walked to the ER.  I was very winded. They took me to a room and checked stats.  after 3 attempts taking my BP and using two different cuffs, she said my BP was 190/90 where it is typically 120/70. I drank lots of water and they monitored me for almost an hour and gave me another Benadryl.  My BP came down to 180/82 , breathing was easier and itching was decreasing so I chose to return to my station and I took one more Benadryl.  The following day: woke up with head ache in rt eye and fuzzy vision all day, mild sore throat, mild body aches, queasy stomach, fatigue and runny nose.  Took a Pepcid for stomach, Tylenol/Advil duo for sore throat, headache/body aches, drank lots of water and rested.  Following day most symptoms resided, still  slight sore throat, rt eye blurred vision, coughing, sneezing and runny nose.  everyday since, symptoms continue to decrease.

                                                The patient received the vaccine at approximately 1:30. They were observed for the standard 15 minute wait time at which time they complained of some mild numbness to their arm. The patient felt well enough to return to work after the 15 minute observation time. They returned approximately 20 to 30 minutes later complaining of more numbness and some dizziness. She (the patient) was told to continue to monitor symptoms and alert anyone of worsening side effects or symptoms. The patient returned to the room again and was now complaining of nausea. She was offered Benadryl but patient refused stating &#34; I cant have Benadryl&#34; after multiple times of the pharmacist(s)  offering Benadryl. Patient stated they sometimes take Claritin so they were instructed to take it and lie down in an area where staff could monitor her. At about 3:30 another staff member came into the vaccination room and alerted the pharmacist they were having a hard time keeping to patient awake.  Upon arrival at the patient&#39;s side they were coughing and seemed to be in a state of drowsiness. They were linked to a vitals monitor by the staff. BP: 170/110 O2: 96-100% HR between 80 and 90.  Approximately 2 minutes after arrival at patient&#39;s side 911 was called. Pharmacist retrieved the Epi-Pen and was on standby if administration was needed.  The patient was moved to a chair and vomited multiple times over the course of a few minutes. The Patient was able to vocalize and stated they felt &#34;aweful&#34; and has some difficulty swallowing, and when asked if they were short of breath they stated &#34;a little.&#34; Over the next 5 minutes (approx.) the patient&#39;s BP went down to 152/90&#39;S and O2 saturation was holding at 97-100%. Epinephrine was not administered during this time as patient was breathing and did not appear to have hives. Emergency medical services arrived about 5 minutes but within 10 minutes after the call was placed. EMS then took over care  for the patient. EMS was told of condition and that epinephrine was not administered at this time. After patient assessment by EMS they also declined to use epinephrine. At around 3:40 the patient was transferred to a transport bed and was taken away by ambulance.

The following two days I felt nauseated, very fatigued, achy and interrupted sleep patterns - going to bed earlier than usual, waking up between 2-4am. 4 today after still fatigued aches. The 6th day I felt better with energy, then that evening came the headache and by the following morning (7th day) felt fatigued with chills. The head ache woke me up from sleep at 1 am that night and 3:45am the following night. By the Friday 1/15/21 I still had chills, broke out in a sweat walking throughout house, still tired but not as bad and the headache is gone. I felt so bad onvthe 14th I went and saw a Doctor who suggested I was having a severe reaction to the vaccin. He said my vitals were good, performed a covid test to rule out the possibility (turned out negative) and told me to rest. He also warned the 2nd dose could be worse reaction.

                                                a couple hours after the vaccine, I experienced a bit of rapid heart rate, which resolved after a few minutes. The following day around 3 pm I began to have chills and felt like I had the raid heart rate again.  By 5 pm I was beginning to feel really bad, I was freezing, chills and my heart rate was now extremely fast, I was having trouble speaking complete sentences, my husband drove me to the emergency department.  I had a very high heart rate and high fever, I was admitted and in the hospital until Sunday afternoon. The diagnosis was pneumonia,  I don&#39;t really believe this, as I felt fine and had  no symptoms prior to the onset of the fever.

                                                Left work early Friday (4pm) and went to bed. In bed for the following 5 days, including now. Muscle and bone aches through my spine and hips, nausea with some vomiting, chills, severe weakness, no recordable fever but felt feverish, skin hurt. Woke up Tuesday drenched in sweat but the bone pain had subsided. Still very weak, nauseous, continued in bed. Woke up today feeling on fire, eyes burning hot, skin no longer hurt but felt hot.  Injection site hurt through Sunday-no redness, no rash or swelling.  I took Tylenol and Advil throughout.  My previous trunk rash completely disappeared. I began taking the prednisone last night. 50mg BID. I have a 5 day supply.  Took a Covid test on Monday-results pending.  Tried to see my doctor today giving them the above information-there were no appts til Friday and I was referred to the ED.  I will not go to the ED where I could actually catch Covid. I was unable to get past phone triage with the doctors office.

About an hour later while watching TV, a hot flash/flush came over my head and upper torso. I noticed bright red checks and nose which resolved within a couple hours (without any intervention). Temp was elevated per touch, and clammy. Blood pressure was elevated for several days 160-180s/86-100. A small scar on my finger from cyst removal 7 wks prior became inflamed and red w/ burning/tingling for 3 days.   Anticipated SE did included head ache, sore arm, fatigue and sleepiness for 2.5 days. (previous vaccines only resulted in sore arm--all other SE above (esp becoming possessed with fury), were new experiences.

Today I feel better, first day I have not woken up with a headache. Have developed a slight headache not as bad.  Continue with the fatigue.  I would like to report this and have someone contact me. I do not know what to do about the second does! This has hit me so hard. Thank you!

                                                Office visit 1/26: The employee is having right-sided back pain radiating down to her knee since 1/19/2021. She relates this pain to a vaccine for Covid which she received on 1/12/2021.  She has a history of right-sided shoulder tendinitis after flu vaccine and so she refuses to get the vaccine in her deltoid muscle and usually gets vaccines in her right gluteal area.  She had the vaccine for Covid on 1/12/2021 in the right hip area a little bit higher than where she normally gets it.  She developed some redness to the injection site which subsided but soon afterwards began having right-sided sacral pain and then right-sided knee pain. The pain is described as a ache and burning.  She does not have numbness and tingling down her leg.  And she does not have any limitation in terms of flexion or extension of her back but she finds that she cannot lie on her back at night because it hurts.  She also has trouble getting out of a chair because of right knee pain. She was seen by the orthopedist,  he has ordered an EMG which came out negative, and ordered to take Naprosyn twice a day. Dx: Lumbosacral radiculopathy at L3. F/U on 1/28: At this time she still having some dull right-sided back pain and pain to her knee but it is tolerable. She has been able to rest over the course of this week as she has not gone to work. She feels at this time that she can manage her pain and is able to start working this weekend on 1/30/2021. We expect that the pain will gradually subside as the effect of the injection subsides as well.

                                                Within 6 hours of vaccination, intense pain in the right arm - could not lift it overhead without pain.  This continued - and got worse on Friday morning.  The Friday morning event is what I am reporting.  I got up to shower; put shampoo in my hair and then conditioner. My right arm was hurting so badly that I was having trouble rinsing my hair. Then I felt faint and nauseous. Got out of the shower and fell onto the bed in the bedroom. Woke my husband to tell him that I was feeling badly - faint and the whole room was spinning. Then I felt my airway closing. He went down to get my levalbuterol (rescue inhaler); took one puff and that opened my airways.  I was still weak and he had to help me get dressed.  (BTW- I&#39;m a competitive athlete/ swimmer.)  I held onto him going downstairs.  I was not hungry though did eat a bit.  I spent the day on the couch with the chills and the room spinning until early afternoon.  By Saturday I was starting to feel better.  The pain in my arm mostly subsided by Sunday and I went to swim practice.  It wiped me out for the entire day and I spent the rest of Sunday on the couch. It&#39;s now Monday morning. I am feeling a bit off but better.  I am concerned about getting the second shot.

                                                My left shoulder was moderately sore for about 3 days after the injection.  The soreness didn&#39;t interfere with activities but did interfere with  my sleep.  Other than that I had no immediate reaction.  However, early on day 7 (01/11), I developed itching at the injection site and as the day progressed I developed redness, irritation, hotness, and continued itching.  It began as a small area about the circumference of a golf ball and spread, over the course of the day, to about the size of a grapefruit.  The symptoms lasted about 2 days (01/11-12).  By the evening of day 9 (01/13), hives began to appear, mostly on my arms and legs, with minimal bumps also on my torso and neck.  I&#39;m submitting this report on the evening of day 10 and the hives are still present.  The hives itch and are easily irritated.

That night I had severe left arm soreness to the point where I needed a narcotic, I had some at home. The pain woke me up. The next day I was more tired and had a stomach ache and more fatigue, left arm sore took Tylenol, fluids and did not call my doctor. Went to bed with a narcotic. Sunday into Monday 1/9 -1/10 I had severe diarrhea and could not eat, sore throat, muscle aches, decreased left arm soreness.  Full relief by Thursday.

                                                One week following my 1st vaccination, on Monday January 11, I developed small red bumps at the injection site, which turned into one big, itchy welt by the end of that same day. I visited my PCP the next afternoon, on Tuesday, January 12th. He said it was not a systemic reaction but a localized reaction to the vaccine and prescribed a 5-day Medrol pack and Hydroxyzine. I was also experiencing episodes of anxiety beginning 2 days following my injection, on Wednesday, January 6 th. The redness is subsiding at this time - approximately 50% improvement; some itchiness persists if I don&#39;t take the hydroxyzine regularly (I don&#39;t because I have to work and it makes me very sleepy). Anxiety is improved, as well.

Arm was so painful unable to raise over my head. Also had severe lethargy, stuffy nose and complete malaise. I did not have a temperature but felt the body aches as if I had a temperature. Also became very tearful and I ended up napping multiple times during the day which are two things I NEVER do during the day.

I could not ambulate without looking down at the ground. This grew worse over the next few days. I was seen by a Neurologist on January 12, 2021 who based on my neurological exam ordered me an MRI of the brain with gadolinium. Dizziness persisted and I could not work for three days that week . After a two week period,  it became more intermittent in nature.

About 12 hours after the vaccine I spiked a fever and felt like I was hallucinating.  I was unable to check my temperature until 10:30 a.m. the next morning and it was 102.4.  I had a fever, body aches, and headache the entire following day. My fever broke to 99.0 around 6:00 p.m.  I also had severe pain at the injection site that started several hours after my injection and continued to get worse.  The pain was so bad it was too painful to move my arm.  Today is day two post-vaccine, I have no fever but feel very weak and lethargic.

                                                First three days was just muscle soreness and fatigue.  On day 4 I started having tight chest and SOB while snowshoeing, which I did not have the day before on same activity.  That night I woke up with SOB and tightness in my chest and severe pain in area of my heart.  I could not lay on my left side.  It seemed like I was having heart attack symptoms.  Barley slept but upon waking my heart rate was 94 and the pain remained in LT Axilla area.  Took it easy for day and that night again had trouble sleeping, SOB but not as bad.  Woke up with excrutiating pain radiating up the base of my RT skull.  Was concerned about blood clot potential??  Had SOB when walking up stairs.  My throat hurt when bending over, as if my esophagus was crushing.  Friends said my face looked puffy and I felt bloated.  Landed up reporting to ER at the Hospital on Monday, Feb. 1st as directed by my PCP.  Hospital was told I had just had 2nd dose of vaccine, but did not think it was related.  I will mention all tests below, but upon arriving home on Feb. 2nd, I discovered a rash breaking out on underside of my LT upper arm, LT inner thigh and LT lower leg.

                                                Arm turned red at injection site and hot. There was really no pain and went away within a couple of day but turned red again exactly a week later from injection date. This time it was hard, hot, red, itchy, and bigger. Dr treated it with clindamycin and dose pack of steroids. It got better after a few days. Next, I got a UTI and called my primary care physician. She ordered CIPRO and phenazopyridine. That got better but before CIPRO was finished, I got a crick in my neck that turned into excruciating pain in my neck and was unable to turn head from side to side. At the same time, my left foot became painful, red and swelled. I have been treated for arthritis in that foot 6 years ago with an injection. I have not had any problems with it since the injection.  Dr. treated my neck problem with Robaxin and a steroid dose pack. This seemed to help my foot too temporarily. Neck pain improved but not gone. It was excruciating pain up the back of my scalp at times. I can turn my head some now but it&#39;s not back normal. Can&#39;t turn it all the way.  Dr. did another injection in my foot but did not work this time. I got worse and I can no longer put any weight on that foot. I have not been able to work since January 20. Have had to apply for leave of absence and short-term disability

                                                On Tuesday went to work and at around 1:30 she told her boss that she was not feeling good.  Felt achy in her body, her arm was hurting and was not feeling like herself.  She went home, sat on the sofa and drank something and went to sleep and felt drained, and slept for 4 hours.  She then woke up with runny nose, low grade temp, and felt really weak.  The next day, 1/6/21 her body ached bad.  She slept a lot that day and drank a lot of water, didn&#39;t eat and just felt really sick.  Then on Saturday evening, she looked at her leg and felt cold chills and her leg was hot.  She looked at her leg and had an area that was like a red dot, and she then realized that her leg was about to be inflamed.  She went to bed, woke up and her entire leg was blotchy red, swollen and hot.  She then called her family and around 12:00 on Monday 1/11/21.  She went to the hospital, and they treated her like she had COVID, isolated her and was negative.  Sent her to vascular and did not have a blood clot in her leg, and told her she had an cellulitis flair, and she started being treated with IV antibiotics.  Was in the hospital for 5 days.  She was discharged and went home after infectious disease team told her to go home with a nurse on IV antibiotics.  She came home on 1/15/21, and was off the IV antibiotics on 1/22/21.   She has been home and unable to work.  She is going to therapy for her legs.  They changed her hypertension medications, and put back on her antibiotics last week as they told her that the swelling was not going down.  Her kidney function is low and told today, 2/9/21 that she is concerned about her kidney function.  She is to have more labs drawn on Monday, 2/15/21.

My speech was Ok, my BP was monitored and was  a little elevated, nurse thought I was a little anxious because of my symptoms, BP was checked again about 10 minutes later and it was normal, they listened to my lungs to-all seemed to be well, except for these changing sensations going up my face, and lip. I stayed for about 20 minutes more, and returned to my office. Throughout the day changing sensations/lip area-that evening, my family said my lower lip was  drooping slightly downward-it seemed a bit swollen as well.  I checked in with the Covid Vaccine Clinic Wed. 01/13/20 in the AM as asked, and let them know i was still having symptoms in my lips, and felt slightly swollen on the one side.   It is 1/13/2020 @ 8:45PM and my bottom lip still feels strange(fluttery/tinglingly-not quite numb in sensation/  my cheeks/chin have intermittent differences in sensation

Developed a delayed reaction to the vaccine 12 days after receiving  it.  Developed a rash that is approxiamently 3.5 inches wide by  5 inches in length.  It is dark in color and raised as well as itchy.  I am also experiencing tingling in my tongue and lips as well as feeling that my tongue is slightly swollen as well as my throat.   The rash is warm to the touch and slightly sensitive to touch as well, and is  giving off heat.  It has gotten slightly larger in the past 2 days.  I DO NOT have a fever. Monday evening started taking Allegra.  It helps to keep the reaction I am having in my mouth and the itchiness for about 12 hours

                                                I got my vaccine at 3pm, I felt fine the entire afternoon, somewhere around 6 r 7 pm my arm hurt it was sore. It was not red, it was not swollen, it was just sore. I decided to take a bath, and went to bed. Felt tired and my arm was sore but it was mild, around 8 or 9 o&#39;clock.  I went to bed at 8 or 9 o&#39;clock and woke up around 2 or 3 in the morning and arm was very sore, would call it moderate. I took 500 Tylenol and 200 ibuprofen together.  Throughout the night my head hurt and i tried to go back to sleep. at 5 in the morning my head was excruciating, I would it an 8. My arm was very sore, I would give it an 8. My body hurt really bad so i give that an 8. so I&#39;m thinking ok this is what you get when you get a vaccine so I went back to bed. from 5-8 am  tossed and turned. at 8 o&#39;clock i got up and was very wobbly and weak and had chills. I checked my temp and it was 101.5. I went down stairs but had to take one stairs at a time because I was so weak, I went to kitchen because I was so thirsty. I tried to fix some ice water and lemon but it spilled. Went back upstairs because I had so many chills. I called my job at the Clinic but all they had was a voicemail. My face hurts my jaw hurts and my neck on the side where they gave me the shot, my right side. I was trying to put something in my stomach but I could only eat a few sunflower seeds. My body head and arm hurts so bad, moving is excruciating. I felt great all week and yesterday.

                                                I started with a pain in the left arm similar to the aching I felt the day after my  vaccine.  It felt worse this morning, and I looked in  the mirror since it felt so hot and it is a very large oval- red outline rash.  Not raised,  just mostly red on the border and hot and angry .  Feels more painful inside , like &#34;sharp, and achy&#34; and a worse headache than the day after the shot .   The headache is progressively getting worse.  I have taken my migraine Rx- 1- Fioricet earlier so I could work, but it did not help.  My PCP suggested putting a  topical cortisone cream on the rash, I have not gotten that yet.  Perhaps unrelated, but for the record, this past Tuesday, 1/19/21, I had such bad vertigo that I could not even telework, and that&#39;s a 1st.

I was able to get up with help at 11:30 a.m. to use the restroom and straight back to bed. I did not wake up again till 10:00a.m. on the morning of 01/28/2021 I had slept for more than 36 hrs straight. I just could not wake up during this time my eyes were heavy and my body felt wiped out, very tired. I feel better today although I am extremley weak with little strength. It has been a horrible experience. I was afraid that I was not ever going to be able to wake up again.  What would cause my body to shut down like this????????  Wishing I did not get that second dose

                                                16 hours after vaccine administration I noticed  muscle aches. Over the next 4 hours the muscle aches worsened and I developed intense chills, headache, nasal congestion, joint pain and fatigue. I had one episode of dizziness associated with standing in the afternoon (approx. 25 hours post dose). My highest oral temperature recorded was 101.8 F. These symptoms continued until approx. 35 hours post vaccine. At that point the fever abated and the next day I felt somewhat better but was still achy, congested and significantly fatigued. On the third day after vaccination I felt much better.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   I had chills, low grade fever of 99.4 initially, fatigue, lightheaded and  felt like I was moving in slow motion.  As the evening progressed, I felt worse and worse, had no appetite, very slight nausea, but no vomiting. During the night, my fever went up.  I only checked it once and it was 100.1, but I was having severe chills, my knee joints were aching, as well as some of my fingers.  The next morning I had a headache, and was dizzy (which may have been from not eating the night before). The symptoms continued throughout the day, but were managed fairly well with Tylenol.  Additionally, my arm was extremely sore.  It hurt to move it in any way.  Even worse arm pain than with a Tetanus shot, which has always caused me a great deal of pain.  Thankfully the symptoms only lasted about 28 hours.

Returned to the site to be monitored by the doctor. Was advised to take a Benadryl (within 30 minutes of injection). The head issues continued in waves for about 2 hours. My throat felt tight, but never closed off. Once home I experienced a fever of 100 for approximately 2 hours. Remedied by acetaminophen.  Slept well and woke with no further symptoms except slight injection site soreness.

Outreached PCP and was advised that these events were side effects experienced by some after receiving vaccine.  Ibuprofin was recommended along with rest, fluids, eating small meals, monitoring of symptoms, and was advised by NP for my PCP that symptoms/side effects normally remedy  in 24 to 48 hours.  On the evening of the 48th hour, 1/8/21, after other symptoms had cleared, I began experiencing constant ringing in my left ear and some wobbliness, this continues today 1/11/21.  Called Urgent care and was advised there is nothing they can do for  such symptoms and was advised to continue to receive guidance from PCP.  Am currently awaiting call back from PCP.

When I awoke at 5:00 AM my head felt foggy, I had chills, and headache.  I took extra strength Tylenol at 6:00 AM with relief of headache, but returned to bed from 9:00 AM to noon due to fatigue, muscle aches and chills.  I have continued to have fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and chills throughout the day (1/14/21). I also developed a fever of 100.6 at 5:00 PM.  Second dose of tylenol has reduced my temp to 99.5, but I continue to feel fatigued with headache.  The current time is 6:15 PM on 1/14.

My hands and feet got tingly and then while I was on the phone my tongue and throat swelled and unable  to speak and started to cough. But couldn?t clear my throat . I was able to get enough oxygen. My husband drove my to ER and which time they took my straight back took my vitals and gave me Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroid injection and it worked! They observed me few hours and sent me home.  I was unable to sleep  last night and a hallucination that concerned my husband but otherwise  I?m just achy today, note I never had a fever.

                                                That evening my heart was pounding very hard throughout my entire body that&#39;s all I could hear laying down I thought that I was going to either have a heart attack or a stroke. I got up and took one of my blood pressure medications. It&#39;s slowed down but I was unable to sleep due to feeling jittery and my heart pounding hard. The next day I felt exhausted my stomach hurt. I have had a sore throat the worst being on the Thursday following. Today Friday things seem to be subsiding.  However my concern is not to get the second dose if I had such a bad reaction the first time I definitely will have a heart attack the second time.

She was feeling tired, slightly nauseous and very low energy. At about 4:50 PM that day, patient got up to walk to the pantry after eating some peanut butter toast. She suddenly stopped and shut her eyes and froze and then she began having a seizure (and she has never had a seizure before and seizures do not run in her family). After the shaking from the seizure ceased, her body tensed up and she fell flat backwards and she hit her head on the refrigerator. She then was going in and out of consciousness, she had a big laceration on her forehead and was bleeding rapidly. I, her daughter, witnessed this and then at 4:54 PM I called emergency services and paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Later that evening, the family was notified that the patient had bleeding in her brain, a concussion, a forehead laceration that received 15 stitches and a broken neck (C2 fracture). She was taken to the hospital that evening on February 8, 2021. Patuent experienced a second seizure while at the hospital during a CT scan. Patient later was able to come home February 11, 2021 in the afternoon. Patient now has to wear a neck brace for up to 12 weeks, cannot drive, cannot work for up to 12 weeks, and is still recovering cognitively from the concussion.

I told the nurses I didn&#39;t feel right, and I sat down for about 10 minutes and drank 3 glasses of water.  Initially I felt better, but then I felt weak and &#34;not right&#34;,  so I lay down on a cot for approximately 40 minutes.  My B/P was elevated (165/95), which is very high for me.  I did not have any trouble breathing.  I continued to drink water, and eventually my B/P lowered, and I felt better.  I took an antihistamine (10 mg Zyrtec) when I arrived home at 11:00 AM, and felt very tired until about 3:30 PM,  when I felt just about back to normal.  I was assessed by an ER physician at the clinic site.

                                                Severe pain, swelling in arm that kept me awake most of Friday night requiring Motrin x 2 doses and ice to area and still continued into Sunday. I had fever, headache, chills, muscle and joint pain, extreme fatigue and slept for hours all day Saturday, Sunday into Monday, which I called off work. I felt as if I had the virus all over again , except this time it felt much worse. I am worried to get the second vaccine as it states it is worse than the first. Would like and appreciate any feedback on this.

                                                First shot of Moderna vaccine.  Had the shot and waited around 35 minutes and I felt fine.  I left and was a few minutes down the street and my lips started going numb. I turned around and went back to the hospital where the shot was administered and they had me see the emergency room doctor.  My throat did not start closing, my lips just were numb.  I have had serious reactions before and they start with the lips usually so I was concerned.  My blood pressure was high as well as my pulse.  The doctor gave me prednisone and benadryl and I was feeling good after 15 minutes.  I was in the ER 45 minutes to an hour and then was released with a script to take prednisone and benadryl for the next 4 days.and to come back if I got worse.  I never got a rash or anything else, just the numb lips and increase in blood pressure.  I did have a bit of a headache as well.  I am at work now (the next day) and feeling fine.  I did speak to my doctor and she did advise me not to get the second shot in the vaccine series. .

                                                I had underlying body inflammation prior to getting vaccine, but otherwise no illnesses or issues.  Two days after vaccine I came down with a UTI.  Another 3 days after that my body went into an acute inflammatory response.  I had extremely pronounced pinkeye (first time ever) followed by acute gout flare-up (first time ever) followed by extreme edema in lower extremities (first time ever).  I&#39;m being treated with steroids, but these issues have yet to resolve.  I have not been able to work since Jan 4.  I can only stand for a few minutes and walk a short distance with the aid of crutches.  In all of my life, I have never had pinkeye or gout or edema, or a UTI for that matter.  I am a healthcare worker and I&#39;m needed back at my job asap.

                                                Patient felt unwell and had a fever on Wednesday (1/27) and went home early from work. On Thursday morning (1/28), she threw up once and then laid down to rest. Her son reported seeing her that morning with the episode of emesis prior to her getting on the couch. Son reports that when he came home at 5pm, she was asleep on the couch. Teenage daughter reports patient had been asleep on couch all day. Son tried to wake patient up and she was disoriented and lethargic.  Daughter (reporter) was contacted to come see patient and on arrival to house (5;45pm), noted patient was confused, lethargic, febrile (104), and hypoxic at 83% on room air with portable pulse oximeter. Patient was able to stand and ambulate to car with assistance and was driven to Emergency Department for evaluation.   At emergency department, patient was hypotensive 80/40s but was able to increase blood pressure with 3 L of normal saline to blood pressure of 90/50s. See all tests performed and results below.  Patient received antibiotics, anti-virals and tylenol for fever of 102.7 while in emergency department. She was admitted to ICU that evening at approximately 11pm and had a foley catheter placed overnight due to decreased urine output. patient continued to have low blood pressure through morning of 1/28 and was placed on levophed for blood pressure control at approx 10 am. Her blood pressures continued to improve through afternoon and levophed was titrated down and then discontinued around 4pm.  She continued to received antibiotics for 24 hours after initiation and continued acyclovir during course of hospitalization and is still receiving doses on 2/2. Patient&#39;s initial mental status was confused, lethargic, and unable to communicate. She was intermittently oriented to herself only and would not follow commands. She would localize painful stimuli. Her mental status began to improve on Saturday when she started to become more awake but was still unable to follow commands or communicate clearly. She was moved from ICU to IMCU (step down unit) on Saturday once mental status was improving and blood pressure was stabilized. Her mental status continued to improve from Saturday 1/ 30 to Tuesday 2/2 (current). She began to have diarrhea on Saturday afternoon that continued through Monday and occurred every 1-2 hours. She was unable to stand or move body on her own and had to be assisted by staff to be cleaned. She remained awake and alert and was able to get up and walk on Monday and began to eat. She continued acyclovir treatment pending HSV meningitis panel PCR results (still pending currently 2/2). Mental status not currently at baseline but continuing to improve. She is also still experiencing generalized weakness. Hospitalist team and infectious disease doctors report she should be discharged tomorrow (2/3).  No source for confusion and hypotension has been found at this time. Physician team think HSV is unlikely but awaiting final diagnosis until test is resulted.

                                                Severe dizziness (even with sitting and lifting head) associated with nausea, especially when I tried to move about and fetch supplies like water and ibuprofen, chills and shivers, trembly weakness, joint pain lasting 2days. Required ibuprofen every 4hours for 30hours and sporadically thereafter to manage symptoms. I was ready to call 911, but was able to reach friends as a safety check through the night and the next couple days. Very difficult to manage this living alone.

                                                One week later (on a Wednesday morning after receiving the vaccine the previous Wednesday afternoon) I had the onset of a headache, body aches, chills and extreme fatigue making it impossible to work. Slept most of the day.  Next couple days with less severe symptoms and mostly resolved this morning (Saturday) aside from some fatigue.  ALSO the site of the injection became red, tender, warm, swollen and slightly itchy with the onset of these symptoms after a milder injection reaction had resolved for several days.  This  makes me question if this is a late reaction to the vaccine and hence reportable as I have not read about this possibility

Then on Tuesday, 01/12/2021 I started with diarrhea at 11AM.  I called work and explained that it was a side effect of the Covid vaccine.  They still would not let me go to work even though I was covid negative.  I took 2 Imodium tablets. I will email you tomorrow, 1/13/2021 and continue to monitor.  Yes I am a RN.

                                                On 12/31 finished having dinner. Thought sudden slight shortness of breath may be do to appetizer type foods we had. Drank water to help subside it with little effect. Went outside into cold air. Still had some slight shortness of breath. At 8PM continued to my other daughters home( where I&#39;ve been going since pandemic) upon sitting there still felt slight shortness of breath but again manageable. We left at 11:30 as my breathing never really got better or worse. When I arrived home I Took my PROAIR-HFA inhaler that I use PRN. My symptoms resolved and went to bed. On Friday 1/1 I had again slight shortness of breath with no real excertion.  On 1/2 I went to work at Hospital in neurology dept. I was pushing collector up to SICU unit and then to M2 unit. On arrival to M2 I felt very winded and took my inhaler with results.  I then called my manager to make him aware that I was having dilemma do to fact that I didn&#39;t want to call Covid hot line as I felt symptoms were from vaccine not Covid!  I was put out of work by Covid hot line had test on 1/4 and negative results on 1/6. My symptoms seemed to subside on 1/6.

                                                1st dose December 23, 2020.  Arm pain, swelling, raised red 3 inch bump developed within 12 hours.  Subsided, and reoccurred about 10 days post vaccine.  10-14 days post vaccine I developed New onset forefoot weakness (foot drop) Right, new onset trigger finger Right middle finger, new onset bladder spasms with immediacy and incontinence - not bladder volume dependent, resurgence of body aches, new bilateral knee pain requiring two arm support for sit to stand,  Mental status changes including anxiety, paranoia, mania and depression (personality change!), motion induced nausea and dizziness, visual changes (blurry vision), New intensification of nocturnal muscles spasms - bilateral and progressive and intermittent headache up the Right neck to crown, New onset (01/14/21 - present) burning rubber scent when some food being cooked.  The muscle and joint pain were present with February illness, subsided by April, and came back with a vengeance within two weeks of the 1st injection.  I also lost three teeth (fracture vertically while flossing), thinned hair, and had intermittent dizziness during the initial illness in February.   February Initial loss of taste/smell included metallic taste with artificial flavors, rotten garbage - random, and ?iron taste with meats.  I can now taste some fruits but only get bitterness with other fruits and vegetables.  I had one sided facial paralysis after tooth extractions in September - resolved in 1 week.  I required dental implants to replace the fractured teeth.  I am a vaccinator, and have been administering our vaccines and swabbing for Covid testing since we reopened elective procedures.  I strongly encourage our staff to get the vaccines - and I am the one who gets the reaction.  The constellation of symptoms, temporal proximity to the vaccine with no intervening illness or injury, and commonality of some symptoms with my February illness have prompted further testing and evaluation for central nervous system insult.

During the night, early 01/28/2021, I got up and had horrible cold chills that actually hurt.  I have never felt anything like this terrible feeling.  I took Ibuprofen and drank lots of water and returned to bed.  I was drenched with sweat when I awoke for the day.  I felt fair the 28th when I went to work and by that afternoon, my temperature raised a degree up to 100.3 with feelings of general malaise.  I continued to take Ibuprofen.  I took Ibuprofen during the night on the 29th and again had broke a fever; the neck of my pajamas were soaked.  My left deltoid is still very painful as of the 29th as I type this.  Swollen, hard with red area in the center.

After about 2 minutes I began to drive away.  I then became to dizzy, I had to pull into the lot of a vacant store.  I was incapacitated with dizziness!  I notified my two daughters in case something worse happened.  The dizziness was so extreme.  Vertigo.  I laid my car seat back and opened my car windows and did some deep breathing.  Still too dizzy to drive back to the vaccination site.  I then ate a granola bar, hoping it might help.  It did.  After about 15 minutes the dizziness subsided and I was able to drive away.  It was quite severe and scary at the time.

                                                On or about 09:40-09:45 I felt a heaviness on the left side of my tongue and a general unwellness feeling, the heaviness persisted  and then as then somewhat of a continued presence that did not go away, later followed by a metallic taste in my mouth.  As I previously had a reaction to the first H1N1 vaccine years ago, I notified the person administering the vaccine before hand and also the nurse after the vaccine who was making her rounds.  I called her over to left her know I felt a little off/different, and described what I was feeling.  She escorted me to a private area where I was further assessed and given Benadryl 25mg po x 2.  The feeling never left my tongue and reportedly there was notation of questionable welts on the left side of my tongue. .I was able to speak clearly and swallow.  I was monitored and then discharged in the company of two of my colleagues (one an ICU nurse who works with me, and the other an ICU MD/anesthesiologist) who happened to be getting their vaccinations at the same time.  The tongue feeling did not leave me until late the next day and my lips felt a little off that night of the vaccine and the next day.  I continued to take the Tylenol and allegra as well as Benadryl.  By Friday night(1/8) I was feeling better, enough to work the weekend. Tylenol helped greatly for pain at injection site.  Today (1/12) I&#39;m feeling not my best and  tired like yesterday but I had a busy weekend at work (RN in the COVID ICU), some malaise and achy (maybe my fibromyalgia or the weather), minor headache and fatigued, had a minor sore throat this am that has resolved, and Tylenol has resolved the headache.  Not sure if this needed to be included but I thought I&#39;d mention it.

                                                Monday evening - Extreme pain in the arm where the injection was given. Swollen (like a baseball) and very red. I realize it would be sore; however, the pain radiated down the arm to the hand and upwards into my neck. A fever of 100 so I took tylenol.  Headache throughout the night and by morning my whole body hurt to the point I could not get out of bed.  Tuesday - I got up to go to the bathroom with help and lost consciousness. When checked at that time, I had a fever of 102, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms took place all day. I continued taking Tylenol for the pain. Not much sleep due to pain.  Wednesday - Some of the pain in the arm subsided; however, the spine pain was extreme. I struggled walking the pain severe. Throughout the day I was feeling a little better. Thursday - still body pain but tolerable.

After 20 min or longer the symptoms begin to dissipate. 1st event 1/8/21 in the evening. The following week another episode while driving home from work. During work 1/21/21 another episode took place and EKG done with negative result. That same evening during sleep another episode woke me up, although it was not as bad as the other ones and 20 minutes later i was able to go back to sleep.  As of today 1/25/20 no other episodes. I do take Famotidine daily and have been for several years due to acid reflux and heartburn, but never have I experienced chest pain.

It seems that I had a ?flare? or worsening in condition following the injection.  Arm hurt where vaccine given is also but that happens with most all vaccines.  That was not the reason I am writing this up.  Writing it up to the the inflamed state I was in.

                                                After receiving the injection I experienced slight soreness at the injection site, which was expected.  later that evening I experienced swelling in the left axilla lymph nodes. The swelling in that area was extreme on 01/20/2021 throughout the night and has continued until day of reporting on 01/27/2021. The pain and swelling involved the entire underarm and pain could be felt deep in the tissue. On pain scale of 1-10 with 10 as extreme, I would rate pain as a 9 on days 1-5. Pain has gradually diminished in severity on subsequent days and is a 2 today. Measures to reduce the pain included elevation of arm and shoulder during the night, discontinuation of deodorant during period of discomfort and application of warm and cold compresses to decrease pain and swelling.  Initially contemplated seeking emergency room evaluation and treatment for evaluation , but decided against because there is no way to remove the vaccine and treatment would probably include measures already implemented.

For the dizziness I had a banana and potato chips to stabilize the sugar in the blood and took about and hour nap.  Co-workers and Supervisor monitor me in case EMS needed to be call. For the pain in general I took 1 capsule Tylenol 500.  Nothing for the nausea and plenty of water to reduce swelling.

Pt was monitored for vaccine reaction with no known adverse reaction. Approximately  18 hours post-vaccine, she was found deceased in her sleep at 0540 on 2/20/21. Per circumstances/pt history, it is presumed that the patient aspirated while sleeping, perhaps secondary to a seizure. Coroner was notified and declined as coroner&#39;s case. VAERS notification being made due to pt death within 24 hours of receiving a vaccine.

MRI showed vasogenic and cytotoxic edema in posterior temporal, parietal and BL occipital and BL cerebellar hemisphere which can be seen with PRES. Patient required inpatient treatment for her elevated BP and neurological evaluation. Was started on Norvasc and Keppra due to concern for PRES.  Discharged with follow up in cancer center and with neurology.
