I didn&#39;t experience any diarrhea or vomiting that night.  The stomach cramps were enough to keep me up for most of the night, but not as bad as food poisoning.  The next morning when I got out of bed I immediately got sick and vomited.  I was very shaky and light headed.  These symptoms continued until about 7 pm on the 30th.

                                                About 1  hour after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19, I started feeling extreme pain in my left shoulder and arm, where the shot was administered. The pain continued to intensify throughout the day and night and was 10/10 on a pain scale. In addition, I began to lose my ability to lift my left arm or use it. It became so weak that I had to use my right hand/arm to pick up my left arm to move it. My left arm was &#39;hanging and drooping&#39; and my left shoulder was very  noticeably lower then my right shoulder. I called my primary care and employee health. My primary care doctor advised me to take advil and go to urgent care if the pain persisted and worsened. I could not sleep at all that evening of 12/29/20 because the pain was so intense and I had to keep picking my left arm up with my right arm to keep re-adjusting to try and get comfortable. The next morning I went to an orthopedic urgent care where I was diagnosed with nerve damage from the shot and prescribed Methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack. The doctor who saw me explained that he could not assess the extent of the damage at this time because my nerves were so agitated and inflamed. He scheduled a follow up visit with me for Thursday, January 7th and stated he will then proceed with an MRI and further investigation to assess the extent of the nerve damage.  During the days that followed my immunization, I was unable to do anything with my left arm and was dependent on my husband to help me get dressed, showered, household chores, etc. It is unknown at this time whether this will be temporary or permanent damage and disability.

                                                I got the shot, didn?t feel it at all so it went good. I went to the bathroom and went pee and got my arm back in my long sleeve shirt under my scrub top. I wasn?t anxious about getting the vaccine. Then I went to sit down and be monitored. After about another minute I felt very weird like a warm feeling going all over my body.  I started pulling my mask away from my face to get a deep breath. Then I broke out in a sweat from head to toe. I think I became pale (I apparently didn?t look good).  I started feeling more ?weird? as I had never felt this way before and I stood up to walk because the nurse there wanted me upstairs near the ED but I was weak so I sat down and had tunnel vision. After that it?s a bit of a blur. After I stopped sweating I got very cold and shaky but vitals were ok.  It scared me because I have never had a reaction before to a vaccine.

                                                1/5/2021 - Day 1:  R) deltoid pain at injection site around 1600, mild headache viewing around 2100 when going to bed. I took ibuprofen prophylactically to prevent pain getting worse.  1/6/2021- Day 2 around 00:00, I was woken up out of bed with severe body aches all over. Mostly to bilateral hip joints and lower. Arm pain and headache were barely noticeable d/t other pain. Pain radiated to arms down to both shins. It hurt to touch skin and took ibuprofen around 0130-0200. It was so bad I couldn&#39;t roll my body up without assistance and I&#39;d need to use restroom for almost 2 hours at this point. Had to call out of work because I knew this pain wouldn&#39;t go away in a few hours in addition to lack of sleep, I knew it&#39;d be better to rest with OTC, rest, And heating pad.  Later this day I was still feeling the same, went to store to get something for body aches. It wasn&#39;t until I was in this store, when my left femur bone hurt so bad I had to grab onto a shelf. I felt my bone was about to break - scary. (My1 st time experience the bone pain symptom) Later at home same day, spent an hour going back and forth to bathroom with large loose/water diarrhea. I slept most of the day, as I was too fatigued to do simple tasks. Went to bed around 21:00 after taking ibuprofen, laying on heated and covered in electric blanket.  1/7/2020 woke up at 05:50 to get ready for work and instantly felt the pain again and headache, I&#39;m usually not so tired after sleeping, so contributed that to same fatigue. Although is not pounding, still dull.  1/7/2021 0900 took my HCTZ, Propranolol, and Potassium. Today the pain is not as high, but better than yesterday. I expect to feel a lot better tomorrow to go into work.

Approximately 2 minutes after sitting down I felt a sensation that can be described as a wave through my body. It only lasted for 10 seconds; however, it was immediately followed by a rapid heartbeat. It almost felt as though I might pass out (I have never passed out before). I alerted a nurse, and she monitored me for the 15 minute duration. After about 2 minutes, I felt &#39;normal&#39; again.

It is painful, burns, stings and has a tingling type feeling. She has not changed medications, no new laundry soaps, she believes the only change has been the COVID vaccine. She also explained what she described as &#34;electricity&#34; the afternoon following the injection. She said the best way to describe it was the sensation as if she put her tongue on a battery however much more intense and throughout her whole body.  She has had extreme fatigue as well as body aches as well.

Within 24 hours of vaccination, she developed a headache that lasted approximately 1 week. Within 36 hours of vaccination, she developed an itchy rash that covered her trunk (abdomen and chest). Upon assessment of her injection site one  week after vaccination, it was extremely red with very defined borders of erythema.

The chills subsided on 1/4/21. The arm pain started to subside 1/6/21, to the point where it was just the area where the shot was administered, but still hasn&#39;t gone away. It still hurts to move that muscle. The pain is worst in the morning, but my arm will loosen up by the afternoon. The pain doesn&#39;t go away completely. It hurts to lift or push if that muscle is involved. I have not been able to sleep comfortably because if it. I have been taking advil and tylenol multiple times a day, as well as trying hot packs on my arm at night.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, January 4. I had a mildly sore arm for the first couple of days following the vaccine, but that was about it for side effects. I noticed my face was a little flushed when I was driving home afterward, but I chalked it up to being excited and nervous and wearing a face mask.  Seven days later, it started to feel itchy around my vaccination site (upper left arm). There has been some mild swelling around the site, in addition to being itchy. The area is also warmer than the rest of my arm or body. For one night, it was uncomfortable sleeping on my left side.  Starting on the 8th day after the vaccine, there is a small amount of redness just above the vaccine site, about an inch and a half wide, a little larger than a quarter.  Here are my doctor&#39;s notes, who I saw on January 12: Patient is a 40 y.o. female who presents for evaluation of rash/ possible injection reaction  involving the left upper arm. Rash started yesterday.. she noted slight swelling, warmth, and itching with pink erythema in a spot just above the area of her arm where she had her COVID injection 1 week ago. She received the Moderna vaccine.   Associated symptoms: no associated symptoms. Patient denies: fever, headache, arthralgia, abdominal pain, nausea, myalgia, decrease in energy level. She did not have significant pain at the time of the injection, and had a mild sore arm the following few days but no other symptoms after the shot. The warmth and swelling began just yesterday, almost a week later. She has reported this to the VARS website. She is employed by public health and is going to work at a covid vaccination site tonight, checking in people who are getting vaccines.  She has a h/o sensitive skin, but no h/o hives or urticaria, no previous injection reactions. She get racing heart from epinephrine but no other known allergies.  She denies dizziness, dyspnea, SOB, cough, or sensation of swelling in throat.  She has been using ibuprofen, cold compresses for sxs with some relief.  Assessment:  Probable injection site reaction, delayed reaction No strong evidence of cellulitis but we discussed signs and symptoms to be watchful for such as increased swelling and redness or tenderness of the overlying skin, fevers, chills, body aches.  Plan:  Medications: Benadryl 25 mg administered in clinic and discussed use of antihistamines to reduce injection site reaction. She can continue use of ibuprofen and cool compresses as well. Avoid over cooling of skin as this may also cause local reaction.  If pain, redness, or other sxs of concern progress she should follow up.  Verbal patient instruction given. Follow up: as needed.   If no further increase in sxs she should be able to receive her second vaccine but would premedicate with Benadryl to prevent local reaction again.

On Tuesday 1/12/21 my arm was hot and had developed a knot at the injection site and continued to itch and hurt, on Wednesday 01/13/21 when I woke up I had a red rash on top of all the other symptoms at the injection site. I have been very tired and had a headache since I got the vaccine. And over the last few days I have felt worse and my joints and muscle ache, I have been nauseas and mild chills with low grade fever.

Racing heart began within the 15 min waiting period but I interpreted as anxiety.  Other symptoms began roughly 3 hrs post-vaccination.  Remedy was to leave work and go home, lay down in bed, and wait.  After a few hours symptoms mostly resolved, but face still feels strange (slight numbness and slight tingling).

                                                I experienced an extreme head pain/headache that was located on the top of my head. This pain felt between a horrible migraine headache and as if I was hit by a baseball bat. The pain woke me out of my sleep and kept me awake for at least an hour&#43;. (approx 2:30am-4:00am). When I woke up a couple hours later the intensity had gone down and I went to work. As time passed, the pain/discomfort dulled and by midafternoon I was barely able to notice it (I had to focus on it).

                                                I received the vaccine on January 15, 2021 at 4:37 in the evening. Everything was good until about an hour after I got home, and I developed a headache and was very tired. Went to bed at my normal time which is 9o?clock, and slept all night. When I woke up the next morning which is January 15, 2021 my left arm was very sore and my headache was gone. Went to work at normal time, 7:00 am and began feeling very fatigued with muscle soreness and joint pain. Left work and came home and slept for two hours. Still experiencing aches and pains and fatigue. I do feel it necessary to report I have had a positive covid-19 result in April of 2020.

                                                This facility staff member received her first dose of the MODERNA COVID-19 vaccine (Lot037K20A/EXP 6/22/21) at clinic at approximately 9:15AM on 1/14/21. She initially answered &#34;no&#34; to any allergies on the VAR but revealed to the pharmacist reviewing the VAR that she had experienced an allergy to food and contrast dye that required an epi-pen and hospital attention. She did not offer additional details and explained that she had tolerated other shots (including the 2020 flu shot) without incident. I advised patient to remain for a 30 minute monitoring period post-vaccination due to history of allergic reaction. Patient presented with some anxiety before the shot and immediately started to complain of feeling &#34;sick&#34; and said she was having trouble breathing due to chest pressure. We advised patient to remove her mask and provided her with water and a trash can though no vomiting occurred. After 15-20 minutes, patient still complained of chest pressure and difficulty breathing. When asked if she was experiencing any itchiness or throat swelling, patient said she did feel some throat swelling so she was given 25MG of Benadryl. After an additional 15 minutes, patient&#39;s condition seemed unchanged (not worsening, not improving) so the facility&#39;s nursing team was called to evaluate patient. Patient said she was still experiencing difficulty breathing and throat swelling so nursing advised use of EPI-PEN and patient consented. I administered a dose of 0.3MG (LOT0FM4066/EXP 02/2022) to the right lateral thigh and nurse called for EMS. Immediately after injection, patient&#39;s eyes fluttered and she seemed to be on the verge of fainting. Nursing checked her oxygen saturation which was 100%. Patient reported no improvement after 5 minutes so another EPI-PEN 0.3MG was administered to the left lateral thigh. Nursing also gave the patient 81MG chewable aspirin due to the patient experiencing a stroke last month. EMS arrived a few minutes after the second EPI-PEN dose and patient was transported to the hospital for evaluation. Facility reported that patient went home that afternoon but did not provide details. Based on my assessment of patient&#39;s symptoms and behavior, I feel it is likely that she experienced either an acute panic attack or anaphylaxis due to vaccine administration. I called the patient today (the day after the incident) and she confirms that she received treatment for an anaphylactic reaction to the Moderna COVID shot and is doing well without any lasting adverse effects.

                                                Patient received her vaccine and was taken to the observation area to be observed for a 15-minute period. In the observation area, she immediately reported &#34;feeling funny&#34; and was noted to be &#34;sweaty&#34;. The advanced practice nurses and pharmacist were called for assistance immediately. She was placed on a stretcher, had her legs elevated, and was moved to a quieter area. She was responsive to commands and her vitals at this time were as follows: blood pressure 96/56 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 96%, and heart rate in mid 60s.  She did not require treatment and within several minutes of lying down on the stretcher felt better. She did not have any rashes or swelling, and she denied difficulty breathing. She was observed for about half an hour in this area and was also evaluated Emergency Medical Services who had been called. It was suggested that the patient should visit the Emergency Department for observation but she refused as she felt better and due to concerns of being exposed to Covid-19. We were able to walk with her escort her to the exit area at the end of the observation period.   We questioned her about potential allergies again and she denied a history of allergic reactions. The advanced practice nurse evaluating the patient suggested this episode was consistent with a vasovagal episode and that anxiety could have also played a role.

There was also a huge lump at the injection site that was really warm - way warmer than usual.  It lasted approx. 4 days.   I also had a 4 day migraine and was really sleepy.   Since the injection, I haven&#39;t slept through the night and I take a prescription sleeping medication.   I just dealt with all of it; it wasn&#39;t severe enough to warrant a Dr&#39;s office visit.

Began with an itchy arm at injection site and thought nothing of it b/c there were not marks. by the end of that Sunday my arm was red and warm with round spots. I took some Cetirizine and used a topical cortisone. Monday morning I woke to two lumps, itchiness, heat, tenderness, sore muscles, headache. I took some APAP and IBU and applied some more cortisone, went about my day with a two hour car ride and a walk. i was stiff through the day so i completed stretches several times through the day. When i got home that night most of my major joints hurt enough that I could not sleep through the night even with Naproxen 440 mg , APAP 1000 mg, Cetirizine 10 mg on board. My arm began to be more swollen, my nervous system began to be off. I had no appetite, was dizzy, felt shaky but when I held my arm and hand out, I did not shake. I have continued on a with Naproxen an d APAP since Tuesday after read not to take PO IBU if had Moderna vaccine.  I have not been able to complete house hold chores, missed three days of work, and been able to be with family.  As of today, January 22nd 2021, thirteen days post injection I still have fatigue, intermittent dizziness, loss of appetite, joint pain, headache with no relief with OTC&#39;s. The redness, swelling, heat have dissipated in left arm at and near injection site.

The pain was sufficient to disrupt sleep and normal activities. Ibuprofen brought partial relief at 800mg every six to eight hours. Site was not hot or red. The pain resolved to a mere nuisance in approximately 36 hours from start of symptoms. Swelling persists.

                                                Got my vaccine early morning.  Left arm where injection site given,  started to become really sore 30 minutes after injection.  I ate breakfast at around 9:30am. Went to my Doctor&#39;s appointment for 1030am, started having mild chills that would come and go. After Doctor&#39;s appointment,  around 1130-12pm, started to feel nauseous and loss of thirst and appetite.  I called the vaccine line at my job at around 2:59pm, but nurse just stated nothing to do right now, to call back following morning.  I knew things would get worse so I made the judgement call to call out this was close to 4pm. My chills started increasing,  despite not having any high temp was 98.9 f. Then around 5pm started having mild joint pain all over my body. Around 7pm joint pain got unbearable,  that I even started to shiver from more chills and pain.  I couldn&#39;t sleep,  except just laying and tossing and turning in bed, I also started having stomach cramping . Finally I fell asleep at around 12:30 midnight,  due to the pain. I finally woke up around 3:30am, took 2 Motrins. Then I woke up around 06:30am with body aches all over. Last night just took sips of ginger ale, didn&#39;t eat anything since 9:30am yesterday.  Finally had a small breakfast at around 7:30am with a glass of water. Still feel warm at times, with body aches, and nausea.  Will call vaccine line again today.

                                                &#34;I received my covid vaccine (Moderna) first dose on 1/7. I developed a fever up to 102F over the following few days and severe pain at the injection site. On about 1/18 my ankles started swelling and turning bright red. I took tylenol / motrin not knowing this could even be associated and thinking maybe I overworked my muscles running around at work that weekend. Over the following few days the reaction has become much more severe. I have nodules that are red, painful and flat all over the front of my legs and thighs and continued swelling and pain to my ankles and knees. This makes it difficult to walk. I followed up with a Dr. on health online as I am unable to drive myself to an appointment at an office at this time who diagosed me with Erythema Nodusum and started me on prednisone. I missed 2 days of work with the initial reaction to the vaccine and will miss 3 shifts this weekend as I cannot walk and need to start prednisone&#34;

                                                210 am woke up hot. Walked downstairs had ringing in my ear and saw stars, held the wall almost passed out. Began profusely sweating drenching my clothes. Nausea began. Went back upstairs sat on my bathroom floor due to nausea/ dry heave. All of a sudden SEVERE abdominal pain began 10/10. Cried for my husband. Dripping sweat gave me a cold rag and foam large diarrhea began. Still 10/10 pain in abdomen. Felt like my lower abdomen was getting ripped out.  About 45 minutes or so later still 10/10 wanted to go to ER. I could not stand. If I stood my legs and body felt like I wanted to curl in a ball on the floor. He called an ambulance. I was pale as a ghost, no fever, normal vital signs. Went into full reynauds flare from body stress. Ambulance was unable to get oxygen sat and glucose at the time due to flare. Arrived at the ER labs drawn. WBC 10.9 and Glucose 194. I am not or never have been diabetic. Vaccine related. Like a lightswitch all symptoms stopped except sweating hot and cold spells, sore arm and drowsiness. Discharged at 6am

                                                Symptoms began with severely sore muscles about 3-4 hours after the vaccine.  I&#39;m healthy and 40 years old and I was barely able to walk to my bed, like a 90 year old.  Followed by uncontrollable shaking for 1-2 hours (like extreme chills, though I wasn&#39;t cold and was covered in blankets).  Following that,  I was unable to walk or crawl and almost any movement of any part of my body was excruciating, including picking up a glass of water and even wiggling my toes.   It felt similar to the physical trauma of recovering from a car accident, when every muscle is tensed for impact. That severity decreased within 24 hours of the vaccine.  Muscle pain, extreme fatigue, headaches and dizziness have continued for 4&#43; days and are still present and prevented me from working and going about day-to-day activity.

I had to stay home from work on Friday 1-29-2021. I stayed on the couch all day was in and out of sleeping. I did not want anyone touching me the pain was horrible. Did not eat much 2 slices of toast and chicken noodle soup. I would take Advil or Tylenol for the pain and fever it would bring my fever back down which runs around 97 degrees but the medication did not help with the pain that I was experiencing. I went to bed at 9 Friday night and woke up at 4 am on Saturday 1-30-2021 and was feeling much better. It is now Tuesday 2-2-2021 I have continued to have a mild headache and I get sleepy all of a sudden once in a while. Other wise the pain is gone and I am able to raise my arm.

                                                About 24 hours after the vaccination (NYE), my last knee was achy, first I did not correlate it to the vaccine, but by the end of the day I could not walk. The next morning (01/01) my knee was better but my left hand was very stiff and painful and in the afternoon my left shoulder was very painful and I could not lift my arm. Next day (01/02) my shoulder was better but my left hand was swollen and very painful.  I went to bed with a swollen hand and next morning (01/03) the hand was a little better, maybe 80% better, but my right shoulder was ridiculously sore that I could not lift my arm and I could not go to work because of that. That day I also had stiffness on both hands. I went to bed that night and when I woke up my shoulders and knees were ok but my hands were still stiff and sore.  My feet were painful and bluish. Woke up the next day and my feet were fine but then my right hand was like 5 times its normal size, I could not open or close it, and that is when I ended up at the ER with lots of joint pain, my feet and knees were hurting again and I also had shortness of breath and   chest pains at that moment. They prescribed me prednisone for the swelling. The day after the ER my fingers were numb, I totally lost the feeling on my fingers until 01/28/2021.

Intense headache that lasted for over 1 week close to 2 weeks causing me to have to call off work. Large painful lump in left axilla that lasting 2 weeks. Axilla remains to be tender to touch. Also, had sweats after the chills subsided.   Thought that my blood pressure was elevated, but now I am relating the elevation  to the 1st injection. I have never had hypertension and after 1st dose blood pressure went as high as 160/104.

                                                Immediately after getting the 1st vaccine I had a very sore arm that lasted about 3 days. 2 days it was so sore that I took 800mg ibuprofen every 6 hours and put heat and ice on site for 20 min on 20 min off and alternating for 2 days while awake. No other symptoms.  For 2nd vaccine, the vaccine itself was extremely painful (burned and pain at site and tingled down to fingertips for a few hours. Applied pressure as I bled for 10 min after administration. Followed by ice off and on for 20 min for first 2 hours.  At 22 hours, I started to feel nauseated and lightheaded and had mental fogginess. The following morning, I awoke around 3am and was very ill with flu like symptoms. mild temperature of 99.8, chills, body aches, fatigue, rapid pulse, headache, sore throat, and mental fogginess. This lasted for approx. 36 hours. The worse symptoms were the headache, fatigue, and severe body aches that lasted for 72 hours after vaccine.

Experienced fatigue, chills, bodyaches on 1/6/21 and resolved by 1/7/21.  Rash below injection site appeared on 1/9/21 that was red, itchy, and inflamed with a palpable lump.  Rash slowly dissipated by 1/15/21.  On 1/16/21, experienced generalized pruritis  and tingling in hands, feet, and legs.  Over the course of the next 3 days, experienced tingling, numbness, burning, and pain in upper and lower extremities that interfered with sleep and daily function and was not resolved with self mediation with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine.  On 1/19/21, primary care provider was contacted.   PCP consulted allergist/immunologist who did not think symptoms were related to an allergic reaction to the vaccine. Referred to neurologist for further workup  and prescribed gapabentin for symptom control.   Neuropathy slowly resolved over the following week by around 1/25/21-1/27/21.

Next morning, I could not move left arm without severe pain. Took ibuprofen and 2 hours later, still had pain, but could somewhat move arm. Very tired/foggy. Took another dose of ibuprofen after lunch and Tylenol before bed. 2/10, continue to have left arm pain. Minimal increase in movement without the severe pain. My normal temp is 97.5. Woke up with 99.3 temp. I feel okay and not as tired. I just have severe left arm pain still.

Noticed slight lightheaded/faint feeling, stayed in bed due to known symptoms of first shot being pretty bad. Let Tylenol/ibuprofen cocktail wear off and did not take dose at scheduled interval (curious to see if symptoms would start) and that?s when chills, body aches started up. Took Tylenol/ibuprofen around 7pm and started to warm up after an hour or so. Went to bed and had night sweats/hot flash/fever. Arm was sore all day despite medication but not unbearable. Next day itching started. No other symptoms except sore arm. Continuing Tylenol/ibuprofen, seems to help keep symptoms away.

                                                Developed a mild headache about five hours after injection. That was not uncomfortable. I then developed intense chills that woke me up from sleep  14 hours after injection.   I had pain in injection site, fatigue, non-stop chills, body aches, joint pain, muscle pain, cough, and difficulty eating (but not nauseated) and slight fever - just less than 100 degrees the entire first night, next day and night from the second injection. The joint and muscle pain was so intense in my elbows and wrists, that it caused me to break down crying as I was trying to drive home from work at 9 AM the following day after injection. The joint/muscle pain persisted and I would get some shooting pains in my toes, feet, hands, and wrists on and off for roughly 12 hours the day after injection. Lymph nodes have also been swollen in my throat since 14 hours after injection.   Naproxen did not ease this pain or discomfort but it did keep a fever at bay (but still with chills nonetheless) so at the recommendation of my sister who&#39;s a doctor, she said I should take the max dose for short periods of time at 2 pills, 3x a day. After taking two at once, that made the chills go away but not the body aches.

Around hour 28 (3pm 2/10/21), I began feeling inebriated and then began acting as such. Like I had taken a substance or drank several alcoholic beverages. I had not and was 100% sober. Fell asleep at 7pm and slept until 6am only briefly waking a few times as I was warm &amp; a little sweaty. Head was completely clear by 11:30pm  but dizzy when I stood up. By 6am, only remaining symptom was dull headache.

It covers the entire top of my foot from my ankle down.  Onset was about 52 hours after vaccination and is still occurring now (24 hours from onset).    Note:  I had Covid at the end of October.  Also both Covid vaccinations gave me chills, fever, severe body aches, fatigue, and headache.  Not allowing me to work the next day.  Onset 8 hours after both vaccinations and resolving about 36 hours later.

                                                I received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 2/8/21 around 11:30 am in my right deltoid. That same evening I had only pain at the injection site. When I woke up the following morning on 2/9/21, I had complete body fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and a migraine headache. The following morning, on 2/10/21, when I woke up at 5:00 am for work I had a sore throat. The sore throat rapidly progressed from mild to moderate pain. My sore throat persisted and worsening into the following day. On 2/11/21 my sore throat was still progressively getting worse so I had a co-worker (my charge nurse) inspect my mouth/throat. She told me it was swollen, red and spots on my throat/top of mouth. I left work and went to Urgent Care (on 2/11/21). They ordered a rapid beta strep test which came back negative. After evaluation, the doctor mentioned my throat being red, swollen and lymph nodes enlarged. He thought it was viral versus and an upper respiratory infection. I was not prescribed any medication when I was discharged. Over the next 2 days my sore throat worsened to the point of having severe pain, difficulties swallowing and talking, grossly enlarged lymph nodes, swollen and red tonsils, spots on the top of my mouth and throat, and pain in my ears, stiff neck, constant headache. I returned to Urgent Care on 2/14/21 at 9:00 am. The doctor ordered another rapid beta strep test which came back negative again. Upon inspection, the doctor quickly diagnosed me with peritonsillar abscesses (left greater than right). I was prescribed an antibiotic and a steroid pack. I have an appointment to follow up with an ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat) doctor in one week to ensure it is healing. Prior to this second vaccine dose, I was completely healthy. No illness. Not around anyone who was likely sick. I have never had an issue or illness related to my tonsils in my entire life. Since tonsils are a part of our body&#39;s immune system, I believe the vaccine triggered this adverse reaction (peritonsillar abscesses) I experienced.

I went home and took benedryl and tylenol which I did until about Wed when I finally was able to get up and  got nausea meds.  By the Monday of the next week the dizziness and nausea returned.  I  visited my dr. on Tues who gave Zofran for the nausea and Meclozine for the dizzines and by Friday I felt a little better and was able to return to work.  I experienced the up and down feeling within my body for about 2 1/2 weeks before all symptoms finally resided.  My brain felt foggy thoughout the entire time as well

Unable to perform many work tasks/chores. These symptoms all subsided prior to the onset of the severe arm rash and swelling.

This is day 7 and I could barely put one foot in front other after work to get in bed but vomited first.  Today, odd pressure in my face developed and headache came and went and again, the fatigue, muscle and joint pain are intense.  I&#39;m still working, but have had to take time off, go in late, etc.  Brain fog is a thing.  It feels like it did when I &#34;didn&#39;t have COVID-19&#34; before but had every symptoms and I was going to die, but in waves.  I was dizzy, saw stars and black spots in my right eye today on and off and vision in my right eye honestly seems to have significantly decline.  I&#39;m really just concerned that it is day 7.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, I walked about 40-50 feet and experienced extreme dizziness and shortness of breath, and could not stand straight. I was able to stop my own fall due to a wall being next to me, and I stooped down close to the floor so as to prevent a fall. I then was able to walk about 20 feet to an office where I could sit and the dizziness continued. I noticed I was shaking and heartrate was elevated (that could have been the anxiety caused by the dizziness and being unable to walk straight). I sat for a total of 30 minutes before I walked to my office, which is a couple minute walk. I continued to have dizzy spells (not as severe) while sitting in my office for a few more hours. Also, I&#39;m having a hard time focusing, feel dazed.

                                                This may not be related but, the fatigue associated with my autoimmune disease had been well-controlled for 11 months through the oral biologic treatment Otezla. Three weeks post vaccination, I&#39;m starting to have the same fatigue as before when my autoimmune disease was untreated. I did experience some fatigue in the days following the second injection but, this is different. This is the debilitating fatigue that interferes with my daily life. I realize this may not be related but, I know people with autoimmune diseases were not part of clinical trials. I am just submitting my experience in case others report the same.

I got up to go to the bathroom and became extremely dizzy and my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest.  I was having difficulty breathing  and felt disorientated.  I crawled up the stairs and when I reached the top I stood up to walk and promptly fainted/passed out.  According to my husband I was out for roughly 30 seconds.  He described my body as completely tense (formed fists, shaking). I don&#39;t have any recollection of passing out.  When I came to I was overwhelmed with nausea and immediately vomited.  I was sweating profusely and struggling to breath.  After I vomited, within minutes (less than three) I felt fine.  My heart rate returned to normal and I wasn&#39;t dizzy or nauseous.

I saw my doctor and just thought I was having anxiety. Started medication for anxiety.  Three to four days post second shot, the side effects came back and are not yet resolved at this time. I am currently working with my doctor to determine what I need to do to lower my blood pressure and stop the anxiety attacks.

                                                About 20 hours after 1st dose, I started becoming very tired and spacey. 24 hours after dose, I felt very exhausted with a headache behind my eyes and pain in my neck and upper back (felt more skeletal than muscular). I fell asleep for 2 hours and woke up with a headache, some disorientation and feeling slightly nauseated. I had gotten plenty of good sleep the night before these symptoms and hadn&#39;t felt any immediate side-effects.  ...I don&#39;t feel that these are serious side-effects, but thought maybe the feedback would be worthwhile.

                                                I had gotten my second Covid shot in my left arm at 9:30 Saturday morning (2-20-2021), the shot was pretty high up to my shoulder.  By 1pm my arm was feeling sore just to lift it up. By 2pm the same day I could not move my left arm up at all. I couldn?t hold on to my steering wheel, I couldn?t pull my pants up from going to the bathroom, I couldn?t put my arm in my jacket. That night I couldn?t sleep at all. I was in so much pain. The next day I could 4 ibuprofen and 2 Tylenol pain would not go away. The pain was in my shoulder. For a couple days moving it anyway was nothing but extreme pain. I went to the Doctor March 2 and explained what I was feeling. The dr or the NP said to take ibuprofen and moist heat.  She said she could of hit a nerve but also could of been a side effect from the shot. So two weeks after the shot was given, my shoulder is still in pain, it?s a lot worse at night time and right when I wake up. I have been doing what my NP told me to do but no relief. She wants to me to call her in a couple weeks if it doesn?t improve. But recently, I?ve been feeling tingling going up to my neck on the left side and my fingers as well.

By 0230 on the morning of 03/02, I was vomiting, had chills, had hot flashes, had motion sickness with any movement.  At approximately 0230 I lost consciousness on the floor of my bathroom.  My husband, witnessed this event and indicated that he saw me stop breathing for a period of about 15 seconds.  I revived on my own, no intervention was needed.  More vomiting, chills, and hot flashes occurred after this event.  This event subsided at about 0300 hours and I was able to get some rest.  I have a skin rash that developed after the vaccine but is undocumented when it began.  It is still persisting today, one week after the vaccination.  The symptoms of this rash are it is widespread across my torso and it is itching and has small red dots.

I was unable to stand up, so I crawled to the bathroom.  I couldn&#39;t catch my breath and my heart was racing.  I wanted to get my phone off of the counter and call for help, but I was too confused and too dizzy to get it.  I felt like I couldn&#39;t control my body.  My left arm was hurting really bad during this.  I am not sure if I fell asleep or laid there awake, but I couldn&#39;t get myself up and start making sense of things until 4 am.  I did not have any other episodes similar to this, but I did feel really tired and weak for two days.  My arm hurt really bad around injection site and through my shoulder blade for 3 days.  My symptoms are all improving now.  Just a slightly sore arm.

About 10 hours later, I had body aches, chills and fever, which got so severe that I couldn&#39;t sleep. I had a fever that went up to 101 and then 102, so I took Aleve. Muscle aches became more tolerable. I felt fatigued for the next couple of days. I also had swollen lymph nodes under my armpit on day 2. A few days later, I started having joint pain in my left hand to where it hurts to use it and it is still happening now--6 weeks later. I have an appt with my doctor in a few weeks to have it checked.

I took two Benadryl at work and my sister had to pick me up from work and take me home.  Where I slept for quite some time.  When I woke up I was not as confused  but was still not all together.  The next day I was just tired and sore.

It was like a hyper, anxious, mania where I had trouble relaxing for about 2 days,  and after about 3 days I mentally felt normal and I could hear my normal cadence in my voice and knew that whatever I had been feeling those past days was strange and hyper.

Pain bad enough to wake me from sleep. Called my doctor, had televisit. She recommended antihistamine and ibuprofen. It resolved in another week or so. My doc counseled me that this reaction was not a reason not to get my next dose.

They monitored me there and I went home once I started feeling better with only slightly elevated pressure.  For about three weeks after the injection, I felt very lightheaded, nauseous, had a headache every day, felt confused and out of it.

                                                Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

                                                15 min after vaccine, I felt dizzy and lightheaded. 2 hours after vaccine, I felt nauseous and lost my appetite  The following morning I felt like I had been run over by a truck. I had a low grade fever of 99.9 that went up to 100.0 measured by ear thermometer  I had joint pain and over all muscle pain By the evening I had mucous in nose, post nasal drip and slight difficulty breathing. I took 2 advils which relieved the fever and body aches On Saturday and into Sunday, I continue to have an over arching malaise, I do not feel healthy.  I feel like my body is fighting something, I developed a slight sore throat and my head feels heavy and foggy. I&#39;ve continued to take advil.

                                                12/31/20 10:30a Vaccine given 10:48a Left the vaccine observation room 11:30a Started feeling warm like maybe my temp was increasing, face was red 12:00p had what felt like an adrenaline spike through my body became hot and jittery feeling. 12:30p The spikes started coming in waves, like a full body hot flash. Was very shaky and my tongue felt itchy and tight; not swollen just tight 12:40p made it home and took Benadryl 1:00p symptoms dissipated, ate a chicken salad sandwich thinking that would help with the jittery feeling. 1:25p The whole body flash came back and the tightness in the tongue increased. 1:27p Called employee health for information on this type of reaction. Wanted to call me an ambulance, I declined. After much discussion they suggested I come back to the vaccination observation room where they have epi, then decided it best that I go to Urgent Care. 1:40 on the way to town I told my husband to take me to the ED instead as my bottom lip felt swollen and tight, and my tongue felt thick like it was a bit swollen too. Was not short of breath, airway did not feel compromised, breathing normal, and heart rate normal. 3:01 Was given 40mg Methylpredinisone (solumedrol) &amp; 20mg famotidine (Pepcid) given- immediate improvement in tongue thickness and swollen lips. 440p 50mg Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 10mg loratadine (Claritin), &amp; 40mg prednisone given prior to discharge 8:20p Top lip started to swell just before my next dose of Benadryl 8:30p Took next dose of Benadryl, once it kicked in had quick resolution of lip swelling 9:00p joint pain started setting in, was uncomfortable but not too painful 1/121 Joint pain is still present but not uncomfortable. Injection arm a little sore, no redness or swelling at site of injection. Swelling of mouth, face and tongue is persistent as it nears the 4-hour mark for 50mg of Benadryl. 1p ate a couple of bites of chicken fried steak, face is increasing in redness and swelling, and mild tongue swelling. At max dose of Benadryl per box states to only take 6 doses in a 24 hour period. 2p Mouth and face swelling not relieved with Benadryl 2:52p checked into ED for 2nd time. 4:08 Given 10mg dexamethasone (decadron), 20mg famotidine (Pepcid), 10mg montelukast (singular) Swelling improved. 5:54p Potassium low on lab work given 40 mEq of potassium chloride 6:00p discharge with scripts for famotidine, epi pen, montelukast 7:00p taken 25mg of Benadryl 8:20p lips feel mildly swollen again. 8:45p next dose of 25mg Benadryl. Did not have complete resolution of swelling but did improve. Mild hives, swelling of hands and feet. 1/2/21 All joint pain is gone, and injection site pain is only noticeable if someone bumps into my arm. 6a 25mg Benadryl &amp; Pepcid 10a 25mg Benadryl 2p 25mg of Benadryl 3:30pm felt fine all day with only mild swelling and redness to hands, ate chicken nachos. Face became very hot (like my face was too close to the oven when I open it), redness from eyes down, lips swollen, mild itchiness too the tongue but nothing too concerning. 4p 25mg Benadryl I strongly believe the exacerbating factor is eating as all times the symptoms increased in intensity I had just eaten. After discussion with Dr. will be cutting out chicken (chicken was eaten before all 3 instances) and all other meats until complete resolution of symptoms and will avoid any inflammatory foods such as nuts, berries and shellfish. 7p 25mg Benadryl &amp; Claritin taken 7:30p ate a banana, no reaction 8p Singular taken 9:30p put Vaseline on my lips, face &amp; ears flamed hot and swelling and redness followed. 9:45p took 25mg Benadryl 10:25p tongue thick feeling 11p took 25mg Benadryl tongue still feels thick 1/3/21 Fevers 101.6 and chills started in the night Face and lips are permanently swollen and red despite all the meds I?m taking.Lymph nodes are all swollen. I?m too afraid to eat for fear of more swelling while my face is already so swollen.

                                                I received the injection around 2:15 pm.  There were no immediate effects. By late afternoon/early evening, my arm was a bit sore and later started to feel warm near the injection site.  However, I otherwise felt fine.  At 9 pm, I suddenly became very dizzy and passed out for several minutes. When I regained consciousness, I felt a little short of breath, which resolved within 20 minutes or so. However, I was also extremely nauseous, which got worse any time I tried to move. This continued for several hours.  I also alternated between being very warm and chills during this time - it was like waves of heat. I did not have a fever. Later, my head began to hurt and I took tylenol to help with that. I also had diarrhea. These symptoms began to gradually lessen after a couple of hours and I was able to fall asleep around 12:30 pm. I woke up hot and sweaty several times throughout the night. The following day, 1/6, I was very tired and had a headache and could not eat much, but otherwise felt much better.

I had COVID-19 disease in September, so I was expecting to have a robust response to the vaccine. I received my Moderna vaccine on 12/29. I developed fever, shaking chills, and terrible body aches about 13 hours after the dose. I felt a bit better in the morning, so I went to work as usual but was still sore with body aches. I developed shaking chills, nausea, and worsening aches at lunch time and left work early because the nausea and chills were so significant. I slept the remainder of the day and by the morning of 12/31 felt well again. My symptoms probably lasted around 24-30 hours total. I did miss a half day of work but otherwise had no significant effects.

                                                The first day all I had was some soreness and by Wednesday it had faded.  Thursday night 1/7 I started getting chills off and on. I felt like I couldn?t get warm.  No fever.  Took 800 mg of Ibuprofen l, went to bed.   Still felt like I couldn?t get warm.   At about 2:00 am I suddenly awoke to severe nausea and thought I was going to vomit, but it didn?t come up.  Then, I felt like I was going to have diarrhea.  No BM.  Went back to bed eventually and continued to have chills and hot sweats back and forth. Nausea and stomach turning feeling  off and on.  No fever.  Normal temperature.  1/8 stayed home from work due to nausea.  Off and on during the day today and some light chills about 5 times so far.  Some headache and possible shoulder stiffness.

                                                I had my first COVID 19 Moderna vaccine Lot: 025J20-2A at hospital. Within about 60 seconds of receiving it, my heart started pounding hard and rapidly and I let a nurse know. She took my vitals and my heart rate was very high, as was my blood pressure. My O2 was fine. I had some tightness and heaviness I my chest. I felt flush in my cheeks, but did not have hives. The nurse said my color was very pale. I was warm, given an ice pack, and then a bit later cold. At one point they wanted me to go to the Emergency Department, which I refused (perhaps stupidly). I&#39;m not sure I was thinking clearly. I was trying very hard to stay calm and relaxed. My blood pressure was very elevated for about an hour and a half. They finally let me go home when I was 140/95 (my usual is 110 over 70 ish). I had some tongue tingling at home, very briefly.

My mom was on the phone with me and stated I didn?t quite know what I was saying to her and she became worried.  The RN came by asking how I felt and I told her I was jittery and decided to wait at the site a few more minutes.  The sensation passed after about 3-4 minutes and then I felt ok.  I drove home and showered.  The rest of the night I would get random bouts of tachycardia and felt overall not well.  Also a small amount of chest tightness.  I also noticed things such as climbing by stairs cause me to become winded very fast and my HR would elevate rapidly.  Today I woke up and am feeling almost normal. HR has not been elevated but when I ate I did notice a small amount of lightheadedness.

                                                A day after the shot I was in the shower and started experiencing exhaustion and shortness of breath. I also had tachycardia. I proceeded not to feel well they?re very next day. Then on Friday I was dizzy and a coworker said that I was flushed and I wasn?t feeling well. I proceeded to go see patients and while examining a patient I became very dizzy and lightheaded while bent over and almost passed out when I came up.. at that time I decided to leave work and go to my PCP. Orthostatic?s were positive and EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and an echo is ordered. Echo was normal. Throughout the week I continued to have tachycardia and shortness of breath with any type of exertion. I left work this morning and was tested for Covid because of my symptoms.

                                                On 1/8/21 I had pain in my left ear and a feeling of fluid like an earache, also had a pressure type headache behind my eyes and felt fatigued. I stayed home from work and reported it and was told I could return to work on 1/11 (my next scheduled day) by workplace health. I felt fatigue and eye pressure headaches on and off since. I also felt like I was having vision changes. On 1/14/21 I noticed a small, raised, red area at the injection site. Over the weekend it continued to spread over my arm. It is warm and very mild tenderness to palpation but does not itch. I am also feeling tight muscle pain in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.

                                                When I received the shot, I felt pain radiating down my arm to my wrist.  This continued for about 12 hours after the shot.  I also felt some numbness/tingling in my left hand.  Since this went away within 24 hours, I did nothing extra to treat it.  On the 4th day after the shot (1/19/21), I began to itch.  It started in my arm near the shot site and then spread throughout my left arm, up the left side of my neck, and on the left side of my face.  By the evening, my entire upper body was itching to the point that my skin felt like it was crawling/I wanted to rip my skin off.   I had to take Benadryl in order to sleep.  The itching has continued throughout today and seems worse on the left side of my body.  I cannot take Benadryl during the day as it puts me to sleep.  I cannot be asleep at work, nor can I take off of work in order to stay home to take Benadryl.  The itching is making basic tasks difficult.  I know I will have to take Benadryl again tonight or I won&#39;t be able to sleep due to the itching.  Is there any idea on how long this will last?  Is it safe for me to get the 2nd dose of this vaccine?

                                                Approximately 36 hours of fever of 101, chills, shivering, sweats, aches and pain in every joint in my body, back pain, headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, nausea, difficulty completing my daily work duties and household activities due to pain and not feeling well. This was not much helped by Alleve, therefore I took Tylenol which was mildly helpful. After the first 36 hours, the symptoms lessened in severity and lasted for about another 12 hours. After that, I felt well for several days in a row, then about 1 week later I felt sore, weak, tired and nauseous. This resolved in its own in about 2 hours. I have felt well since then. I am choosing to receive my second dose of moderna vaccine tomorrow, because I would rather experience these side effects then catch COVID ever again. I caught COVID19 in March 2020. With my COVID infection, I was sick for about 21 days with fever of 101 and more, bone pain, body aches, chest pain, back pain, headaches, nausea, shaking chills, sweats, trouble breathing, dyspnea, cough, runny nose, sore throat, pink eye, dizziness, tiredness, ?brain fog? and fatigue. I was not hospitalized. After about 21 days I began to recover, but the first week after my recovery began I was very weak and tired, and spent most of my time sleeping. I was 41 years old at the time, with health problems including well controlled asthma and being overweight. I never wish to experience this again and I am grateful that I am receiving the Modena vaccine. Thank you so much for logging my side effects.

I told the staff and she said to tell the nurse in the waiting area. I walked over to the nurse and told her my symptoms. She had me lay in a reclining chair, relax, drank juice. She took my blood pressure (144/78 and pulse was 100). I sat in the reclining chair for 30 minutes then walked around to see if I felt safe to leave. By then my pulse was down to 70bpm.

I got very sick at about 4:30pm Symptoms: muscle aches, chills, fever, headache, SOB, chest pain, sore throat, cough. I ended in the ED because I couldn?t manage my asthma and my HR was high on Wed. I was diagnosed with Covid as I found out my husband gave it to me. Then a couple days later my asthma got worse and I ended up in the ED overnight. They were able to get better management in my Asthma.  I was sick for 3 weeks. Went back to work week four 1/25 Monday and 1/27 they cleared me to get the second dosage of the vaccine. I got the vaccine 3:20 pm and at 5:00 I walked my son in Kung Fu and then waited in my car. I ended up passing out in my car at approx 5:15 pm and my 8 year old son knew something was wrong and had to wake me up.  I could barely drive home I felt very drunk. When I got home my temp spikes to 101.3. I had extreme muscle pain, fatigue, chills, sore throat, chest pain, cough, SOB. My left arm swelled up where I was injected and I couldn?t move my arm. I was told I couldn?t take anything tylonel or Ibuprofen for 8 hours. I suffered. Even when I could take something my body was very painful. This lasted  wed, thurs, and Friday morning.

                                                Will call back later this week with lot number. Two days later my body started tingling, I ended up leaving work early. I called the doctor who said and take some Benadryl and rest it off. I was nausea all weekend and slept most of the weekend. I went to work on Monday and worked through Thursday. Friday 1/22/2021 afternoon my body began tingling again, I became so weak that I couldn&#39;t walk. I had to leave work early and they made my husband come pick up because the staff at my job did not think I was safe to drive. I was nauseous again. I had major diarrhea and vomiting about a week after receiving the vaccine. This lasted around 3 days. I finally went into the ER on 1/24/2021. They treated me Magnesium and Potassium and 2 bags of IV fluid and said I was dehydrated and sent me home.  I went from the ER and I could not sleep that night, the ER gave me so much Zofran it was just to much. I still continued to throw up at home. Went back to ER this time  in  on 1/25/2021 around 5AM I was losing feeling in my fingers and toes, they were completely numb. I was also still vomiting. They said I my electrolytes were still out of balance and gave more nausea medicine, medicine to help with the cramping and more IV fluids.  I was sent home later that afternoon. I went to work on the 26th, I felt slow to react, trouble concentrating, very lethargic, and off balance. I was still nauseous but it was getting better with medicine. My eyes yellows turn straight yellow, I thought I had jaundice.  I was able to work all day. I left work and when I pulled into driveway at home 7:01 PM and EMS was in front of my house 7:14  PM.  I went inside and went to bathroom and my husband found me and I was having a full blown seizure, foaming at the mouth. EMS took my to  ER and I was treated for a seizure and an elbow injury and went home. I have seen the neurologist and my physician since being discharged. They did more blood work. I have been having high blood pressure since then. I am trying to get an MRI scheduled that my neurologist ordered. They started Keppra 500 MG to control the seizures. I have been taking Tizanadine for muscle spams from the elbow injury when I feel during the seizure.   I did have an MRI 6 months ago.

The next morning I experienced brain fog, inability to formulate thoughts correctly, difficulty thinking, lack of concentration, muscle soreness, aches all over body, tired easily, shortness of breath, fever, chills,  and nausea.  36 hours after receiving vaccine, I still feel uneasy on my feet, light headedness, muscle soreness, stiff neck, nose bleeds, headache, nausea and extreme fatigue.

Then my legs started to feel heavy and numb, then my face felt numb and then my arms. I could barely pick something up and I could not stand. Then my jaw started to shake and so did my legs. I went to the ER and they said I was having a shock/panic attack response to the vaccine. On Monday 1/25 I woke up in extreme stomach pain and went back to the ER and they said I needed to have my appendix out. I went to a hospital where they tried to just give me antibiotics, but still had to have my appendix out on Wednesday 1/27.

Later that evening she felt off- partly because the air was off in the ER and she took her pulse ox and HR  and HR was 97 o2 was 91 reports no rash at that time.  Came home and took a cool shower and 25 mg of benadryl. Morning of 1/26 she noticed a fine rash on her left lower neck and upper chest.  She had Dr.  look at it when she got to ER to work- they thought it looked like heat rash (air was still out).  Her skin felt uncomfortable and rash worsened to where a co-worker noticed.  The NP checked her and it had spread to her abdomen and back - not legs.  It felt like fire and was painful, but did not itch.

                                                As I was leaving the clinic, roughly 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I because very nauseous and returned to tell the nurse I didn&#39;t feel well.  I then had an episode of syncope and was unconscious for around 40 seconds.  I was transported to the hospital via ambulance.  In the ambulance I had a second syncopal episode while the EKG monitored that my HR dropped to 30 bpm.  I was unconscious the 2nd time for around 1 minute.  Upon arrival to the ER I vomited uncontrollably for a few minutes.   For the last 3 weeks following the vaccine I&#39;ve had a fever of 99.8, headaches, mild diarrhea and nausea.  For 10 days following the vaccine I had trouble with thinking clearly and &#34;brain fog&#34;.  Beginning 2 days post-vaccination my left supraclavicular lymph nodes became very swollen and hard and have remained that way since.

Upon trying to drink water, she started to feel sick and dry heaved (never vomited) then she said she had problems trying to swallow.  She did not report trouble breathing.  I called 911, they had me ask her a series of questions.  As soon as she said her throat was bothering her again, I administered the EpiPen at 12:10. We also called her emergency contact person.

                                                About 7 hours after receiving my injection I started experiencing neck stiffness and body aches. The following day I had really bad flu symptoms and was unable to do anything except use the restroom (with assistance walking) and sleep. I had a fever between 100 and 102.9 all day, it never broke. I would take Tylenol and it would decrease slightly after a bout of sweats so bad I had to change my clothes (3x). I also experienced chills and extreme fatigue. The 2nd day following injection fever and body aches were gone and I was now experiencing headaches and mental fogginess. This lasted almost the entire day. Once these symptoms cleared (early evening) I started experiencing bouts of dizziness, 2 instances prior to bed and 2 instances so far today.

I told the nurse on stand by, what I was feeling and she said to seat down because she was going to check my blood pressure. She checked by BP and it was on 160/80&#39;s ranges, was checked 3 times and they were the same  ranges. I don&#39;t suffer from high blood pressure I told her. So she gave me cranberry juice and water and I stayed for another 30-45 minutes. She rechecked my BP and it went down to 138/70&#39;s. I was told if I want it to go to the ER to get check, I told her that I felt much better that the dizziness went away and my accelerated heart had lessen. I feel much better today and BP it&#39;s back to normal ranges.

Deep pain now radiating in to my axilla. Increased pain with arm movement today. Treatment: I have been taking ibuprofen 800mg every 8 hours since Tuesday morning 2/9/21.

                                                I felt a little lightheaded after the first shot on 1/28/21, they had me stay an additional 15&#34; and I felt ok. After the 2nd shot on 2/25, I immediately felt a little lightheaded, sat for 15&#34;, when I stood up to leave I felt lightheaded and had to sit down. The staff member got me a cup of juice and some water. I stayed for another 15&#34;, I felt better, a little kind of &#34;flighty&#34; feeling but not like I did when I had to sit. I went home and did ok. I dont think i drank enough fluids that evening. That night around midnight I had chills and could not sleep, muscle aches, headache. Around 8 am when I woke up to go to the bathroom, I felt so lightheaded that I had to lay back down, my temp was 100.4. I drank some water. I got back up to take tylenol and get more to drink. I still felt lightheaded and fatigue, temp was down to 99.6. I drank 3 bottles of water and a gatorade before I needed to urinate. I dont know if the lightheaded feelings were a drop in blood pressure and the more intense lightheadedness the next day after the 2nd shot was a presyncopal episode. I continued to nap and drink fluids until about 2p when I woke up I no longer felt lightheaded and the fatigue was getting better. I still had a headache til that night. I did call Occupational Health to go over my symptoms, they told me to push fluids and rest.  Today I emailed my doctor, PCP to go over things and see if he thinks this was a reaction to the vaccine vs not drinking enough the night before, I am leaning toward a reaction since it made me feel weird right after the shot for both times. As of Saturday 2/27 AM I am feeling more like myself, still drinking alot and resting though.

                                                A couple of hours after injection i became dizzy off and on for around 12-24 hours. My balance felt off, low grade fever, weakness upon exertion, headache and fatigue ad injection site very red and tender x24 hours. nothing helped the dizziness. Tylenol was taken q4 hours for fever/bodyaches. The second day post vaccine i had trouble thinking of common words that ive used all of my life. I felt very confused and had a hard time getting my thoughts out. Continued with fatigue but after several hours of exertion. Day 4, some nausea and loose stool. Day 5 post vaccine, injection site has become very itchy, feeling like an insect bite.

                                                I do not have a peanut allergy but I did eat waffles topped with peanut butter for breakfast that morning. About 30 minuets after eating the waffles I started to feel sick to my stomach, both like nausea and also having to have a bowel movement. I went to lie down in bed and after about 15 minuets my heart began to race and I felt very hot. I got up to get my pulse oximeter and noticed my face was very red and I had red blotches down my neck, chest and shoulders. My pulse was at 120 so I laid back down for a few minuets. I felt like I needed to have a BM so got back up to go to the toilet when I saw the hives were now down my arms to my wrists so I took 1 Benadryl 25 mg. I still did not have a BM or vomit. My chest began to have tightness and pressure and I felt short of breath. I was home alone and was feeling very scared. I took 2 aspirin 325 mg each. I unlocked the front door and got my daughter&#39;s Epi-Pen Jr. 0.15 mg. I waited a few minuets yet and began to sweat heavily, I was feeling cold and like I was going to faint. I gave myself the Epi-Pen Jr and called 911 around 11:50 AM.   I never lost consciousness thankfully. EMS arrived and gave me another 25 mg of Benadryl IM in my left arm and they started me on fluids. I received a prednisone and pepcid shots at the hospital.

Tuesday no fever but pain in arm got worse and a large red rash developed. Rash continued to grow daily and became hot to touch. Saw my doctor on Thursday I drew a circle under the rash and it grew outside the circle, doctor prescribed prednisone and antibiotics as a precaution in case not an allergic reaction but possible infection at the injection site.

All my glands continued to swell on and off.  They were tender and irritated and i could feel them externally and internally.  I became extremely fatigued but could not sleep.  I continued to have gland swelling and irritation and extreme fatigue.  The fatigue never cleared up and neither did the swollen glands specifically in my neck and armpits.  I started having some dizzy spells, brain fog, memory lapses and continued extreme fatigue.  I called my PCP to let her know what was going on on at week 3 before my scheduled second as i was worried and did not want to get a second dose.  She ordered blood work CBC and a EBV panel and COVID testing

Increased sway in static standing that is more pronounced with rotational movements, eyes closed, and decreased base of support. Ataxic movements and lateral veering with walking at times. Episodes of low blood pressure/significant decrease in blood pressure from sitting to standing, tachycardia, and resting tremors in the hands that are intermittent in nature. Feeling of head being &#34;in the clouds&#34; constantly where something is not right.

                                                Pain in the site of the injection started immediately.  During the course of the evening, pain worsened and I began to feel fatigued.   The next morning I woke around 5:30 am with pain in my back. I tried to get back to sleep and it was very difficult to rest. Finally, I got out of the bed around 7:30 am with a pounding headache and body aches along with back pain and my arm (at the site of the injection) is too sore to touch. There is also a red ring around the injection site (similar to the look of ringworm). The symptoms continued to get worse. I checked my temperature and it was 101.3 so I took some Tylenol. After several hours, the body aches had not subsided, so I took my temperature again and it was 100.5. At that time I took another dose of Tylenol. After about thirty minutes after the second dose of Tylenol, my temperature dropped to 99.1.   The current time is 6:41 pm on March 17, 2021. This is what has occurred today (1 day after the vaccine).

                                                The night after receiving the vaccination I was very fatigued and fell asleep around 2030.  Around midnight had upset/gurgling stomach that woke me from sleep.  By around 0300 I felt feverish, nauseous, and had severe muscle aches.  I attempted to use the muscle relaxants (Baclofen) on hand to use as needed for chronic back pain and added Tylenol to my daily regimen of Naproxen.  No medication helped my pain and I was unable to sleep or find a position of comfort for 24hours until symptoms passed.  This occurred over the weekend so no medical provider was contacted and I did not seek emergency care as I knew it was a potential side effect of the vaccination.  Sometime during the following day most symptoms resolved but I felt fatigued like I had been sick and bed ridden for days (even though it was only one day).  Took just under a week to feel back to my normal self.

This went on for about another 12 hours. Early in the morning on Sunday 1/17, I woke up sweating and still high increased heart rate. I went to the ER and was treated like an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I was not able to work both Saturday the 16th or Sunday the 17th.

                                                I received my vaccine on Friday, within the first 10 minutes, light headedness, dizziness and headaches.  Paramedic took my blood pressure, I had an elevated BP.  I do not have a history of hypertension.  Within the hour, I started to have body aches and chills. Early the next morning (2 am) Saturday,  the body aches were so bad that I could not get out of bed.  My whole body felt as if I had bloodclots all over, it ached all over and felt very heavy. I started having night sweats, chills and my head was aching badly.  I had to call off from work.  I took Benadryl and drank lots of water and warm tea.  This feeling lasted all day.  I stayed in bed wrapped up the covers. Sunday morning I woke up (6 am ) and was my normal self.

                                                This is a relatively minor &#34;adverse event&#34; but I want to report anyway, in the event this information is useful.  I experienced significant pain in upper arm (same as where vaccine was administered) starting a few hours after vaccine administration. I could not move or touch the arm, and was unable to sleep. (Much more significant pain than with TDAP and other vaccines previously administered.). Had to take OTC pain medication. Pain has receded in the past 24h, though arm is still sore. Reporting as I want to be sure that the vaccine was administered appropriately and nothing was wrong with the dose I was given.

                                                On 2/25/21 I received my first Moderna vaccine.  Later that day, I started to experience some brain fog and fatigue. this resolved itself after approximately 4 hours. On  3/3/21 I took my dose of Humira that I use for Crohn&#39;s Disease and about 3 hours later experienced extreme fatigue. I have been on Humira for 3.5 years and I have never experienced a reaction to the Humira like this. On 3/4/21, the next day after taking my Humira, I once again experienced extreme fatigue, a very bad headache and horrible brain fog to the point where the things I was reading on my computer and things people were saying to me was not making sense. I was also very nauseated and had severe diarrhea. I was tested for Covid just to be sure and I was negative. I went home and fell asleep and slept for 6 hours. I did feel better upon waking up.  Approximately one week later I experienced a sever migraine with visual disturbances.  On 3/15/21 I began having  a Crohn&#39;s flare. I had been in remission for 3.5 years with my last colonoscopy in October of 2019 showing  this and that my Crohn&#39;s ulcers had improved. I went to the ER on 3/16/21 in severe pain, was found to be in a flare with inflammation and swelling in my small intestine and a partial blockage. I was admitted to the hospital for 2 days where I received IV steroids and fluids. I was sent home on oral prednisone and now have to add additional medication to my Humira regimen for my Crohn&#39;s.  I am sure that some will say that none of this is related to the Moderna vaccine I received, but I have had no issues with my Crohn&#39;s in 3.5 years until I had this vaccine. All of my issues this past month coincide with receiving the vaccine and I have never had any side effects whatsoever from the Humira. In fact, it&#39;s always made me feel better when I&#39;ve been due to take it, so I know that my symptoms are not from the Humira. I cannot say for sure if the vaccine caused my issues, however, it&#39;s pretty coincidental that I was feeling good and otherwise healthy until I had this vaccine.

                                                I developed a sudden, sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my head while at work. I had not fallen nor had any injuries/illness. I went to ER; CT scan was concerning for clot in sinus so I was sent via ambulance to inpatient neurology where further MRI/MRV scans determined it was not in fact a clot, but a small bleed of unknown origin. Again, I had no injuries. I was hospitalized while multiple scans were completed along with lab work. Home now following up with neurology, still have head pain, unable to fully work, etc. Hematoma is still there but not growing.

Ambulance was called but patient refused to go with them. Felt better approximately 40 minutes after being vaccinated. Left accompanied by her husband.

                                                This is another reaction I experienced. My  left arm started to be sore again  8 days after vaccination, on 1/7/21 (I originally had sore arm on left the first 3 days of vaccination but then it was recovered).  I also feel there is some weakness on my left arm as well.  I wonder if this is a delayed reaction and if it would be permanent? I previously filed  an report on early adverse events-left arm soreness within an hour of vaccination, then spread  across shoulder, in the middle of night, I woke up with whole body muscle ache that lasted till next morning. The next day of vaccination, I was tired , yawning frequently and very sleepy. I slept for 11 hours on the second night of vaccination which was unusual for me. The sore arm disappeared after about 3 days. But 8 days later it occurs again with some weakness on upper left arm.

                                                Thursday night shortly after the vaccine I was exhausted and headed home to go lay down. While driving, I developed a severe headache. I went home and went to sleep really early. Friday morning, woke up, went to work. Extreme lethargy and severe headache. Left work early (2 ish) with joint pain, headache, lethargy. In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and &#34;buzzing&#34; throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled. Still lethargy and dizzy yesterday but no joint pain, no nausea. Now, Monday morning, still dizzy/lightheaded. Symptoms are subsiding, but not gone.

                                                VERY sore left arm, made it difficult to sleep first and second night after vaccine.  Fever (100.5) and chills within 16 hrs of vaccine; extreme fatigue and mild headache. 48 hours after vaccine: headaches that became a migraine, fatigue continued but less severe than previous day,  and runny nose (no further fever or chills). 72 hours after vaccine:  headache/migraine, but no other symptoms. Migraines resolved once I took my Rx (Maxalt).  **I think it is important to note I tested positive on Oct 14th, 2020; my symptoms were mild/moderate (headaches, runny nose, very mild fever, lost of taste and smell, fatigue; all symptoms resolved after 10 days, with the exception of lost of taste and smell which I still struggle with).

                                                When I woke up on Dec 31 (the day after my shot), my face was swollen and my the area around my eyes was very swollen. I began taking Benedryl and continued to take Benedryl every 4-6 hours over approximately the next 48 hours. Also, I originally had no injection site reaction, however, on Jan 9th, my right arm began to itch. Upon assessment, I noted a 1.5&#34; diameter red, warm area where the vaccine had been administered. This lasted for three days, and now, January 12th it no longer itches, and looks more like a bullseye that is approximately 2.5&#34; in diameter around where the redness was. I have also noticed that since the vaccine I feel cloudy or like I have a constant mild headache.

                                                On the 1st day, I had a migraine. 2nd day (29th) fever, chills, nausea, vomiting - woke up with it and that lasted about four or five days And I had meds to treat it.. Went to work but had to leave work - acutely ill. When I went home, I had a rash across my abdomen. On the 30th I went to urgent care, I had a rash across my neck when I woke up. Rash kept spreading.

                                                Around 730-8 I got a really bad headache. Throughout the night my back tightened up and my hips. I got up tp get ready to go to work, I felt really  light headed while I was brushing my teeth but went in to work. I started felling shortened of breathe and achy. I started feeling  bad and told my Head Nurse and he took my BP and I have a fever. My heart beat was rapid. I went home, slept and had no appetite . The I ended up going to the Hospital  my chest was hurting bad in my lung area, everything about me just hurt I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  They did xray on my lungs, they were clear, my BP was still high, my heart rate had calmed down. They had me sit and relax. The next day I woke up and was ready to put my scrubs on, it was like nothing has ever happened to me. I felt worse with the vaccine then I did when I got the Covid, all I had with Covid headache.  Everything hit so rapid and fast after the shot.

                                                Developed symptoms within 10min of vaccine shot. Feeling hot and nauseous, sensation of feeling ?off?, rapid heartbeat, shaky hands. Similar to onset of more severe allergies in the past. Medical team have emergency juice and crackers and we stayed at site about 40minutes. I had some lower stomach cramps and waves of feeling strange  and a bit confused and chills. It didn?t get worse but I still felt  nausea and just strange, so we drove home.  ( husband drove, I could not drive). About 30min into the drive we had to stop and go to a park toilet because I had sudden painful stomach cramps and the I had  diarrhea (severe). Started feeling less strange and more clear headed after that. At home I took one Benadryl  and Zyrtec, had more diarrhea but not severe, a bit nauseous,  and felt better after 2-3 hours. No more issues after that, just a sore arm.

                                                I received my second dose of the moderna vaccine on a Sunday at 10:30 am in my left deltoid.   Symptoms started with chills and swollen supraclavicular lymph nodes around 10:30 that night, and progressed to body aches,  joint pain, muscle pain,  and a low grade fever.   I was unable to sleep due to chills and pain.   The muscle pain would radiate down my arms and legs, and I would sometimes have a pinpoint sharp pain in the bottom of my left foot.  Symptoms persisted the next day, and also included extreme fatigue, nausea, and enlarged and painful axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  The  supraclavicular lymph nodes were large enough to visibly see.   A round rash/redness started around the injection site started on Monday as well.   This also occurred with the first vaccine, but is much larger this time.   Most symptoms had resolved as of Tuesday, except for fatigue and the rash which are still on going.

In the evening (around 1700), I began to feel muscle aches and pain in my joints (wrists, knees, ankles). I also felt fatigue and brain fog. My injection site (L upper arm) was sore, felt hot to touch and was about 5/10 pain-wise.  I took Tylenol 1,000mg PO and rested for the next 24 hours. The muscle aches and joint pain resolved after 24 hours. However, up to 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt extreme fatigue and could not resume my regular level of activity. After 48 hours, I returned to regular activities.

                                                My left arm - around the injection site - suddenly became warm, itchy, red, and swollen on the evening of 1/23. I took some ibuprofen but was still unable to sleep that night due to the discomfort. The next morning the swelling and pain was worse - I called and spoke to a nurse. Gave her my symptoms and medical history. She shared my concern about a possible DVT (I previously had a DVT in my right arm in 2008). I then went to the ER to have an ultrasound - Dr did rule out a DVT and stated that it was likely just an adverse reaction to the vaccine. Over the next several days the swelling went down, but a red itchy rash continued for the next 7 days.

                                                This morning after breakfast (around 9:00-9:30am) my right eye started feeling strange, but looked fine.  The sensation was a sense of pressure or slight numbness.  After about 20 minutes, that sensation disappeared and then my right arm  started feeling strange, too, as if my joints were swelling and the ulnar nerve was irritated. The right forearm near the ulnar nerve felt slightly numb to touch, as if I were touching Playdoh, or molding putty.   All my joints started feeling swollen and heavy, my knees visibly showing swelling.  I?ve done some work to alleviate the inflammation, but my right side arm and joints are still feeling heavy and a little warm, with some lingering weird feeling of Playdoh (molding putty) numbness when I touch the area.  The numbness is not so noticeable when I?m not touching the area. It seems that it will go away with time and not too serious, but wanted to report in case others experience the same thing.  Also, I should mention that the day after getting the vaccine (2/5/21), in the morning when I woke up (7:00am), I experienced an intense one-sided headache behind my right eye that lasted until I gave myself some acupuncture in the late morning.  I also experienced extreme arm pain at the site of the injection the day after the vaccine which lasted until yesterday (2/6/21).  This morning when I woke up (7am), I felt some local numb feeling (when I touch it, it feels like I?m touching playdoh) at the injection site on the left arm, with minor soreness.

                                                Woke up early in the am on 2/13/21 with extreme chills, muscle aches, and joint pain. Did not check temperature at that time but took 800 mg of Advil due to the severity of the symptoms and went back to sleep. Woke up from nightmares x 2 throughout the night that I was being physically hurt. When I woke up I was crying and realized both times I was still having muscle and joint pain. Finally got up around 1100 in pain still. Calves, thighs, deltoids, triceps bilaterally had severe aching and soreness. Joints hurt generalized. Even my fingers on both hands hurt. I took 800 mg of Advil and 2 Tylenol 500 mg. After about an hour and a half went by and I finally felt my pain ease up, I did check my temp. It was 100.9 after the med dosing. I kept having to continue to take these meds throughout the day and slept the whole day. I did not get up until about 5 pm. Then went back to sleep at around 1100 pm. The next day, on 2/14/21, I seemed better but toward the end of the day I got a sore throat. The following day, on 2/15/21, I was very fatigued throughout the day. I did not feel better until 2/16/21.

I took Advil to assist with the pain. 36 hrs after receiving the vaccine, the only side effects that remained was minimal pain in the hands and shins; approximately 48 hrs after receiving the vaccine I have some chest congestion (if I take a deep breathe it causes me to cough).

                                                I had feverish symptoms - 99.6. Body aches were worse this time and headache was worse this time than first dose. It lasted until Monday the next week - so that was until January 25th when I finally started feeling normal. Tylenol was taken - 1000 mg - I took it every 6-12 hours. That helped. I also added benadryl - 25 mg - I took that every night because I was having a hard time going to sleep with body aches.

                                                I cannot think of an illness or previous vaccine response where I felt worse than I did following this vaccination. Fever 105.8F for roughly 54 hours. After the first 24 hours, the fever would reduce to about 103F with Tylenol. I continued to fever/chill intermittently (ranging from normal to 103F) until 5 days post-vaccination. Brain fog (inability to think or reason normally for about 5 days--the brain fog decreased over time--it was the worst when the ever was the highest) I took aspirin once, although I don&#39;t know why I chose aspirin and not Tylenol. I wasn&#39;t thinking very well. Rigors-duration of the fever, very strong and intense Body aches-severe Headache-possibly the worst I have ever experienced Fatigue Enlarged/swollen lymph node, very painful,  (right side/side of vaccine)--roughly 2 1/2-3 inches in diameter. Weakness--barely able to get out of bed when I absolutely need to use the restroom. Required help. Nausea/Loss of appetite-I did not eat while the fever was high. I struggled to even drink water My reaction symptoms were what I anticipated but much for profound than I expected.

                                                I had immediate pain with the first dose. Within 24-48 hrs I experienced sever pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite. The fatigue tapered off after about a week, but did not fully resolve, I attributed the signs and symptoms to an immune response.. I received my second dose of Moderna on 2\7\21. The reaction was significantly more intense, the body pain( not aches, this was racking pain) was bad enough that I nearly called an ambulance. After 12 hours of pain, I slept for almost an entire day, and was exhausted for a week. Depression and apathy made activities of life almost impossible.  I do have fibromyalgia, and its like the worst never ending flare. The fatigue won&#39;t break. Depression and mental fog will not lift either. I will discuss with my doctor what,if anything, can be done. But it just really hit me this morning that I&#39;m not getting better.

                                                Day 10 post first shot I developed a small red swollen area near injection site that was accompanied by slight tingling in my fingers in the same arm (this was bearable). However, I also developed a petechial rash at the same time on upper back which spread to lower back and had a low fever of 100.5-101 and felt unable to function.  I did a video visit with a doctor who confirmed it was  a petechial rash, she prescribed antihistamine and a topical steroid cream. The rash continued along with fever for 3 days, it spread slightly to my stomach area. By day 4 it began resolving and  I no longer had a fever.   Prior to this reaction occurring on day 10, I had typical symptoms of sore arm and swollen lymph node.

                                                Had the injection Friday evening. Very quickly had my heart rise and felt shaky (like when you take an inhaler). Heart rate stayed up for about 30 min, shaky for about another 1 and half.  but left factily after 15 minutes, as I was shaky, but ok.  About 20 min after shot, the tip of my tongue and lips got tingly/numbish. Not swollen, just tingly.  (They were very slightly the same way the next day). I went home and contacted  hotline. She suggested I call a dr. I called a dr who told me to take a benadryl.  I ate some food and took the benadryl. I fell asleep and slept for 14 hours (definitely not normal). That next day (Saturday) I had a headache, upset stomach, lowgrade fever (below 99.9) and pretty good pain in the injection arm. Stomach was settled by that evening, headache was gone Sunday. Off and on low grade fever (highest was 100.3) still ongoing (Tues 3/2, but highest today is 99.1))

My legs felt very weak, I tried to lay down but that made me feel like I would pass out so I sat up. I dry heaved and threw up several times. I eventually had to be taken to my car in a wheelchair because I could not walk I felt weak, nauseated, and dizzy. My stomach would cramp up the remainder of the day and I felt very dizzy. Food and water made me feel worse. I took so Phenergan to sleep and stop the nauseous. I slept most of the first and second day. I couldn&#39;t eat or drink much. I felt significantly better the second day but was still dizzy and nauseous. Saturday night I felt hungry for the first time. Sunday and Monday I still felt weak but am much better than I was on Thursday.

The rash started 1 week later after the vaccine it was about 2in diameter it lasted about 2 weeks. Mental fog lasted for about  weeks &amp; the chills only a couple of days. I did see my doctor on 1/14/2021 she recommended me to use a steroid cream.

                                                On the night of  February 25 (day 6/7) I woke up in the middle of the night with my hands itching and right butt cheek.  In the morning, there were a couple  small hives between my fingers on left hand and a larger one on right butt cheek.  I was able to go about my day, periodically itching.  That night, I woke up more frequently in the night with both hands itching.  Primarily in between my fingers and a few small hives on both ankles.  At 11 AM, I noticed a lesion on my tongue.  By Friday night I had several more spots and the itching continued to become more bothersome.  I took benadryl before bed.  I woke up Saturday morning at 1 AM with my tongue swollen and  lower right lip swollen as well.  These did not itch nor hurt.  My hands itched and burned very intensely, I put ice on them for some relief.  There were more hives on my hands, ankles,  left shin and left knee and right elbow.  I went into urgent care at 9 am.  Dr prescribed Prednisone and benadryl.  Dr. only looked at my hands and mouth.  When I got home I noticed I had a large hive bout 2&#34; by 4&#34;above the injection site on my right arm.  This did itch, however was not a major concern because my hands hurt quite severely.  I took benedryl at noon on Saturday and that did bring the swelling of my lips and tongue down.  I could not sleep at all on Saturday night due to the pain and itching.  Once the prednisone took effect, I finally got some relief.  Monday I went to see the allergist and he also prescribed zrytek twice a day.  He suggested I take that for a few weeks to make sure the hives do not return.  It is March 9 and some of the hives are still there and bothersome, but the majority have resolved.

                                                Eight hours after vaccine administration, I began to have a mild HA and nausea. This was followed by fatigue, joint pain, body aches, and fever, Tmax 102.0F. 400 mg Advil improved but did not receive symptoms.  I was unable to get out of bed, eat, or go to work. I have not felt this bad since H1N1 over a decade ago. All symptoms lasted 24 hours, with fever breaking after a final dose of 200mg Advil at 9pm 3/9/2021. Advil was taken only twice.

I had a very pale eczema patch on my neck prior to the vaccine. On Saturday night my husband said my neck was the reddist he&#39;d ever seen it in 17 years. I said it was burning, and then looked in the mirror and realized it was as red as my eyelids had been in the morning. Like a severe sunburn. I had been parched all day like I had a lump in my throat. I took benedryl for the next 24 hours. My breathing remained fine and it passed .

Then later on that day I started experiencing extreme all over body aches, headache, even my skin and hair hurt.  Could not sleep for 2 nights due to extreme pain and it also felt like I had restless leg at nights. Nausea. I  alternated Tylenol &amp; Advil but neither helped.  Body ache symptoms started approx 8 hours after injection and lasted a total of approx 48 hours from injection.

I took some ibuprofen and tested. I went to bed at about 8:00 pm. At about 9:00 pm severe body aches started. I took my temp again and it was about 101. At about 11:00 pm  I still had severe body aches, headache, fever, and nausea. They lasted until about 8:00 am 2/23/21. On 2/23/21 my fever, nausea, and severe body aches subsided, but I was very fatigued the entire day and still had a mild headache. I slept/rested the entire day, and I felt better by 2/25/21. I also experienced soreness and redness and some itching at the injection site for approximately 7 days after my first shot.

I barely could drive home.  Went home and tried to lay down to rest.  The nausea was overwhelming.  I began to throw up and was not able to hold anything down all weekend.  I had zofran at home and tried to take that only to throw it up as well.  The nausea was severe.  My mouth would fill with water and then I would puke.  I noticed fatigue, stomach cramping, nausea, pain at the site of the injection, headache, and became dehydrated.  i had to go to the ER by Tuesday.  My primary care told me to go.  They gave me fenergen and an IV.  Finally  I got pedialyte and light food to stay down.  As of today I am feeling better but my stomach is swollen and very gassy.  Like its upset.  I barely have an appetite.

I felt inexplicably sad in the afternoons and continued until March 1st anxiety event. I also found myself crying more.  o Sleep ? I woke up a handful of times with heart racing and then would fall back asleep. This is never had happened before   February 11: Shot #2  of Moderna at 7 am  at Hospital o Within 11 hours of the vaccine had fever, chills, aching and 103 fever. Next day my period started a week early. o Over the course of the next two weeks my anxiety levels heightened;  o March 1st acute event that mimicked an anxiety attack (no previous history of anxiety or attacks); followed by my first night of many nights with no sleep.  o Insomnia ? worsened each night.   o Internal thermostat dysregulation ? I would get very cold and shake uncontrollably and then feel hot after the shaking episode; shaking would often happen in the afternoon and especially after meals.  o High Blood pressure o Night sweats. o Muscle weakness; tingliness running through arms and legs. o My heart would skip a beat (several times a day). o My entire body would feel like it was pulsating uncontrollably but I wouldn?t be visibly shaking.  o Muscle stiffness. o Pain in lower right back region (ultrasound yielded nothing). o Extreme exhaustion. o Loss of appetite and dietary changes (no longer can eat rich foods; only bland small meals multiple times a day) o Weight loss (5-6 pounds) in one week (146-140) o Unable to focus; blurry vision. o Unable to partake in intense physical activity; can only walk. o Unable to participate in household work because of low energy. o Unable to participate in job duties due to inability to focus on screen for long periods of time. o.  Second week, March 8th, muscles in upper back burn and intense pins and needles in my shoulders arms to finger tips. T This sensation woke me up from sleep on Friday March 12th.   o Unable to focus; blurry vision. o Strange headaches- behind eyes, in temples, on one side of the head. (don?t? have a history of headaches)

This same reaction also occurs when I eat certain foods I&#39;m intolerant to. I felt very dizzy right after as well. After exactly one hour my throat symptoms went away but suffered from residual effects for the next few days.  The next day I couldn&#39;t lift my left arm(which went away 2 days later), I was out of breath with everything I did, dizzy, muscle cramps, chills, body aches(as though I had the flu) and had extreme fatigue. All of theses symptoms lasted for the next week almost two.

The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

                                                Felt a burning sensation in my hands right after getting the shot.  Went home,  took 2  Aleve and iced my arm for 5 minutes at a time on and off about 4 times.  Hours later,  about 8 pm I was laying down on the couch on my left side for at least 20 minutes.  When I was getting up my upper left arm was very numb and I had a strange sensation on my left side like my blood had pooled over there but it was very numb in the area.  I never have felt anything like that.  The sensation did go away over the course of a few minutes.  Soon after I was having shooting pain in my hands.  It felt like arthritis pain.  This did not last too long but came back here and there.  My lower back started hurting a little bit out of nowhere.  And then when I went to bed I started having random body aches all over.  Like brief shooting pain in different parts of my body.  I did have some dryness, weird sensation in my throat at times. The body aches kept me up until 2 or 3 am.  It was resolved by the time I woke.  I never felt that I had a temperature.  And I was not sick prior so I felt it was a cause and effect from the vaccine.  I took 2 Aleve and I went to work.  Temperature checked at work and I was 97.1,  normal.  Wore a mask all day,  social distanced at work and I had mentioned to my manager upon arrival that I had symptoms/reaction? after my shot.  I did still have some residual,  arthritis type pain in my hands during the day and more so when I got home.  I also felt fatigued when I got home from work but I was half awake most of the night before due to the body aches.  Felt pretty good,  normal on the second day after the vaccine.

When I woke up in the morning to get ready for work I felt very weak.  I walked into my bathroom and lost conciousness.  I woke up on the floor and had hit my forehead on the tile floor.  I was confused when I got up, and proceeded to get into the shower.  I then passed out again in the shower and hit the back of my head against the shower wall.  My husband found me as I woke up on the shower floor.  He called my doctor and took me to the emergency department on doctors advice.

Approximately 8 hours later I suddenly became very tired. I could barely manage to get out of bed at 2 PM on Saturday to take my temperature. My temperature was 102.3 (I?m normally around 97.4 per my morning COVID symptom checks 2x/week). I had aches, chills, joint pain, extreme fatigue, and injection site pain, redness and bruising. I was so out of it that I am not sure I would have been able to navigate taking a fever reducer, eating food, and other basics. My partner assisted me with these things. The first round of Tylenol on Sunday eventually got me to 99.5 or 8 or some such. I continued to take Tylenol throughout Saturday and Sunday. Sunday I woke feeling fatigued and out of it, but definitely on the mend. Sunday late afternoon/ early eve, even more like myself. Today (Monday 1/25) generally back to normal&#34;

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine at my workplace at 10:12am on 1/14/21 and waited the 20 minute observation period with no problems. I returned to my work station and noted a &#34;typical&#34; sore arm and slight fatigue. Appx. 5-6 hours later, the soreness increased significantly and was very uncomfortable. Tylenol 1300mg helped me fall asleep that night. The second day, the pain continued at the deltoid muscle and I was unable to raise my arm more than 90 degrees. The pain interrupted my ability to go about my daily activities or perform my job duties. That second night, the pain was debilitating to the point of crying and Tylenol was not helping. The third day, the severe arm pain continued and I was still in tears. I could not even raise my left arm to the level of my wait. I switched to ibuprofen with moderate success.   By the fourth day, 1/18, the pain had rescinded. I had little to no pain for the next four days (1/19/21 to 1/23/21). On Saturday, 1/23, I noticed my left arm was becoming sore again. Over the past three days, the soreness and pain have returned and have limited my ability to use my left arm. The arm pain disrupts my ability to get a good night&#39;s sleep as there is no position of comfort. When not moving, my left shoulder feels sore and uncomfortable. When moving my left arm, I feel pain when moving it in certain motions/directions. My range of motion is reduced and this along with the pain is disrupting my ability to drive my car, reach for objects and take a shower.   Because it has now been 12 days since my vaccine, I went to urgent care for help this morning. Because the pain left and then returned again, the physician determined that my mechanism of injury is not mechanical in nature, but most likely related to inflammation caused by the vaccine. She prescribed me an anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxers, and home physical therapy exercises to see if we can improve my condition. She also recommended me to file this report with VAERS.

Due to the later hour i went to the ER where after examine gave epinefrin.  The Dr examined my throat by eye and x-ray.  He saw no signs of swelling.  He hypothesized this was an anxiety reaction as none of the symptoms indicated allergic reaction

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine I began to feel light headed, dizzy and my heart rate was climbing. I wear an Apple Watch and notice my heart rate was steadily climbing. I asked the exit secretaries to be seen by a nurse and as they were getting a nurse my heart rate reached 169 and I was feeling faint and beginning to shake. When the nurse came she noticed how white my hands were and my breathing was becoming labored. The nurse called a code white and an ICU nurse and respiratory specialist arrived to assess me. I thought I would pass out and they had me lay on my back with legs up. They tested my blood sugar and were assessing my vitals. My breathing was fast but I was still able to breathe. My heart rate started to slow down but remained somewhat high. they helped me into a wheelchair and escorted me to the emergency department. I was assessed for cardiac concerns and labs were taken. After a couple of hours in the ED the dizziness started to subside but I had excessive thirst and dry mouth and slightly swollen tongue. I had feeling of butterflies in my stomach off an on. My heart rate stabilized and I was cleared to go home after four hours.

After about 20 minutes, I grabbed my water bottle and both arms felt weak when I lifted them and they felt like they were floating. I had a sudden urge to cry when this happened that lasted for 30 seconds.  I was not anxious or nervous to take the vaccine but my body may have overreacted to the sensation of my arms but it didn&#39;t feel like a panic attack that I had a few in my earlier 20s after the birth of my child and undiagnosed thyroid disorder.

I took Motrin and even needed Vicodin for the pain.  No fever or nausea.  This is still better than getting COVID and I am just reporting for data purposes.  I was told that this symptom could occur after the second dose.  Some people are talking about blood type being a factor, I am not sure if that is true, but I am A&#43; if that helps. Vaccine on Friday, Saturday felt horrible and Sunday was back to normal.

Sore arm started as slightly sore, became extremely sore within an hour, and remained extremely tender for 24 hours. Within 36 hours pain decreased. On day 5 barely noticeable. I noticed a sensation of racing heat at times, dizziness occasionally, feeling of anxiety, slight headache on day 5. Day 5 also very dizzy.

                                                Within 5 minutes after shot my lips were feeling tingly. at 15 minutes out a co-worker sat by me and I told her about my lips and she commented that I had a large red mark/rash on my neck. I went to the nurse and she asked if I was nervous - which I was. She told me that I should take a Benadryl. I took a single Benadryl.  I went home and was still feeling the tingling sensation and had the rash which had spread onto my chest.  I took another Benadryl about one hour after the initial shot. This reduced the rash and tingling sensation. as it wore off about 4.5 hours later the rash, tingling lips and facial swelling started to appear. I took two more Benadryl and called the on call doctor at my physicians office.  He advised me to continue taking Benadryl until 48 hours after the vaccine, I did this every 4-5 hours including waking during the night to keep up on it. I was also taking Advil at this point to try to help with the swelling and a dull headache that had set in. I should note that I have never had any facial injections or anything like unto it. For 40 hours post vaccine I did this. After 48  hours the symptoms seemed to go away. I did start feeling a metallic taste in my mouth that night and the following night so I took a single Benadryl at bedtime those nights and that seemed to resolve it. I have had a slight cough and congestion on days 3-6 when I woke up in the morning, but that would resolve itself within an hour of being up. The doctor on call that I spoke with the first night did advise me to still get the second dose, but to take some Benadryl ahead of time and to make sure that the clinic has a current EpiPen on site.

Intense body aches in whole body, especially back  and vey painful injection site. I halos had a headache and trouble sleeping. I too Tylenol at 5:00 a.m. and was able to sleep three hours. I took Tylenol/ibuprofen every 4 hours until evening. I was fatigued all day and spent the day sleeping/resting, which is very unusual. By 4:00 p.m.  I was mostly feeling normal. Other than arm pain, I am fine today.

I thought  my back condition was worsening but honestly think it was an effect. Nothing I had been using for pain relief helped. I was in agony during that period. Agitated.  At 5AM on 1/29/21, I woke up soaked in sweat and finally had some pain relief. From that point on, my pain returned to my normal level.  I never reported this to any healthcare professional since at the time, I did not think this pain was related (also not sure what could have been done).

Headache and nausea accompanied fever for 36 hours.  I called Occupational Health at noon the next day to see if I could take Ibuprophen to reduce the fever and they said I could.  Fever was reduced after dose, but came back 5 hours later until next dose of Ibuprophen was taken.  This lasted for 36 hours until fever finally went away.  I then developed a bad sinus infection that lasted for 5 days following the fever.

That night at 12:30am, woke up with temp (99.9) and had chills. Was shaking so badly from them, i was having uncontrollable hand tremors and couldn&#39;t use my finger to type on my phone. Was awake for the rest of the night. In the morning had a 101 , also had loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, nausea, headache, weakness.  But the adverse event I&#39;m reporting is blurred vision. I think it began around 12pm on Wed, so almost 24 hours the shot. It was primarily my left eye. There was also a great deal of pressure from behind the eye. It was difficult to read. After about 2-3 hours it passed. It returned briefly again in the evening, although more mild. Today (2/4/21) when I woke up, my vision is fine and the pressure behind the eye is gone.

I became nauseous, had a slight headache, dizzy, a cold sweat and began having intense stomach cramps. Within 1 minute I passed out in my bathroom and was found face down in my bathroom. It was clear that I hit my head and lost a tooth. I was taken via ambulance to a local hospital.

                                                I got after the first dose what some people are to experience after their second dose.  This could be because I had Covid in November and probably have circulating antibodies already.  My right arm had 10/10 pain starting around midnight waking me up and was persistent with any movement which extended up into my neck and down to my elbow area.  Ibuprofen and tylenol did not help with the pain. Currently on post-vaccine day 3 I still am unable to get full ROM to my right arm due to pain but it is better than yesterday.  Other symptoms I had was the fevers, chills, headache, extreme hypersensitivity to my skin, and bone pain with movement especially to my hips and back with walking which seems to be subsiding.  whole body aches/pain which seems to be subsiding as well.  What I don&#39;t see mentioned in a lot of the expected side effects is TINNITUS.  I am experiencing moderate tinnitus.  I have experienced this previously in my 20&#39;s when taking a full dose of aspirin and I avoid aspirin products because of that.  I did not see anywhere that there is aspirin products in these injections.  It has not subsided yet at this time and I am wanting to report this.  Not sure if others are experiencing this as well.

Similar if not worse than when I had COVID-19 in July. It was painful. The vibrations of the car, putting my hair up, and changing clothes physically hurt. I took Tylenol, Aspirin, Aleve, and finally Ibuprofen, at 5pm on Friday 1/22/21. Ibuprofen 800mg was the only thing that helped. I took it every 6 hours until I went to bed Saturday night and was fine after that.

                                                The first shot I received on December 28th.  I have fatigue and a headache for about three days and my arm did hurt for close to 2 1/2 weeks,  the second week it was red, 3 inches in diameter, raised, also it itched very badly for 4-5 days.                I received the second maderna vaccine on 1/28/21 about 5:45 pm. I had noted about 8 pm mild burning to the lower part of my legs and bottom of my feet that evening.  Later I started to have mild nausea about 9 pm, but it resolved, and I went to bed.  I woke up about 3:11 with diarrhea and my body and mainly &#34;my skin&#34; started to hurt, as if someone was taking a wire brush to my legs, and slowly pulling out each hair, but at one time. After another hour or so, I started to have severe chills with increased nausea and more severe severe body/bone/joint pains. I took Tylenol at this time. I noted that the bottom of my ribs or rib cage hurt with breathing, also I had upper abdominal pain, severe lower back pain and a headache. The next morning I stayed in bed all day and took a few baths, I had multiple episodes of diarrhea. I was nauseated, but no vomiting.  I still had chills, bodily shaking, fatigue, muscle and joint pain.  I tried to sleep off and on through the day.  That evening I did have a temperature of 101.4 with using Tylenol and Motrin.  It did come down later that evening, but I still had severe pain of my body and my skin hurt, even the hair on my head, during the night about 2:45 am I took a bath and that did help with my body.  on Saturday evening I was able to start getting up and moving around, but a severe decreased appetite. I&#39;ve noted a drastic change in taste since having the vaccine and have lost 9 lbs in the past week.  I am able to taste, but everything has a different taste.  I have had two covid tests PCR&#39;s in order to return to work.  I also have had the continued bilateral leg burning from the calves to the bottom of my feet.  The sensation is if you are cold outside and come back in and run your hands or feet under warm water to warm them up and that pain you feel when they warm up is how they feel, but on a milder level than that pain.  I also have had post nasal drip that has started in past 5 days and while at work in the ER on Tuesday I had a PA look at my ears and I had a large amount of fluid behind both ears.  I had a zpack that I had at the pharmacy that I had refilled and have taken that for the past four days with some relief.  I still feel fluid in my ears, but mildly better.  The headache and fatigue is getting better each day.  My appetite is still very diminished as well as how things taste in my mouth, it is way different than anything I have ever experienced before.  I also had an Issue on Monday 2/1/21 when I was working, I felt in my brain, as if it was just not as sharp, cloudy. I had an issue with typing on my right hand for a few hours (upper row on rt side) that has since resolved, but it was a truly &#34;off&#34; day.  It has taken me this entire week to start to feel even a bit more back to human.  So what remains- the bilateral leg to bottom of feet weird burning sensation, decreased appetite,  taste alterations, post nasal congestion with bilateral fluid in ears, shortness of breath with activity, mild burning in lungs with activity (working out/running in the cold weather).           this was just a side note that was copied to the bottom.       I was unable to touch my arm right arm due to swelling and pain for about three day, which I know is to be expected and actually wasn&#39;t as sore as long as the first shot.  I did take a few doses of Motrin 800mg but tried to stay with Tylenol and Zofran, and hydrate.              I noted that warm baths helped the most and the use of a heating pad on my lower back and an ice pack on and off my head for the headaches.   Thank you

                                                Approximately 48 hours after vaccination I began to experience nausea. Within a few hours I began to have stomach cramps of increasing frequency and intensity. Approximately 60 hours after the vaccination I began vomiting. This lasted about 6 hours. The stomach cramps continued and then an intense headache that included both a squeezing and pounding sensation was also experienced. It was difficult to eat anything besides dry crackers and water as any intake was met by more intense cramping. The stomach pains continued for approximately 72 hours and the headache for 48 hours. I was unable to work for 3 days during this time.

She felt that the pain went into the lymph nodes and into her back. The headache, pain and sore throat worsened over the afternoon. By the time she got home at 4:30pm she had whole body aches and was feeling really bad. She developed facial and eyelid swelling. She applied ice. Her eyelids swelled so much that they cracked. Her face has a dry, red rash. She later got up to take bedtime medications and she passed out. She began vomiting. She declined an offer to call the ambulance or to go be seen by a doctor. She took tylenol for pain and zofran for vomiting. On 2/6/21, she developed diarrhea. She was

Day 3, itchy rash on my neck and chest and a sandy, itchy feeling in my throat. I took a Claritin and it went away after I woke up. Day 5 - felt very dizzy and had chills and rash came again - all over my chest. It was a burning sensation. Called Dr about 10 PM in evening and she told Claritin and Benadryl for a week. I had lymph node enlarged above my left clavicle on Day 5, as well. Really bad fatigue started occurring - really bad fatigue; headache. Felt horrible. Eventually I started feeling better. Rash went away but I fatigue was still lingering. Lymph node became slowly less enlarged but got the second dose of the vaccine and it enlarged larger than the first time. (Second dose of COVID Vaccine was date was  January 27, 2021 about 3:00 PM.)

                                                Weird Taste in my mouth within 2 minutes and Accelerated heart rate.  From the time of injection until current, chills, intermittent low grade fever, headache and body aches different from my normal aches. Worse GI issues, memory issues worse than normal, feeling of disorientation at times, little difficulty catching my breath (only used rescue inhaler once). I felt a bit better about a week and a half post injection. But, then, started to feel worse, including vaccinated arm feeling heavy and sore again - February 27, 2021 - noticed reddish/ pink abnormal circle around injection site this is new, delayed, overall worse malaise, I felt a general feeling of yuck. I know it?s not a great descriptor, but, it kind of fits. Basically, lupusy, but worse.

Immediately after shot my body got hot and my feet were on fire. On the way home approx 1 1/2 hours afterward my mind was foggy. 2 hours after shot I experienced tachycardia with heart rate  at 138 beats per min and blood pressure 138/94 A friend came over to stay with me cause all I could do is lay down. My legs felt like they weight a ton 3 hours after shot. I had chills and nausea that lasted 48 hours after 1 shot. I am required by my job to get 2nd dose next week.  Do you recommend 2nd dose due to reaction off 1st shot?

In the morning at 0600, woke up with nausea  and BM urgency.  Shortly after N/V, chest pain and delerium start.  Chest pain caused anxiety. No SOB. Upon standing, I blacked out and fell to ground.  When I came to ( 5-10 minutes later ) nausea disappeared but arthralgia and chills still present.  I did not take any OTC/ pain relief meds at all since I did not want to blunt my body&#39;s immune response.  Nausea does not return and the CP/ hypotensive/shock episode made me stick to sitting on the couch for the remainder of the day.  I took 400mg IBU around 8 am and all SX disappear by 1800.

I had on fleece pjs and three blankets laying in front of fireplace and could not get warm.  Headache out of this world.  Every joint in my body hurt.  My ankles were so swollen I could barely walk.  I missed three days of work.  3/4/21 2nd dose of Moderna.  Same as above only joint pain was much worse.  Chills and then breaking out in sweats.  I?ve missed two days of work as of now with this shot.  It?s really wiped me out.  I haven?t been able to eat or sleep much because I hurt so bad.  My knees, ankles, and neck seem to be the worst.  I?ve never experienced joint pain as bad as these two times.  I could barely walk to the bathroom.

                                                2am woke up with severe chills and a severe migraine. At 10am severe migraine progressed to skin on scalp feeling like it was pulled too tight. From there I began to feel an internal tremor in my head, almost like if you ran a jack hammer all day and then stopped, that shaky, off-kilter feeling.  I used the bathroom that morning and had massive diarrhea, experience a vaso/syncope episode and passed out.  All week I felt like this and experienced nausea, dizziness, heart palpitations, severe migraine, internal tremor, severe anxiety and severe thirst.  By Friday, 2/26/21, it got so bad and my blood pressure dropped to 112/50, that I was taken via ambulance to the ER.  They gave me IV fluids, ran labs, EKG, etc.  Blood pressure went up to 137/91.  Released to rehab at home.  2nd ER visit to Hospital on Sunday where they repeated labs, EKG, gave me fluids and treated symptoms. Both trips I was labeled Tachy.

I took Tylenol for the fever, which did not really work until 3/4/2021.  Fever finally broke to just under 100 by 3/4/2021 and was gone completely by 3/5/2021. Headache was gone by 3/4/2021.  All other symptoms have subsided by 3/5/2021.

                                                Received vaccine on 3/3/21 at 2:30pm. Waited for 20 minutes at pharmacy for allergic reaction. Given the all clear, so headed home. Around 5pm, I started noticing how extremely sore my left arm was, almost as if somebody had hit it with a baseball bat (no bruising, redness, etc., just VERY sore). I also started noticing numbness and tingling in my left arm that traveled down the outside of my arm into my left hand and into my left pinky finger.   As the evening progressed, I lost my appetite, developed a headache, felt extremely fatigued, was dizzy, had muscle and joint aches, had left kidney pain, and began to feel flushed and hot. I took my temperature and it showed I was running a low-grade fever of 98.7F (my normal temperature is anywhere between 96.9F and 97.1F). I went to bed around 9pm.  Around 3am (which is now 3/4/21), I woke up with nausea, and my left arm/hand/finger really experiencing numbness and tingling (it&#39;s as if that portion of my arm/hand/finger was semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was on the verge of throwing up. I broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed and went back to sleep.  Around 5am (still 3/4/21), I woke up again with nausea and my left arm/hand/finger still numb and tingling (semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was again on the verge of throwing up. I, again, broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed. I decided to take a Zofran around 6am for the nausea.  I slept from 8am-12pm on 3/4/21 due to the Zofran. When I woke up, I called the pharmacist at pharmacy to notify them of my symptoms. The pharmacist everything I experienced was normal and should go away in 2-3 days (if they didn&#39;t then contact my regular doctor), that I could take Tylenol for any pain, and I still needed to keep my follow-up appointment for the second shot.  The entire day on 3/4/21 from 12pm until I went to bed around 10pm, I still experienced an extremely sore arm, loss of appetite, slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, muscle and joint aches, left kidney pain, low-grade fever (for me), and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger.  I was able to sleep through the night, and woke up around 6am on 3/5/21. Currently, I am still experiencing an extremely sore arm, fatigue, and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger. I am EXTREMELY concerned about the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger as it does not seem to be getting better.

Twenty-two hours later I developed a headache at the base of my skull/top of neck. The headache lasted for six days. I avoided taking medication until the sixth day. On day four following the vaccine the headache was severe enough to cause nausea &amp; vomiting and I was unable to work that day. The prior day, I again experienced a complete loss of memory from the previous evening. I do not have any medical history of migraine headaches. I would manage the pain by lying down until it would subside, however, within an hour of resuming normal activity, the headache would return. I also experienced heart palpitations on day five.

                                                I received the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine at 3:45pm. Approximately 5-10 minutes later I felt flushed (warm chest/face), ear congestion and anxious. After another 5 minutes, I felt an asthma attack start. I could still breath through my nose but it was difficult to swallow.  I used my albuterol inhaler and took Benadryl (2 tablets) and felt much better after 15-20 minutes. I am taking daily antihistimes and still feel congested but no further asthma attacks have occurred. I developed hot flashes and chills the night of taking the vaccine but that has resolved. I also have upper abdominal pain that has not resolved.

                                                I am emailing you about filing a petition for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination that I received on Wednesday February 17, 2021, at the Department. I went to my primary care providers for my annual physical and to address my concerns with the vaccination. I gave blood work. Later into my afternoon, I notice that I began to itch across my sternum and I thought it was an allergic reaction to some of my common allergies. I took some Benadryl to calm the itching to get rest. I was out of work from Wednesday February 17, 2021, @ 1300 to Friday February 19, 2021, without pay, returning on Monday February 22, 2021.   On Monday February 22, 2021, I came into work and felt fatigue, light headed, headache, blurred vision, and some great deal of body pain. Approximately 2145, I notice that I was having trouble breathing and began itching profusely. I grabbed my epi pen and gave myself an injection. I laid back on the bed and I fell asleep. The following day Tuesday February 23, 2021, I barely had energy to get up and get ready for work. I prevailed because there is nothing set in place for people who experience an delayed allergic reaction to these vaccinations. I have literally been pushing myself through my workdays because I can not afford to be off.   On Sunday February 28, 2021, I notice that the rash began to spread across my body parts. My arms, neck, shoulder, upper back, behind my ears, legs, and again I figured it related to my allergies. The condition continued to get worst throughout the next week. It was several occasions I almost lost control of my vehicle because the itching sensation had hit me instantly while driving. Once I was able to pull over, I just began to scratch every area of my body. Therefore, Friday March 5, 2021, I drove myself to Hospital too seek help.   I explained my situation, I was checked in, and I showed how the rash had spread all over my body. It was nothing they could do but give me IV fluid, did some blood work and Prednisone 10mg (5 tablets) and send me home without relief. I continue to suffer from this vaccination and no one has any answers to give me. My scar-less skin now looks unattractive and dark spots where there was a rash that came and went but left awareness that I once had a rash in that spot.   I am scheduled to see my dermatologist today, Thursday, March 11, 2021. My appointment time is 1615. I went my employer to file a notice of the outbreak and to see what if anything that they could do. It was just a standard report and they are submitting all information to the CDC.   I am a health care professional and my job requires me to stand, sit, bend, lift, push, pull and assist in all aspects of an operating room that has caused me some issues and concerns that I can not perform my duties as required due to the severely of the itching.

By the next morning (03/23/2021) I had a fever of 101.3 and it stayed at that level for nearly 24 hours. I had to stop work halfway through my normal work day. Triggered a massive migraine headache.  Groggy, lethargic, minimal appetite, diarrhea, arm more swollen now, extending beyond injection site, swollen lymph nodes in neck &amp; left armpit.  Took 600mg ibuprofen every 5 hours.  Drank lots of water.  rested.  Went to bed by 9pm.  Woke up the following morning (03/25/2021) covered head-to-toe in a red rash.  Assume this to be a heat rash, as my fever had broken by then &amp; I&#39;ve had a heat rash reaction post-fever in the past.  However, never one to this extreme.  Rash intensified throughout the day, despite multiple cool showers.  Dressed as lightly as possible. Itchy.  Took only ibuprofen during day to allow me to work.  Took 2 Benadryl approaching bedtime to stop the itching &amp; try to sleep.  Left upper arm still swollen, sore, and hot to the touch.  Woke up this morning (03/26/2021) with rash still covering body, but reduced to a much lighter pink. Still quite itchy. Left upper arm still quite swollen &amp; sore; definitive difference in how left arm feels vs. right arm that was not injected.  Arm is still quite hot in that area.  Rash in that area is much redder, extending several inches outward from the original injection site.

The next couple of days I felt lousy so I didn&#39;t work out. When I started to work out again on Friday, Feb. 26th, I noticed I couldn&#39;t lift my arm across my body or directly above without severe pain. My range of motion was immediately impacted. It&#39;s been six weeks and I cannot put on a shirt or take it off without pain. I&#39;ve had to modify my typical workout routine. The pain wakes me up at night when I shift positions.

                                                Have had tiredness since 2nd vaccine in February and noticed shortness of breath when walking or going up stairs in mid March.  Around 4/1, I started having left rib pain preventing me from sleeping on my left side and then could not breath during a massage on 4/8.   On April 9th, I was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms (clots) in both lungs, reducing my lung capacity to only 30% of normal.  This could be due to Loestrin birth control but I have taken hormones in the past for IVF and when younger for birth control.  The reaction may be due to a combination of vaccine, Loestrin and iron but triggered by vaccine.  I am currently on Eliquis to treat pulmonary embolisms.

                                                12 hours after my 2nd dose of Moderna I felt somewhat nauseated and my abdomen felt sore. 18 hours after 2nd dose I started running a low fever of 100.7. The following day my fever jumped to 102.6 at 2pm and fever continued to return every 3 to 4 hrs. My abdomen aches when I have fever. The following day (Friday night) I went to sleep at 10:30 with a fever of 101, rooks some Tylenol and woke up at 12:30 to a 104.3 fever and severe chills. It took two hours, a cold bath and 4 Advil gel capsules to bring fever down to 101.5. This fever has continued and I still currently have a high fever, all day every day, every 3 to 4 hours.   My body is somewhat achy and I have mild to medium headaches off and on.  I met with a nurse practitioner and she ordered a RESPIRATORY PATHOGEN PANEL WITH COVID-19. I tested negative for all viruses.   I am managing the fever by setting alarms on my phone for every 3-4 hours so I don?t forget to take a fever reducer.  It?s a total nightmare. When will it end?  My appetite is also v small and I am weak. I am truly exhausted from this unending high fever.

                                                Started saturday May 1st with the basic &#34;vaccine arm&#34; pain... Today is wednesday May 5 and It STILL hurts really bad. Nothing with injection site, no other side effects... I did have severe arm pain on day 2 of 2nd dose along with chills, fatigue and brain fog  which all subsided on day 3... This pain in my arm is JUST like the pain i had with the 2nd dose... I couldnt have slept on it wrong because i sleep on my right side and this is my left arm and i have a bad back so i know for certain that i didnt over exhurt myself because i literally am very limited to what i can do physically. I have no other explanation for this pain and the vaccine is the only thing i can think of since it mirrors the same exact pain... But why so much later??? Maybe you guys know?

                                                I came home around 5:30pm after receiving the injection at 3PM and felt very drowsy.  I was drowsy and my head felt really heavy on my shoulders.  After another hour at 6:30 pm, I felt a strong headache coming on. Throughout the evening I was drowsy and went to bed early.  In the middle of night, I woke twice due to headaches.  This morning 1/8/2020, my headaches continued even after I took 1000mg of acetaminophen at 11:00am.  That was my first dose of any type of pain medication.  I thought the side effects would go away therefore I delayed taking any pain medication.  I usually do not have headaches and healthy.   My arm is very sore at the injection site as compared to when I received the flu shot in November.   It is almost 2:30pm almost 24 hrs from the injection and my headache continues.

I began vomiting shortly thereafter and continued to vomit for several hours. It wasn&#39;t until late the evening after the vaccine that I was able to hold down solid food. The headache continued until the next day and I experienced extreme fatigue (Although that&#39;s likely due to the lack of sleep and vomiting for several hours).

                                                The day after I received vaccine I had severe arm pain at injection site, my body was achy , and fatigue. These symptoms resolved after a few days . I then had dizziness, nausea, unbalanced when walking, chest pain, feeling like my heart was racing,  palpatations, muscle weakness in my legs, and brain fog. The unbalanced feeling, dizziness, weakness ,and occasional palpatations remain. I had a covid test done on 1/6/2021.I had sinus pain started on 1/8/2021. I am being treated for possible sinus infection with Augmentin that I started on 1/11/2021 but my symptoms are still present . I have been unable to work because when I walk I feel dizzy and unsteady.  I have follow up with my primary doctor on 1/18/2021.

The fever broke early Saturday morning but the headache, pains &amp; fatigue continued throughout Saturday. She felt better by Sunday, just a little fatigue but attribute that to the poor sleep from Friday &amp; Saturday.

The next day the arm was still very sore and I had very little energy and total body aches.  I self medicated with 600mg of Ibuprofin several times through out the day.  My injected arm was 4 degrees warmer on the surface than my non-injected arm; as measured with an infrared thermometer.   I felt like when I had actually had Covid 91 days prior.  The next day I was about half as bad as the day before, and I was able to return to work on Monday.  The injected arm remained sore for more than a week at the injection site.  I also experienced some swelling of lymph nodes under my arm.

                                                About 10-15 minutes following the vaccine I began to feel a sensation on the left side of my body (injected in left arm).  It began across the left side of my face and over a period of about 15 minutes it spread to my left arm and then my left leg.  It never went to my right side.  It was not painful.  It was not numbing, tingling, or anything.  It was simply a sensation.  It hung around a while, and was gone by evening (shot at 3:30 pm).  In the evening around 6:30 I began to get a upper stomach ache.  The pain was manageable by sitting down, and was more bothersome by being up and around.  When I went to bed that evening the pain was worse, still in my upper stomach, and I was unable to sleep.  I took some pepto bismol wondering if I had eaten something that bothered me, but that didn&#39;t seem to touch the pain.  Somewhere between 12:30-1:00am I did fall asleep.  When I woke up in the morning the stomach pain was very minimal and I could go about normal activity.  Within a couple hours the pain was gone.  Those were the adverse events on the day of the vaccine.  I also had normal muscle arm soreness for approximately 4 days.  Over the next  4 days I did have some stomach pain that would come and go, but it never required medication and it did not effect daily activity.

                                                Within 5 minutes, I felt weird and light headed.  My blood pressure spiked, temperature spiked to 101, heart rate was elevated and continued to be elevated for about 12 hours, and there was a rash across my chest and upper arms. On 1/14, I was extremely tired. On 1/15, I had a sore throat, headache, and still slightly tired. As the days went on, the cold symptoms got progressive worse. Extremely congested, runny nose, extremely painful headache, coughing up pflegm, sore throat, etc. On Wednesday, 1/20 I had a fever of 101. I had these cold symptoms for a week and a half and that was when I called my doctor. She gave me an antibiotic.  I was on the antibiotic 1/26 - 1/30.  Today is 2/4 and I&#39;m still coughing.   Something weird also happened, smells changed.  My coffee smelled awful and other things seemed extremely strong.

                                                1/28- Moderna vaccine to left deltoid approximately 1000 AM. Felt fine the rest of the day. Very tired in the evening and went to sleep early. Took PM medications- Xyzal 1 tab PO HS, Xanax 0.5 mg PO HS. 1/29-Woke to Left arm was sore, felt like I had received TDap injection, like I was punched in the arm- localized to Deltoid.  Took AM medications as normal- Wellbutrin XL 150 mg QD, Effexor 75 mg QD, B12 SL, Multivitamins QD As the day progressed, left arm soreness and discomfort became more pronounced and then went from localized to circumferential to left arm. Also noted discomfort and soreness to left axilla and soreness to left lateral/posterior cervical neck area. Became increasingly tired, weak, left arm was weaker than right arm with grip.  Headache was pounding and predominantly bilateral temporally.  Decreased appetite. Non productive cough.  Mid day, started to have freezing bilateral upper and lower extremities. Applied wool socks and clothing layers to accommodate. Temperature to forehead was 99.0, Right ear 101.4 and Left ear 102.0. Pulse ox 97% on room air. Took 1 gram APAP prophylactically, also took Zicam SL. Tolerated as much PO fluids as possible, water.  Increased flu like signs and symptoms for the rest of the day, no actual fever recorded. Literally had on thermals, top and bottoms. 2 pair of wool socks, gloves, and a hoodie. Wrapped in bed with 2 blankets.  Through the night, had discarded all clothing and remained in shirt and had sheet covering. Difficult night sleeping with the soreness to left arm and left axilla, was not able to get comfortable.  1/30- Woke, still, felt signs and symptoms of flu, body aches, pains, weak, tired, and decreased appetite.  A noticeable audible wheeze, shortness of breath with minimal exertion, and persistent dry cough. Cough remained non-productive.  All other signs and symptoms from the day before remained and the soreness to the left upper arm, left axilla, and left neck. Flu like signs and symptoms were just as intense as day before. Chills were consistently inconsistent with start and end, noticeable bilateral hands and feet were freezing. Afebrile, pulse ox 97% room air . Continued to treat prophylactically with APAP and Zicam, po fluids, rest.  1/31- Difficult night sleeping again related to discomfort to left side of upper torso. Felt a little better concerning weakness and being tired. Headache subsided some from it?s intensity. Started to have stomach discomfort, diarrhea, and remained short of breath with minimal exertion. Felt as if I was not able to expand my lungs to their full capacity, thus yawned a lot and had to continue to try to expand lungs. Continued to have flu signs and symptoms (not as intense as past 2 days), diarrhea STARTED, and feeling tired continued. Shortness of breath decreased in severity and lungs continued to feel a decline in expansion with inhalation. Continued to treat prophylactically and rest. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/1- Difficult night sleeping related to left upper torso soreness and discomfort. Diarrhea continued into this day. No nausea. Tolerating PO fluids; however, feeling weak and tired.  Left upper arm soreness and discomfort less than initial onset. Left axilla remained sore and left side of neck. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/2- Diarrhea subsided, flu signs and symptoms continued to decrease in initial intensity. Shortness of breath not as extreme; however, continued to feel as if not able to expand lungs to full capacity. Left upper arm soreness and discomfort almost resolved, left axilla beginning to decrease in soreness along with left side of neck. Only prominent s/s is feeling tired and inability to expand lungs to full capacity. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/3- Feeling 95% better, closer to baseline. Worst days were the first 2 after the injection; however, still remain unable to expand lung capacity to full expansion with inhaling, thus requiring multiple attempts and yawning. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile 2/4- 99% to baseline and feeling better, continue to have decreased expansion of lung capacity. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile

Day 3, felt fine. I could lift arm without any issues.  Day 4 to 5, started feeling the worse kind of fatigue, mild headache, all over body ache like my actual joints hurt and head feels pressure like it is in a fog.  I have a stuffy nose.  It is now February 5th and I still feel this way.  Everyone else I talked to had  just a sore arm and recovered within a day or two.  This is my 1st shot and I go back on February 26th for second shot.  I was asked by pharmacist that administered vaccine to report any side effects since this is a new vaccine.

It was sore from my neck down to just below my elbow. I began having chills and a low grade temp shortly after that. by 0130, I was dizzy, experiencing diarrhea, with episodes of diaphoresis, and acute nausea. I felt that I had some postural hypotension, was very pale and every time I would get up to walk I felt like I was going to end up on the ground. I remained in bed for approx. 16 hours before I felt like I comfortable even getting up and going to restroom. I still have intermittent dizziness, with syncope to this date.  I had to leave work early as well as calling in sick for the next shift.

I drove home, made dinner, and ate. Shortly after eating, around 7:00PM, the soreness in my arm got intense, I began feeling nauseous and disoriented. I went to the bathroom and got on my hands and knees because I thought I was going to vomit. My boyfriend helped me get up on the edge of the bathtub, but I quickly passed out and fell forward. He said I was out for approximately 30 seconds. I came to long enough to tell him to call my mom then passed out again. for about 15 seconds Within minutes my mom, sister and daughter arrived, followed by first responders. First responders had to keep me from passing out for about 10 minutes, during which time I broke into a cold, soaking sweat, had involuntary muscle convulsions, extreme nausea, disorientation, slurred speech, and loss of ability to get up or walk on my own. I was admitted to the emergency room around 7:45. It took another hour for me to regain muscle control, speech and total coherency. I was released and went home. My arm was severely sore until Monday morning, but I also experienced severe fatigue, nausea, headache and muscle aches until late Sunday.

I developed pins and needles with numbness that started under my feet,by the following day the tingling sensation was moving up to my arms. By day two of this symptoms,I deloped a severe hot flash on both my fit but with lessening pins and needles. The worst part of this is that I also developped very severe sore muscle and joint pains,equating it to like someone who has been beaten and like my musles are being ripped off the bones.That is what I am feeling up to now, I am not able to walk or drive now.

                                                8 days after the vaccine, I developed a blotchy red rash that trailed down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was red, swollen and painful to touch. Mild itchiness noted on that arm. Otherwise, I was fine. Just seemed strange so long after the vaccination. It improved without intervention and was gone within 2-3 days. I did not seek professional help because I read that this reaction was noted with the Moderna vaccine and that it was just considered a mounting immune response and no cause for concern.  However, I still thought I should report it. I have since received the second dose of vaccine on 2/19/21. I had moderate side effects starting on 2/20/21 (lasting 15 hours) of fatigue, chills, body aches, joint pain, headache, generalized body swelling, swelling and pain at injection site and brain fog. I didn?t experience a rash (yet- the vaccine was only 3 days ago). Will update if that changes.

I took two regular strength Tylenol at 9:30pm on 2/21 and that took the edge off so I could sleep. I woke up on 2/22 feeling better but still had a sore neck and arm. The whole time I had a sore arm starting on 2/20 around 3pm.

                                                My left arm, where I received the shot, began hurting after a few hours. Approximately 12 hours after receiving the shot, fatigue began. Approximately two hours later, I was unable to walk, I collapsed on the floor, my heart was racing, I was sweating, my entire body went numb, and there was ringing and static in my ears. After about 20 minutes on the floor, I got back into bed. My fingers and hands wanted to curl up and not open and that lasted throughout the night. My arms and legs stayed numb all night long.  At around 24 hours post vaccine, the numbness started to subside, I could open my fingers and hands, and regular flu symptoms were present (fatigue, body aches, low grade fever). I could not work the day after receiving the shot. I slept all day. I was not able to drive until around 5PM the day after receiving the shot. The second night and throughout the following day (so 36-48&#43; hours post shot), I had cold sweats. It is now 3 days later and I still feel terrible. I am worried about getting the second Moderna shot.

                                                After taking the shot I had a very mild metallic taste in my tongue.   After about 45 minutes later the metallic taste became much stronger.  My lips felt like they were drying out, my tongue felt like it was swelling and drying out, and it felt difficult to swallow.  The strong sensation only lasted a couple of minutes.  It is now 7:48 PM and I still have a &#34;very mild&#34; case where my lips feel they are either itchy or mildly burning and my tongue still feels weird and has a very mild metallic taste.  I did not have any issues with tasting anything.  I also have a very mild headache.

The next morning, I ended up have a lethargy reaction (9:00 am) - it was like I was a robot and I hd powered down. I couldn&#39;t sleep but I was sitting up and thought I was sleeping. I couldn&#39;t really talk. My co-workers were very concerned. Lasted a couple hours and I went home and I went to sleep and slept about 16 hours . I called off work the third day - I had slept so  much after that night before I had a  (first) gall bladder attack (in the middle of that 16 hours) it was very bad (the gall bladder attack). I had gall bladder attacks occur for the next few days. I ended up getting my gall bladder out last Friday - about a week ago. It was inflamed and full of pus. It was an emergent situation and I was hospitalized 18th and surgery on the February 19th. Lethargy eventually subsided (lasted a handful of hours)  and was then fatigued with no energy for about a week .

After day 3, I went to hospital thinking I had Meningitis because my head hurt so bad and my neck was stiff. They ran an urinalysis and found a pretty bad UTI.  The doctor said that the UTI exacerbated the side effects of shot. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true. I got I. V. Keflex and prescription. Migraine continued for another 3 or so days. I missed 4 days of work. Honestly the symptoms felt like I was doing chemo again. It was awful.

                                                1 week after shot I ,got &#34; arm&#34; that lasted 4 days along with chills and  very sore/ achy legs making it hurt to walk. I still have leg achyness and dizziness that prompted me to call my doctor to note it in my chart. on March 1, 2021. I soaked my legs in an upsom salt bath for comfort.   I now have light bruises on my legs and some feet and left hand tingling/numbnes.  My heart rate is elevated at different times of the day with simple movement; walking to kitchen or bathroom. Some dizziness/brain fog at given moments throughout the day.

                                                Initially there were severe flu like symptoms: chills, shaking, headache &amp; body aches, fatigue starting apx 2 hours following. These continued until apx 24 hours later when additional mental fog set it, difficulty focusing attention, lethargy, trouble walking, dizziness then brief loss of consciousness occurred, extreme difficulty staying awake. I was taken to the emergency room where additional tests were done due to &#34;stroke- like&#34; symptoms.  Tests were okay with hospital staff reporting that likely/only known cause was the COVID  vaccine given the day before. Symptoms have gradually reduced but occasional mental fog, occasional dizzy spells &amp; chronic fatigue persist.

Initially, I took 600 mg of Advil and seemed to help. But fever spiked 102.5 - symptoms get worse throughout the day. Advil brought down the fever some. Sleeping helped the most. These symptoms lasted about 48 hours. I missed a day and a half of work because of it.

                                                Injection site pain began approximately 2 hours following injection and continued to intensify and spread down the arm and up the neck and upper back over the next hour. A headache and intense fatigue began and I took 500mg Tylenol at that time. Approximately 30 minutes later I unintentionally lost consciousness and awoke several hours later confused and disorientated. I arose to get a drink of water and was unable to walk, falling twice within approximately 10 feet. I noticed my vision was affected as the entire room appeared to be rocking left to right even though I was holding myself still in an attempt to steady my sight and balance. I immediately went to bed and have no memories until I awoke the next morning. At that time, my vision and balance had returned to normal though the aches and pain in my arm, neck and back persisted. This pain slowly dissipated over the next 3 days.

                                                I stood up from a sitting position after smoking a cigarette and got a headrush that traveled through  whole body , and then I fainted for a few seconds.  After the first event, I never fainted again but had several headrush like dizzy spells over the next few weeks. These spells would last for 1-2 minutes, originally only occurred after smoking a cigarette, but then began to happen when I would stand from a sitting position when not smoking, and I would need to sit back down until the headrush passed. This reaction occurred periodically up until one week before my second shot (01/23/2021), and I have not experiences it since, not even after my booster shot.  I understand  it may not be related, however, I have been smoking for 30-years and have never experienced a reaction such as this one before.

Then Saturday during the day I started getting sore all over, had chills, headache, and took ibuprofen.  Saturday night I also ran a low grade temp of 100.3 and felt terrible, took Tylenol.  I started coughing during the night, which is said not to be vaccine related but I didn&#39;t have a cough or any of these symptoms prior to receiving the vaccine.  Today I still have a low grade temp, headache, fatigue, and a heavy feeling, but much better than last night.

                                                Middle of the first night following the administration of the vaccine, I woke up with notable lower back and hip pain that became increasingly severe over the next 7 days. On Days 5-Day 7 I also developed a rash on my torso and chest. Did not itch or cause discomfort and resolved within days of onset. By the end of the week, I was literally forced to lay flat on the floor all day.  I was completely floor-ridden Day 7-Day 10 .  Pain was predominantly on the lower right side, hip, glute, thigh...had some tingling on top of right foot. This pain most definitely interfered with my daily routine.  Could not get comfortable, could not exercise, could not sleep well. I eventually took my  meals on the floor....only up to use restroom and shower.  From Day 10- Day 12 things very slowly started to improve with complete resolution by the 2 week mark.  It was as if the shot caused my muscles to spasm so badly that my back was thrown completely out?  Or I had some kind of systemic inflammatory process that triggered my low back pain? I NEVER suffer from this kind of debilitating back pain . Typically hike 3- 5 miles per day.  Was extremely bizarre timing and perhaps it was a coincidence? However the sudden onset of this issue in conjunction with the timing of the shot seemed important. I was able to treat pain with Tylenol, muscle relaxers, and lots of rest.

                                                The day after receiving my 2nd vaccination, I was very sick with a high fever, headache, body aches, chest congestion, and generally just feeling bad. I also developed dizziness within days of my second injection and it has continued to persist and is getting worse. Sometimes I struggle to stand because of dizziness. I am also having extreme night sweats and very vivid dreams. I have never experienced these symptoms before. I got a double ear infection (never had an ear infection in my life) and strep (have not had in 20years) at the same time a couple of weeks ago.

My heart felt like it was fluttering and I felt weak and tired. I laid down and the symptoms continued with a tingling sensation, especially in my left arm, very slight tightness in my chest, and very cold feeling coursing through my limbs and body.  My heart felt like it was racing. The following day I felt weak, like my blood pressure was low though I didn&#39;t check it. I was tired, dizzy the following day with frequent fluttering heart feelings. I had a headache for a few days following.

                                                I was at home getting ready for bed when my arm felt a little funny so I looked at it and saw about 15 small bumps at and around the injection site. After about 1/2 hour they were getting bigger and had merged in to fewer larger bumps. I took a picture. about 2 hours later it had merged into 1 bump was hot and red. I called health because they were the ones who administered the vaccine. After speaking with the on-call nurse she recommended I see my primary care doctor with in 24 hours. The next morning the area was swollen about the size of a baseball , raised about 1/2 inch and hot as well as itchy. I was able to conduct a tele visit with my doctor and she said it looked infected and prescribed an antibiotic. When I got off work that evening I went and picked up the antibiotic and started them right away, by this time the swelling had grew to about a softball diameter. the next morning the swelling was greatly reduced and continued to shrink and disappear 3 days later. My skin had a strange texture to it in the area for about a month and a half.

                                                Shot administered Thursday, March 18th 1. Today (Sunday, March 21) I am able to lift my arm again (see #2 for arm pain) and in the shower realized the lymph node in my left armpit close to the injection side is very swollen and dense.  Right armpit lymph node is fine and difference is visually noticeable.  If by morning it has not gone down I will call my doctor, I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s bad enough to go to an ER on a Sunday night. 2. Day after shot (Friday, March 19), waking up the injection site was incredibly sore, beyond a what a normal shot causes (with the exception of the tetanus shot, similar pain).  I have been taking ibuprofen for pain, but having a hard time sleeping continuously, as waking up in pain.  Today (Sunday, March 21), pain has gone from what was severe to mild-moderate.  Still hurts if it gets touched, but I can now lift my arm without severe pain. 3. Headache since injection.  Similar headache to when I had Covid in December, but probably 50% as bad, so able to deal.  Still have headache, but not as bad as the day after the shot.

I sat still for the afternoon and noticed my resting heart rate bounce around. The highest was 129. On average it stayed around 89 for the next 2 days. (Usually mine is around 65)I was really tired but that could of been because I wasn?t getting good sleep as my heart was keeping me up. I lacked energy and the desire to do anything. This resumed until afternoon Sunday on the 21st. By late afternoon I had my energy back and felt like myself again. Still had some heart flutters but manageable and able to do daily activities again.  Today is March 24th and I still have some flutters but not too bad. Heart rate is back to normal.

The paramedics came and checked my vitals and my blood pressure was very very low but I got to feeling better and stayed there for more time. I was very very tired and my memory was kind of bad for the rest of the day. My husband said I was twitching and my eyes were rolled back when I was seizing and he was a little over a minute when I was seizing.

Said they thought vertigo. That week pulse was going up and blood pressure spikes started. I also started to not see things as clear getting bad pressure in face and forehead. I then had ent do epley maneuver that helped with spinning. However feeling like I wanted to spin would still happen even though I wouldn?t spin. Headaches on and off everyday couldnt sleep right for weeks. Pulse and blood pressure still going up. Then I never had this anxiety that started. Heart doctor put me on a beta blocker that?s been helping. I am 8 weeks from first shot and still not myself. Been on beta blocker for a little over a week starting to feel better bc pressure and headaches are under control. I have been to neurologist also. No one can really explain. I did get the second dose bc doctor said to on Feb 24th. I was fine till I took the vaccine on Jan 27th

I was given water and told to drink it and wait for 30 minutes. I lasted the whole day of work, but called out the next day.Body Aches chills within12 hours.   I had those symptoms about a week and a half. The night of the vaccine: About three in the morning, I developed achiness all over body. It was horrible. I was cold, lethargic, shivering. I used a heat pack. The migraine I had from the injection didn&#39;t go away for about a week which caused me to go to Urgent Care -  to get a shot - it may have been demoral but I&#39;m not sure. It helped with the migraine - it went down from a 9 to a 5. The symptoms just slowly went away after the week and a half.

Day 2: residual headache (50%), tiredness, weakness, sweating if doing things, residual knee joint pain, sense of smell/taste returned and heightened. Day 3: residual headache (25%), still not 100%, residual knee joint pain. Day 4 (today):  residual knee joint pain (comes and goes). I realize that these are not symptoms of an allergic reaction, but severe side effects.

                                                Patient had chest pain post administration of vaccine.  Patient attributed this to heartburn after eating a large meal just before getting her vaccine (though she didn&#39;t typically get heartburn). Since the pain continued to persist her BP was taken and was 160/110.  Patient said it may also be nerves but she didn&#39;t feel particularly anxious.  She also stated she hadn&#39;t had her BP medication that morning.  Patient took a couple of Tums and her BP was rechecked a few times.  Each time the BP stayed above what the patient said was her normal even without BP medication.  Due to the persistence of her hypertension and chest discomfort she was taken to the ED to be evaluated.  Once patient was in ED she had an EKG, CBC with diff, CMP, and troponin.  Provider eventually ruled it as an anxiety reaction (not cardiac related).

No other issues with allergic reaction.  Mild injection site soreness, mild body aches, 99.3 temp persist at 36 hours post injection.

                                                I woke up on 1/23/21 @ 3:30 a.m. with aches, chills, and low-grade fever, which I was told to expect.  I went back to sleep and slept much of the morning, afternoon, and evening of 1/23/21.  I alternated Tylenol and Advil in 3-hour intervals.  However, as the day wore on, my fever started going up, at one point reaching 107 degrees  (8:00 p.m. on 1/23/21) with a temporal thermometer.  I checked this with an oral thermometer to be sure, and it read 105 degrees.  Fortunately, I was able to take a cool shower and re-medicate with Advil, and my fever came down to 102.    By morning on 1/24/21, it was 100.7 and never got above that again.  The body aches and headache and low-grade fever lasted into the day on Monday, 1/25/21, on which I had to use a sick day at work.    During the morning and afternoon on Monday, 1/25/21, I noticed a strange feeling in my chest--a sort of pressure or tightening--for just a couple of seconds--and then it went away.    Tuesday, 1/26/21, I felt more myself, but I still have a lot of exhaustion and fatigue, though no fever, and the headache has diminished quite a bit.

                                                Swollen throat, tounge, dizziness, difficult breathing, increased blood pressure, nauseau, difficulty swollowing, headache. This were the immediate adverse effect withi in 5 to 10 minutes of receiving the shot. Followed by aches, chills, loss of appetite and days of swollend tongue and sore throat and difficulty swolling. My breathing was not affected as I did not experience a full anaphylaxis reaction but I continue with the discomfort a week and a half later. I have been taking benedryl, claritin, and fatmotidine which is what my doctor suguested I take to calm down the allergic reaction and it has helped a bit with the nauseau and the feeling of having a lump in my throat.

Tested on 1/1/21 and was positive. At the day of the vaccine I had a slight temp (99.9F) I was also fatigued seemed like I was ran over by a truck, but I slept it off and next morning I was fine. I still can&#39;t smell and taste still is not the same.

                                                I was sitting for observation and I felt chest ache/pressure. Nurse asked if I was okay and I didn&#39;t know. She took my Blood Pressure - 165/115 (not normal for me). She took it again ten minutes later - 150 something over 110. Put me in a wheelchair and took me to wheel chair to ER. I was in ER for 3 or 4 hours. EKG normal. My blood tests were normal. Blood pressure stayed a little bit elevated but it eventually came down - 145/92 (still high  for me) but they discharged me when it was still at that. It didn&#39;t feel like a panic attack or that I felt nervous  before the vaccine at all but they asked me if that was what I thought I was happening. Started running a low grade fever before I left the hospital - 99. something - I took two Tylenol and missed my shift that night.  I broke out in chills. I laid down and was tired. I tried to sleep it off for a day. The next day, I still felt a little tired but other symptoms were resolved although I do still have slightly high blood pressure since the shot and it wasn&#39;t high before the shot (that I was aware of). (My blood pressures were all normal - with my medication before that even for my surgery in September 2020.)

                                                Patient presented for 2nd dose of Moderna Covid Vaccine. While withdrawing the  needle from patient&#39;s  arm after injection of vaccine, some of the medication was expelled from the syringe and dripped down the patient&#39;s arm. The patient insisted on being given another injection. This staff spoke to the patient and advised that we have no data re what to expect by giving her a 2nd injection. Permission for 2nd injection was given by physician who oversees quality, and repeat injection administered. The patient was taking photos of the nurse while he was performing the injection and this is thought to have contributed to the medication error by causing him anxiety. Both doses were documented in the medical record.

                                                Patient was very nervous prior to injection. Patient received Moderna covid vaccine. Patient was instructed on waiting in the store for a 15 minute observation period. A few minutes later she said her vision was blurry, and then it had passed shortly thereafter and her vision was clear again. She also said she felt tingling in her hands and feet. The pharmacy technician called 911 and the medics arrived and she went to the hospital. The husband had stated he though it was her anxiety.

                                                Day of vaccine I experienced brain fog for about 3 hours. Typical soreness in arm for a few days and bruising at injection site. Arm remained tender but not bad and no concern until day 8, which was yesterday. That is when I experienced itching around injection site and swelling. Day 9 (today) the area below injection site is red, swollen (hard), tender, and the left shoulder joint aches. No other symptoms to report and this seems fairly normal. I&#39;m going to watch closely and take action if there are adverse changes. As of now, this seems like a typical reaction.

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine on 1/1/21.  Initially, I had a sore arm for 24 hours but otherwise no problems.  Then, on day 8, my left deltoid area started itching and there was a red, slightly raised area just larger than a golf ball. I called the  hotline at that time and took a Benadryl.  Then, 24 hrs later, the area had expanded to over 3 times the size and felt warm. I actually went and saw a friend who lived in my neighborhood who is a general surgeon and he thought I should get it checked out to make sure it wasn&#39;t an NSTI.  Being Saturday at 9pm, I went to the ER  where they started me on Keflex/Bactrim for a presumed cellulitis.  By the next morning, the redness and itching were gone and my arm felt totally back to normal the next day after that. Unfortunately, on day 3 of the antibiotics (Tuesday the 12th), I had symptoms of anaphylaxis (chest tightness, wheezing, throat clearing, lip swelling, hoarse voice, impending doom sensation).  I took Benadryl 50mg and got my epi pen ready but did not use it.  (I have a tree nut allergy).  The symptoms resolved completely about 1 hour later.

                                                Within 40 minutes my arm started to ache badly.  About 15 minutes after that while I was driving my head started to feel strange - almost lightheaded.  Within a couple of minutes my eyes involuntarily went to the left and the right and then my vision went black (this all happened in a matter of seconds).  I stopped at a store and felt light headed and confused/brain fog.  That continued at home for around 2 hours.  The pain in my arm continued to get worse.   I woke up several times throughout the night with pain in specific sites.  Today I was unable to go to work because of the full body muscular and joint pain, muscular weakness, headache, pain behind the eyes, and feel like I have fluid in my head (kind of like when you have a cold).   I had a significant reaction after the first dose as well (1/5/21 Moderna Lot 026L20A) but it was completely different - mainly arm pain, fever, chills, extreme fatigue, and what feels like fluid retention.  I gained 9 pounds without changing anything diet/exercise following the injection. On day 10 a large red welt appeared on my arm at the site of the injection.  On 2/1 my Endocrinologist sent me for lab work and urinalysis.  Those results are not back.   I likely would not have reported any of this if it wasn?t for the visual occurrence with the mental confusion and lightheadedness. I have never experienced anything like that in my life.

                                                Nurse did hit a capillary and I bled immediately after injection- enough where it ran down my arm and went onto floor. I felt pretty okay except for the feeling of my arm hot and fuzzy and fuzzy fingers on my left hand until my &#34;leave time&#39; of 10:03 am. I stayed a little longer, and was home by 10:30 when I became extremely nauseous, dry heaving, left side of face numb. Headache started at 10:40. Tried calling medical facility but was on hold for soo long- no one answered so since I don&#39;t have insurance I decided to just rest and drink fluids. By 11:40 my face was back to normal, no longer nauseous but extremely lethargic and was the rest of the day. The following day I felt ok -slight swelling on my arm at injection site and a bruise that I still have.

                                                Within about 45 minutes of receiving the vaccine I started getting mild hives spreading around the injection site and across my belly. I had mild wheezing and feeling of loose fluid in my brachial area of my chest. Now at 24 hr out, hives are head to toe, and I took diphenhydramine at bedtime in addition to my loratadine each AM.  I&#39;ve used my inhaler twice to see if that helped - it doesn&#39;t, so it&#39;s not a regular asthma attack.  Today I have intermittently dealt with mild sweats, moderate chills, mild nausea, shakes (might be the inhaler as that sometimes makes me shake), headache fluxing between mild to moderate, eyes watering and lids swollen slightly with hives, injection site soreness, swelling about the diameter of a softball (interfering with ROM on left arm - I am an interpreter, so this interfered with work a lot today!), left arm from shoulder to elbow is hot to the touch, and I have had mild disconnects with my ability to focus/breaks in completing thoughts today.    I am keeping my EpiPens close, just in case.  I live 3 miles to the nearest ER, and someone is here with me just in case I need to go.

                                                About 12 hours after I received the vaccine, I developed chills, muscle aches and fatigue. Approximately 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, I starting having neck and shoulder pain. I reached out to my doctors office on 2/4/2021 and I was informed that some people have experienced neck pain. I woke on 2/5/2021 around 2:00 in the morning with excruciating pain in my neck, rating my pain at a 10 using a pain scale from 0-10. Zero being no pain and 10 being the worst pain. The pain was slightly better throughout the day but I woke at 11:30 pm on 2/5/2021 with the pain again being at a level 10. I went to the ER where they told me it&#39;s a side effect from the vaccine. I will have missed 3 days of work so far.

My pulse was excessively high too. They called 911 and paramedics monitored me until my pulse slowed and softened some. My diastolic was still around 110. They allowed me to go home and lie down as long as I agreed to call them back or go to hospital if it didn&#39;t go below 100 after lying down a bit. It was 97 after about 40 mins,  then 95 after 1.5 hours, then 78 after 3.5 hours and 67 after 6 hours. I felt good again at that point.

I was very worried about the dark urine because I had history of hemolytic anemia. I went to ER and got diagnosed with Hemolytic Anemia after blood and urine test. Admitted to hospital overnight and dismissed with my request to do so with steroid prescription of steroid prednisone 20MG 3 tablets a day for 7days to suppress  my immune response for for the vaccine that believed to be one which triggered the Hemolytic Anemia. following up with Hematologist on Monday with extra blood draw to monitor my situation. Still not feeling well with fatigue, back lower pain and dizzeness .i still look yellow and urine dark .

                                                12 days post vaccine I experienced nausea, headache, lightheadedness, blurred vision. I waited to see if it would go away. I had lab work done, went to multiple appointments with 2 different clinics and now I?m set for a CT scan to rule everything out. I live a healthy lifestyle. I exercise and eat healthy. I don?t do drugs. I drink seldomly. To date, all of my labs are normal and the symptoms are the same as when I used to get migraines, although instead of a 1 hour migraine this one is lasting  now 11 days and counting. I am miserable, I call in sick and lay in bed all day. The symptoms have not lessened.

                                                About three hours after shot, arm started hurting. By the time I went to bed four hours later, intense pain deep in the muscle. Shooting through the arm. Woke up all night in pain. Next day, fatigue, and a bit of a cough, runny nose, general body achiness, a slight fever. Next day, felt mech better. Arm still aches a tiny bit, but all other symptoms gone. By evening, so 48 hours later, noticed a redness to my arms, like I&#39;d gotten sunburned. I&#39;m very fair skinned so burn easily. But when I examed it, I noticed tiny little red spots scattered over the area, like little broken spots of blood just under the skin. It doesn&#39;t itch, no swelling. But odd, and weird. So I decided to report it. Especially because the arm pain I experienced seemed so much more intense than others I have spoken to.

                                                I woke up at 3am on Tuesday with neck and jaw pain.   It was so bad on Tuesday that I stayed home from work. At 3:30 pm I took excedrin like I normally do.  I also applied Hempvana to neck and temples(I&#39;ve been using for several weeks). At 8:30pm, I began to have non stop diarrhea.  I went to bed at 10pm. Today, I woke up at 3:30 am with neck and pain on right side of face.  A vein is bulging out near temple on right side of face and I have a red bump about the size of a dime in temple area. My stomach is making noises but I don&#39;t have diarrhea.

                                                Nine days after receiving dose one of Moderna, the patient developed a 1.8X0.8X1.5 palpable lymph node in the right axilla. This prompted a complete workup for breast cancer in this 45 year old woman, and severe emotional distress.  This also resulted in 2 visits to a healthcare provider, and two additional visits to a health care facility for radiographic procedures.

These neurological symtoms have increased to involve both hands and both feet and part of palms and arch of feet.  Numbness and pins and needles feeling all the time now. do not know if nerve stuff will be permanent or not.  had to go on fmla due to disability related to this.

                                                9th, in the late afternoon, I started feeling really cold and I started getting headache and a lot of arm pain. It hurt to reach out to grab steering wheel. I felt very tired. I checked my temperature - 100.5. I got really cold and shivering at about 6:00 pm and I could not warm up for about 2 hours. It went to 101.5. Horrible pounding headache and dizziness. I started having stomach issues and diarrhea but didn&#39;t vomit. That went through the night - I felt like I had the flu. Back of my  neck was really stiff and achy - from shoulders up to the back of my skull. I didn&#39;t sleep much. I woke up completely soaked in the morning. My fever had broken. SUnday, I felt a little better. Dull headache ( it came and went). My temperature would go up and down -96.8 - to 100.1-ish all day. When my temp went up I got a headache and fatigue and down my headache would be better. Rolling every four hours. Monday, I stayed at 99.2 to about 100.2. Stayed at that the whole day. I was really tired. I had trouble thinking and concentrating. My arm was feeling better by Monday. Monday afternoon, about 1:00 my fever went to 100.5 and I called the nurse then. She told me to call my doctor&#39;s office. They sent me to a call to a triage nurse and she advised me to get tested for COVID. So Tuesday morning,  the 12th,at 9:00 am - healthcare clinic - the results were negative for COVID. Tuesday, I was feeling a little better - fever stayed around 99.2 to just over 100 and the headache was dull. I wasn&#39;t quite as tired. Wednesday, I was feeling better - like I could go to work but I didn&#39;t because of my fever the day before. I went to work on Thursday or Friday. The whole next week then I was better and felt fine. I got the second dose February 1.

                                                Hours after my injection my arm was extremely sore; much worse than the first vaccination.  I could barely move it.  I got in the hot tub which did help a bit.  I didn&#39;t sleep well that night and kept waking up feeling achy and hot.  Around 6am my temperature was 101 degrees F, I felt fatigued, had body aches, and the area where I received the shot was very sore and a bit swollen, so  I took IBU 200 mg.  A couple hours later my temperature was 102 degrees, my fatigue and my body aches persisted , so I took another IBU 200mg.  Around noon I started to get what felt like a migraine but my temperature was back to normal so I took an Excedrin migraine.  My body aches, fatigue, and headache were resolving as the day went on although my arm was still very sore.  I was a bit fatigued the following day but much improved.  My arm soreness resolved after a few days.

                                                Like others I had dizziness, headache after first vaccine. After second Moderna again like others, I was extremely ill with forceful vomiting and nausea, massive headache, dizziness, fever, chills, body aches. Etc.  My concern is that since the vaccine I have been having periods of major headaches with slight nausea but also bouts of dizziness.  I have NEVER had headaches. I also never got nausea while I lift weights,  workout or sometimes after sex. It seems when my heart rate gets elevated I?m having these reactions.   I?m writing tonight because I got a migraine style headache with dizziness after sex and I?m getting anxiety that these symptoms will not go away. Wanted to report them to see if I?m not alone. I?m a very healthy 46 year old. Had blood work tested recently.  I tested my blood sugars during these episodes as well and I used a pulse oximeter to test oxygen and all normal.   Thank you

Got up 3-4 times in the night to urinate (which is not normal) FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN GOT UP around 6:30/7:00am:  body temperature felt extremely HOT and stopped being able to walk or function.  Almost fell down from feeling dizzy/out of it.  Had to drop to the ground and stay there for a while.  Within about an hour felt mostly normal again.  Did NOT take temperature or blood pressure, would have if I hadn&#39;t been in a state of fear/shock.  Also itchiness in left deltoid 12 days after the vaccination, fingers on left hand accompanied this itchiness.  Felt irritated in general at injection site up to two weeks after. Digestion affected - loose stools for the week after and increased gas up to a month after injection (current)

As I write this it is currently 99.3. I normally run low at around 97. 99.3 is high for me and feels pretty crappy.  I have had some heart palpitations. Some of the worst chills I?ve ever had. A few dizzy spells. Fatigue. My arm still REALLY hurts. I?m dehydrated and keep having muscle cramps (I?m drinking lots of water and pedialyte). You need to know how people are reacting to this. This is day 4. I have no energy. I do NOT feel good.

                                                Allergic reaction:  About 5 minutes after the shot I started feeling flush and I turned blotchy red on my face, neck, chest, and arms. That flushing was followed quickly by mild shortness of breath, an overwhelming feeling of being so hot, a heavy-headed feeling, chest tightness, face and scalp tingling, confusion, hand tremors, and tightness in my throat. This all started during the 15-minute observation period. I raised my hand to report my symptoms, and the onsite nurses took me to a private area to monitor me. My heart rate was quite high (tachycardia) and my blood pressure was very elevated at 184/116. They gave me 50mg of benadryl and continued to check my heart rate and blood pressure. After 30 more minutes, my vitals still weren&#39;t really improving nor were my other symptoms, so the decision was made to call paramedics and have me transported to the emergency department for further evaluation/observation. After 30mg zyrtec, 50mg benadryl, 40mg famotidine, and 3 hours, I was feeling much better. My blood pressure was still elevated and my pulse pressure was quite wide, but my heart rate and other symptoms were improved so I was discharged to home, where I pretty quickly fell into a 3-hour deep slumber. I awoke still feeling shakey and confused. The confusion continued throughout the next day. It has finally subsided on day 3.

I sat down and put my head on the table. According to my husband, my eyes briefly rolled back into my head and I was convulsing for a brief period of time (5 seconds). I then sat straight up, sweating profusely, white a sheet and with a terrified look on my face started hyperventilating for a short period of time. My husband said I never actually fainted, but I don&#39;t have memory of this incident. After this episode passed I continued to feel feverish and achey. Temp about 100.7. Started to feel a little better 54 hours after injection.

Within 9 hours, headache had intensified and experienced a few waves of overwhelm from it. Took Ibuprofen and went to bed. .  Day 2: Headache had eased up by morning; shoulder discomfort still prevalent. Injection site sore with red circle, raised and warm.   Day 3: Stiff/painful neck. Circle on arm still red, raised, warm--about 3.5 inches in diameter.  Day 4: Stiff neck impeding normal activities. By end of day, arm finally looks to be improving and is tingly/itchy, but neck pain is radiating into throat.  Day 5: Injection site looks normal, still a little tingly. Neck persists, though no longer radiating--just still and painful.  Day 6: Neck persists.  Day 7: Neck persists. Intestinal distress in evening.  Day 10: finally some improvement in neck!  Day 11 (today): didn&#39;t even think about my neck until mid-day--much improved.

Started running a fever, got a sore throat, started coughing and by Friday evening my fever was 101.6 and I was extremely chilled and felt awful.  I had a terrible headache and no energy.   I woke up Saturday morning and my fever was gone but I was extremely congested, coughing, my throat is very sore and I feel like I have a sinus infection to be honest.  I have not gotten any better since Saturday.

Pain killers have little to no effect on dulling/minimizing the pain. Ice/heat dull for the initial 5 minutes of use, but cease to be effective longer than 5-10 minutes.  Within 24 hours I had a fever that would last 2-3 hours, go away, and then return with the highest temperature of 101.3. 48 hours later the fever did not exceed 100 degrees. I?m very tired 48 hours later, but this may also be from the inability to sleep with the excruciating shoulder pain.

I reported to EMT on site he said I was fine was probably due to not eating anything before vaccine. Left, got something to eat felt better. Arm sorness after injection that lasted 4 days, very cold feeling for 4 days after vaccine. Developed brain fog that still has not cleared up since vaccination. On 1/12/2021 I woke up for work, as I was combing my hair I noticed the lymph nodes on back of skull and neck were raised and very swollen. Started developing vision problems and stabbing pains in my eye. Immediatly called my PCP, he had me come in thought it was shingles and gave me Valtrex to take. This did nothing for me, no rash, no symptoms ever appeared. I called again and he had me go in for an MRI and CT of my neck/head. I still have motor skill problems, dropping things, brain confusion, lymph nodes all over my body are swollen at random times, I have now developed muscle spasms in my legs and feet. Was sent to a Neurologist as they thought I might have a MS lesion after brain MRI. Still ongoing treatment for that issue. I have had no energy at all since this vaccine, having difficulty talking to patients at work, still get dislexic problems, symptoms seem to get worse with higher levels of stress.

My body had horrible ache, shivering chills, unable to function and exhausted as if I was fighting a very high fever but with no fever at all. I took my temp every hour and it was 98.7 and below but my body was acting as if I had a fever. The second day I felt like I had the flu. Was completely exhausted after simple daily tasks, still some shivering and body aches. The third day I had a horrible headache, tightness in my chest and a bit of a cough. Each night after that, at the end of the day, I&#39;m more exhausted than normal, I have a headache and a little bit of sore achy muscles.

                                                From the time the shot was administered I could feel it running through my body.  I felt high (like I consumed Marijuana edibles) and had panic attacks until late in the evening.  I had no appetite.  My hands and feet kept getting cold.  I made an online doctor appointment with urgent care.  Doctor said this was normal but I don&#39;t feel like it is based on other people&#39;s experiences.  Now on day 2 my appetite still feels off but luckily I don&#39;t feel high anymore.   My arm is sore but I expected that.  I&#39;m scared to get the second shot knowing side effects will be worse.

Around 11pm I began feeling extremely nauseous and continued with the fever and chills.  By 1 am I began throwing up. I had about 3 episodes of throwing up/dry heaves. By this time, I also had body aches and the fever continued throughout the night. I would guess I got several 2 hour naps between being sick, but by 5am the nausea finally subsided. The next day the fever and chills continued throughout the day. I couldn?t eat much, so I wasn?t able to take anything for the fever. I did get some water down throughout the day, but I was dehydrated by the end of the day. I would say the worst of the symptoms lasted about 12 hours. The next 24 hours were manageable: minor soreness at injection site, body aches, headache, low fever. I needed to take a day off from work.

The day after around 11pm I had to go home because I had a fever of 102.6. Continued with a fever for two days, with chills and body aches. Especially a headache was noted even after my fever broke on the third day. Also a large, itchy rash is still around my injection site and I am on day three post shot. Went home from work early with a bad headache.

                                                Racing heart began approx 30 minutes after shot. About 3.5 hours later became shaky and started to sweat profusely with mild confusion. Was checked out by fire department with a pulseox and blood pressure. First blood pressure reading was 188/122 at which point they encouraged going to the er. I refused. They then decided to continue to monitor my blood pressure every 5 minutes. It slowly was coming down. When it reached 149/105 they allowed me to go home with advice to continue to monitor my blood pressure. If it began to increase they suggested going to the er or calling 911.  I continued to monitor my blood pressure at home every hour. It was slowly coming down, however the first normal (120/80) reading did not appear until 12:30 pm on 3/19/21.  On 3/18/21 at approximately 4:30pm a low grade fever of 100.5 developed with slight chills. At 8pm 3/18/21 I went to sleep after taking two tylenol and slept for 16.5 hours.

Fever all night, but I didn?t feel cold instead I felt I was burning I felt so hot checked temperate and it was 102 degrees, I could not get up from the bed my body hurt and it felt heavy. I was not able to go to work. Today 03/23/2021 the fever was between 99.9 to 100, back pain and head ache, and I feel weak tired. I didn?t take anything for pain because I read it could have adverse effects on the vaccine.

This included painful teeth chattering and clinching, accompanied by profuse sweating.  About 18 hours after the injection I experience a hallucination -like daze for several hours. Throughout the entire 24 hours following the injection I had severe pressure in my head, fatigue, nausea, and no apatite.  I am still having a hard time sleeping.

                                                Within 3 hours of receiving it I suddenly became very dizzy and lightheaded. My vision blurred and I felt like I was hallucinating. My mouth also became severely dry and I felt dehydrated. I have a metallic taste and have pain when I take deep breaths. I blacked out at one point and can?t recall anything. My temp was 103 all night Saturday and I never slept. Sunday I woke up Dazed, Confused and dizzy. I was extremely light headed and out of it.  I had double vision and was running into everything.  My heart has been racing non stop with a feeling of severe anxiety.  Tuesday I woke up again with sharp pain in upper left back shoulder/armpit along with severe dry mouth which feels like dehydration. My head still hurts, but somewhat manageable.  Fast forward 10 days later and I?m still experiencing dizziness, rapid heart beat, anxiety, dry mouth, feel dehydrated and headache.

                                                On 2/1 I started to feel rundown. On 2/3 I had no energy. On 2/4 I couldn&#39;t think straight. On 2/6 I got a covid test. Results negative. On 2/8 I saw a doctor who tested my electrolytes. Everything was good with labs. I was declining rapidly. I started to become very lightheaded and dizzy. I had blurred vision. I started to get migraines. On 2/11 I saw another doctor who did a bunch of tests like vertigo, said she could not figure it out. The migraines were severe and consistent. On 2/15 I went to the ER. They did a CT scan, EKG, more blood tests. She said she would diagnose me with migraines although I never had an issue with them before, and she was diagnosing me with it as a &#34;diagnosis of exclusion&#34;. I was bedridden. I had spots in my vision and couldn&#39;t drive. I felt like I was driving drunk although completely sober so I stopped driving. I had severe brain fog. I couldn&#39;t remember what happened 2 minutes ago.  They prescribed me propranolol and a triptan. I didn&#39;t take them because I felt that the diagnosis was wrong. Something was causing migraines, my whole body was experiencing something major. On 2/19 I went to another doctor for another set of eyes. I told him what I was feeling was systemic. I had been out of work for weeks. He tested me for B12 and Magnesium deficiencies. Everything was normal. I googled nonstop. I started feeling zaps like my body needed oxygen. My brain needed oxygen. The brain fog was so severe I felt like I had dementia. I kept googling... I came across iron... I started to take iron on 2/21. I went to the VA for more blood tests. The blood tests had some low markers like eGFR and slightly low MCHC. I was clearly very sick. The same day I could barely breathe well and I went to the ER. The doctor told me he &#34;deals with strokes and heart attacks&#34; and not what was happening to me. I asked him to please check my ferritin. He refused. I kept taking iron. On 2/22 I went to another ER with shortness of breath and all of the other symptoms. I felt like I was going to die. I had never been so sick. I am a very healthy person who eats healthy and exercises daily. This doctor refused to test my ferritin as well. She told me it was stress. I ordered my own labs using walkinlabs.com. I had read that ferritin can be falsely elevated if the body was inflamed and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what happened because at the time my ferritin was normal at 48. I kept taking large doses of iron (within safe limits) because my symptoms matched iron deficiency without anemia and the causes of it fit me. I read many many medical journals regarding our ferritin ranges and how ferritin should be 75&#43;. I had never had an issue with it before. I swore it was iron. Every day 2-3 symptoms would go away.  I saw another doctor shortly after who dismissed all of my symptoms again. It was the sickest I had ever been and 4 doctors, 3 ER&#39;s all dismissed me. I was beyond frustrated and lost faith in the medical community. Some mentioned it could be the vaccine but they did not question it too much. I went to a naturopathic doctor. She did a thorough test on 3/9. My ferritin came out as a 21 on this date (after 16 days of taking large amounts of iron). She thought maybe I was already iron deficient and that when I got the shot, maybe my immune system couldn&#39;t handle both. I left it at that.  Meanwhile, another coworker, had also been out 3 weeks. He had deteriorated severely about the same amount of time after the Moderna Vaccine that I did. I didn&#39;t think much of it as he had diverticulitis. He is also a healthy eater and exerciser. Today he is still very ill. Today he told me that his Kidney doctor just found out that his Iron was completely depleted! His labs were off the charts low. Coincidence maybe, but too similar to not consider as an adverse reaction to the shot! And how many people may have the same symptoms who don&#39;t know? As of today I am still very weak and tired but I am able to work.  I don&#39;t feel as sharp. Iron did fix a lot of the symptoms but iron deficiency usually comes on slower. In this case it is like I FELL OFF OF A CLIFF. I deteriorated so hard and fast and was terrified. My family was terrified.

Itching grew progressively worse on D1 and I was up most of the night. Morning of Day 2 I checked my skin in the mirror and there were hives on my hear, face, neck, torso, arms, and legs. Hives continue to pop up as D2 progresses. Took Benedryl 25mg with little to no relief. Took Prednisone 40 mg 2-3 hours after Benedryl and took 50mg of Benedryl 4 hours after initial does. At the time of writing this report it&#39;s been 2ish hours since taking the Prednisone and 30-45 minutes since taking Benedryl 50mg. I am having some relief from the itching.

Starting 18 hours after injection-  Severe Joint pain and moderate muscle pain for 3 days - unable to do normal tasks, slept extra, acetaminophen and ibuprofen only resolved the pain 20%. Pain Symptoms resolved upon waking on the fourth morning.  Starting 18 hours after injection-  Extreme tiredness for 3 days with moderate tiredness for additional 1.5 days.  It felt worse than when I had Flu B last year, but resolved  quicker.   Note: second shot given  4/16/2021 and outcome was much much less. Just moderate joint pain and tiredness and only for 2 days and ibuprofen resolved the pain 80%.

                                                I  got my second dose of Moderna vaccine on Wednesday. The day after the first dose, I was very shaky all day, had diarrhea, and ended up with hives on my arms, neck and face. The hives went away pretty quickly after taking Benedryl. This is now two days after my second dose. I&#39;ve had intense body aches, fatigue, headaches, and today developed hives all over my chest and stomach. I have taken one Benedryl and the hives are still there.

                                                Received shot on a Thursday afternoon and felt fine that evening.  The minute I stood up from bed Friday morning, it hit me like a ton of bricks- instantly:  Fever, chills, joint and muscle pain, lightheadedness, increased heart rate, exhaustion, migraine-like headache...all severe.  I don&#39;t recall the last time I was so ill and in pain.  Did not lessen at all throughout the day.  Took Advil 3 times that day.  I tried to go to work but couldn&#39;t stay.  Had to take a sick day.  Went to bed at 9:00pm and slept until 9:30am.  I usually sleep 6-7 hours.  I broke out into a sweat multiple times through the night.  The following day, I woke up much better but still weak.  By the end of that day, I was probably back to 75%.  I was back to normal on Sunday.  It was horrible experience and will unfortunately prevent me  from getting the vaccine annually.

                                                Following the vaccine I was slightly dizzy, after 25 minutes my chest started to get tight, had difficulty breathing, racing heart rate, some constriction in the throat.  I was taken to the ER, used Proair inhaler on the way to ER to ease breathing,  O2 sat slightly decreased but returned to normal in the ER.  Due to difficulty breathing, I had some increased anxiety which lessened after breathing became easier.  Nebulizer treatment given in the ER.  Benadryl 25mg taken.  Rash on L arm and upper chest, burning and pain in L arm.  Benadryl taken for 2 days due to returning rash and burning in arm.  Nebulizer treatments every 4 hrs on the day of the vaccine due to continued tightness and difficultly breathing.  The following day I had fatigue, slight fever, pain of 7 out of 10 in L arm, headache, neck and muscle pain.  Followed up w/ primary care physician on 12/29/2020, he advised not to take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  L arm pain lessened to 4 out of 10 on 12/30/2020.  L arm pain dissipated on 12/31/2020, but headache, neck pain and fatigue continued through 1/1/2021

                                                Two hours after the injection, I started to not feel &#34;right.&#34;  My head felt heavy, I was getting a little dizzy and all I wanted to do was to lie down.  By the third hour, my body completely shut down.  I was so tired I had no energy to move, to talk, and even breathing was difficult (not because I couldn&#39;t breathe, just that the effort was difficult).  I was dizzy, nauseous, and lost my appetite.  My temperature was elevated, 98.5, but no fever.  I slept for 5 hours as if in a coma.  Woke up to drink water, felt total-body aches, and slept the rest of the night again getting at least 12 more hours of sleep.  At some point during the night, I had chills so bad my body was shaking uncontrollably.  I had 2 layers of clothes and 3 layers of blankets and could not warm up.  Day #2 (today), I have a tremendous headache, dizzy, nauseous, my heart rate is abnormally fast and I am out of breath.  My resting heart rate is typically upper 50&#39;s and is currently averaging in the 70&#39;s, jumping into the 90&#39;s often.   Sitting up, my heart rate is between 80-100 (which is typically my rate when I exercise).  When I stand up or walk to the other room, my heart rate is around 115-120 (typical of when I am running/sprinting or participating in taxing exercise).  Along with this, I am out of breath as if I am exercising, although I am barely moving around. All I am doing is laying down, only getting up to go to the bathroom and my body feels like I ran a marathon.  Breathing is difficult even at rest.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12 at 1:30pm I felt the onset of chills, body aches, headache, fever, and  nausea. Additionally, the area where the vaccine was administered (left upper arm) was tender to the touch and red. On the same day, at 5:00pm all symptoms were at an extreme level where I had to lie down to rest, however, the pain of the body aches, headache, and chills made it difficult to rest (sleep) On the morning of Wednesday, January 13 and throughout the day all symptoms were still at an extreme level making it difficult to function (unable to get out of bed, no appetite to eat due to the nausea,  unable to sleep due to the headache, extreme discomfort) these symptoms continued on this level throughout the morning, into the afternoon and into the evening On the morning of Thursday, January 14 all symptoms with the exception of the nausea and headache had subsided The headache and nausea subsided by 11am on Thursday, January 14. I am now feeling better and could eat and function.

                                                My initial side effect on Monday 1/11/2021, was slight dizziness after about 5 minutes. I was not impaired, and it faded after about 10 more minutes. The next day, the arm that received the injection was very sore and achy.  It was difficult to get dressed, and the ache was located from my collar bone to my elbow of the injected arm. This ache lasted 3 days.  My range of motion has returned. On Wednesday (48 hours post injection) I began to develop an itchy rash on the insides of my arms in the soft tissue area.  I took two benadryl last night and applied benadry cream to the rash.  This morning, 1/15, the rash has spread down my arms onto the back of my hand, and onto my torso.  It is itchy.  Taking more benadryl, and I called my doctor.

Today is day 12 post vaccine and I am still experiencing this effect. I have contacted my doctor who advised me to go ahead and fill out.

                                                On 1/14/ 2021 @ aprox 6pm, the injection site suddenly began burning sensation and had a raised white ring around a red hot center. It began as the size of Suzanne b Anthony coin.  Over the course of a few hours the white rind turned I to a larger knot/lump the size of a silver dollar. I began feeling feverish and the entire arm ached. The itch was intense so I used topical anti itch cream in an attempt to subdue the sensation. It helped slightly. I also began oral antihistamines and a fever reducer , following protocol as if I had been stung by a bee/wasp and experience a similar reaction.  On 01/15/2021  in the am I decided to report my reaction via the V-safe app that was given in the pamphlet at the time of the drivethru clinic. It allowed me to set up my profile and make an initial report, however after an hour had passed my arm had continued to swell, itch, and become painful to use and I was unable to continue my daily activities. The swelling had a strange bruising appearance aprx 4inch in size  so I tried to report it to the app. At that point the app would not allow me to report and just kept sending sign in codes that would allow anything. Over the course of the next few days the app kept sending codes but would not allow for anymore updated reporting.  I decided to email our health department who had provided the drive thru vaccinations on 1/7/2021 and 1/8/2021. Thats was 1/14/2021. On 1/16/2021 a reply was finally received with only instructions to contact my person primary care physican. I do not have health care. health Department did send a link to this reporting form.  Today 1/20/2021 the redness and swelling have subsided leaving a faint 6inch discoloration under the skin. The shoulder joint and elbow joint ache dully and the bicep muscle spasms at times of use. Physically I feel better at the time of this statement. I did take a couple of pictures at the beginning of the reaction of the affected area/arm.  Others in our area on these same dates gave experienced delayed reactions to different degrees as well.

                                                Fatigue hit within a couple of hours; So tired and this was fall in to bed and be out. I slept for awhile - I rested all day the second day. I was getting dizzy and; muscle pain; a lot of joint pain (normally I&#39;m not in a lot of pain and never this tired). I needed a cane to walk I went to work on Wednesday and I had to leave early (11:30). Wed - horrible diarrhea Started getting a little confused and  still had dizziness and joint pain was bad. Couldn&#39;t take care of patients. Went to work on Thursday and I had to leave earlier yet that day - by 9:00 am - Started having chills  but didn&#39;t have fever and still had other symptoms and was getting confused.   Had an excruciating headaches and nausea (no diarrhea but extreme nausea) and that day started light and sound sensitivity - so bad. Was getting scared driving home - and had very slurred speech. Couldn&#39;t drive for a week after that(. My sister was on the phone with me helping me stay alert and drive safely on the way home from work on that Thursday.) Thursday when I got home. - had Telemed visit - Set up appt for a rapid COVID test - and a flu test so my sister drove me and I slept the whole way there. My sister said my speech was slurred; confused in my speech and I felt like that for three days. Both (Covid and flu) tests came back negative. Times when my sister couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying and I slept more than I was awake (Thursday - Saturday was like this). Took Imodium for diarrhea when I had that. For joint pain - I treated it by tramodal 50 mg and I can take it as needed and I usually don&#39;t need it but took it consistently during this time.  What scared me the most was I could feel my Hip Implant  - ball and socket joint from bone all the way to my femur( I had Right implant on Hip on May 2019) - which is healed completely but I felt it at this time. I still can&#39;t lay on my right side without pain - like a deep bone pain.  I was going to call my surgeon today.  January 4th visit with my Dr - for check-in - He gave me a clearance to go back to work on Wed the 6th. I work two days a week; I&#39;m on disability and so have been able to work since then. Right hip pain is still  a lot and bouts of dizziness and still have joint pain. Have to take a minute and a couple of breaths to stand up. Some days I do have to use may cane. Chills are gone.

                                                Just prior to 5P had left arm pain -that traveled to my hand. At 5PM driving and heart rate went 128 - most likely higher (registered on iwatch). This is abnormal for me as my heart rate is typically in high 40&#39;s (marathon runner).  Along with the rapid heart rate felt like throat was closing - like a reaction caused by an allergy.  The rate rate stayed like that for about a minute or two followed by severe chills (chills can be described like when a person comes out of the OR).  I felt like I was coming out of my skin and became dizzy. I became nervous and called 911.  In discussion with the 911 dispatch everything subsided and decided I would continue driving with an intent to going to Hospital.  About 10 minutes later, prior to getting onto I95 the same cycle with increased heart rate followed by chills occurred again for about the same timeframe.  I do not know how far apart the cycle was occurring other than I ended up calling 911 again and Ambulance was dispatched while I was on I95 and I had pulled over.  Approx arrival of ambulance was about 6P Once in the back of the ambulance, I showed no arrhythmia and heart rate was now in the 70&#39;s, however I was still having the chills.  Decided to drive home after waiting about 20 minutes in the back of ambulance with no further issues of the tachycardia. Once I was home I continued with chills and a high fever throughout the night.  The fever did not go away until about 48 hours. The chills went away by the following morning. Thursday and Friday have had chest tightness and the feeling of needing to take large breaths to expand chest.  Continue to have moderate headache.

Headache, chills, fever and feeling tired are gone.  Still a little achy.

                                                The vaccine was administered incorrectly.  The IM injection was given too high on the left arm.  The injection immediately caused significant pain in the left shoulder which worsened throughout the day and into the following day.  The significant pain in the left shoulder has persisted and is accompanied by decreased AROM, decreased strength, and sleep disruption.  Treated with Ibuprofen 800mg q8h and ice with minimal benefit.  Saw PCP on 01/29/2021 who recommended continuation of same and ordered a PT referral.  Was unable to work for 3 days due to this complication.

                                                Became nauseous and started vomiting approximately 20 minutes after the vaccine. She initially refused to go to the emergency room by ambulance. The vomiting continued and she then passed out and became diaphoretic. 911 was called and she was transported to the emergency room. I later spoke with a nurse at the ER and tests were being ran. She said they did not feel it was vaccine related. She did say the doctor said she had a panic attack.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine, my head and face felt tingly and my cheeks felt like they were on fire, I was having to concentrate on what I wanted to say. I felt really drunk. I went back up to the vaccine clinic and the Pharmacist and RN  took my vitals and sat me down. My blood pressure was high. After 15 minutes of sitting in a chair they took my vitals again and had me lay down in a bed with my feet up in hopes of making my blood pressure go down. After about 45 minutes my blood pressure started to go down. After about an hour and a half my head started to clear, but I had developed hives on my face and chest. The pharmacist gave me liquid Benadryl and then monitored me for another half hour. Once my hives started to look better they sent me home, where I slept for the rest of the day.  2/4/21 the next day I woke up with a headache but otherwise felt ok until about 3:00pm when I developed body aches, chills and a fever of 100.8. I took some tylonal and rested  until bed time. When I got up the next morning I felt alright. Just a mild headache.

Left clinic after 30 minutes not realizing I was having a reaction.  About 35 minutes after injection started feeling lightheaded, more anxious, and slightly confused.  Drove home for 20min.  Once home (approx 3pm) I gave myself 2 doses of Epipen Jr., 25 mg Benadryl, and 20 mg Pepcid.  I started feeling better, thinking clearer.  Approx 10 minutes later I again became slightly confused and anxious and began having increased throat tightness, chest tightness, and cough. After continuing to not improve I went to Urgent Care arriving approx 4 pm.  At that time I was given 40 mg prednisone and another dose (0.3mg) of sq epinephrine.  I immediately had improvement in breathing, thinking, and throat tightness.  I continued to have mild throat clearing and cough for approx 24 hours.

I had severe muscle aches the day after the shot and the night of the shot. I had stomach cramps and threw up once. I was very tired and slept the entire day following my injection.

                                                Covid vaccine time line 1st Moderna vaccine on 1 2 21 (Sat) given at PMH at 5:10pm.  Tired x 3 days with some cognitive issues noted (very slight..like forgetting things I never do?was slowly resolving but never completely went away.  I did not even mention this to anyone because I was not sure it was the actual vaccine, or just my brain.) 2nd Moderna vaccine on 1 30 21 (Sat) given at PMH at 2:40pm.  Immediately had more pain in L arm, swelling in upper arm and redness, fatigue. --Sun. 1 31 21:  woke up with a low grade fever, increased fatigue, chills, nausea, diarrhea, headache, body pain, joint pain (it hurt to even shower).  Fever got higher?max 100 (I think, as I was taking Tylenol at this point) and fatigue got worse by nighttime. --Mon. 2 1 21:  Called out of work due to reaction but fever was lower around 99 and less fatigued (ie I could get off of the couch, clean a bit, take care of my son).  Still rested a lot, had diarrhea, nausea, headache off and on t/o day. --Tues. 2 2 21:  Had a planned day off anyway.  Same symptoms as Monday and same energy level.  Felt positive about going back to work on Wed. --Wed. 2 3 21:  Woke up feeling the best of the past days and went to work.  Still fever of 99 and I noticed I was ?off? all day.  Example:  I forgot my schedule book and Id tags at home (I NEVER do that).  Made weird ?forgetting? mistakes.  By 1pm I was EXHAUSTED and having diarrhea, nausea, chills, and headache.  Called the Employee Exposure Line and my manager.  Went and got COVID test at request of EL and contacted immunologist and primary MD.  Immunologist is on vacation x 2 weeks and covering MD deferred to whatever primary said.  Dr. covered for my primary MD, Dr.  She asked me to touch base with her on Thurs after results from COVID test, but she recommended that  I rest ?and let my body adjust to the vaccine?. --Thurs:  2 4 21:  Up at night from 2:30am on and off with nausea, diarrhea, chills, headache, weakness, shaking, brain fog, sweating.  I am also having some anxiety at this point.  COVID test negative.  I did send a message in MyChart to Dr. as requested.  She called me later in the day and instructed me to drinking fluids and rest.  She ordered blood work which I did go and do.  Also contacted Urgent Care though MyChart and spoke with a CRNP about my symptoms.  She felt that they were a reaction to vaccine and my anxiety. --Friday:  2 5 21:  Called out of work again due to all of above symptoms.  Diarrhea has resolved and no longer any fever, however fatigue, lightheadedness and dizziness,  headache, ?brain fog?, and cognitive symptoms remain.  I am off balance and have difficulty concentrating  and reading.  I did communicate with my neurology office and they stated that it is ?just a reaction to the vaccine?. --Sat:  2 6 21:  Called Employee Exposure line to report same symptoms as above.  Same headache (almost migraine?  Having an aura?)  I am not sure why I feel so foggy.  Did have some ?clearing? of my head in the afternoon. --Sunday:  2 7 21:  Woke up feeling worse immediately.  Horrible headache, lightheadedness, off balance, difficulty focusing and concentrating.  No fever.  Called Employee Exposure Line to report symptoms and they recommended that I call the Urgent Care MD again.  Called urgent Care MD through MyChart again and tried to go into see her at Healthcare, however it was snowing hard and I slipped 3 times so I called the Healthcare and made apt for Monday 2 8 21 for 10:30am. --Monday:  2 8 21:  Headache, lightheadedness, fatigue, off balance, difficulty with multitasking as of this AM.  Went to Healthcare and saw CRNP.  She wrote for Augmentin for possible sinus infection and I filled at the pharmacy.  She instructed me to see my neurologist regarding possible neuro symptoms from COVID injection reaction.  I communicated with workers from comp team.  I am allowed to see the neurologist from the Dr. office.  I called their office and office manager tried to refer me back to primary.  I insisted that I see the lady as I was referred from CRNP at Worker?s Comp.  They were agreeable to a telemed appointment as soon as I get my claim number.  I am exhausted, have a headache, and difficulty focusing at this point.  Sore throat started this AM and is way worse tonight.  B swollen glands near carotids.  Started Augmentin. --Tues: 2 9 21:  Cont headache, lightheadedness, fatigue, off balance, difficulty concentrating, difficulty with lights and sounds.  Trouble reading.  Saw neurology this AM at 10am in the office as opposed to telemed visit and had a MRI at 12pm.  She diagnosed a fair amount of things including vaccine reaction possibly causing intractable headache, migraine, dizziness w/o vertigo.  Wants me to start to Propanolol for the headaches.  Need to pick up from the pharmacy.  Out of work until 2 15 21 and then a partial return to work?  Not sure how that works.  Hopefully just feeling better and can go back full time.  I have to contact the neurologist through portal at the end of week to update on progress. Health care called me and wants me to have a visit with a vaccine specialist.  I need to fill out CDC form for vaccine incidents.  Bad headache tonight that started behind R eye and is now whole head.  Need to call ENT tomorrow to discuss MRI results.  Left the neurologist a question on portal about MRI.  --Wed. 2 10 21:  Woke up with light headedness, fatigue, dizziness, off balance, feeling ?off? cognitively.  Pressure around R eye and R sinuses.

                                                Fatigue - I was unable to work that day. I was so tired. Pain - in my arm to the point that when I moved my arm I felt like I was going to pass out - it hurt that bad. I felt nauseous like I would vomit. I didn&#39;t vomit. Had a headache on day two (I have been having headaches since I had COVID in July 2020). I took Tylenol for that severe headache and that helped and it was just that one day that it was severe.  The worst, was my heart - increased heart rate - anything I did just was difficult on my heart. My heart - was having a hard time - standing, brushing my teeth - was exhausting for my body. That type of exhaustion went on for five days. I was able to feel better by day 11. But my heartrate is still poor. Depending upon what I did - 10 to 30 beats over my normal - just normal work. 40 beats over when I&#39;m attempting a more intense exercise. A slight jog puts my heartrate to 180. My heart rate still hasn&#39;t subsided yet - it is still above average above post COVID ( I had COVID in July of 2020). My heart rate was still at an elevated rate post COVID but worse after the vaccine. I have chest pressure now - like someone sitting on my chest - that started day two after the vaccine. Even when I&#39;m resting, I have chest pressure - it comes and goes and there seems to be no pattern as to why. Didn&#39;t have a doctor visit this second time yet. I treated with Tylenol for the pain at the injection site and for that headache and then I just rested my body.

                                                Two weeks after my first covid vaccine, I experienced weak muscles., light headedness, brain fog and general malaise. It was alarming due to being so far after the foretold reaction time. I tested negative for covid twice because the symptoms lasted two weeks right up to my second dose.  My doctor stated that this far of a delayed response was uncommon but hoped it wasn&#39;t unusual and to keep hydrated.  On 2/25, one week after my second dose which was administered 2/17, I experienced acute blurred vision followed by memory loss. Events that I participated in had to be told to me with my having no recollection of them. I was told that I spoke of feeling dizzy &#34;like  being on a boat&#34; and feeling brain fog before falling asleep for hours. I wake up with no memory of any of the events. This has happened three times since.  2/25, 2/26 and 2/28 so far.  It is very alarming and concerning and I wonder if it is normal to have these side effects although they are not mentioned on any website I have visited when researching side effects. I have once again contacted my doctor for further advice.

                                                2.5 hours after injection I started feeling weird, clammy cold sweats, nauseous and it felt like my eyes were bulging or like an intense pressure behind my eyes, blurry eyesight, extreme headache.  I have not ever had any issues with my blood pressure only my diabetes.  It had recently been slightly elevated but controlled mostly. I knew it was high and it suddenly just came on even after not eating at that time. I proceeded to flush with alot of water and some walking to bring it down. I wasn&#39;t exactly sure of how high it got because I don&#39;t normally have to bring my tester to work with me. However as soon as I got home I tested it and even after heavy flushing and exercise my glucose level was down to 500. It has never been that high ever. I continued to flush and monitor and not eating due to nausea and headache I was taken to the hospital. At that time my glucose reading was at 400. I was given 10 units of novolog as well as 1 full bag of fluid thru an IV.  And before I was discharged it had come down to 192.  I have only had to have insulin 1 time since 2008-9. Since then my sugar is refusing to come down below 250. My vision is still not clear and I am now attempting to keep it down with 15 units of a fast acting insulin multiple times a day. I will also be starting metformin again as of tomorrow morning to also help bring it down to a more healthy level due to the possibility of another life altering stroke.

                                                15 minutes after vaccination received, she says she had a sore throat but did not tell anyone at the vaccination site. Started feeling that left hand was burning. Then started getting nauseous 3.5 hrs later with upset stomach. Then had &#34;burning&#34; feeling in all her joints (migratory in pattern). Then headache. Then face numb on left side (never happened before, usually gets the numbness on the right side with her atypical migraines) - still numb 1 day later when she discussed with me. Could not sleep the night after getting the vaccine. - No new BEFAST symptoms (balance issues - usually has some imbalance issue, visual changes, facial asymmetry, arm/leg weakness, speech slurring or difficulty)   All joint pains resolved 1 day later. Arm is sore 1 day later with left hand pain. Still nauseous 1 day later. Nausea resolved within 1 week.

About 40 hours after shot I woke up in the night feeling very nauseated.  I also had a slight temperature but the nausea was so strong thats mainly what I was feeling.  I spent the next 10 hours with extreme vomiting &amp; dirarea to the point of weakness &amp; dehydration. At lone point lost control of bowels.   This is all extremely unusual for me and I&#39;d had nothing unusual to eat or drink on that day/the proceeding days.  I took an ambulance to ER bc I live alone and was too sick to drive.

On her VAR form, she indicated &#34;no&#34; on #5 that if she ever had a reaction after receiving a vaccination, including fainting or feeling dizzy questions on the VAR form. She also had history of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.  We gave her Covid 19 vaccine and noticed she was nervous about the shot that she is getting. We ask her to stay in the pharmacy for at least 15 minutes for adverse reaction observation. About 5 minutes in while she was sitting , my technician noticing that the patient is not normal like she is about to faint and call the pharmacist on duty for attention. The pharmacist ran to the patient right away and noticed the patient starting to faint and unconcious, the pharmacist told technician on duty to call 911. We laid her down on the floor to see if we need to process CPR but she regained her concious and alert after about 30 seconds. The paramedic arrived within couple minutes and check her vital and they said her BP is low and she agreed to go to the  Hospital for check up. Paramedic took the patient with on stretcher.

                                                Around 10:00 a.m. the day following my first shot, I started to feel like I had the chills/a fever.  I was at work so just took some tylenol to help with this and it helped a little until around 2:00 p.m.  At 2:00 p.m., I started to feel much more feverish and achy.  By the time I arrived home at 4:00 p.m, I had a fever of 101.7, I was achy, and very fatigued.  I felt this way all night long and slept on and off from about 5 pm until 5:30 a.m.  By about 10:00 a.m. the second day after my shot, I no longer had a fever and the achiness was improving but I still felt fatigued.  By Day 3 after my shot, I attempted to work out.  I was able to work out for about 30 minutes before feeling very fatigued.  By Day 4 after my shot, I felt like normal again.   FYI...I was diagnosed with Covid in October, 2020 and had tested positive for Covid Antibodies and blood donations in December 2020 and January 2021.

Then at 4 pm tingling and swelling started to the right side of face from jaw line to below left eye. Became foggy headed and felt as though shaking all over. Then around 5 pm lt side of neck from shoulder to ear on left side   I took ibuprofen at 8 am and 4 pm. At 6:30 pm a tightness across the top of my chest but no shortness of breath or fever or actual chest pain no difficulty swallowing. At that time I called the pharmacy and spoke  with someone (I think that was his name). He advised me to take Benadryl and ibuprofen and to go to er if any shortness of breath and to report to this site.

                                                Between one and two hours after the vaccine the injection site was surrounded by a five inch circle that was swollen and red, hot to touch and tender. Within 4 hours of injection every part of the extremity (right arm) was aching and my elbow and wrist and shoulder had pain and stiffness. Over the next two weeks the pain became worse  in every muscle in my right arm And shoulder as well as ligaments and joints there. In the third week after injection the pain spread throughout my shoulder (front and back) throughout shoulder blade area.  As of today March 27, 2021?o have had periods of numbness and tingling from the tips of my fingers throughout my arm to my shoulder and upper back right shoulder area. I have also not been able to lift a gallon of milk to pour into a glass, it is like my strength is gone in my right arm. I could not turn the car steering wheel today and therefore am Afraid to drive. Also I am noticing my knee and ankle and hip have had dull aching pains today. The pain is stabbing , dull, aching and incapacitating at times. I kept thinking these are temporary and will go away, but have done the opposite and gotten worse as time progresses. Should I get the second dose?

The patient denied having any allergies, past medical history or concomitant medications.  Therefore, no medical history or concomitant medications were reported.  On 14-Jan-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #: 251L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10-Feb-2021, approximately twenty-four days prior to the onset of events, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #: 16M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06-Mar-2021 the patient had a &#34;TIA&#34; (transient ischemic attack). She was sitting down and when she got up, she got dizzy and her left arm was paralyzed. The right side of her face was drooping, she had slurred speech and she was confused. The patient went to the hospital where she was hospitalized for 2 days. The MD (medical doctor) said she had a &#34;7 mm focal diffusion.&#34;  Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event(s); therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event(s) is not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, TIA, dizzy, her left arm was paralyzed, right side of her face was drooping, slurred speech, and she was confused, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My eyes, nose, throat, and ears started to itch and burn. My eyes swelled to the point that one eye was completely swollen shut. My lower lip started to swell slightly, but not much. I took Cetirizine Hydrocloride 10 mg. I took one pill in the morning and one in the evening until the evening of 1/25. The burning and itching subsided in an hour. The swelling in my eyes was not completely resolved until the morning of 1/26. 1/22 - 1/24, I was extremely fatigued, sleeping most of the time day and night. On 1/26, I felt that my symptoms had completely resolved.

                                                I was vaccinated at 9am on 1/25/2021.  I had no noticeable side effects that day.  At approximately 1:00 a.m. on 1/26/2021 I started waking up a lot and couldn&#39;t get comfortable.  I tossed and turned and body aches began and quickly worsened.  My knees, thigh bones, hips, pelvis, lower back, and shoulders all hurt like I had been beaten with a bat.  I took a sick day from work due to the severity of symptoms.  I had no fever, but did have hot flashes periodically throughout the day.  I was dizzy upon standing, had nasal congestion, and sever fatigue, and developed a moderately bad headache later that day.  I went to sleep at 10:30 p.m. on 1/26/2021 and slept through the night.  Upon waking on 1/27/2021, I felt much better.  I still have some lingering fatigue and stiffness but not enough to interfere with my normal routine.  I was vaccinated in my left arm and today, 1/27/2021 I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit that are quite sore.

Fever has resolved, no body aches, no headaches, just the diarrhea.   Did not take her Tylenol on Monday due to conflicted reports, but did take Tylenol when her fever got up to 100 and continued to take it every 6 hours and is continuing that now.

                                                Monday, January 25, 2021 - swelling at injection site and extremely tender to touch. Unable to lift arm up or down easily. Tuesday, January 26, 2021- swelling and hardening at injection site and still very tender to touch. At approx. 10 am,  I began experiencing extreme nausea and exhaustion. By 1:00pm I was dry heaving and began a temperature of 99.9 (when I usually run 97.7) with a very bad headache. At 2:00pm I started vomiting very violently, my body was on fire and I was very faint.  Diarrhea  started at this time as well. The headache continued as well as the nausea. I continued to vomit on the hour up until about 8pm. (I have black and blues all over my knees from being on the bathroom floor.) The headache persisted as well as extreme nausea. Soaked through the bedsheets three times over the night while trying to sleep. Too exhausted to take temperature, but I am certain that I had one. Wednesday, January 27, 2021- Could not work. Went to doctor to get a Covid-19 test, just in case. Doctor says what I describe could be side effects of vaccine. Rapid test returns negative.  Extreme exhaustion. Woke up with nausea and a headache and no fever. Extreme exhaustion persists. Could not get out of bed, could not eat. I was only able to drink sips of water.  Diarrhea continued throughout the day. Nausea returned strong at about 5pm and dry heaving began again. Headache returned as well as temperature of 99.9. Soaked through the sheets again this evening. Thursday, January 28, 2021- Worked remotely and I do not know how I got through the day. Diarrhea  continues as well as nausea, headache and exhaustion. Still not able to really eat. Drank Pedialite and was able to eat 2 dry crackers. At about 3pm, dry heaving and nausea. Headache returns. Unable to get out of bed.  Friday, January 28, 2021-  Diarrhea stops. Still experiencing nausea and headache comes and goes. Still exhausted. By 4pm, back in bed with 99.9, body feels hot and headache returns. Soak through sheets once again.  Saturday, January 29, 2021- woke up with just enough energy to report these side effects. Headache is quiet... temperature is normal. Very, very tired. Feeling completely wiped out.

                                                I passed out 12 hours after vaccine received while standing in the bathroom. This followed hours of terrible chills and muscle aches that I couldn?t sleep through. No medications were taken until after the episode and it didn?t happen again. I did not have a working thermometer so unsure how high my temp got. I peed myself when fainted. My husband was present to pick me up off the floor and luckily I didn?t hurt myself in the fall. I didn?t come to until he took me back to bed. I started feeling better a few hours later and much better by 24 hours. Now just lingering body aches and fatigue at 48 hours and still taking ibuprofen/Tylenol.

                                                Within five minutes after receiving vaccine I felt very anxious and I could feel my heart rate go up. The medical staff came over amd took my vitals and blood pressure went up. My heart rate as in the 150?s amd my blood pressure went up to 154/ I can?t remember the bottom number. My head felt tight in my forehead area and my head felt foggy.  They had me do deep breathing and within 15 minutes I felt normal. So I am not sure if my anxiety took over because was extremely scared prior to getting the vaccine or if it was a combination of anxiety amd a reaction. I am scared to get the second one. They said I will have to sit for an hour after the second one. I left the facility after a half hour and felt fine. The next day I felt chest tightness amd my head felt tight. But again not sure if it is anxiety combined.

I felt a little ?foggy?   I went home and went to bed , I woke up at 3am with a severe headache and nothing helped it. It felt like a jackhammer  was pounding in my head. I felt very fatigued the next day. The headache lasted about 16 hours. I woke up 1/7/21 feeling better.

At approximately 2 p.m., I felt like I was going to pass out while seated at my desk doing some computer work, my alarm on my Apple Watch went off stating that my heart rate was in excess of 110 bpm while at rest- I checked and my heart rate was 143 bpm.  I felt heart flutters and nausea increased as did the headache.  I went home once I was able to drive after the event and my heart rate came down some.  I had heart palpitations and flutters for the next couple of hours.  I rested in the bed for the rest of the afternoon and evening.  I took Advil and Zofran.  I felt better, but still very fatigued around 9 p.m.  The next day I had none of the symptoms except for some fatigue.

                                                I felt impaired  (similar to being intoxicated) about a half hour to an hour later.  I had trouble saying some words., like my brain and my mouth weren?t communicating effectively.  My heart was racing at times and I was  a little short of breath. All of this subsided a few to a couple hours later. I then just became extremely fatigued,  sometimes light headed, with a slight headache and back ache. My arm hurts a little, but not near as bad as shot one. I ended up taking two days off of work to sleep and recover.

                                                The shot was given maybe an inch from the shoulder bone. After 13 days of trying to just make it through the pain, I called the facility, and they told me to go see my PCP. My doctor believes the needle hit either a nerve or the tendon.  I could not use my arm regularly for over a week, partially from pain, but more from the lack of ability to lift it. I am still getting pains and a ?catch? in my shoulder when I try to move in certain ways. My arm was in no way injured prior to the shot. The intense pain I had for over a week had me sleeping upright so the throbbing would be less intense. Simple jobs like showering, closing my car door, and even lifting my arm to put a purse on it were very difficult for approximately 10 days. While the pain has gone down tremendously, I rolled my kids? bikes out to a shed &amp; moved some items (less than 15 lbs- I can typically move 50 with no problem) on Tuesday, Feb 2, 2021 and ended up in severe pain again with the throbbing that night. That is when I decided to call the facility regarding the issues I am having.

I slept poorly but didn&#39;t realize until I got up in the morning that my heart rate was off. I wear a fit watchand it told me my heart rate was above resting 97% of the night (its usually below resting 97% of the night). My heart rate increased to 140  when I got up in the morning. I called my doctor who told me what to do to try and reduce the bpm and when to go to the ER if needed.  I stayed in bed all day and laying down I was able to keep my bpm in the 90&#39;s (about 20 bpm higher than usual) I experienced the other expected flu like side effects and headache as well.  24 hours after the side effects started, they began to decrease and for the next 24 hours I felt only slightly ill and my bpm resting was about 10 bpm over my usual. The next day  (2/14/21) I felt 100% myself and my heart rate was back to normal.

At about 28 minutes, voice changed very raspy, chest tightness worse, I could not stop coughing and a very mottled rash on the arm of injection.

By 6pm on 2/21, I experienced fatigue and minor arthralgia / myalgia.  By 9pm on 2/21, the arthralgia/myalgia worsened.  The pain in the bones was severe enough for me to not be able to feel comfortable in any position.  I chose not to take any NSAIDs at the time.  By 1am on 2/22, I awoke with chills and a fever of 103.   I was shivering and sweating.  At that point, I did take ibuprofen.  I woke up at 7am on 2/22 in terrible muscle and joint pain.    I had still had a 101 fever.  I worked for 4 hours that morning.  At 1pm, I went back to be with the same symptoms.  Fever went back to 103.  I had brain fog and unable to concentrate.  It was hard to climb stairs.  I experienced shooting pains at times.  Continued fever and pain through the night.   Injection site pain also.  The morning of 2/23 I woke up with the fever still at 7am.  I took my second dose of ibuprofen.  I was able to work that evening.  My fever broke at noon on 2/23.  On the evening of 2/23 I notice a delayed reaction at the injection site.  I developed red blotches that were hot to touch and painful.  The blotches went from my deltoid to my elbow.  My muscle &amp; back pain had resolved at that point however I developed a soreness at the base of my skull from ear to ear.  I was unable to look up at the ceiling with limited range of motion.  I developed a runny nose and a slight cough.    My soft palette also felt swollen at 11pm on 2/23.   I woke up on 2/24 with the neck pain resolved.  The arm was still red and warm to touch.  My  other symptoms resolved I just felt worn out.  On the evening of 2/24, I developed a metallic taste in my mouth.  The metallic taste resolved by the end of day 2/25.  As of today, 2/26 I am feeling 90% better.

                                                The first day, I had fatigue (tiredness) and  little bit of soreness in the arm of the injection. It was later on that night that I had to use my other arm to get my arm up to a cabinet to reach something. I went to bed early. The next day, still very fatigued, I still had the soreness in the muscle in the injection site arm. 10:30 am at work - it hit me almost like a flu - really quick that I started to feel very bad. Headache - light a migraine - it encompassed my whole head and started having low grade fever and severe nausea and abdominal pain and chills and severe body aches and bone achiness. Extreme fatigue. Side that I got the vaccine in, the glands in my neck and under my arm were swollen.  My fever was never only 100 - but 99.6 is where it usually ran and that was unusual for me to have a fever that high. I had had shingles about two years ago that affected my left side. I started to feel like my shingles was coming back. This felt like it was going to go from trunk all the way up to my neck (the shingles) - it didn&#39;t. I did have a few areas on my trunk area on that left side that did start - like a burning pain - no itchiness but they did go away. I had  flushing feeling - it was worse than a hot flash and different - it was like my body was extremely hot. My coworkers told me that I looked red as a bright red apple - and I wear makeup and had a face mask on. That continued for about 5 days - face, cheeks, especially below my chin, neck and my trunk - just really red. I have a photo of it. There was no pain to it - just hot flushing feeling. That was different from the shingles. The headache never went away - seven days - had trouble sleeping it was painful. It was almost like I had  flu. I had also increased aura migraines - this aura was squiggly lines instead of usual round. I felt like my chest was tight over the weekend. Like it might be going to my chest - Pulsometer - I check my pulse and my blood oxygen level - it went down to about 92 or 94% and I felt  a little short of breath and that lasted about two days.  I did not check my blood pressure.  The only other thing, like if you have the flu for ten days etc which is what my symptoms lasted- but the fatigue lasted another week past these severe intense reactions.

                                                Immediately after shot: I felt some pain &amp; burning at injection sight. In general felt a little off, but nothing significant. After observation period, on the drive home, I began to &#34;taste&#34; the shot, as did my husband who received vaccine right after me. Then, my face felt a little funny, and my jaw felt tight, but no visible swelling. Then I felt a rush of burning sensation throughout my chest and abdominal region. After arriving home, 20 minutes later, I felt a little nauseated, but not bad. An hour later, I was unable to eat dinner, as I felt ill. I felt like I had a mild fever and I was shivering with chills. While trying to sleep, the chills continued. I then experienced unusual frequent urination, every 2 to 3 hours. I had no consumed abnormal amounts of liquid, but my urine was nearly clear, which was odd. After returning to bed after the first time urinating, my heart rate became very fast and I felt like I had a hard time finding my pulse in my neck, which is unusual for me.   The day after the vaccination I experience headache, a lot of tenderness around injection sight and arm muscle pain making it very painful to make certain movement, like putting on my top and reaching for objects. That evening I experience some muscle aches.   These symptoms have improved now that it is day three after the vaccination. I still have a mild headache and pain at injection sight.

                                                I developed extreme shoulder pain and weakness in my arm with limited mobility  the evening of my Covid vaccine. I kept trying to move my arm since I thought it was pain from the vaccine dose, but the pain continued to get worse over the week even with ibuprofen. I went to my primary care physician a week after the vaccine and he examined me and said the placement of the injection was much too high and it missed my deltoid muscle. I completed lab work to rule out infection, and I am scheduled to have imaging of my left shoulder to determine the extent of the shoulder injury from the misplaced injection. It has been 2 weeks and the pain is continuing to increase with very limited mobility. I have had to miss work, can&#39;t drive my stick shift car, and my sleep is poor because the pain wakes me up during the night.

                                                Patient developed significant joint pain throughout her body about 24 hours after her second Moderna vaccine on 1/26. 5 days later she developed migraine which required several rounds of imitrex, one headache waking her from sleep which is unusual. She sought care on 2/23 through an office visit with me. At that point she continued to have significant polyarthralgia but no joint swelling. She works as a nurse and her joint pain was worse on days she worked but she was having difficulty doing normal activities on her days off due to the joint pain. I ordered labs and recommended naproxen for pain which has been helping but she still needs this to make her symptoms tolerable.

About 5-10 minutes after the vaccine while in the waiting area she sat on the floor because she was not feeling well and didn&#39;t want to pass out.  She said she was hot and dizzy and nauseous.  We gave her a bag in case she was sick and got her an ice pack.  She was very anxious and was concerned she was having an anxiety attack.  One of the pharmacists asked her to pull down her mask to be able to breath deeply.  After some deep breathing, the ice pack and some time she was feeling better and sat on the chair.  We recommended she wait a while and see how she felt.  After a while she said she was very nauseous.  We kept her a while and she only left when she realized the only symptom was nausea. She left around 3:10pm.

                                                Four hours post vaccine I had muscle and joint pain throughout my entire body and I took 600 mg Advil.  Four hours after that I repeated the 600 mg dose of Advil and went to bed.  I felt feverish and my pain did not diminish despite the medication.  At approximately 2 am I got up to try and cool myself off.  I fainted in my bathroom and fell, hitting my head on the tub, although I did not know this at the time.  I thought I just laid down.  I was unable to get up.  For the next 2 hours I slowly inched myself from the bathroom into the hallway and towards my bed.  I was very cold and in severe pain.  When I reached my bed I finally warmed up and fell asleep.  I was unable to get up out of the bed, except to raise myself on my right elbow to drink a mouthful of water, until approximately 4 pm the following day.   This was 28 hours after the vaccine.  No medications helped my pain, it just slowly subsided on it&#39;s own.      For the next 24 hours I was able to get up and use the bathroom and drink some water and juice but I could not eat or perform any function. I could not even sit up in bed.  When I was able to start eating again I had diarrhea for 24 hours.  It has been 5 complete days since the vaccine.  I am still winded while performing simple cleaning tasks.  I need about 2 hours of rest in bed (twice yesterday) just to get through a day with nothing in it.   I did not expect the level of immobility/illness, unalleviated pain or the seriousness of my second vaccine reaction.

I got out of bed and just couldn&#39;t stay out of bed, I could stand up right, I felt hypotensive. I had to be laying down.  The next morning I woke up with a slamming headache, I took two Tylenol and it went away.  I was ok after that until about day 6 after the vaccine. I had chills and thought i maybe had Covid but tested negative. My arm started swelling up, my whole upper arm was swollen. It was hot to touch and itchy, they thought it was cellulites and put me on medication, after 5 days It wasn&#39;t doing anything and it was getting worse. I went back to the Urgent Care, he had me finish the medication and took Benadryl over the next two days and it started to get better.  I was advised not to get the second shot.

                                                I woke up at 2am this morning with a headache on the top of my head and my head was ringing (not my ears, my actual head). Then I started having vertigo which i have never had before - felt like i was falling even though i was laying in bed and started feeling nausea. I took 1 tylenol and after a long time was finally able to go back to sleep. About 830am I woke up with an even worse headache, even worse dizziness and worse nausea. I ended up vomiting twice. After that the symptoms started to subside. I did not have a fever at all. If anything I felt cold (not chills, just generally cold). I fell asleep again for a few hours and when i woke up I had a little bit of dizziness and nausea but it went away.  I napped again for a few more hours and when I woke up I felt better and was hungry. I also wanted to report that a red patch reappeared at the injection site on March 11 and has been there ever since. It does not hurt like it did for a few days after the injection, but is a bit tender. Just redness, no bumps, and it&#39;s the same size as it was when it initially showed up after the injection.

It was impossible to sleep. Then I used cold compress and the next day I started taking Motrin to help with the pain. The swelling started going down after 2 days and the pain was present for about 3 for days. The pain was excruciating, nothing like the flu shot pain or anything like that.

Almost 2 weeks later and  these  symptoms still persist. Taking prednisone, meclizine, nurtec and zofran. Currently  as well as back to taking an albuterol inhaler.

                                                Around 40 minutes after receiving the second COVID19 vaccination, my heart began racing, I was lightheaded, and my tongue began to swell.  I was taken to an observation room, and a my oxygen saturation was checked.  Because my tongue continued to swell, my chest felt tight, and breathing became shallow, I was injected with 50mg of Benadryl.  I asked for this instead of the Epi pen injection.   The constriction in my chest improved a bit and my tongue started to reduce in size.  I was very sleepy and had the shivers.  After a half hour of resting, I was driven home by family.  The next day I had terrible joint pain, fatigue and chills.  Breathing was fine, but I was easily exhausted by any exertion.  Starting the third day, I was at work teaching and noticed a rapid heart rate, increased chest tightness and extreme fatigue from talking or walking the stairs.  The fourth day I had to leave work early because of the lack of breath and fatigue.  I visited my family doctor who gave me Prednisone and a rescue inhaler, and I started taking the medication. The fifth day my symptoms were the same, but I sat at my desk and was able to do paperwork.  The sixth and seventh days I had to get a substitute for my job, as I did not have enough energy or breath to teach or walk the stairs at school.  I have been on vacation from work since Saturday, a full seven days after the vaccination, and continue to have extreme fatigue and chest tightness with any exertion.   Sunday night I went to the Emergency because I could not get a deep breath and felt like I was suffocating. My oxygen levels were high and my blood pressure good, but the muscles in my neck and chest were constricted making me gasp and choke on my spit.  I was given an albuterol treatment and an anti anxiety drug to help relax me so I could breath normally.  I am still struggling with these symptoms of tight chest, constricted breathing, and extreme fatigue.  But now I am sleeping sitting upright and afraid to fall asleep because I may not be able to breath.

Thursday, I started getting a cough and that started getting worse and I was sick for about 6 weeks. I was short of breath, extremely tired and coughing. They started me on a Z-pack and Dx&#39;d me with bronchitis at the time. After I finished the Z-pack I went back to Doctor and he put me on another antibiotic for 10 days twice a day  - maybe Augmentin 875. And put me on a dose of Prednisone at the same time. I still had a cough and couldn&#39;t get rid of it. Adver discus twice a day and a Prednisone Taper. I am still on it the Adver. I was out of work for two weeks and had to use my PTO and paid family leave. The symptoms have resolved - but it was 6 weeks. First doctor visits were drive through since I had a cough. I had a total of four doctor visits.

Have tried different sensitive skin lotions and Cortizone cream (only helps for about an hour). Took 1 Benedryl one night and that was the only night the itching didn?t wake me up. Started about a week after the shot. Still getting worse and today is 2 weeks since the shot. Will give it another week or so before I decide to make a doctor visit.

The next day Wednesday January 27, 2021, I had to stay home from work due to not being able to think clearly again (brain fog). On Thursday January 28, 2021, I went back to work arriving at 0600 but still didn&#39;t feel right until around noon and then it was like the &#34;fog&#34; lifted and I was better. 2. On 2/5/2021, I noticed that I was starting to itch on my trunk and I  had a fine rash. The rash then went to my neck, back, arms, and legs. On March 23, 2021 i noticed that the rash was fading and the itching was much better.

                                                A few days after each injection I had extreme pain and swelling in my elbow.  It was painful to extend my elbow and to lift or exert any strength in my left  arm.  After the first shot the pain didn?t subside until two days after I received the second shot.  Now it is back again after my second dose.  The skin at my elbow is also extremely sensitive to the touch. Hi

                                                2/5 I received the 1st does of Moderna. The next day I had a massive headache. As the days went on my neck started to heart. The days continued and my back started to hurt. I thought my pain was just radiating down my back from my neck. ON 2/12 I have record of going to the pharmacy to get Lidocain patches. I continued on with pain from neck to middle of back. I made appointments with chiropractor and went there complaining that my back and ribs were out. This continued. On 3/5 I got the 2nd dose. I reacted as expected but this went on for 4 days. Went to a convenient care clinic where the dr ordered chest xray and D-DImer for suspected PEs. I got a call immediately to go to ER as my D-Dimer was high at 4.3. I went back to Local ER and had a CT Scan. The CT scan showed MULTIPLE PEs with infarct. I was admitted. SInce then I have been back to the ER and still struggling and have many tests coming up. My pulse is consistantly tachycardia. The ER docs do not want to entertain the thought that is was the vaccine because i was a smoker and on hormone replacement therapy. HOWEVER, I smoked for over 30 years and was on that HRT for almost 3 and never showed any signs of a clotting issue. I can pinpoint with pictures, and bank records of when the pain started and it reflects back to the 1st dose.  Who knows but after the 2nd does and out of the hospital I struggled with covid symptoms including the &#34;foggy&#34; head and that continues as well as other health related PE issues.  They may not want to contribute it to the vaccine but I know when this all started and it does need to be reported incase others. I have a whole story to tell that doesn&#39;t cover in writing!

Sometimes mild or moderate, but sometimes severe, where I can&#39;t work or go after regular daily activities. I hope this isn&#39;t a chronic condition, it&#39;s day eight now.

                                                I got the vacine today.  Unfortunately I did have a reaction, and had to cancel my patient load at work for the day.  They said if you have food allergies you might have one, but I was willing to risk it.  They observed me for 30 min after.  After 15 min it felt like I was having a mild panick attack, but I?m used to that so I just breathed through it.  Coughed a few times.  After 30 min got up and was whoozy/dizzy, but shrugged it off, got my card and walked slowly to my car, drove 5 min home.  By then my hands were shaking hard.  It was like being shot with a crapload of adrenaline.  I called my sister and when I talked I started sobbing.  I don?t know, I just couldn?t stop.  But I knew it was just the adrenaline and if I could calm down, I?d get thru it.  She was awesome bc she kept her voice soft and low when she spoke, which helps.  After 3 hours it has calmed down and I?m just really cold and exhausted and nauseous and only a little shaky.  Being quiet and calm is helping.  Also sitting on a heating pad bc it?s 74 in my apartment and I?m freezing cold.  I?ll be ok by end of day.  I got the Moderna vacine and I?m still glad I did and thankful I could get it....but to those who are getting it...symptoms are that it feels like being shot full of adrenaline, you get a panic attack, but my O2 actually went up, not down.  Chest pain, panting, high anxiety, shaking, nausea, dizziness.

                                                Upon waking the next day I suddenly felt very ill, I was short of breath, had chills and was too weak to care for myself.  I had been diagnosed with COVID in June and was very ill with that.  This felt exactly like I did when I had COVID.   Throughout the day I ran a fever around 102.  My ability to think or care for myself was greatly impaired.  I continue to fight fatigue and brain fog.  I then developed several cold sores outside and in my mouth.  I continue to battle fatigue and weakness but am improving and now back to work.  I do not plan to get a second dose as I am afraid of a stronger reaction that would require emergency care.

                                                Within 4 hours of receiving the injection I was unable to move my right shoulder.  There  was excrutiating pain.  Upon removing my bandaid it was apparent that the vaccine was injected just below my acromion.  I have a picture of the injection site.  My shoulder continued to ache (there was no aching in the muscles of my arm). I took Advil 600-80 mg tid and Tramadol 50 mg at night.  The pain woke me from sleep.  It was difficult to get dressed and undressed.  After 9 days of pain I finally took Prednisone 30 mg po.  This improved y pain by 30%.  It became clear that this is likely bursitis.

                                                I am an RN and was working a Covid 19 vaccine clinic for first responders. I took my own 1st administration of Moderna at approx 6:20 then went out to vaccinate/data entry. I noticed I was a little bit shaky and more jittery than normal but I attributed that to getting first vaccination clinic off the ground and problems we were having with computers and login. When I was leaving approx 2 hours later and all settled down I went to my car and noticed small area near front of tongue in R side. I also had small feelings of tingling or what felt like small electric current around edges of my tongue. My throat was sore but I had thought that was from talking to so many vaccinated first responders and having to talk over my n95 mask.  Upon getting home approx 12 minutes later I noticed my tongue had swollen. I was not having trouble breathing. Throat was red but no swelling noted. I took my Zyrtec early and then. 50 mg of Benadryl and it was relieved within 40 minutes. I did not need to seek any medical care and over the counter meds remedied the issue.

                                                Body aches; Fever 99.8F; Chills; Entire left arm muscle is in pain on movement; Choking in the throat; Facial Flush; Blurred vision; Dizziness; Confusion; I had no emotions; A spontaneous report was received from a pharmacist concerning a 48-years old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced choking, flushing, vision blurred, dizziness, confusional state, emotional disorder, body aches, pyrexia, chills and limb discomfort.  The patient&#39;s medical history included migraines and a hysterectomy. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included sumatriptan, naratriptan hydrochloride, and galconezumab.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A) in the left deltoid intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   A pharmacist called stating she received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 02 Jan 2021 at 9:45am in her left deltoid. Immediately after receiving the vaccine, she had facial flushing, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion and choking in the throat that lasted 20 minutes. After a few hours, she stated confusion would come and go, and she had no emotions. The next morning, the confusion was gone. On 03 Jan 2021, she reported having body aches and a fever of 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. She reported chills, body aches, and a lot of pain in the left arm. If she tried to move her left arm, the entire muscle in the left arm hurt.  Treatment for the events included acetaminophen and an antihistamine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was withdrawn.   The events, choking, flushing, vision blurred, were considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events, confusional state, emotional disorder, and dizziness, were considered resolved on 03 Jan 2021. The events, body aches, pyrexia, chills, and limb discomfort, were not considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 48 year old female patient with medical history of migraines, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Choking, non-serious unexpected events of Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, Confusional state, Emotional disorder, Pain, and Limb discomfort, and non-serious expected events of Pyrexia and Chills. The events of Choking, Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, and Confusional state occurred immediately after administration of their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A). The event of Emotional disorder occurred on the same day when the patient received mRNA-1273. The events of Pain, Pyrexia, Chills, and Limb discomfort occurred on the next day of mRNA-1273 administration. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Second and Third days:  Large amount or swelling and knot (size of an egg) popped out at injection site and felt hot and bright red and unable to sleep for two nights due to the pain (like a tooth ache) in my arm.  The symptoms improved over the next week, but I began to itch all over and at the injection site (felt like a wasp sting healing) and then the symptoms began to improve, but on day 10, I woke up with a bright red circle, hot to the touch and about the size of a baseball at the injection site and itching. On day 11, the size of the redness increased to the size of a softball and still very hot to touch. I contacted the health dept. where I received the vaccine and they said it was probably my bodies reaction to the vaccine and I should be ok since I wasn&#39;t having trouble breathing and no itching in my throat and to contact my primary doctor which I am doing tomorrow.  I was also told it was fine to get the second dose, however, I&#39;m very nervous about it.

                                                I went to bed Friday night around 10:00PM.  I woke around 12:30AM with a throbbing headache, sore throat, post-nasal drainage, body aches, chills, fever, sweating, weakness and nausea.  I went down to use the bathroom and then back to bed but could not sleep due to the throbbing headache and chills.  I got back up around 2:30AM and soaked in a warm bath.  I went back to bed around 4:30AM.  I was able to go to sleep.  I slept until around 8:30AM.  At that time, I drank some water and went back to sleep.  I slept until approximately 10:30AM and started drinking Powerade Zero.  The Powerade was taken to bed and sipped on when I would stir and change positions.  I slept until approximately 2:30PM, when I got up to use the bathroom.  I urinated, washed my hands and went to walk out of the bathroom when everything went black.  I remember yelling for my husband but then nothing else until I heard him yell my name several times and I was lying on the floor in the doorway of the bathroom.  I passed out.  I was sat up in the recliner and monitored.  Above symptoms continued.  Tylenol and Motrin were alternated every 4 hours for the fever.

                                                I had typical reactions after vaccine for 3 days (chills, foggy/on and off again headache, extreme lethargy,  aches from arm to shoulders to other arm, sleeplessness (insomnia) for 2 days, soreness in injection site). No fever.  My concern is today is TEN days after vaccine injection and my injection site has a round redness and hardness at the injection site. About 1 inch in diameter. It&#39;s itchy off and on but no pain. It&#39;s hard, red, round, and the skin of it is raised similar to like a hive. I don&#39;t know if this is normal.  Especially because it&#39;s 10 days out from initial injection. I&#39;m due back for 2nd injection on Feb 9th.

                                                I woke up around 12:30 in the morning on the 21st of January with a headache and I took 600mg Advil.  I went back to bed and was restless and still had the same pain, so I took 975mg Tylenol. I continued to feel poorly and pain was increasing, so I used Maxalt x 2 without any relief.  I became nauseated and diaphoretic with increasing pain in my head.  I woke my husband to take me to the ER for relief.  My pain was 8 and all vital signs normal.  1 liter of Saline, Toradol 30mg IV and Zofran got the headache to a 3. I did follow up with my doctor later that day for further eval.  I have not had a headache that bad in 17 years.

Prior to the seizure they said that she was &#34;feeling off&#34;, &#34;jittery&#34;, and &#34;misfiring&#34;.  The RN that notified me said that they were checking on her every hour and the last check in was at 1:00 PM. She went to check on her at 2:00 PM when she found her in the hallway very pale/gray, bradycardic, and hypotensive. The nurse said she appeared to be postictal and hallucinating. They immediately called 911 -and she was transferred to the hospital and to my knowledge she is still there. RN will keep me updated.

                                                Upon receiving injection, the RN administering noted that pt appeared anxious.  Following her 15 minute wait, EMT noted that as she stood up she commented to another pt that her throat felt &#34;scratchy&#34; after he made the same comment.  This patient was a volunteer at the vaccination site, and returned to her assignment.  Throughout the assignment, she began rubbing her chest and the injection site.  She returned to the EMTs approximately 2 hrs after receiving the vaccine to report  &#34;feeling different&#34;.  EMTs witnessed redness on her chest area.  They administered Benedryl and Decadron IV, called 911.  All vitals WNL.  This writer called pt the following day, she reported having been transported to Hospital.  Bloodwork was obtained, she noticed while at hospital that the arm below where injected was covered in a &#34;scarlatina type&#34; rash.  This rash continues to persist, no additional symptoms reported. She was discharged from ER with  Rx for Pepcid and Prednisone and told to f/u with primary.  She saw the PA at her MDs office, and was told to f/u with an allergist.  She intends to go to Medical Center Allergy Immunology for f/u and further advice on receiving second dose of vaccine.  She will follow up with this writer regarding the scheduling/canceling of the second dose based on the consultation with the Allergist/Immunologist.

                                                I had a very painful injection site and also area got swollen and red. Like a bruise.  For about 4 days. I took Ibuprofen and Tylenol and it was hard to sleep because it was very painful. New Years eve I started feeling my throat scratchy so I made me some honey tea. As I sipped  the tea, my son entered the room and made a remark regarding the tea smell and then I realized that I could not smell the tea, but could still taste it. Concerned it could be a sign of COVID I sanitized all areas and stayed in my room. Next morning I noticed my smell and taste were compromised.  I communicated with the employee health and was tested on the 4th and my rapid test was negative and I could not believe it.  So I decided to go to the UC and I was tested for flu, strep and Covid I was tested positive around 4PM on the same day (01/04/2021).  On 01/02 I noticed I was nauseated around 6:30PM til 10PM and next morning it was gone. On 01/03 I had headache and chills about the same time, I developed diarrhea on the 4th later in the evening as well. On the 5th, 6th and 7th I had cough and on the 9th I had diarrhea again and after that by the weekend everything had resolved  and I felt better.

                                                I had my second shot on 1/26 at 1010. By 1800 I started feeling lousy. I had a few hours of fever overnight along with chills and body aches. The body aches continued all day on 1/27. I stuck it out and didn&#39;t take ibuprofen or Tylenol to be sure the vaccine had a good take. After a 1500 nap I started to feel better and was fine for a few days.   Around 1800 on 2/1 I started feeling bad again and have ever since. I don&#39;t think I have had fever, but I have been chilled a couple of times. The body aches are the worst. For a couple of days I has localized pain in my left lower shin, ankle, and knee, but that&#39;s better and now it just general muscles aches. Sometimes individual muscles are mildly tender but that&#39;s very intermittent.   I am taking ibuprofen or Tylenol tid. It&#39;s bad enough that it wakes me in the night to take meds. I&#39;m also really tired. Still functional--I went running once my ibuprofen was working yesterday, went to work, etc--but tired.

                                                When my first dose was administered on this day I felt a pain go down my arm. I continue to have pain in my elbow/forearm area. I cannot lift or reach for objects as i was able to prior to the shot. My day to day duties continue to be affected.

All symptoms resolved by 2/5/21.

It was if my whole body was swollen and just to move had me in tears because my body was so sore. The arm pain was there but not as bad as from the first vaccine.  I developed SOB and have had to start using my asthma pump which I hadnt had to use in over 3 years.  I have been off work since 1/3 from the AE experienced to both vaccinations and to date I am still experiencing breathing issues. I have been developing intermitten fevers off and on throughout this  whole time. An the fatigue has been awful.   I havent been able to stay awake long and as of yesterday was the first day I have been able to stay awake for an extended period of time.

The arm was so sore touching it was unbareable for the first couple days.  The fatigue was so bad it kept me from working for about 5 days.  It eased up during that time but was really bad on me and by the 6th day I felt a little better just hasnt fully been feeling myself since.

                                                Within 3 minutes my arm started to turn red, and I started to break out in hives. By 20 minutes my hives went across to my chest and right arm. My BP was 168/108 and pulse 84, they hooked me up to vitals. They wanted to send me to the ER  for Benadryl but I had more own and took Benadryl (20mg) this was about 25 mins into injection.  About 30 mins my arm started to get really warm, you could feel the heat coming off of it.  They monitored me for an hour and re-did my BP 158/97, pulse dropped to  80, my o2 stats were 99. They made me monitor for another 18 mins. BP was  155/103, pulse still at 80. They had me get up and walk around and wanted me to take more Benadryl but I didn&#39;t have a ride home.   . My hives started to improve but were not gone.  About 1hr 25mins post vaccine  I got on the phone with Employee Health to ask to leave (clinic was closing) , they wanted me to stay and I told them I had a BP machine at home, if it didn&#39;t go down they wanted me to go to the ER. My BP did go down about 4 hours later but my arm was still hurting.  The hives on my chest went away, but hives on my arm was on and off for about a week. My left arm remained red for about 2 weeks and I ended up getting a really bad rash.  When I woke up the next day I had to take a Benadryl and Tylenol. On January 3rd I felt awful like  I got hit by a car.  On that Wednesday (6th) my arm started to hurt really bad in the middle of the night, it felt like day 2 all over again. It was really painful, it was bright red and life a figure eight going down my arm and I immediately called employee health and they  told me to monitor for 24 hours. It got worse and went down my arm to my chest.  I went to Friday night to our immediate care (only place we could go), I was given antibiotics for cellulitis.  It took about 7 days to  go away.  They were telling me I couldn&#39;t get the second dose because of my reaction and I had to fight to get the second dose.

About half hour later, face felt a little weird like when you are coming off of novocaine at the dentist. Tip of nose &amp; cheeks sort of numb. Head felt heavy/pressure. Didn&#39;t think much of it, but still feeling it the next day (19 hours after shot). Face just feels funny. I feel the same way when I am around a lot of balloons or rubber tires since I have a latex allergy. Sort of affecting my vision as well, seems to go out of focus every now and then.

                                                It started with tingling in my tongue (which I ignored), then it became numbness that spread down my throat I also became short of breath. That&#39;s when I notified one of the nurses. They checked my blood pressure. I vaguely remember hearing it was high (189/?). They called 911 and the paramedics came. Shortness of breath became worse and chest pains started. The paramedic gave me Benadryl and then epinephrine since I was increasingly getting worse. I was shaking  and I felt lethargic. I could not control the shaking and I felt cold. I do not remember a lot of details when I got to the Emergency Room. Looking at my record they gave me: LORazepam (ATIVAN), methylPREDNISolone sod suc(PF)(SOLU-MEDROL) and famotidine. I went home that night with the condition that I see my primary care physician. I felt like I have the flu and soreness of arm the next couple days. I went back to work after four days.

                                                I had the first Moderna 12/23/2020 and did fine with only arm pain on the next day after shot.  When I received dose 2 on 1/20/2021, I did well but later in the middle of the night felt foggy, severe arm pain, and kept asking my husband if I was in an earth quake.  That next day I had sever arm pain, extreme fatigue all day and the fatigue got worse as the day went on to the point I felt like I couldn&#39;t walk even though I could walk from the fatigue.  On Day 3, I felt fine just little arm pain. On Day 4, some fatigue only.  On Day 5, my arm became hot to touch, swollen, severe redness and itching.  The rest of that  week some fatigue but bearable until Day 8, I felt extremely fatigue.  Since then I have had 1-2 episodes a week of extreme fatigue that lasts about an hour or two for no reason.  I also have had some wheezing but comes and goes but that is better now.

                                                February 26, 2021 10 am overcome with nausea and need to vomit. Had three vomiting spells and stomach pain. It was all yellow stomach bile. By 1 pm, the pain had increased and I&#39;d had 12 bouts of increased pain and vomiting. Went to  Instacare. My white blood cell count was 18,000 so they sent me to the ER. Dr did a CT Scan that showed pancreatitis. I do not drink alcohol at all, my triglycerides were normal, and I&#39;d had my gall bladder out almost 20 years. Cause unknown for pancreatitis. I&#39;m a healthy 115 lb 48 year old who eats healthy and works out every day. The only medical change was having the 2nd Moderna vaccine dosage on 2.18.21. I was sick right after getting the vaccine and missed work the next day. I had bloating and stomach pain all week, but I assumed it was my menstrual cycle. I am reporting this in case my pancreatitis is linked to the second dosage.

                                                Immediate (non-severe?) allergic reaction. I received the first dose of the Modern covid vaccine, injected into my left arm. I went to sit for the mandatory 15 minute &#34;observation&#34; period, sitting with a couple of my coworkers who were being vaccinated at this time as well. After approximately two minutes, I started feeling a little light-headed and had slight difficulty breathing. I mentioned it to my coworkers and they suggested I take off my mask (masks were required for everyone). I did so and took a couple deep breaths which made me feel better. I put my mask back on and continued chatting with my coworkers. About 5 minutes later I felt the same, slight difficulty breathing again, but thought it was probably due to my mask, so I repeated - mask off, deep breaths - and felt better. As a precaution, I stayed in the observation area for 30 minutes with one my coworkers, but did not experience any other problems. Feeling a little shaky but otherwise okay, I left at that point and walked to my car. Once in the car, I took off my mask and took more deep breaths. Feeling okay, I started my drive home (approx 7 minutes). About halfway on the drive I felt a slight difficulty in breathing again, so I rolled down the window, took deep breaths. Arriving home, I told my husband I felt &#34;a little weird&#34;. My throat felt slightly swollen, the back of my neck felt stiff, my lips felt a bit numb, my face felt tingly and my jaw felt tight. It was about 2:45 at this point. I felt the outside of my throat with my fingers and realized my tonsils were quite swollen. My husband felt them, too, and agreed. However, nothing was visibly swollen in my face or neck, only felt inwardly. I still felt a bit shaky and had an occasional metallic taste in my mouth. I drank some water and laid down, with my feet slightly elevated. My husband stayed with me, both of us monitoring my symptoms in case anything got worse and medical attention was needed, but nothing got worse. My symptoms stayed at this level for the next few hours. I sat up occasionally and continued to drink water. I would get occasional waves of slight difficulty in breathing, but would take deep breaths and that would help. My airway never felt constricted, I just felt like I need a bit more oxygen. By early evening, I was feeling a little tired, but was able to eat dinner without problem and by about 8pm I was feeling a bit better. The swelling in my tonsils had subsided a little at this point and the waves of difficulty in breathing were getting much less often and milder. I slept through the night without problem. In the morning, however, I did not feel very well. I felt quite fatigued and had a little difficulty breathing again, but no worse than before. My arm was pretty sore from the injection, but no other symptoms had developed otherwise. By about 11am, I started feeling better, and by about 1:00pm I felt much better. I had low energy, but I otherwise felt good the rest of the day and slept fine again that night. This morning (day two) I again felt some fatigue and had a little difficulty breath at times, but by mid-morning I felt much better and have continued feeling a little low in energy, but otherwise okay so far. It is now 6:30pm on day two.

Her tongue started swelling up and she felt very uncomfortable.  She bought some baby liquid Benadryl and took it.  Then she noticed her face had blister like hives in and around her mouth.  Her mouth was like it had ulcers.  Pt could not get in to see her PCP right away so had a tele visit about a month later and was instructed to get the 2nd vax dose  but to take Benadryl prior to getting it.

                                                I received the 2nd dose of the Covid 19 vaccine on March 11th.  The first dose, I only had a sore injection area, so there were no other side effects for the first dose.  The second dose, proved other.  I got the 2nd dose at approximately 10 am, and did not have any effects until that evening.  At 1230 am, I awoke with extreme chills, a low fever, 101, and severe body pain. I was able to crawl on the floor and sit next to a heater vent and get warmed up.  I made a cup of tea and took 2 ibuprofen and was unable to get back to sleep for about 4 hours. Palms of both my hands were extremely hot, every joint hurt and especially the arthritis within my right shoulder.  5 days later, my right side organs feel uncomfortable

                                                Immediately after injection I had a weird taste in my mouth, and of course the sore arm from injection site. Within 2 hours I felt nausea and fatigue and body aches. Within 5 hours my injection arm was so painful I couldn&#39;t hold an empty water glass or pull up my pants. The arm pain increasingly worsened spreading to my hand and chest and prevented me from sleeping. 2 days after injection the arm pain , fatigue and constant nausea have not dissipated however the body aches have. I also have developed a sty in my right eye for which I was prescribed antibiotics.

Extreme body aches/pain whether I moved or stayed still - it felt like my body was being kicked around like a soccer ball.  I felt nauseous and dizzy.  Hard time eating or drinking.   I could not sleep even though I was extremely fatigued.   I felt like my heart was racing too. Slightly alleviated with ibuprofen.  Injection site was extremely swollen, red, hot to touch and painful - the swollen red area extender down to my elbow and wrapped around my arm and felt tight.  I took theraflu tea and the symptoms subsided for the four hours it was in my system, and I finally slept.  The third day, I could get out of bed, but I felt as if I was extremely hungover.  The fourth day, I had extreme fatigue, and injection site was still red and swollen.  The fifth I felt better and it took about 2-3 weeks for the red site to slowly go down.

Aches and pains included: broad muscle aches, joint aches and skin pain (skin hurt/very sensitive to touch, but did not have rashes).

                                                After the shot, I had the &#34;typical&#34; reaction - sore arm, a bit of a head ache, but nothing concerning.  Then on the 4th night after my shot, I started feeling bad and got in bed.  That night I couldn&#39;t sleep due to not feeling well. The next morning I was very dizzy, agitated, nauseous and had a weird head ache behind my eyes.    I started feeling like I was going to throw up anytime I looked at anything for more than about a minute. (my phone, a book, a puzzle, the tv).   I laid by the toilet most of the day with a wash cloth over my eyes. Around 6pm that night I started throwing up a TON, major headache, body aches, shivers, but no fever.   These symptoms lasted for the next two days.  (as a side note, this was during the freeze, so I was not able to call my doctor, etc...).  I started feeling better on day 4 but I had a headache for about two week - that still lingers on most days.  (headaches are unusual for me).  This was, without a doubt, the sickest I have ever been in my life! I decided not to get the 2nd shot because I was afraid of feeling worse after the 2nd shot.

                                                Vaccine was given and while scheduling second vaccine I noticed my tongue and gums itching then my throat (?? trachea) began to tighten.  Not knowing if these symptoms were the vaccine, wearing of a face mask, or just slight anxiety, once I finished scheduling my next vaccine appointment, I took my seat and sat for the 15-minute observation time.  The itching and tightness did not seem to get too much worse so when my 15-minute observation time was up, I left the building, called my mom, and headed back to work.  Removing the mask and having a drink of water did not alleviate my symptoms, so my mom suggested I go back to the clinic at the fairgrounds and have them assess my symptoms.   I was escorted to the back of the building where Dr was.  After a brief examination and asking questions, Dr had me lie down on a cot and he monitored my blood pressure and oxygen while continuing to ask questions about how I feel and any new symptoms I may have.  He said my oxygen and blood pressure were great.  I was shaking/body tremor pretty much the whole time I was lying on the cot.  Neither of the original symptoms, tongue and gum itching and tightening of throat, ever really subsided.  I was thirsty and I began to feel nauseous, and on a couple of occasions thought I was going to vomit, but only had dry heaving.  (Note: I am not aware of the time and how long it was from beginning to end, when I was given something to when ems arrived, to when I arrived at hospital.)   Sometime later, my throat was a bit sore and I felt like something was tickling or in the back of my mouth.  Dr examined the location, and upon looking, called for a nurse and the next thing I know, I now have a throbbing headache and Dr was administering an EpiPen Injection to my upper thigh.   At this point, I was still nauseous, pounding on the right side of my head near eye socket, still having body tremors, and ready to fall asleep.  Dr explained that my Uvula and soft palate had double in size and that I was having an allergic reaction and will need to go by ems to the local hospital for observation. I tried to refuse, but was told it was protocol.   Several people looked inside my mouth. I was given a pill that dissolved on my tongue.  My head stopped pounding and I was no longer nauseous once I was in the ems.  I do not remember when the itching and tightness of my throat went away, but it was before I arrived at the hospital.    Once I arrived at the hospital, the only thing that hurt was my upper left thigh where Dr administered the EpiPen and I still had small body tremors. Two separate nurses tried to give me an IV, but both were only successful at blowing out my veins. I refused an IV after the second attempt. The nurse gave me, what she said was 3 steroid pills (Decadron??) and ½ of some other pill that will coat my stomach and protect it from steroid pills.  They allowed me to walk on my own without observation to and from the bathroom down the hall.  Sometime later in the emergency room, the itching of my tongue and gums came back and the tightness in my throat returned.  The staff at the hospital did not feel concerned enough to even examine me after I mentioned the return of the symptoms.  After about an hour, I was told I could go home, but they later came back and said I had not been there long enough and had to stay.  It was around 7:30 pm when I was able to leave and go home.  Saturday and Sunday, I was very fatigued.  Monday and Tuesday my hips and legs feel very weak and wobbly and I have pain going from my right hip down past my knee on the outside of my leg.

I was fine until I woke up 11pm or so with body aches, fever of 100.8 or so, headache, stomach craps and was extremely tired.  These side effects went on all of Friday to where I missed work with all symptoms and fever reaching over 102. (I didn&#39;t have that when I had Covid.) Saturday and Saturday evening were much of the same but the fever came down to 99.5 or so with improvement on headache and body aches.  Slept the better part of Friday through Sunday morning when I had returned to fever free and mostly myself less some mild sleepiness.

I stopped at an Aldi about 7 minutes away to use the restroom and get a snack, as I had been at the fairgrounds for about an hour and had not had breakfast. While washing my hands, I noticed that my chest and neck were flushed red, much like when I drink certain alcoholic beverages. My left arm was also red up to my elbow. Feeling a little concerned, but still feeling generally okay, I bought a Snickers bar and a Coke, thinking it would perk me up. I checked out at 10:39AM, and got on the highway to head for home. I drank a bit of Coke, then took a bite of my candy bar. It felt a little weird when I swallowed, but went down okay. I took two more small bites, and each was more difficult to swallow than the last, with the third one not clearing the back of my throat without several sips of Coke to wash it down. I was starting to feel panicky, but figured response time would be relatively slow, as I was traveling in between jurisdictions. I remember my late  husband giving me Benadryl after I had a weird reaction to a flu vaccine in 2014, so I focused on getting to a store down the road where I could stop quickly for some. This took another 5 minutes from where I was. I bought a box of Benadryl Liqui Gels, and took one in the parking lot. I could still breathe, so I decided to drive home to my daughter, who was home alone. The Benadryl kicked in when I was almost home, so I did not call EMS.

                                                I started getting muscle aches around noon the day after the vaccine. It slowly got worse and worse and I was miserable. I had muscle aches, back ache, temperature of 101 and chills. My body hurt so bad that I needed help walking across the room. My fever broke at about 4 am and I was sweating. 3 days later, my heart started racing up to 265 BPM. I had diagnosed A-Fib for 6 years before up until this point that has always been able to be controlled with my Diltiazem. I had to go to the ER. I was admitted into the hospital for a day and 1/2.

                                                moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Tachycardia sudden onset 4 minutes after injection (6:09am). Arms and legs cold and weak. Generalized weakness. BP 167/78, o2 sats 100%. Tachycardia lasted about 10-15minutes and resolved to HR 88 and BP 138/78.  Still left with overall weakness, malaise, cold feeling. No other symptoms.  Released from the facility at 6:48am.  Drove 2 blocks to my husband&#39;s workplace (hospital). Had diarrhea x 2, dull diffuse headache, odd feeling and malaise that persisted. Sudden onset of terrible feeling, the need to get to the ER at 8:36am. Had a bathroom visit to urinate. By the time we got to the ER the intense malaise improved. I sat in the ER lobby not wanting to be admitted to the ER (didn&#39;t want to be having a vaccine reaction). I stayed in the ER lobby. Symptoms completely resolved at 9:45am. I stayed there for 30 more minutes to be sure and then drove home with no other symptoms but Left arm soreness. Tachycardia never returned after the first episode. No rash, no itching, no swelling, no dyspnea. Just felt toxic. Then it resolved completely at hour 4.

I felt a lot of pressure behind my nose, but not a stuffy nose. The woozy feeling also brought on some nausea. I felt like I couldn&#39;t focus, like I was in a daze or fog. This lasted throughout the following day. Left arm at sight of injection was sore starting 2 hours after shot, couldn&#39;t raise left arm x2 days. Still sore but manageable. I took a zofran for the nausea.

Arm soreness developed about 8 hours after vaccine, woke next morning with fever 100.9, severe body aches, headache, nausea, weakness and fatigue, decreased appetite. In addition, as the  day went on I experienced a shallow cough, high pulse rate (130), tongue twitching and just felt aweful. Slept on and off all day, sx lasted the entire day. Took Tylenol throughout the day for the the fever. I awoke 3:30 am today, 1/10/21 with fever 101.5, took more Tylenol, still headache and feel tongue twitchiness  however muscle aches, body aches, nausea, decreased appetite and fatigue have subsided. I took 600mg Advil around 9am today and have been gradually feeling much better as of now 1:30pm. As a side note, I did have COVID 19 illness mildly in March 2020. It was dx&#39;d with PCR testing and my sx were loss of taste/smell, nausea, weight loss, bursted eye vessel, slight respiratory sx, I recovered well and had a follow up negative test 2 weeks after. Thank you.

Continued to feel weird rubbing chest and short of breath but no chest pain.  Decided to take her to the ED.  On the way she passed out and was not responsive still had a pulse.  In ED became responsive, reports numbness in both arms and short of breath.   Received Benadryl complete assessment, doesn&#39;t appear to be an acute allergic reaction.  ECG &amp; vitals were okay. Patient observed for 4 hours and seemed to improve so discharged.

Possible racing heart but I am prone to heart palpitations and may have just been anxious about this unexpected side effect.    Significant irritation  lasted for 48 hours, mostly improved after 72 hours, resolving with Benadryl and ice packs to the site.

                                                Fever of 102, chills, headache, body aches, nausea, sweats, lasting from 12 midnight until about 1-2 pm the next day. The symptoms were severe enough I could not work and 800 mg of ibuprofen did not take fever down enough to work or help much with the myalgia. Symptoms improved after about 14-16 hours of onset.

                                                Patient had COVID vaccine at approx 16:00. She was observed for 15 minutes and then D/C&#39;d home. At 16:18, she developed tingling in the arm. She developed redness in the upper chest. Immediately came back and arrived around 16:38. I saw patient around that time and she was breathing well, had a patent airway. Very anxious. Vitals showed tachycardia but were otherwise normal. Patient had IV placed in the right hand and was given 125mg solumedrol and 25mg diphenhydramine, both IV. Patient monitored at bedside during entire time. BP at time of D/C was 140/80 and HR of 91BPM. No swelling in mouth/tongue/lips/throat. Speaking in full sentences and feeling well. Called pharmacy and confirmed that EpiPen was received as an Rx. They have it in stock and patient aware she has to pay $109 for the medication. She will pick up EpiPen after being picked up by friend. She will be monitoring her symptoms and stay with another person for the next few hours.

I am a nurse and had nurses with me, so I did not go back to the facility for care. Numbness of anterior 1/3 of the tongue and felt  &#34;distant&#34; from surroundings within a few minutes of the injection. Symptoms progressed to numbness to the left side of the face and head. This sensation lasted a few minutes, then disappeared altogether. After about 30 more minutes, my entire tongue and head felt numb and I felt &#34;distant&#34; again. It became difficult to swallow as well. This too lasted a few minutes and disappeared altogether. I was left with a severe headache that lasted a few hours.

My vitals were stable the entire time. My neck was sore and I had no energy.  My arm of course sore at injection site. This was on a Friday. Saturday residual soreness, and low energy. Sunday overall ok but neck was very sore. Monday same. By Tuesday afternoon (1/12/21) my joints ached severely (ankles, knees, elbows), I could not keep my eyes open, my neck continued to be sore and I had extreme fatigue and mild occasional nausea and loss of appetite. I had to stay out of work the rest of the week. 11 days later I still feel some fatigue and neck soreness but otherwise okay.

                                                At 2 a.m. on January 10th, I woke up with a high pitched ringing  sound in my head. The sound was constant and disrupts my sleep significantly. It is always present but not as noticeable during the day when there is noise in the surrounding area, however, my job requires a lot of report writing and for that I work in silence. Therefore, the ringing sound is very distracting and makes it hard to focus. I saw my general practitioner, on January 14th at 4:15 p.m.. She cleaned out my right ear and started me on a 6-day steroid. She did not clean out the left ear because it did not appear to have any wax buildup. I began taking the steroid on Saturday January 16th. The ringing is still there but it does seem to be more on my left side than my right now. I went to an ent specialist on January 19th who checked my hearing and said there was no hearing loss. Her recommendations were to call her in a week and if ringing doesn&#39;t go away, she will try another steroid. As of today, the ringing is still present and I have finished the course of steroid.

                                                After the vaccine was administered I waited the 15 minutes with no symptoms. I started at 1:00 in the morning with chills and uncontrollable shaking and the feeling of never being able to get warm. I woke up with a 101 degree fever and a severe headache, muscle aches and the inability to get out of bed. I spent the whole day in bed and unable to eat that day. The next day I still had a fever of 100, muscle aches, severe headache and listlessness, but able to eat a little. I wasn&#39;t able to finally get out of bed that day until around 5:00 p.m. From then on all of the symptoms had pretty much subsided and I was able to get back to daily activities.

                                                Extreme dizziness, darkened vision as happens before losing consciousness, feeling of losing consciousness. All symptoms repeated in 5 waves. First wave hit about 10 min after dose and last about 60 seconds. 2nd wave hit a minute later and lasted approximately 30 seconds. 3rd wave hit 2 minutes later and lasted about 60 seconds with some shaking in core/diaphragm area.  4th wave hit 8-10 minutes after that and lasted 5 minutes. 4th wave was precipitated by shaking starting in diaphragm area and branching out to extremities and jawline. Shaking was uncontrollable and made speaking impossible. Shaking passed after about 6 minutes when wave subsided. 5th wave hit about 10 minutes later and was dizziness/darkening vision with disorientation, no shaking.  EMS responded to first wave by removing me from my car and having me sit in a chair, removing my mask to breath better, took vitals. Vitals were taken several times, oxygen levels varying from 93 - 98.  Oxygen was ready nearby but not used. Blood pressure varied, don?t have the readings. EMT gave water immediately and then pretzels about 30 minutes after the episodes began. I was kept for observation for an hour total after inoculation and then released to go home as symptoms had fully subsided.

                                                - 5 hours post-injection, felt extreme fatigue, mild fever and muscle soreness. Fretful sleep, woke up with a headache.  Took two Excedrin, headache went away.  Soreness in arm lasted a few more days then dissipated. - 1 week post-injection, injection site swelled  and itched like a spider bite.  That dissipated within 2 days. - Low level fatigue continued constantly - A week and 5 days after injection, experienced a repeat of the same extreme fatigue, mild fever and bad headache that had initially followed on the same day as injection. Passed a day later. - Two weeks and one day post-injection, I went to the gym and worked out pretty hard.  The next day felt excessive fatigue again and continued headache.  called pcp who advised COVID test.  Took test same day, came back negative. - Today is two weeks and two days post-injection.  Continued headache, not relieved with Excedrin or Vicodin (at night), and low level fatigue remains.  Also continued achiness in all of upper left arm, where injection was done. This is definitely out of the norm for me.

About 20 minutes after she received her vaccine, she felt chest pain and claustrophobia.   She refused an epi pen.  She took 50mg of diphenhydramine.  She quickly said that she felt better, but we monitored her blood pressure, pulse, and pulse ox.   We also called a paramedic, they arrived shortly and evaluated her.  She refused to get treatment.   Her vitals were all normal, she was drowsy from the diphenhydramine.  The chest pain and feeling of claustrophobia were gone.  She worked at a school and the school nurse checked on her throughout the rest of the day, and she was feeling fine.  She was very nervous about the vaccine, and her reaction could have been anxiety related (although she felt fine after her vaccine).

Around 2 to 3pm had this weird feeling going through my body. As the vaccine was doing something, then my tongue felt numb. I stopped eating. I couldn&#39;t  eat anymore. I felt sick and nauseous. Needed to lay down. I was scared to fall asleep because of my tongue. Still felt bad that evening. Went to work the next day. I felt bad in the morning. I tried to stay. I could not. I just felt bad as though I was sick. Still felt nauseous, headache, my body was aching.and fatigued

I was short of  breath and my heart was racing. i could not sleep all night due to up and down trying to settle my heart rate.  I was very thirsty during the night as well.  I ended up going to the ER the following day around 930am due to unrelieved tachycardia and sob. My headache continued. MY EKG showed PVC&#39;s, tachycardia and my triponin was slightly elevated on two different blood tests. I am now 7 days out and still have nagging headache, some sob and my heart races at times. When i talk alot, I become Short of breath.

                                                I have had extreme fatigue, intermittent low grade fevers, horrible leg aches, and brain fog that persisted up until the week I was vaccinated. A few days before I was vaccinated- for the first time since I was dx with COVID, I felt better. I remember thinking I was ready to start running again. I was vaccinated on Jan 15 and Jan 16 I got really sick - I had 101.5 fever and my body aches like when I had active COVID.  I couldn?t stay awake for 2-3 days. Since then the fatigue, aches, low grade fever, and brain fog- which I attribute to fatigue has persisted- sometimes at night, but this week it starts when I wake up. I?m a full time doctoral student and I have a full time Practicum. I can?t keep up - I?m halfway through my program and I?m ready to quit school. I don?t know what to do. I?m scheduled for a second vaccine and I don?t know if I should get it.

I felt ok day one, but day 2 arm injection site was painful. I took ibuprofen and went to bed. Woke up in the middle of the night with severe left shoulder pain that seemed to radiate to the clavicle and neck. Fever, chills also. I called off from work and slept until noon the next day, a full 48 hours post injection and felt much better with exception to the left shoulder. I have continued to have intermittent pain in the arm, that also now results in numbness and tingling of my fingers and left hand. I can hardly sleep at night due to the pain. there is not much that will relieve it, other than finding maybe a pillow for support, but that only lasts a short time and then I am awakened with pain again. It seems to be the joint itself that is affected. And instead of getting better it seems to be getting worse.

I did not panic (although it was very scary) because my pharmacist/friend had told me that this happened to her overnite after her first dose.  By morning  my mild headache &amp; warmth went away &amp; I was able to move but was extremely sore with muscle aches throughout my body.  I was unable to do anything all day &amp; night.  I was better the next morning but still somewhat achy &amp; my aches proceeded to continue over the next few days but decreased daily.

In the middle of the night between 2/6/2021 and 2/7/2021 I started experiencing enough pain in my right armpit that woke me up in the middle of the night. I felt that it was likely swollen lymph nodes and took some Advil to relieve the discomfort.  My armpit was sore through the weekend and the discomfort has slowly decreased. Today the area feels slightly swelled and I have experienced some aching in my right breast. It also feels as if my lymph nodes have started to get inflamed in my right groin area (2/8/2021).

                                                1/26/21 @ 10:05 am:Received 1st Moderna dose Left Deltoid area. Returned to my office at HSH and at 11:55 am left arm at site of vaccine tender and I became very tired. At 1:30 pm I began to have slight chills that lasted maybe an hour. The pain in my arm progressed and by night my arm was very sore. I could not sleep on my left side. 1/27/21 at 5:00 am I woke up and was still in pain. I could not even put the slightest amount of pressure/touch at the site of injection. At 5:04 am I texted my boss that I would not be in. I felt very fatigued the entire day and my arm and left side of my body was sore. I couldn&#39;t flex my deltoid and the muscles in my upper arm hurt. My deltoid was also swollen. 1/28/21 I woke up at 4:30 am and my arm was still sore. My index finger of my left had had pain in my joints and I could not bend my finger without pain. I took Motrin 600 mg and that helped a little. Over the next couple of days then pain at site and in my arm got better but my right index finger was still sore in the joint areas. On 2/2/21 I noticed there was in induration area of approximately 1/4&#34; at the site as well as below the site. There was also slight bruising. My arm was still a little swollen and it was warm to touch. On 2/3/21 the vaccination site became itchy.As of today 2/5/21 I no longer feel pain or itching in my arm. My index finger is still a little tender when flexing and I still have some malaise.

                                                Pt was being observed for 15 minutes after covid vaccine administration. Pt was noticed to be &#34;sleepy&#34; and  RN SB went to talk to pt who appeared to be lightheaded. I went and got the available emergency kit for RN   SB to check pt&#39;s pulse ox. Pt&#39;s SaO2 was 99% and Pulse was 89. Pt reports that she had a recent heart cath and high blood pressure. Pt reports not taking her blood pressure medication prior to coming. 5-10 minutes after covid vaccine pt was more alert and stated she was feeling better but had vision changes. Pt&#39;s blood pressure was checked and it was 160/110 which was taken manually, pulse ox 98% and pulse was 87. Pt denies difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Pt able to speak in full sentence. Pt was told that we would like her to stay for further evaluation. Pt was able to ambulate without difficulty to another place in the auditorium for further observation. 30 minutes post covid vaccination pt was alert and respirations were even/unlabored. BP 130/110 on both arms manually, pulse 67 and SpO2 99%. Pt still complaining of blurred vision/double vision. Pt was talking to husband on phone without difficulty and asking him to move to garage area to pick her up. Pt was told to follow up with her cardiologist and PCP. 45 minutes after vaccine admin pt asked if I could help her call her cardiologist office. I told her yes. I called Doctor&#39;s office and was transferred to the nurse line. The nurse told me that she was not Doctor&#39;s nurse but she would send him a note and recommends pt go the emergency department for vision changes. Pt was told the recommendation and called husband to tell him to meet her at ED while we were waiting for a wheel chair to transport pt. Pt works in nutrition and there was a supervisor or manager that knew her and said that he would let them know what was going on. She was supposed to work at 1330 today. Pt walked to wheelchair without difficulty and pt was transported to ED. Pt&#39;s husband was at the ED waiting when we got there. ED triage nurse was updated that pt had received 2nd dose of covid vaccine, had a recent heart Cath and was told by cardiologist office to go to ED for vision changes.

I got up and it felt like my ribs were rubbing against my kidneys. It was hurting that bad. I felt like I did when I had COVID the first time.  I just laid on the couch. I took 2 Ibuprofen that helped more than Tylenol. My lymph nodes were swollen and I couldn&#39;t even put my bra on. The swelling was also in my neck. I continued to have chills and a fever. I was sweaty. From Friday to Sunday, it started to dissipate and then I was able to get around better. My lymph nodes were swollen for about 5 days.  I started to feel better, with the exception of my arm which is still bothering me. I experienced sharp pains in my arm last night and it&#39;s been itchy.

                                                SECOND DOSE.  Side effects stared about 16 hours after the vaccine.  Started with slight soreness in left arm.  This remained a slight discomfort. Body tingling sensation turned into body aches.  Most were in the lower back and shoulders.  Random shooting pains in thigh muscles.  First temperature check at 8:00 am was 101.1 it increased throughout the day, peaking at 102.6.   I took 500 mg of Extra Strength Tylenol at 3:30 pm .  The fever dropped to 100.1 by 6:30 pm.  I took another 500 mg.  At 11:00 pm, the fever was up slightly to 101.6.  By 7:30 the next morning, the fever was down to 99.8.  It was gone a few hours later. Headache associated with fever, but not severe. NO fatigue, so I could not sleep off the fever.  I was wide awake and miserable. Felt fine by 8:00 am, so side bad side effects lasted approximately 24 hours.  By approximately 40 hours after the vaccine, I felt fine.  Very minimal soreness in arm remaining.

I chose not to go to the doctor or hospital as I just felt lousy and stayed in bed and administered self care (that was yesterday, Wednesday, February 17, 2021).  Today, Thursday, February 18, 2021 I chose to stay home from both my jobs even though most of the symptoms have not returned but I am still very tired!  As for treatments; I drank lots of water, took Tylenol and Motrin (as appropriate per package) during different parts of the day, ate in moderation, and slept a good portion of Wednesday 2/17.

                                                After receiving COVID-19 Moderna vaccine dose 1 on 1/28/2021, came down with headache and soreness in left arm the next day. Throughout the night on Saturday, 1/31/2021 began having stiff neck and left side, including arm and leg, became weak with numbness throughout. The numbness was mostly felt in fingers and toes of left side. These symptoms continued and progressively became worse throughout the following week 1/31/2021-2/8/2021. In addition to the left side symptoms worsening, numbness and weakness developed in the right side fingers and toes. On 2/8/2021 numbness and weakness in left side became so bad that left leg was very heavy and dragging when trying to walk.  I was unable to work that day and was told to call Employee Health.  Employee Health directed me to go to the Emergency Room. While at the Emergency Room, I received lab tests, XRay, EKG, CT Scans, and MRI of neck. MRI was evaluated by Neuro/Orthopedic Surgeon who diagnosed me with Cord Compression Myelopathy and told me that I needed immediate urgent surgery. ER Doctor, Neuro/Orthopedic Surgeon and Hospitalist all felt that the COVID-19 vaccine could have caused the inflammatory immune response that led to further cord compression.  I had anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery on 2/11/2021. The hope of the ACDF surgery was to stop further progression of the symptoms of numbness and weakness, but was not guaranteed to restore normal function of the left side. I am currently still experiencing numbness and weakness in left side postoperatively.

                                                Left side stroke-like symptoms. I was walking and 20 minutes in I started having left leg weakness. This then turned into full left side numb/foggy feeling. I was with my son (and I&#39;m a nurse) so I asked him to test for signs of a stroke. I could smile evenly but it didn&#39;t feel like it. I had strength in both hands and could lift my arms. I was able to communicate what to look for to my son without slurred speech. But I was not stable on my left foot and felt as if I was listing to the left side. My left side was foggy. I moved my arm but flet it in slow motion. When I got home, I sat down and stretched. The symptoms went away and I was able to continue the day without episode. The episode lasted 20-30 minutes as I was walking home still. In hind sight, I did have a similar eposide after the first dose (Moderna lot 037K20A on 1/29/20) while exercising at home but sat down and thought it was due to a hard workout. That time it was just a weak left leg that was giving out on me and lasted 5 minutes because I stopped the workout.

                                                My left arm was very sore , red and hurting pretty bad. I went to bed around 10:00pm thinking everything was ok and it was a normal reaction. Woke up around 1:30am arm hurting so I got up to get some more tylenol. I immediately felt sick to my stomach (both ways) and I passed out and broke my nose.  I was coherient at times and other times I could not seem to answer any questions. My husband got me to the ER and they took my blood pressure 4 or 5 times and the nurse said &#34;I can&#39;t get a blood pressure&#34;. Another nurse came in and said we will take this one ! My blood pressure had bottomed out and caused all sorts of things going on. I left ER after 4 1/2 hrs. with a BP of 107/57 but I am not sure how low it got! At one point my husband looked at monitor and my bottom number was 39 but it is all a blur to me. As of today I still feel week (heavy arms) and I am concerned about taking my second dose!

                                                12 hours following receipt of vaccination at 9:30 pm on 2/23, developed severe chills and muscle and joint achiness (I was trembling uncontrollably and my teeth were chattering). A fever followed shortly thereafter and typically hovered between 100-102 with a high of 103 for the next 36 hours despite taking Tylenol regularly. The fever finally broke around 6 am on 2/25.  I developed a severe headache that felt at times like there was a ping pong ball in my head, and it later became a searing headache.  I have had a dull headache every morning since then, though it dissipates after taking Tylenol. Around 5 am on 2/24 I became very nauseous but did not vomit. My appetite was greatly diminished for 48 hours plus.  The injection site had a rash and was very swollen and painful. The lymph node under that arm also swelled to the size of a mandarin orange and was very painful to the touch. As the swelling reduced, starting Friday morning 2/26, I noticed brusing in that location that ended up extending down my side along my ribs and right breast. As of today 3/2 the swelling is gone and the bruising is fading.  I am  a week out from the second dose of the vaccine, and when I was exactly a week out from the first dose in my left arm, I developed a secondary rash/swelling/itching at the injection site that last about 36 hours. It has not happened yet with my right arm, but I have read it can appear between 7-9 days after vaccination.  Overall, I was very ill for about 36 hours and was not able to go to work or do any other sort of normal activity, and had moderate symptoms for the next 12 hours, 48 hours total of side effects following vaccination.

Also pain between my shoulder blades. This subsided after two days.  Beginning 26 hours after the shot I had stomach cramping, nausea, extreme fatigue, body aches, headache, chills. This lasted for 3 1/2 days. Then I developed a severe cystitis flare up, which I had not had in years. I?m still dealing with the cystitis flare which causes fatigue, bodyaches, frequent urination, insomnia, pressure in the bladder and pelvic area, extreme discomfort, nausea and headache.  I?m taking 200 mg Advil every four hours, using a heating pad, drinking mint tea, and taking desert harvest freeze dried Aloe Vera capsules (6) daily.

My blood pressure dropped to 87/57 (normally have high BP).  I had a hard time catching my breath.  These symptoms came in waves about every 15 minutes.  I was monitored for 2 hours until I felt well enough to go home.  I arrived at home a little after 5:00 pm and started having a very bad migraine.  I had fever, (101.8) chills, and trouble walking.  My legs felt like they weighed 100 pounds each.  Every joint in my body ached. I was extremely lethargic for the remainder of the evening.  The next day, 03/10/2021 I continued to suffer from the same symptoms as I had on the first day.  I was unable to return to work.  I could  not drive safely.  I attempted to be active and it resulted in being dizzy and very faint.  The migraines are incredibly painful  I have had migraines for years but these were the worst I have ever experienced.  I am now on day 3 (03/11/2021) and I am still unable to work. I have extreme fatigue and headaches. I am reporting this event to hopefully help in research of the vaccine.  I believe in science and will do whatever is asked of me to help this progress.

Masses developed on both knees, also knee pain.  Large red lump where injection was given that was warm to the touch and increased in size and itchy. Went to ER to be seen but nothing was done.

                                                Neurological response/trigger  - severe leg pain and weakness in both legs. Extremely difficult to walk and not able to climb stairs.  Disrupted sleep (woke up in pain throughout the night). This lasted for a couple of weeks, the worst (debilitating) being 48 hours from initial onset.  I also had difficulty breathing and nausea about 15m after injection which lasted for about 24 hours, then subsided.   I contacted my neurologist, Dr., early next morning, and notified her of what happened and she advised that I increase the dosage of gabapentin until symptoms resolved. After 48 hours, I began to walk without experiencing so much pain and weakness, and it slowly subsided over the course of a couple of weeks. I still experience flares of pain in both of my legs periodically.

                                                About three days after the injection, my right arm itched regularly with increasing intensity. I noticed a ring of redness that also intensified over the next days. By the following Saturday, it was swollen and by Sunday it hurt and itched enough to disrupt sleep. It has since faded but there is still a pale patch where the reaction occurred.

Lasted only briefly, but felt very &#34;off&#34; all day leading up to the event, and after. Woke next morning and felt completely normal, with regular mood regulation and mental clarity.

                                                On February 23rd, I got home about 4:30 in the afternoon after I got the shot at 12:30 that day and started to feel sick. I had nausea, vomiting, fever of 103.2, had trouble breathing, felt like someone was sitting in the middle of my chest, left side of my body was numb, weakness, migraine headaches, and muscle aches in neck and shoulder.  I went to bed after I took Tylenol and nausea medicine. I woke up at 4 am the next morning and told my husband to get the girls (our daughters) up and that i needed to go to the hospital. When I got there they did a chest x-ray, blood work and gave me a breathing treatment. I was admitted to the hospital. While I was there they gave me IV fluids and medicine for headaches and nausea medicine. I was released about 2:30 in the afternoon on Feb 26th. I still have muscle aches  and head aches. I have noticed my memory is real short, I have trouble remembering things from yesterday.

At 0245 on 10MAR21, she returned to the vaccine room with a cup of ice water and a towel she was putting to her head and neck.  She reported to the RN that &#34;about 45 minutes ago, she broke out in hot flashes and went to the bathroom.&#34;  She was talking a lot and appeared &#34;antsy&#34; (which was how she appeared when she got her vaccine). She sat down and had something to drink.  The RN checked her vital signs and reported they were normal.  After about 10 minutes, she reported she started feeling better.  She also told the RN that she had taken Advil before she returned to the vaccine room.  She had listed NSAIDS as an allergy on her consent.  Security escorted her out.  On 11MAR21, she called our onsite RN to report injection site pain, swelling and redness (left deltoid), muscle pain, chills and nausea/vomiting.

Then, the pain radiated to entire upper arm between elbow and shoulder on the right arm by the 6pm.  By 8pm, it was difficult to move or bend arm.  Could not sleep on that arm due to pain.  Next day, pain in arm persisted at full arm between elbow and shoulder, but slightly less.  Arm pain finally went away on its own on Monday March 22nd.  On that same day, feelings of a mild headache began along with congestion and feeling like I&#39;m about to get a cold or similar illness.  By March 24th, fatique, same feeling of illness is to such a point, I am going in for COVID testing at a drive thru facility and I cannot get my physical therapy done because of sudden nasal congestion, fatique and feeling like I&#39;m going to get a sore throat, but do not actually get one.

Within a few hours the vaccine site had a knot the size of a baseball with redness, soreness and hot to the touch. Saturday about 11:30 I started running a fever of 101.8, had severe bone pain and headache. I felt overall bad. These symptoms lasted 3 days. By Sunday the knot on my arm was improving to golf ball size and continued to improve each day. I developed a rash on my face and chest on Tuesday or Wednesday. Still having headaches on and off through Friday. Friday I had stomach upset. It took me a full week to feel pretty good again. Saturday through Monday was the worst with fever., headache and bone pain.

It felt like I was hit by a dump truck. Worse achiness I have felt in my life. Terrible terrible headache - I felt like I could feel every hair on my head.  I took Tylenol for Fever and it broke and I had night sweats for the rest of night - I have never sweated like that before - wet in neck, head, back - on bed. I  had fever the next day. I had to work with the fever and the pain - (I&#39;m a nurse). I slept for two days after that -Saturday night the  fever came back - 102.4  and had bone achiness and when the fever broke I had the bad night sweats again.  I slept all day Sunday. Monday, the swelling came back  - hands,  lower legs and on my face and the hair loss came back. The fever was gone but the night sweats lasted for about a week (with no fever.)  I am still having some of the hair loss but the worst of it was for those initial 2-3 weeks. The swelling in my hands/face etc lasted about 2 weeks. Two weeks after vaccine, I lost my sense of taste - I can taste some things but not other things. Bone aches from fibromyalgia is still bad. I am still experiencing severe fatigue and I have an issue with short-term memory now. I noticed my memory stuff around the beginning of February - Dr. prescribed Strattera but that isn&#39;t helping but it did help with my short attention span issues that I had prior to vaccine. On March 5, I had a fever again and that went up to 103 at midnight and I took Tylenol had chills and achiness and the night sweats - sopped and wet. Tired the next day and felt yucky and achy. The following Friday, March 12, the same thing happened that night around midnight. That time, I didn&#39;t get out of bed to take Tylenol but took it the next morning when I woke up - and I was really tired that Saturday and didn&#39;t feel well. Last Friday, I took Tylenol before I went to bed and I was fine. I am still a little swollen and I&#39;m still taking the Lasix.

I seen my Dr. and an ENT they believe its a reflux issue, but I did not have this issue before the vaccine. I had soars in my mouth and never had that before, my gingiva was inflamed.  I also got shingles about 43 days after the second dose.

Patient reports feeling fatigued, having cough, and feeling more short of breath for the last day, and has developed central chest pain which is pleuritic in the emergency department.  She reports that the chest pain is 4/10 in severity and does not radiate.  Her caregiver at bedside reports that the patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for the last 3 or so weeks.  Of note, she becomes dyspneic with limited exertion, such as going up a flight of stairs, at baseline.  She had a fever of 101.4 °F at home earlier today, but denies chills or diaphoresis.  He had 1 episode of nonbloody vomiting earlier today.  Denies nausea at this time.  She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday, 4 weeks after the first.   They note that approximately 5 years ago, she had a prolonged admission for which she was transferred to OHSU and was on ECMO for a time before making a nearly full recovery.  She has had the baseline dyspnea on exertion since that time.   Review of Systems  Constitutional: Positive for fever and malaise/fatigue. Negative for chills.  HENT: Negative for sore throat.

CT angiogram pulmonary:  FINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    #Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  -Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  Considerations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (&#34;tea and toast&#34;), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   - Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

I noticed my vision blurring and I had a sudden onset of a Horrific headache. By 6 pm I was itching very severely. It was as if I was clawing at my skin. I called one of the dr&#39;s I  work with and he called me in a medrol dose pack. I started the dose pack at 8:30 pm on the 6th. The headache continued, I tried motrin, fiorcet, and oxycodone with no relief. I still have the headache but it is not as intense as it was. I was up all night itching and dealing with the headache by the am , my jaw was  visibly swollen and it felt like I had been in a fight. I was not able to go to work on 1/7/21 and could only work 1/2 day on 1/8/21. the itching did not subside much till sat 1/9 but is coming back as I  taper down off the steroids. My last pill was this am. The jaw pain and swelling lasted till sat night and is subsiding daily. I may have to call my pcp and be seen this week.

(total of 20lbs). A few days after getting 1st dose the hot flashes have been relentless; Internal hot flashes literally every 5-10m, daily, consistently throughout the day, even as I fill out this report. Not sure if the dose has anything to do with this starting up again, but I wanted to report it just in case some others report it.  I do not take anything for the flashes. I just seek some form of air conditioning such as a fan. However, the flashes are very annoying as I even get them while sleeping and it interrupts my rest. No sweating though.

Occasionally the site itches very slightly; ice reduces itch.  Upper arm was sore to touch on Friday night/Saturday morning, but has not been such since then.  No loss of function and all affect to activities of daily living.

At some time early in the morning of 26 Jan she experienced headache and felt very tired so stayed home from work. During the morning she mainly slept however had some Motrin and a banana around 0830 due to feeling feverish. She went back to sleep until about 1030. When she woke up, she still felt feverish and then noticed her pulse started racing a few minutes later. Her husband took her BP but her pulse was reading ?error?.  She then put on her iWatch and had a pulse of 210. She felt very sweaty, hot and ?weird??like she might pass out but I did not have any pain other than my throat felt tight.  She went to the ER. Within about 30-40 minutes of the onset of SVT she was given adenosine and converted with a 6mg dose.

                                                At the time of the injection I felt immediate pain and burning. The next morning when I woke up I was unable to move my shoulder without excruciating pain. I had almost no range of motion. I had absolutely no strength. I started to take ibuprofen and cycle with Tylenol. I treated with heat, ice, icy hot and salon pass patches. My pain is located where my joint or rotator cuff would be located. I had no deltoid pain this time. My shots were both from the same lot. It is now eight days and I have some relief but still some pain, loss of motion and loss of strength. When I reported it to health programs they asked me to fill out this form. I am going to continue on the same regimen and hope it resolves itself. I have been doing a lot of things one-handed and trying to avoid use of my left arm.

                                                Day of injection I was fine, I even felt more energetic than usual, at 2am I woke up feeling Flu like symptoms, fever of 100, and achy all over and my arm hurt terribly.  I Took a Motrin 800, fell asleep and woke only to drink water, take temp, more Motrin, and back to sleep.  I slept about 20 hours only up to move to couch, then back to bed.  I was lethargic, symptoms similar to the flu. That was Sunday, Monday was slightly better but exhausted and barely functional.  I am VERY nervous to get the second shot as I do not want to feel that bad, let alone worse (which I&#39;ve heard is the case) .  I&#39;m scheduled to go this Saturday 2/6/2021 for the second dose.  I know that these are already noted symptoms so I knew I was in the category with others that experienced the same thing, I just want to confirm that I was another individual that had a tough time after the shot and that perhaps there are more people that have the common feeling just are not reporting.  I am pretty tough usually, (having homebirths, dealing with pain that I didn&#39;t think was that bad) this took me down. I was very surprised that I had that tough of a time.

Went to work at hospice on the Covid unit for 12 hours on Friday 1/22.  Felt really foggy and unable to concentrate at work. After work I was relaxing at home trying watching television but not able to focus when about 09:30 I started to not feel my big toes and started to have muscle twitching (no fever, no chills). By 11pm my all body was shaking like if I had Parkinson?s disease.  My neighbors drove me to the ER. My blood pressure was 160/100 (my norm is 100/60), and Parkinsonian syndrome.  I got scared as the heart is a muscle and I did not want my heart to go into  irregular rhythm . Better to be safe than sorry.

The next day I had fever, chills, nausea and it just continued. Yesterday morning I had my husband take me to ER and I had lost 15 pounds since Wednesday. I couldn&#39;t keep down fluids. They tested me for Corona and the flu but both were negative. They also gave me fluids. Everything and smells and tastes terrible. They gave me Zofran but it didn&#39;t help. I haven&#39;t been able to take my medicine.

                                                I received the vaccine at 7:20 am.  At 12:30pm I started to notice discomfort in my left him and right arm. I also started to feel some fatigue and &#39;foggy&#39;.  Within an hour I was very fatigued, the joint pain in my hip progressed and had a headache. I used Tylenol and rest to help the symptoms. I was not able to go to work the next day. By 7pm on Feb 24 I felt fine. I was able to go to work and I no longer need Tylenol. I noticed that on February 25 I had hives on my torso. The hives had persisted for the past two days. They are located only on my torso and I don&#39;t have any other symptoms at this time.

Those intense symptoms went away almost exactly after 24 hours, and I was just tired for 24 hours more. However, the dizziness has persisted. IT doesn&#39;t feel like vertigo, but is amplified with head positional changes sometimes. It feels more like when we have been on a boat for 1 day, and get off, come onshore and feel that walking on the land produced unsteadiness of gait, perceptual challenge with walking. I keep bumping into things, like I am not judging the distances correctly. A competitive athlete, I am a little concerned and a bit bothered on a daily basis with basic daily activity, never mind higher demand function, and hope these symptoms resolve soon.

I stayed 1 hour after at facility . The next day disorientation was better. The head pressure was better after 2 weeks. The hearing loss has slightly improved. The ear ringing worsened significantly and is still going on now, 9 weeks later. It has improved some now after seeing an ENT ear specialist. I have been taking medicine to try to help the ear ringing for about 7 weeks. The severity of the ear ringing has gone from an 8 out of 10 in loudness to about a 2. It is not gone and may never go away.

                                                Within 20 minutes of leaving the facility both arms broke out in hives.  My feet, legs, hands, arms and head have all swelled and the &#34;COVID-19 Arm&#34; rash has covered the majority of my body.   It moved proportionally up from the tips of my toes and fingers up my legs and arms, up my neck and head (face), and this past Friday I saw the first redness on my torso. The rash burns and is tight.  Last Thursday I had a lump come up in my ankle which seems to be growing, my doctor sent me for an x-ray which I went on Friday as I was so wiped out emotionally Thursday that I needed to go home and sleep.  I have what appears to be bruises or spots starting to appear on my body.  I&#39;m maxed out.

When I woke up morning following vaccine, tingly lips and severe nerve pain up and down legs. Legs kept giving way with step and  could not lift leg high enough to enter vehicle. At the time of writing this 94PM the day after the vaccine ( approx 35 hours after vaccine) nerve pain is much less, very tired/ slept most of the day,  nerve pain in legs, hips, back is much less. Stomach issues still persist.

It felt like a bad cold headache and congestion with extreme fatigue which lasted for three days. Two weeks after the vaccine I had a rash on the arm which was round and in the area of vaccination. The rash was warm, raised and it was itchy. It got worse for two days and I took Zyrtec and Benadryl which helped resolve the rash. After the second shot I felt like I had the flu fever 103 with body aches and stiffness for three days. I had a few episodes of dizziness. I still have occasional dizziness since the second vaccine dose.

About 12:30 pm, was cleaning a crib at work, had trouble getting up from a squatting position to standing position.  By 3:30 pm, felt horrible - hurt particularly in hip joints, knee joints, also in ankles, and wrists.  Called in to work - took PTO on Tuesday, could not move hips and knees without some assist (on her own), felt like her hips and knees &#34;had rusted.&#34;  Felt she had done something very foolish by taking the shot.  Had some severe mental anguish for about 24 hours wondering if this would progress to something more serious (says she was concerned about something like Guillain-Barre Syndrome). Suffered through the night.  Had fever (did not check temperature) and chills.  Was able to get up on Wednesday and it was better.  By 10 am on Wednesday, it was gone.  Had pain, but not swelling at the injection site.  Had to take 2 days PTO days.    2nd vaccine given at about 1:30 pm on a Sunday.  By Sunday evening, chills off and on, fatigue.  Sunday night, when she would sit or lay down, she would feel like she was moving - almost like she was on a boat or had been on a boat, and had a nauseating headache from back of neck and up into her head.  Had alternations of feeling warm and chills. By Tuesday, felt better by 3 pm.  Still feel a little woozy this morning.  Feels like a gentle movement inside like she has been on a boat.  Makes her a little nauseated.  Denies any pain now.  Had pain, but not swelling at the injection site.  Had to take two PTO days..

                                                Body aches in large muscles.  From mid torso down through thighs.  Became overly sensitive and emotional due to the fatigue of the aches.  Started the evening of Friday, March 19th, peaking on Monday March 22 and began to subside.  By March 24, I began to feel more normal.  At the peak of the side effects I felt weak and shaky standing from seated position or vice versa.  Muscles felt weak like after a heavy workout or run. Felt no extra energy for anything.  Also noticed chills, especially in left hand after the vaccine was dispensed.

                                                Friday I started getting abdominal pain and it was worse at night and I couldn&#39;t sleep - felt like I wanted to vomit - but no vomiting. Saturday night I did vomit. I had to stay upright because of nausea. Monday, the symptoms were less. Slight abdominal pain was still there. It would come at one spot and it was very severe pain. Monday by 8:00 it was less. Next morning it was a little more severe. And then the next three days I had nausea on and off and it was tapering off. On Tuesday morning, I talked to the Dr. - Telehealth call - he told me it was most likely it was from vaccine and to take the next vaccine also. By the next following Thursday, suddenly the nausea was all gone. (So the symptoms lasted a week.)  Doctor told me not to take any medication. I had no reaction to second vaccine.

                                                Approximately 28 hours after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced intense pain and immobility in my left arm.  I had soreness as one would expect after receiving the injection but this was different.  I took ibuprofen and went to bed. I awoke several times in the night after rolling over in bed with pain.  I awoke in the morning and could not move my arm. My husband had to assist me in dressing.   That day (two days following vaccine), I had myalgia, neck pain, mild headache, fatigue, and a low grade fever.   My arm continued to be very painful although no swelling or redness.  The following morning (three days following vaccine), although I still had pain and decreased mobility, it was improved.  I am filing this report on the evening of 1/8/2021. Although I am not back to baseline, I anticipate that I will be in the next few days.  I thought it was important to report this given the severity of my symptoms.

                                                I received the shot at 8:10 am and felt nothing.  As the morning progressed, I developed a sore arm, similar to a flut shot.  However, it was worse, and I also felt achy in my neck.  I drove home from work around noon, and I couldn&#39;t even use my arm on the steering wheel.  These symptoms continued and I finally took Tylenol in the middle of the afternoon, and evening going to bed.  I slept horribly and woke up feeling like a train wreck.  I took my temperature. It was 102!  I started taking the Tylenol again.  I couldn&#39;t even raise my arm, either. My arm didn&#39;t hurt if it was just still, but it would hurt if it was touched, and I could not raise it for 3 days.  Despite taking the Tylenol, I felt awful all day and really had to stay bedridden.  I was also very thirsty both the day of the vaccine and this second day.  Saturday morning I woke up feeling better, but as the day wore on, the aches and fever came back.  Sunday was the same as Saturday.  Monday was similar, but better overall.  Today is Tuesday.   My arm still feels a little weird and I cannot completely raise it. I did have the COVID-19 back in March and have antibodies, as far as I know as I have donated to Red Cross 4 times.

                                                I was feeling great until day 9 after the injection.  I could not sleep, was very warm and arm was sore.  I woke next morning to find my left arm at the injection site very swollen, hard, red, rashy, and extremely hot to the touch.  I advised with the nurses at work that morning, and I was told it was a common side affect, but I was still uneasy since I had no reaction until day 9.  I was prompted to call my doctor, which was out of the office, was advised to go to prompt care.  I was treated with a prescription of steriods and antibiotics.  Slept better that night, less hot, hard, rashy, and red next morning.  Still used ice packs during the work day.

I woke up a few hours later with chills, headaches and body aches.  I took another Benadryl and slept for the rest of the night.  The next day, I woke up with the same symptoms, but worse.  I was very drowsy and slept all day.  I had no appetite.  That evening, I took some Tylenol and began to feel better a few hours later.  The next day, the symptoms had mostly resolved.  A little bit achy and sore but overall, I felt good.

I didn&#39;t say anything I just kept on going to see if it went away. I went home and was in a lot of pain while driving. I went home took my medication and went to sleep. Woke up in the morning and pain went away, the medication worked. I went to my Dr., went I left I started feeling nausea, dizzy and weak. I went to my sister&#39;s house and was in pain and laid down. I was cold and freezing and felt like I have Covid. I asked my sister to get me a trash bag a nd wash the blankets because I thought I had Coivd. I drove home and called my boss and told him I can&#39;t walk, I feel so bad, sweating and I was burning up, cold and hot.  I cant move I cant move. I stayed in my car until I can move. I made it inside my house and laid there and was burning up, cold hot, in pain, dizzy, everything was going on. I felt like a Mac truck hit me hard, like when I had Covid. I took Medicine and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning (Saturday) and my temp. was 101-102, I stayed in bed and later in the evening went away like it never happened. The same thing happened when I had the Covid.  I had Covid July 31, 2020 and lasted for 5 weeks.  It felt like the worst days like when I had Covid, I was going to call out to my job but it went away and I went to work.

After swelling went down I still have the red mark (size bigger than a quarter)  and until yesterday (12 days after shot) the area was still hot.

The next few days I felt flush although I did not register a fever and had some episodes of chills.  On 1/15/21 I began to experience itching at the injection site.   On 1/23/21, I developed a rash/hives on my chest.  The area is red with raised bumps in a small cluster that occasionally itches.  Since the onset of the rash on my chest, I have also experienced itchiness on my arms, legs and torso.  My left upper arm has raised, red areas.  My legs have patchy red areas as do my shoulders and back.  I have also had a disruption in my sleep which started after being diagnosed with the virus and is still occurring.

                                                About 10-12hrs later, my right shoulder started hurting and  got worse. The night of the 31st it was excruciating, it felt like someone was breaking my bones, it was a 10/10 pain, I wanted to cry the pain was so bad.  I took two Advil and put ice on it and I got to where I couldn&#39;t move my arm. I had difficulty sleeping as well. In the morning it was just as bad and I couldn&#39;t raise my arm it hurt so bad. My husband had noticed the shot given so high in my arm.  The next two days is didn&#39;t get much better, I tired to move it and lift it up but hard. The 5th day after the shot I called to get into the Orthopedic Dr to see that was going on. it was a little better but still a lot of pain.  The Dr. had told me to try to keep moving it, he  did an xray and nothing was broken but told me to follow up with him if it didn&#39;t get better. He did say to ask to have the second dose injection given a little lower in my arm.  It wakes me up once or more at night, I&#39;m not able to do what I use to do. I can move it a little better but my shoulder still hurts, I&#39;m not using it as much. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine.

                                                On the day of the vaccine did have arm soreness 4 hours after the vaccine.  Started to get chills and aches around 8:30.  Then went to sleep and woke up around around midnight with the worse chills, teeth chattering.  Had this feeling all through the night and could not calm down from the aches, temp was 99.  As the next morning progressed, she calmed down and was exhausted.  The fever started to elevate and went up to 101.5 all the next day, really exhausted and was sleeping most of that day.  It took probably about 4 days to recover from that with low energy level.  She felt that she had gone through a shortened COVID.  They had already had COVID at the end of September, and it took 2 1/2 weeks for that to resolve.  The following Thursday 1/7/21 started having diarrhea that lasted 4 days.  Then she finally felt better.  She also spoke with a friend who took the Pfizer vaccine and had the same reaction to her vaccine as well.   Called doctor and he advised her to wait it out.

I took oxycodone (7.5mg), but  it only took the edge off of the pain. It felt like a nasty RA flare up. Since then, I have more bone and joint pain than usual. I am afraid to take the second dose.   Insomnia since receiving the injection. (ongoing) I can&#39;t be sure that this is related to the vaccine, but I work with others who are also experiencing ongoing insomnia since receiving the Moderna vaccine.

                                                -Approximately one hour after receiving the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid vaccine on 2/3/21, I noticed a  heat wave kind of sensation from my back , up through the back of my head, and very mild dizziness. -Between 3:00 and 4:00 pm I noticed I was becoming very tired, and having some difficulty concentrating  and recalling information. I noticed my arm had started to become mildly achy, and body was beginning to ache mildly as well. -About 7:45 pm I was experiencing significant fatigue and &#34;brain fog&#34; during conversation with my son. Stopped in the middle of things and went to bed, needing to hold handrail to walk upstairs due to extreme fatigue and mild dizziness. -Between 3:00 and 4:00 am I woke up thinking I was feeling vibration of loud sound - but it was heart rate of 150 bpm. Temperature was 102 F.  Chest was heavy and tight.  8/10  pain with head ache and body ache.  Heart rate remained high for at least 15 minutes, so my husband took me to the Emergency Department. They ran EKG, took labs, and chest x-ray. My heart rate started to come down during this time. I was told there were no problematic findings. My heart rate was between 100-106 by the time I left. Fever had come down to about 100.  Began to get extreme nausea - was given Zofran. -In bed the entire day 2/4/21.  -2/5/21, continued to experience mild to moderate fatigue and brain fog, difficulty with recall and new learning. Had to leave work early. Continued same symptoms throughout evening, able to sleep in segments. -2/6/21: As of today, I am continuing to experience fatigue and some brain fog, for example, I wrote down my only son&#39;s birthday incorrectly. This is not remotely normal.

They game me some orange juice and monitored me for about 15 minutes. I went back to work and I felt shaky for about 3-4 hours. I then had a terrible headaches and back ache. That same night I got some hives and chest tightness with increased in throat production and the headache continued that night.  The next day I still felt tired and achy, felt like a mild flu. I had chest tightness with difficulty breathing.  I continued to feel sick Saturday and Sunday and Monday I had a Covid test done, which was negative.  On Monday I had rashes on my arms and legs and continued to have the hives and on Tuesday I started to feel a bit better with a dry cough.  On Tuesday 01-12-220 I had a chest x-ray which was negative.  On Wednesday, I woke up and felt much worse and that&#39;s when I called the NP and she prescribed three inhalers for my breathing issues. On 01-27-2020, since I was still feeling not better I called off work.  As now, I am slowly getting better, but I still continued with the hives.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 VACCINE EUA Vaccine administered at 3:00 Pm. At about 7:00 PM I started to notice my left arm hurting a bit and my left arm was swollen from the injection site all the way to my wrist.  Swelling stopped right before the wrist.  The skin on my left arm appeared like a veiny red rash, not raised however.  I also started to get flushed with hot, red blotches all over my chest and face.  Symptoms increased in intensity and didn&#39;t seem to be resolving so I took two Benadryl at 9:00 PM.  After about 30 minutes the redness and flushing started to improve.  Arm pain increased greatly to the point that I could not sleep.  I took two Tylenol at 3:00 am and that took the edge off the pain.  By the morning , the redness and flushing disappeared from chest and face. Left arm is still swollen and painful as I write this at 12;39 PM on Wednesday 2/10/2021. I had called the doctor on 2/9 but did not get in touch with them until 2/10.  They told me to call 911 or go to ER if breathing issues.

                                                Besides the usual expected side effects, on the day of vaccination 1/8/21 I had chest pressure on the sternum area and back pressing together that became more and more uncomfortable as the day progressed. Vaccine was  at 2pm and an hour or two later I noticed it. By evening very uncomfortable and at bedtime even worse. Almost went to the hospital for heart check/tests.  The chest pressure worsened when reclined so it was very difficult to fall asleep.  It got too uncomfortable to lay down so I had to keep getting up to walk around to feel better during the night.  I couldn&#39;t fall asleep because as I was about to fall asleep the chest pressure would worsen and I&#39;d wake up as I was about to doze off.  I felt like I had a strong intense heartbeat, like it was working hard, and I could hear irregular beats.  I did get a little sleep finally. Next morning pressure still there but not as bad because I was up walking around more. Always worse whenever reclined or in bed laying down.  It was very uncomfortable at the end of exhaling big or at the end of a large inhale.  I did not feel comfortable exerting myself aerobically.  As the day progressed it got a little better.   On the 2nd night as I was about to fall asleep I would get a sharp radiating pain across my chest. This happened a few times with the first one being the worst.  Again I almost went to the hospital.  I finally was able to fall asleep.  Each subsequent day the pressure slightly improved.  By Monday I almost went to the hospital to get some tests done on my heart but as each day progressed it improved just a little bit.  I did not feel comfortable doing aerobics until about 2 weeks later and still took it easy.   Night  #3  I did not have any sharp painful zingers, and I was able to fall asleep better, but the chest pressure remained.   Each day it keeps improving but I  still have the pressure, still able to feel a stronger intense heartbeat, irregular beats at times  and uneasiness about overexerting myself.   At a month after vaccination, still have some slight chest pressure but minimal.

I was kept at the facility extra time (around 40 minutes in total) and left with a friend to return about an hour or so later to drive home.   I did not have any difficulty breathing but did have some rashy/redness on my chest but that is not unusual for me when I am having any kind of distress.  The other s/s were not typical for me.

She was advised to apply cool compress to injection site and rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol and to notify me if the pain did not resolve in 2-3 days.  I received a phone call from her today 2/16 with reports that her arm pain is still present making it hard to work and sleep.  She was advised to follow up with her PCP which she agreed to call her doctor tomorrow.

Kept up and got more pronounced throughout week and started feeling burning sensations in both arms through Feb 15th. Self referred to Neurology on Feb. 16th.  Feb 17th, began to feel worse, spreading to both legs feeling weak, burning sensation, fatigue, and began feeling VERY foggy brained.  Have been sleeping a lot, but legs and arms go from burning sensations, weakness, to cold sensations, and achy right leg thigh muscle, to this moment.  Brain fog and fatigue seem worst in morning.

                                                The patient had gone shopping in the store after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and then returned to the pharmacy after about 10 minutes saying she wasn&#39;t feeling well. She reported feeling hot, that her lips were tingling, and stating she just felt weird. I had her sit in the immunization booth so I could tend to her without and audience. I gave her 10 ml of Benadryl because she mentioned her lips were tingling. I broke one of the instant icepacks for her and had her place it on the back of her neck and put her head between her knees. She reported feeling that her face felt hot, so I broke two more icepacks and had her sit up right and place the ice packs on the front of her neck. I stayed with her in the booth and talked to her until she felt better. I set the timer on my phone for 15 minutes. After 10 minutes she said she was feeling better and wanted to move to the waiting area. She was fine after the full 15 minutes and left our store. I estimate she remained in the store for approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

Nine hours after I had muscle aches, joint pains, my skin was so sensitive it was hard to walk, sit lay down- it just hurt so bad.  All night it was sensitive, I had chills, nausea, I couldn&#39;t sleep. My arm became swollen, red and hot to touch.  This pretty much lasted for three days and I just tried to control it with Tylenol and Benadryl, it was so awful and painful. Those three days were the worst of my life .  I called my Dr. and told me just continue to do what I was doing.

                                                Severe pain and swelling of arm.  Unable to eat, stand up, had intense headache, ringing in ears and had some itching.  I was lethargic and slept most of 3 days.  Extremely exhausted for entire week.  Still recovering and tired even today 3/9.   I had to take my rescue inhaler and then took benydrl every  4 hours for a week.

                                                Symptoms:  Onset approximately 6 hours after injection of fever of 102 , severe body aches with joint pain, chills, loss of appetite, decline in cognitive abilities - brain fog.   These symptoms lasted for 72 hours.   Treatment:  I used Tylenol every 4 hours to try and alleviate the symptoms.  With treatment, the only improvement was a slight decrease in fever, but fever continued to be over 100.  The adverse events caused me to lose 2 days of work.

I slept for 36 hours straight and did not eat or drink during that time.   My issues are resolving on day five today I only have a slight amount of dizziness.  Thought it was odd it took so long to get the symptoms after the shot.  I had no ear issues and my blood pressure was normal.

                                                sore arm, started too get dizzy and unsteady about 5:00 pm on vaccination day. Thinking became off- brain fog. Tried to open house front door by clicking my car key unlock button a few times. Later when unloading the dishes that same night I couldn&#39;t remember where we store our pots. This is not typical at all. I woke up in the middle of the night with full body sweats but no fever or chills and a sore arm. My arm swelled up (not red at all) quite a bit that next day. Around 4 inches around the area of injection. I iced it a lot. About a week later, my arm started itching and got a small blotchy area or two. Nothing too bad. My lymph node under my armpit on same side as vax started to swell a lot. Around that same time I also got diarrhea for 2 days then it stopped abruptly. My arm still itches of and on and is sore.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of vaccination, I experienced shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and disorientation.  I remained under observation for one hour, at which point I was able to drive home.  The symptoms decreased but remained until late that night.  On Friday evening, January 15, I developed an ear infection in both ears, a large dark bruise approximately the size of my hand behind my left knee, and the worst HSV outbreak of my lifetime.  The bruise dissipated after approximately one week.  I have had recurrent HSV outbreaks almost continuously since that time.  I still have the ear infection.  I called my doctor twice to request antibiotics for my ears, but she thought the infection would clear up without them.  After 5.5 weeks I called a third time and cefdinir 300mg twice daily antibiotic was prescribed for 10 days.  The ear infection remained after completion of the antibiotic course.  I began a new course of the same medicine without a break in treatment and am now on day 15 of antibiotics.  the infection is improving but not gone.

She felt awful within an hour of vaccination and persisted with symptoms for 2.5 days.  She described it as being out of it, headache, fever, chills, profound body aches, weakness and dizziness with palpitations.  She could not get out of bed for a day.  She literally thought she was going to die given the severity of her weakness.  As quickly as the symptoms occurred, they left her on March 7th, 2021.  She went to work on March 8th and noted similar symptoms to prior ITP flares - petechiae on legs, gum bleeding, fatigue, mild headache.  She also noted dark urine but no frank blood.  Since being admitted and receiving steroids, she is feeling improved and petechiae are lessening.  She also noted mild mouth ulceration to lower lip along with oozing.

I missed the entire following week of work and am still experiencing severe body pain, fatigue and migraines.  doctors do nothing, just say I&#39;m a long hauler (had moderate-severe covid 19 in October, 2020) and there&#39;s nothing they can do.  I have experienced long covid symptoms since I had covid, but my health has deteriorated severely since having these 2 vaccines.

During the night I felt really dizzy. I got up during the night and I fainted. We called an ambulance my blood pressure was a little low. I went to my Primary care doctor the next morning. My brain was foggy, and I was a little confused. The doctor checked my blood pressure, and it did not change on standing. I saw my allergist and he is going to run tests to check for allergies to ingredients in the vaccine. I have not taken the second dose.

                                                I had stomach pain about 2 hours after the injection. I went to sleep at 10 pm and woke up at 2 am to go to the bathroom. My legs felt like I could barely move them but I was able to go the bathroom. Once I got up and walked toward the bathroom door I hit my head into the door. I ended up on the floor. I sat up and my husband came in. He said I was mumbling incoherently and then passed out for about 28 seconds. He said my arms were moving up and down while passed out. I woke up covered in sweat and he put me in bed. I slept until 8 am and then woke up with a headache, nausea, body aches and dizziness. The headache and dizziness lasted until 3/18/21.

My throat started to close and I couldn&#39;t  swallow. I tried to relax but I started to feel distressed. I was taken into the Emergency. I was given Benadryl Zofran and Hydrocortisone. I was prescribed Benadryl and an EpiPen and a Steroid in case it reoccurred. The medication seemed to work and I did not go into shock again. I have not had the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Three days after my first Moderna Covid shot in my left arm, I felt a pain/tenderness in my left armpit in the middle of the night.  The pain, swelling and tenderness worsened for 2 days until I was so uncomfortable I could hardly sleep even using ice packs and advil.  My armpit and breast glands  down my left side were enlarged and hot and tender to the touch. On day 6, I woke up with a 5 inch diameter raised bullseye type rash on my left arm. The itching and rash subsided after 2 days. However, I could not exercise or raise/use my left arm for 10 days from the onset of the symptoms.. Days 5 through 10 were very uncomfortable and I had to limit all activity and stay home to ice and rest my left side. On day 17, I resumed all normal activity including exercise.  Honestly, I still feel a slight tenderness and swelling in the left breast. I plan to get the 2nd shot in my right arm on April 2nd to give my left side a rest.

She was then transferred to Emergency Department. Per their report: The patient presents with a swollen discolored left lower leg.  She does have  discoloration and I am concerned for massive DVT and cerulea dolens.  She does  have really minimal pain to the leg except to the groin, she has intact pulses,  I have low suspicion for acute ischemia/arterial clot.  She does complain of  some mild dyspnea with exertion above baseline so I do have concerns for  possible PE.  She is hemodynamically stable, appears in no distress.  She is on  oral contraceptives, mild obesity, no other significant VTE risk factors.  I am  going to empirically start her on heparin, I have also ordered a CT PE and a CT  abdomen pelvis to check for proximal propagation of the DVT along with a left  lower extremity duplex Doppler ultrasound.    Duplex ultrasound also showed extensive left lower extremity DVT up to the  common femoral, she does have bilateral PEs without evidence of significant clot  burden or heart strain, she is hemodynamically stable with normal pulse  oximetry.  The patient also has clots proximal up to her IVC.  I discussed this  with Dr.  of vascular surgery for possible thrombolysis therapy of the  left lower extremity.  She was discussed with SOUND for admission.

                                                I began experiencing severe tinnitus about 9 days after my first Moderna vaccine dose. Very loud electronic hissing tone throughout my head. This has not subsided since March 22. It is ongoing, 24 hours a day. This produced distress, discomfort, and anxiety. I went to the ER at Hospital on March 22 due to the sudden tinnitus onset and the accompanying anxiety. They gave me referrals for an audiologist, PCP, and psychiatrist. At the hospital, they gave me Ativan.  The tinnitus is very uncomfortable, scary, loud, and disruptive. I&#39;ve had two separate audiologists test my hearing and examine my ears and both are fine. Nothing remarkable. I&#39;ve also had an MRI done with normal results. I&#39;ve been to my PCP, another doctor at the same clinic, and an ENT doctor. I also went to a psychiatric physician&#39;s assistant. No one seems to know the cause or what to do. I&#39;ve been prescribed 20 mg of fluoxetine daily, o.5 mg alprazolam as needed for distress. Also prescribed, 25 mg amitriptyline, and 50mg trazodone to help sleep. The trazodone had no effect so I stopped it. Also prescribed a 6-day course of methylprednisolone, but I had to stop on the third day because it kept me up for almost three days, so I stopped. I&#39;m also taking daily Zyrtec, Benadryl, generic multi-symptom allergy medication, 2000mg Vitamin C, B12, and two Chinese herbs. I&#39;ve also been seeing a chiropractor 3 x a week. I&#39;ve seen a craniosacral therapist once and will start acupuncture this Sat.

This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness) and SYNCOPE (single  syncopal episode) in a 51-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 013L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Concurrent medical conditions included COPD and Asthma. Concomitant products included FLUTICASONE FUROATE, VILANTEROL TRIFENATATE (BREO ELLIPTA) and FLUTICASONE for an unknown indication.    On 14-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 15-Jan-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness) (seriousness criterion medically significant), SYNCOPE (single  syncopal episode) (seriousness criterion medically significant), IMPAIRED WORK ABILITY (tried to get ready for work), INSOMNIA (did not sleep much that night), MYALGIA (pain/body aches), FATIGUE (Tired) and NAUSEA (Awoke nauseated ). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness), SYNCOPE (single  syncopal episode), IMPAIRED WORK ABILITY (tried to get ready for work), INSOMNIA (did not sleep much that night), MYALGIA (pain/body aches), FATIGUE (Tired) and NAUSEA (Awoke nauseated ) had resolved.

My chest felt heavy but I think that may have been slight anxiety because it was a scary feeling and I did not want to be the person who needed EMS assistance.  I rolled down my window, took off my mask and took deep breaths of fresh air.  I slowly started to feel better.  At 30 minutes I felt much better and after an hour I was back to my normal self.

Observation RN was walking cg to lower level when she experienced syncope and fell forward down several steps and to the right hitting the front of her head and right shoulder on the wall.  Cg was unconscious for approximately 30-45 seconds.  Once alert, cg responded appropriately to questions, but slowly.  Vitals were 120/82 P 107 at 0915 and 150/84 P 96 at 0920.  Cg had 2 events of uncontrollable bilateral arm shaking lasting approximately 5-10 seconds.  Rapid Response Code was called and cg taken to ED at 0940.  C-collar and back board was used to transfer cg from floor to stretcher. Unknown at this time if caregiver was admitted.

                                                On 1/5/2021- Pt. noticed left eye lid was starting to swell in the corner of her eye at 1 pm. It then became bigger and started to shut her eye. Her right eye then started to swell around 2 pm and she began to have difficulty talking and swallowing. She was not short of breath but felt like her throat was tightening. She arrived to work at 2:50 pm and informed her boss who sent her to the employee health department. She reported having oral Benadryl and  was going to take that. Anesthesiology evaluated her, felt it was a progressive allergic reaction, and recommended evaluation at an urgent care or ED. She later developed hives, her lower lip became swollen.  She was later evaluated at Emergency Department. She will be able to provide you with information on the doctor, treatment. She was prescribed a course of prednisone and will have allergy testing scheduled. MD indicated uncertain if caused by vaccine.   She missed work on 1/6 due to the ongoing reaction which had improved.

Temperature highs ranged from 100.8-101.4, and I felt as badly as when I had COVID-19 in March 2020. I was unable to go to work as scheduled on Friday 1/8 and Saturday 1/9. I am concerned about getting the 2ND DOSE as it has been stated that 2nd dose may create more severe symptoms than the first. PLEASE ADVISE. Also, is there a correlation between having had COVID-19 and having strong &#34;side effects&#34; to the vaccine? Please advise. Thank you!

Certain smells are terrible, some foods very off putting, unable to eat normal amounts of food without feeling like I am going to be sick.  Forgot to eat for 7 hours yesterday (NEVER in my history do I forget to eat).  I feel okay now but my stomach is not feeling normal and my eating habits are not normal yet.  So symptoms have been present from Tuesday to today, being Friday...they are improving but I am nervous about getting a second dose if more people generally have more severe responses with the second dose.  I forgot to list it earlier, I am not able to take calcium supplements. Anything over 50 mg of calcium on a regular basis makes me very sick and blood labs will like thst have been switched with someone else&#39;s.

                                                I had my first dose of the vaccine on Monday morning. I woke up Tuesday morning with a very sore arm, which I expected. I was also very tired with a bit of a headache. I teach school, and throughout the day I had very little energy and went to bed early that night. The next day (Wednesday) I felt the same, really wiped out, but also had some gastrointestinal issues and little appetite. Thursday I felt the same. Today is Friday, and I&#39;m still dragging a bit but my appetite is returning. I feel like I&#39;m getting back to normal.

Then lost awareness and surrounding noise sounded as if I were in a cave, echoes and non-discernable. Lost consciousness for several minutes.  Next recollection was regaining awareness, clothes soaked with sweat. Was lying on a bed with no recollection of being moved to the bed. Shakes and feeling of distress. Experienced shakes and a tingling sensation for approximately 15 minutes. Once that subsided I experienced chills for the better part of an hour. Would like to add, I have no phobias of injections and regularly have blood samples drawn for medical evolutions with my primary care physician.  Was counselled by administering physician to go home and skip work.

She was tachycardic and hypertensive but was severely anxious as she has a lot going on in life right now and has been anxious all day. EMT offered to drive her to the hospital but she refused and thinks it is due to anxiety. Employee was told if she still feels heart rate and blood pressure are high later today she should call primary care doctor or go to hospital. She left after about 45 mins of being evaluated feeling better but still anxious. Heart rate 119 and blood pressure 150/90.

Pain got less as each day went on and subsided a few days later. Sore throat a few days later in glands area but only lasted a day. Sciatic nerve flared up afterwards...still dealing with that and it&#39;s 2 weeks later but I have had issues with that before: still tired but not as tired, ears bothering me and some nasal congestion but not unusual for this time of year.

                                                this is a report of my personal experience I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine Wednesday January 20th at approximately 4:30pm Cox North. The injection was painful, the person administering the injection inserted the needle VERY slowly, and then pressed the plunger VERY slowly. However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt &#34;funny&#34; mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised &#34;bed rest and hydration&#34;) I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up. I was unable to remain upright, but could sit in a recliner at that time. I was unable to hold a bottle of water on my own until approximately 2pm. I had no headache, no fever, no nausea (after the initial 5am experience) but DID experience extreme muscle weakness until approximately 2pm Thursday January 21, 2021. (too weak to chew food) Friday January 22nd, I felt &#34;fine&#34;, but still mild tiredness. ( I was told by our office manager that I should fill out an RL to report my experience)

                                                Five in a half hours after vaccine ,vaccinated arm became more sore, soreness traveled up arm to fingers and spread to rest of arm and body as time passed.  Body aches progressed and became more intense, went to bed.  Was unable to sleep, had a left ear ache and neck ache that intensified as the night went on.  I was unable to move at all in bed, I was sweating and in SEVERE  pain I was finally was able to crawl out of bed at 5:30 and took some aspirin.  The aspirin only took the edge off for a few hours as I tried to sleep,the ear ache and the headache intensified.  If I would of had a pain killer I would have taken it, as I was in so much body ache pain.  Stayed in bed all day until the evening and continued to take aspirin every 4-6 hours, used a heating pad and pushed water.  Applied CBD ointment which helped quite a bit.  Every hour that passed in the evening the intense pain would subside a bit and by 8:30 pm I started to feel like I was feeling back to normal.  Day two rested and have body aches but am able to control the pain with aspirin.  Ear pain almost gone, left neck pain almost gone, right neck pain started and is controlled.  Sweating  with a low grade fever and fatigued.

                                                The first injection I received was from an empty syringe, the healthcare worker told me she didn?t notice it was empty until after she gave it to me and said she would need to inject me again, which she did immediately after noticing the empty syringe. I immediately felt a burning sensation going down my arm but did not have any immediate pain. Approx. 3 1/2 - 4 hrs later, my muscle where I received the injection began feeling very sore. After several days, I used a lidocaine patch on my arm which eased the pain so it was tolerable. However, today is the 11th day of my pain and I have not been able to sleep through the night for the past 3 nights due to excruciating pain that wakes me up and I am unable to raise my arm. The pain and my range of motion for my arm has progressively gotten worse by the day with today being close to unbearable.

                                                It started with a fever of 99.8 (norm is 97.4). I had brain fog. really slow thoughts. I felt like my brain was in slow motion. Big time fatigue. I felt like I was carrying a truck. I also noticed with my MS I am wobbly but I can catch myself but I felt like it was getting much worse. I called my Dr. and she thinks that the vaccine caused a flare-up in my MS. She gave me a prednisone pack. the last dose of prednisone I took, I was still fatigued. I began using a walker because I couldn&#39;t walk safely. I noticed as I tried to get out of my car a few days later I was thrown backwards which caused me to land on my glasses which cut my face and resulted in stitches. I did test but my MS was not in an active flare but they said it could be in a flare because of the COVID vaccine. they couldn&#39;t give me medication because that medication causes heart spasms. I was denied by my insurance to go to rehab. I cant walk and I am currently in the hospital.

                                                Had a sore arm the night of  the vaccine.  Woke up the next morning  feeling a little fatigued.  Body started hurting at around 11 am, like someone used me as a punching bag.  Left work early and took a nap, the body pain went away, but then developed a fever of 102.  Took some Tylenol. Continued with a fever of 102-100.1  overnight.  Fever broke around 10 am on Friday 2/5/21 and feel much better.

Body aches were painful in neck, shoulders, and left arm (felt like radiating nerve pain). Body aches significant through all of 2/5, unable to stay asleep due to aching and pain.  Fever of 99.6-100.2 from 10a on 2/5 through 9pm, then returned to normal. 2/6: fatigue remained along with continued pain in shoulders, neck, and both arms. Left arm was most painful from ear to finger tips after any exertion such as washing dishes. Tylenol helped slightly, but not completely. 2/7: fatigue gone, residual pain in shoulders and neck, exacerbated with exertion. 2/8: residual discomfort in shoulders/neck with exertion.

Then at 12:30am I woke to severe chills, slight headache, sweats as well, body aches all over my body and I took my temperature and it was 103.4.  I don&#39;t think I have ever had a fever that high before.  I took some Tylenol extra strength  and tried to go back to sleep but I couldn&#39;t I was afraid.  This went on for several hours and my temp ranged from 102.3-103.6.  I tried to drink liquids too.  I called off of work.  That day I laid around hot and cold, body aches, my chest hurt a little to take a deep breath, fatigue and weakness were unbearable at sometimes. My fever spikes probably that high 3-4 times yesterday.  I had fluids and soup.  I alternated Motrin and Tylenol all day.  I tried to rest and maybe sleep but just couldn&#39;t close my eyes despite being tired/weak.  By 7-8pm I was still weak but felt better  My temp was around 99-100.  I went to be around 10pm and woke up at 2am with really bad heartburn that I couldn&#39;t lay down I had to sit in my recliner chewing 4 Galvascon tabs. Sipping water and felt my chest hurt and wondered if I was having a heart issue. But i relaxed and finally by 5 am when my alarm went off.. I took my temp it was 100.2.  I called off work again today and I laid down to sleep a few more hours.   Now  I feel better and still weak  My temp has gone down.

Then about 7 minutes after I started having a weird tingly itchy feeling around my mouth and left check.  Shortly after that, I had a weird itchy, tingling sensation in my throat. One of the pharmacy gentlemen administering shots gave me Benadryl immediately when I shared it with them. I waited an additional 10 minutes after the initial 20 minutes. The itching around my neck lasted for about 2.5 hours. I was fine, but today (the next day) I&#39;ve been very itchy around my ears, eyes, neck, chest, and upper back. I did send an email message to my doctor about this as well.  I happened on this, as I was looking at the CDC site.

My voice changed like a horse - hoarse throat. And when I swallowed it was like a piece of food in my throat. At work, my left eye is swollen  and my lower lip was swollen too and they took me to patient room at work and examined me. Asked me to go home from work and my husband took me to ED  on January 5th- I had gotten hives - started feeling itchy all over my body. At Emergency room they gave me Prednisone to stop the swelling. My throat was swollen and they gave me blood tests, too. Prednisone helped some - took that for one week. (Still missed work on the sixth because my eyes were still swollen.) Had a previously scheduled doctor appt for something else and my doctor told me the hives will come back after Prednisone so he told me to take Claritin for two weeks. All my symptoms resolved after that.

                                                Moderna covid-19 vaccine eua. About 15 min after injection I felt hot (very unusual for me), then dizzy,  racing heart, weak then very nauseous.  I told the nurse.  He asked me to lay down.  I did not get worse.  After 20 min or so I sat up and did not feel worse.  Just stable nausea and dizzy.  I asked if I could leave.  After verifying I had people at home I was allowed to go.  I felt exhausted and nauseous for the rest of the day.  I was confused the next morning about what day it was and had some hives at injection site.  I felt normal after figuring out what day it was.  I walked 8 miles and aside from the hives at the injection site was normal.  One week later I had headache, exhaustion and had an uncomfortable rash at the site.  The rash is still on my arm.    Should I get the second dose?

Rash went away.  SOB lasted off and on for several days. Heart rate was off when I was working out for a couple of weeks.  I work out  so we wear heart rate monitors.  Heart rate did not recover as quickly as normal during my workouts. Took a couple of weeks for this to get back to normal for me.  Just really felt &#34;off&#34; for awhile and not like myself.  Did not feel comfortable getting second shot because of the above symptoms.

I had also dry heaved 2 more times. Upon arriving at home I got into bed and slept until 8:30-8:50 AM the next morning which was Saturday.  Saturday I was able to eat crackers and soda without issue.  I was just extremely tired. No more chills, mild muscle aches and a slight headache still.  Slept a full 9 hours and was fine on Sunday.

                                                Felt fatigue early on, went to bed at 9:00.  Woke up at 11:30 pm with uncontrollable nausea, headache and chills.  Started vomiting at midnight, kept going until 4:30 am coupled with GI distress.  Fever ranged from 101- 103, headache, brainfog and all over body ached lasted throughout the following day and night.  Fever broke at 11PM the next night (29th).  Then took some tylenol for body aches (was scared to take earlier due to nausea) and slept through the night.  Woke up this morning and noticed the injection site is still red and very swollen (looks like i was hit by a baseball) and I have a rash all over the tops of my feet and shins?  Looks like a series of tiny red dots.

The next morning I had a headache and my blood pressure remained elevated all day. I felt dizzy.  For the following 6 days, my heart would randomly race and I felt odd- just not myself. Blood pressure did go back to normal on 2/26/21.

When I got home and 24:30 am I took a shower, then I got freezing, chilly and body shaking, also I went to bathroom may time. The whole morning I felt so tired, then I went down to kitchen to  have breakfast, but I reacted with my food smell. Then I went back to my room because I couldn?t eat. During I went back to my room, I fainted at the stair. I hit my head against the wall. I did not realized I fainted after the fact. Sometime it is tough to breath and body aches. On day 2, I had headache and could not work. From then the vaccination until now (March 6th)  my heads feel heavy.

                                                Experienced Migraine type headache that lasted for 2 days and left arm was very sore at the injection site on both injections. Experienced mild diarrhea after an hour as well.  The 2nd vaccine I became very tired after a few hours and started getting body aches.  I laid down and slept for a couple of hours but still had the migraine.  I got dizzy several times in the early evening.  That night I experienced mild fever and chills and woke up to several hot flashes and the bed soaked with sweat. I felt like this for 2 days. I took Tylenol for the headache and body ache and basically just slept.                                                                                                                                                             An ongoing side effect that has become very annoying is the hot flashes.  I had a full hysterectomy and oophorectomy  in 2012 and for approximately 6 months afterwards I experienced hot flashes which were mild but became predictable to the point that I only had a hot flash if I drank Orange Juice, and only 1 hot flash-This has been this way since 2012 . Since I have had the vaccine, I am experiencing hot flashes a minimum of 5-10 times a day.  Very random and no longer predictable.  I get extremely sweaty to the point I have to fan myself. They are just like the first night after getting the 2nd dose as far as feeling like I have a fever and becoming drenched in sweat.   I firmly believe this is due to the vaccine as I have not experienced anything like it prior.  It has been a nagging side effect that has continued since I received the 2nd dose.

                                                I developed tachycardia with over 130 bpm and increased anxiety and restlessness. My husband took me to the doctor office. They performed an EKG and blood tests. Everything came out normal. Doctor said it could have been an allergic reaction to the vaccine or its components. Recommended to keep taking my anxiety medication and report it to my primary care physician. The tachycardia lasted for 18 hours. It was a scary situation I don&#39;t want to go thru again. I&#39;m not taking the second shot!

                                                My vaccine was given Feb 24th and everything was great until 5:00pm March 5th.  I started to not feel well. Very cold, body aches,, bad headache and my glands hurt.  At 7:00 I headed to bed and noticed a large welt on my arm were I received the shot 11 days ago. In the morning my glands really hurt and I still felt really bad and went to an Urgent care.  They said it was a side effect from the shot.  Take aspirin and Benadryl.  The drew blood.  My WBC was 3.1, LYM% .6, RBC 3.93, Hemoglobin 12.1, Hematocrit 38.2, MCV 97.1 MCH 30.8 RDW 12.3, Platelets 170. Temperture 97.6.  Later that day I felt a little better, but developed a second welt on my arm about 3 inch below the 1st.  That night work up at 4:00am drenched in sweat.  Changed PJ and sheets and actually felt better.  In morning 2nd welt was larger.

It started just a few hours after my vaccine and it stayed that way for 48 hrs. I would still experience this mild sensation every now and then until I took my 2nd vaccine. My injection site was very sore for 2 days. No other symptoms to report..  2nd Vaccine - I experienced a very sore injection site for 2 days and felt warm to the touch. Later in the evening i had mild achy sensations in my lower back, legs, calves, knees and shoulders. During the night I experienced chills and lots of tossing and turning. In the morning my lower back, shoulders, legs, knees and calves were extremely achy and sore. I was also very exhausted. I took some ibuprofen and drank lots of water and rested. Today, 10 March my lower back and thighs are still a little achy but much better than yesterday.

By 5:30 am, I decided to take an Aleve to try and bring down the fever.  I also had 1 puff of my inhaler to try and calm the cough with no luck.  I was finally able to sleep for about an hour with my head on an ice bag.  It?s now 9am and my fever is returning and so is my headache.  My whole body is sore from shivering with the fever and my injection site is sore with a hard lump under the skin.

Mild chest pain, but didn&#39;t know if that was me getting nervous. Felt like heart was racing a bit too. I also felt dizzy. Told pharmacist, and asked if I could take Benadryl. I took 25mg Benadryl around 3pm and waited an extra hour in the waiting area. Continued with dizziness, tongue tingling and warmth until about 3:45pm when I left the facility. Took Tylenol once I got home around 4pm. Symptoms resolved by 5pm.

A short time later my left side of my back near the shoulder blade area and the back of my neck were feeling  wierd . A few minutes later my left side of my face was slightly numb staying that way until around 10:15 or so. Debated medical attention but decided to wait and see if it would get worse or come out of it.  Didnt seek medical  attention but felt it would be best to report. Will be contacting PCP for advice as to whether or not to receive the second dose.

                                                1 day after receiving the 2nd Moderna shot I began to experience severe nausea &amp; vomiting precipitated by intense vertigo. The vertigo was so severe that I had visual disturbances, severe headaches, loss of balance, poor concentration including memory problems, and ringing in the ears that precluded these attacks. These events occurred 1-2 times a day. It has devastated my life.  These episodes take 1-3 hours to overcome and their is no specific time of day they happen. I had to be hospitalized for 2 days exactly 1 week post vaccination. The healthcare providers can not agree that these events are directly caused by this vaccine. I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s central nervous inflammation caused by my immune system over reacting from the vaccine. I have no history of vertigo or really migraine headaches. The neurologists say these symptoms are vestibular migraines or vestibular vertigo (positional).  It&#39;s now almost 3 months and I&#39;m still struggling with these symptoms but thankfully not as severe and debilitating.  Shot 1/27/21, first day of symptoms 1/28 and hospitalized 2/3 to 2/5.

I never had an issue before.  Pain in neck is on left side the same side as shot.  Can sleep on that side.  Pain is unbearable if I try sleeping on right side.  Took a steroid for 5 days.  Pain immediately went away and then return  day 5 of steroid.   Still have pain on day 24 since shot.

Had not had a period in over 8 months.  Hot flashes had subsided.  One month later having EXTREMELY bad period, with excessive bleeding. Could not even go to work. I truly believe it came from vaccine.  Figure I should report so there may be data. The second dose caused severe fatigue for 5 full days, my concentration was foggy.

After that, the pain had become so intense that I could not move my arm without assistance.  I went to bed around 10:00 pm with a headache and slight nausea. I woke up three times during the night with extreme pain in my shoulder, arm, and hand.  At 9;00 am, the pain is not as intense, but I am still unable to move my arm up or down without assistance. The headache and nausea are gone.

                                                Day 1: The evening of shot, my entire body began to feel achy, and my arm was so sore that I couldn?t sleep.  Day 2:  body very achy. Theraflu helped with aches. Lymph node under arm swelled up to the size of a 1/2 grapefruit and was so painful that I took hydrocodone for one day to deal with it. It was throbbing and occasionally shooting pain around armpit area. I couldn?t let my arm touch it. I was a bit sweaty and hot and slept most of the day.   Day 3: I noticed small bruises under my armpit. The area was still very sore but bearable. I couldn?t use that arm at all. I also got a rash in my back  on the right side that was extremely itchy for a minute and then was just red. It faded somewhat quickly. I called my dr because I was concerned about reactions. He told me to come in Monday for blood tests because my reactions were concerning. Later that night when I got undressed for bed, I saw that I now had 7 bruises all on my right side all around armpit area. Tired.   Day 4: feeling pretty normal. Arm is still very sore, but I can use it. I can?t lift my arm without discomfort. Only new bruise is a BIG one on my arm. I finally figured out it was from taking off my shirt!  Day 5 etc = feeling better and better except for occasional vertigo in morning and dizziness throughout the day.

I told her I was feeling a little foggy. She gave me a bottle of water and kept checking on me every few mins. At around 935 she took me into the back with the medics to get my vitals. They hooked me up to their defib machine for my vitals. My BP was 190/111. They did it manually and it was 180/110. I was starting a headache. By the time I left my BP was 165/99.

                                                Resident had the COVID vaccine 12/30/2020. 12/31/20,  resident has been in bed all shift. Staff became concerned when resident was not easily aroused. Resident displayed signs of tremors, twitching, confusion, in and out of consciousness, low O2 sats, elevated pulse and fever, fatigue and weakness. Writer called NP. NP stated this is most likely a reaction d/t the COVID vaccine. She gave orders for Benadryl 25mg IM x1 now and Tylenol 1000 mg now. NP also stated resident will not be getting the second dose of vaccine. Will continue to monitor and update NP if worsening symptoms.   After receiving Benadryl and Tylenol at 145pm, resident began to appear as though she was feeling better and was talking to talk, fever had gone down. Tonight resident is not easily aroused, lethargic, continues to have tremors and twitches, almost appearing as convulsions. When asked if she knows where she is or what day it is, resident can properly answer. Resident denies SOB but staff has noted loud squeals while breathing. NP was updated and gave new orders to give Benadryl 25 mg IM x1 if needed and Ok to send resident to ED. Resident currently refuses to go to the hospital. Will continue to monitor. BP 152/112, P 116, T 99.1, O2 87-91. Resident&#39;s O2 at 1205am was 80% on 3LPM. Resident unable to be aroused from sleep by writer. NAR called to assist. NAR could not arouse resident. Writer and NAR attempted to reposition resident and resident&#39;s breathing became more labored. Resident turned back to previous position and writer called on call MD at approx. 1220am. MD returned call approx. 1235am with orders to send resident to ED. 911 called and ambulance arrived about 1245am. History of present condition given to EMTs and they stated resident would be going to Hospital. Writer has attempted to contact Hospital ED x3 but have been unable to get through. An EMT did just call to clarify when vaccine was given, what symptoms have been present and when they started. She said she has everything she should need and she will let Hospital ED staff know to call if they need anything else. Writer will again attempt to contact them though.  Resident&#39;s temp was 97.5 and BG 128. When EMTs arrived they got an O2 reading of 60%. Resident did open her eyes a couple times during transfer from bed to stretcher and while stretcher was going outside but no responses from resident were made.

All mild and expected as possible side effects.  No concerns.  Symptoms continued and by 1/5; all symptoms had move to severe level and are still occurring today 1/8.  Temperature spikes to 102.8; chills, severe headache especially in eye sockets, body aches, and heaviness in chest.  Could not work on 1/7 and only for a bit on 1/8 (working from home).  Became concerned and was flu and covid tested on 1/7;  both negative.  I was retested for Covid on 1/8 and still negative.  I am not sure if maybe I am sick with something else and this is coincidence or if I am just experiencing issues from the vaccine that are a little different from others?

By this day I recall having some unusual Noc . calf cramping.   Sx certainly improved after 72 hrs but some did continue up to 7 days.   Cramping returned as did odd R ear/jaw/throat nerve pain.  Scratchy throat.  Fatigue persisted, gradually improved.  I believe the non-standard SEs may represent an allergic reaction.  I deem this mild to moderate, as I was unable to perform daily functions at times.  I would like to be able to talk to a professional as to whether a second dose is recommended in my situation.  I am concerned to know if previous allergic reactions suggest increase likelihood of future and possibly worsened reactions.  Note: I have been unable to access my Vsafe reports today to confirm exact time frame.  The above is to best of my recollection.

                                                No pain with injection.  Left shoulder pain began around 4 pm the same day, unable to raise left upper extremity against gravity without severe shoulder pain.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol immediately after injection and 600 mg of Advil at 9 pm as well as used Ice to decrease swelling and pain.  The pain increased and I was unable to sleep at all secondary to pain.  The shoulder pain has continued and loss of active shoulder range is apparent.  I am stretching and taking NSAIDS as able for the pain.  I have been unable to sleep well since receiving the vaccine secondary to the pain.   Today is day 7 and I am slowly getting back some active range however I continue to increased shoulder and peri scapular pain that limits my ability at home and at work.

                                                within 30 seconds I had a cooling sensation rush across the tip of my tongue, then a sweet taste, then more identifiable as bubble gum flavored.  By 12:45 I noticed I was scratching several areas of my body. Arms, legs, chest, neck, back and scalp and kept clearing my throat.  I looked down at my arm and seen a red welt from my elbow to my wrist in my left arm and a fine red rash beneath skin on right arm.  I looked up at the pharmacist and he said at 12:40 he had already placed a call to have another pharmacist come to look me over.   I then noticed that my heart seemed to be racing and feeling winded.  I figured this was my anxiety and just tried to relax.  The second pharmacist arrived and we walked to the ER.  I was very winded. They took me to a room and checked stats.  after 3 attempts taking my BP and using two different cuffs, she said my BP was 190/90 where it is typically 120/70. I drank lots of water and they monitored me for almost an hour and gave me another Benadryl.  My BP came down to 180/82 , breathing was easier and itching was decreasing so I chose to return to my station and I took one more Benadryl.  The following day: woke up with head ache in rt eye and fuzzy vision all day, mild sore throat, mild body aches, queasy stomach, fatigue and runny nose.  Took a Pepcid for stomach, Tylenol/Advil duo for sore throat, headache/body aches, drank lots of water and rested.  Following day most symptoms resided, still  slight sore throat, rt eye blurred vision, coughing, sneezing and runny nose.  everyday since, symptoms continue to decrease.

The 6th day I felt better with energy, then that evening came the headache and by the following morning (7th day) felt fatigued with chills. The head ache woke me up from sleep at 1 am that night and 3:45am the following night. By the Friday 1/15/21 I still had chills, broke out in a sweat walking throughout house, still tired but not as bad and the headache is gone. I felt so bad onvthe 14th I went and saw a Doctor who suggested I was having a severe reaction to the vaccin. He said my vitals were good, performed a covid test to rule out the possibility (turned out negative) and told me to rest. He also warned the 2nd dose could be worse reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA received on Saturday.  Sunday morning in the middle of my sleep, I woke feeling hot and sweaty, slightly nauseated, and like I had to defecate.  I stood up, felt like low blood pressure but wanted to get to the bathroom.  I walked towards the door, opened the door and fainted, falling backwards.  My spouse  states I was pale,staring at the ceiling and kind of stiff in my arms and legs for about 3 minutes.  He spoke to me, checked my pulse, covered me, poked my feet. As I came back to awareness I tried to speak and was unintelligible but then became more conscious.  He tested me with questions to make sure I was ok.  I defecated after that but did not vomit.  I was tired the rest of the day and napped for several hours.  I don&#39;t seem to have hurt anything in the fall.  I am instructed to be off work Monday by my supervisor.

The following day around 3 pm I began to have chills and felt like I had the raid heart rate again.  By 5 pm I was beginning to feel really bad, I was freezing, chills and my heart rate was now extremely fast, I was having trouble speaking complete sentences, my husband drove me to the emergency department.  I had a very high heart rate and high fever, I was admitted and in the hospital until Sunday afternoon. The diagnosis was pneumonia,  I don&#39;t really believe this, as I felt fine and had  no symptoms prior to the onset of the fever.

Muscle and bone aches through my spine and hips, nausea with some vomiting, chills, severe weakness, no recordable fever but felt feverish, skin hurt. Woke up Tuesday drenched in sweat but the bone pain had subsided. Still very weak, nauseous, continued in bed. Woke up today feeling on fire, eyes burning hot, skin no longer hurt but felt hot.  Injection site hurt through Sunday-no redness, no rash or swelling.  I took Tylenol and Advil throughout.  My previous trunk rash completely disappeared. I began taking the prednisone last night. 50mg BID. I have a 5 day supply.  Took a Covid test on Monday-results pending.  Tried to see my doctor today giving them the above information-there were no appts til Friday and I was referred to the ED.  I will not go to the ED where I could actually catch Covid. I was unable to get past phone triage with the doctors office.

I had not felt this since surgery 5 years ago. (Lasted about 15 minutes). 1/13/21 went to work, a little extra tired, went to bed early. Woke up in the night with severe pain in hands, had hard time sleeping. I called off work and slept most of the day 1/14/21. When I woke up 1/15/21 I could not put my full weight on my left leg without pain running from behind my knee up my outer thigh. I called my Dr and took Tylenol and worked a mostly sedentary job.

I tried taking an Amovig shot on 1/21/21, it did not work.  I tried taking motrin, tylenol, and etc... nothing is working... The pain is horrible. I&#39;m having problems concentrating.  This has been 5 days and is still extremely painful... the doctors will not do anything more about it.  I called Moderna and they could suggest nothing either.  I don&#39;t know how long this will last, but I&#39;m miserable!

                                                I started becoming hoarse about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. I left after 30 minutes and while I was driving home about 5 minutes later I became short of breath and took benedryl 25 mg which I had on the seat next to me in the car.  By the time I got in the house, approximately 40 minutes after receiving vaccine dizziness and palpitations started.  I checked my heart rate on O2 sat, 99% on room air, and HR low 100s. I did complete appointments with patients that afternoon but had trouble thinking,  was dizzy, and hoarse. the benedryl helped the SOB. I told the clinic manager the next time I received the 2nd dose of the vaccine I would need to take off from work due to the reaction. I was off 4 four days after receiving the vaccine and had fatigue, nausea, chills, and SOB. During the 4 days off I doubled my corticosteroid dose from 2 puffs daily to BID due to needing to use albuterol rescue inhaler every 4 hours and took benedryl as needed. I am still having trouble breathing and needing to use breakthrough rescue inhaler and benedryl along with cetirizine that I take daily which is why I reached out to Moderna today and scheduled an appointment with allergy/immunology to assess safety of receiving 2nd dose of vaccine.

Patient was immediately given ice packs and applied to groin, neck, and head. Patient did not feel any relief. 50 mg of diphenhydramine was given to patient to help with intense itch. Patient was feeling better and rested for some time in observation room. At 1740, patient had difficulties standing on her own. At 1745, patient voided in her clothes at her own request. Due to medical evaluation needed, EMS was called at 1800 and arrived at 18:08. EMS had to move her from the cot to the stretcher as patient couldn&#39;t stand on her own.

The chills passed quickly, but I still feel tired, run down, and out of it (10 days later). On Thursday the 21st, I had a severe headache. The worst one I have ever experienced. I wasn&#39;t able to work and it took a few days to recover. Today, 01/27/21, I woke up with a rash at the injection site. It is warm to the touch and feels mildly irritated, but as far as I can tell, has not spread. Because I haven&#39;t felt well in 10 days, I am not sure I feel comfortable getting the second injection. I am having difficulty concentrating and sleeping. I don&#39;t feel like my usual self.

Diarrhea within a few hours of arriving home. Felt fine otherwise for the rest of that day. Woke up on 1/25 with very achy back, and severe fatigue. As the day went on, I felt increasingly worse, exhaustion and increasing  body aches.  Low fever, 99.9.  Took one more  Tylenol at 7am, and 400mg Advil at 1pm. Increasingly felt general malaise. Stayed in bed. headache, fever continued,  by nightfall, the temp was 101 with drugs on board. The aches turned into joint type pain in my low back, hips and knees.  Fever broke at 10pm with sweating. Went to bed and woke up without the aches, just fatigue which has lasted until 1/27/21.  Finally feel more well today, 1/28/21. No aches, no headache, just sore arm and slight fatigue.

The body aches, headache and the chills ( I woke up with a fever 101.3F and about an hour ago it was 100.8F)  are more severe than with the first dose.  I also have joint pains that I did not have with the first dose (my lower back and hips and my right elbow are the worse). My injection site is also swollen and it was not with the first dose.

                                                Office visit 1/26: The employee is having right-sided back pain radiating down to her knee since 1/19/2021. She relates this pain to a vaccine for Covid which she received on 1/12/2021.  She has a history of right-sided shoulder tendinitis after flu vaccine and so she refuses to get the vaccine in her deltoid muscle and usually gets vaccines in her right gluteal area.  She had the vaccine for Covid on 1/12/2021 in the right hip area a little bit higher than where she normally gets it.  She developed some redness to the injection site which subsided but soon afterwards began having right-sided sacral pain and then right-sided knee pain. The pain is described as a ache and burning.  She does not have numbness and tingling down her leg.  And she does not have any limitation in terms of flexion or extension of her back but she finds that she cannot lie on her back at night because it hurts.  She also has trouble getting out of a chair because of right knee pain. She was seen by the orthopedist,  he has ordered an EMG which came out negative, and ordered to take Naprosyn twice a day. Dx: Lumbosacral radiculopathy at L3. F/U on 1/28: At this time she still having some dull right-sided back pain and pain to her knee but it is tolerable. She has been able to rest over the course of this week as she has not gone to work. She feels at this time that she can manage her pain and is able to start working this weekend on 1/30/2021. We expect that the pain will gradually subside as the effect of the injection subsides as well.

                                                right arm was starting to hurt more at bedtime (10pm). I slept restlessly and at 3pm woke up with severe upper right arm pain and could not raise my arm. tried icing arm, eventually was able to go back to sleep. when I woke up around 8 am, my arm still hurt badly and I could not fully use it. I had to have my husband wash my hair and comb it and help me get dressed (this is not normal). I took some aleve and within a few hours I could move it some and the pain was less but I still could not do normal daily activities with it without pain and still could not raise my arm above shoulder height. I also was quite tired and took a nap mid afternoon (also not normal). My arm was still sore when I went to bed that night but not as bad. When I woke up the next morning, it was sore but I could do all of my normal activities on my own with minimal discomfort. I still feel like I have limited ROM and weakness in my right arm. I had my son help me with dinner because I could not lift a heavy skillet or roll out some dough.  I had normal amounts of fatigue today.

                                                I have sarcoidosis and the vaccine has kicked me into a bad flare-up.  I have a large granuloma growing under the skin on my right arm near the wrist.  I started noticing it last week because my skin is very tight around it.  I did not have this before.  I have, however, had a granuloma removed from that wrist about 10 years ago.  This is above where that was though, not the same spot.  The granuloma is hot to the touch.  I have felt horrible since I got the shot and I am  extremely fatigued.   I  have had to miss work because I slept past the alarms.   My body hurts all over still.  I&#39;m most concerned about the immune response and the thing growing on my arm.

The next morning I was still feeling the same chills and ached and had cold symptoms as well.  Around noon I started to have a temp that went to 102.5. The aches in my body were horrible, my legs being the worst. I slept on and off from 6 pm on, my O2 levels were 89-90 and my pulse was high.  I woke up this morning at 6 am in a pool of sweat, my fever broke and I am feeling better. My aches are going away as well. I am tired, still feel a little weak and my chest feels a little heavy.

                                                Within 30 minutes I noticed my neck felt funny.  By the time I got home my face was tingly and my tongue was numb.   I did not even think about it being a reaction to the shot.  I took some Benadryl and a beta blocker because my heart was racing.   I laid down and about an hour later it was better.   I checked with my pcp dr.  She recommended that I take Benadryl before the next dose and ordered an epipen.   I have had anaphalxis previously due to a mango allergy.   I took the Benadryl before and was very nervous.  Eskenazi was amazing.  They assigned me a special watch person and kept me for 30 min.  I felt a little funny.... tingly face and my tongue was not normal.  When I got home I took a second Benadryl and a nap and then felt fine.

                                                Modern a COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 11pm started getting sore arm and headache 12am terrible chills: uncontrollable shaking, teeth chattering. 12:30am took temperature: 100.3 Throughout the night terrible chills, cannot get warm.  Muscle and joint aches that keep waking me up - generally feeling terrible. Highest temperature was about 3 or 4 am of 100.9, then slowly subsided.   Alternating between taking ibuprofen and tylenol ever 3-4 hours. Not much help, but a little.  Had to call off of work.  11:30am took hot bath and that helps the achiness.  Temperature still 99.2

I felt fine the rest of the day but my arm was sore and I wasn&#39;t able to sleep on my right side as a result of getting the vaccine in my right deltoid.  It felt like my right arm was attacked by hammers because it was so sore.The next day (2/19/21) I had muscle soreness, chills, and felt tired and &#34;out of it&#34;. I took an ibuprofen (400 mg)  at 1:30 pm on 1/19/21 and felt immediately better. My arm where I got the injection was still sore and I noticed when I changed my hosptial scrubs my arm was red and swollen at 3 pm  and had a rash. I took a50 mg  benadryl at 5 pm and woke up and my lips were swollen. I could feel the tip of my tongue feel like my lips &#34;like they were going to sleep&#34; and tingly. I went to the ER.

                                                Within 6 hours of vaccination, intense pain in the right arm - could not lift it overhead without pain.  This continued - and got worse on Friday morning.  The Friday morning event is what I am reporting.  I got up to shower; put shampoo in my hair and then conditioner. My right arm was hurting so badly that I was having trouble rinsing my hair. Then I felt faint and nauseous. Got out of the shower and fell onto the bed in the bedroom. Woke my husband to tell him that I was feeling badly - faint and the whole room was spinning. Then I felt my airway closing. He went down to get my levalbuterol (rescue inhaler); took one puff and that opened my airways.  I was still weak and he had to help me get dressed.  (BTW- I&#39;m a competitive athlete/ swimmer.)  I held onto him going downstairs.  I was not hungry though did eat a bit.  I spent the day on the couch with the chills and the room spinning until early afternoon.  By Saturday I was starting to feel better.  The pain in my arm mostly subsided by Sunday and I went to swim practice.  It wiped me out for the entire day and I spent the rest of Sunday on the couch. It&#39;s now Monday morning. I am feeling a bit off but better.  I am concerned about getting the second shot.

All my muscles were trembling/twitching, this started 7-8 hours after the vaccine and lasted several hours even after taking Tylenol and Advil.  chills that lasted 3 days, no fever, joint pain that lasted 3 days. Shortness of breath after taking showers, this would last a few hours after and require me to use my rescue inhaler. This would be abnormal for me as I don&#39;t normally become short of breath during or after taking a shower.   Arm pain with 2 in x 2 inch swelling just above the injection site.  9 days out and I still have a red , raised  bump at the site of the vaccination. At day 9 post injection, I am still very tired and take several naps everyday. I have not been to work in a week. I normally work 10 hour days with no problems of fatigue. Of note, I did not have any reaction other than mild arm pain at the injection site with the first vaccine that I got on 1/20/2021.

                                                Approximately 60 hours after my second injection I was awoken from my sleep with the most intense, excruciating pain in my right arm (arm where the vaccine was injected), It felt like every muscle was being torn off. I had been laying on my back at the time and the pain did not go away by repositioning my arm. The pain would eventually radiate all the way down to my right hand and my ring and pinky fingers experienced numbness as did my right hand which also felt colder than my left hand. The pain also ran up to my shoulder around to my scapula, under my arm and up my neck. The pain still exists today 18 days post vaccine. I have been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol around the clock to alleviate the pain. I also was given a steroid dose pack by my neurologist. Sometimes the pain subsides but it always comes back. Sometimes I still feel like I have been punched in the arm where the injection occurred and other times it is my scapula that is so tender I cannot lay on my back. I have to sleep on my back at night and if I try to roll over on my left side, the side where I was not injected, my right arm feels tingly.

Slept more than usual. Symptoms began midday on Thursday. Fever and body aches were resolved by Friday late morning. Slight headache and tiredness on Friday.

                                                The morning after I received the vaccine my lower back starting aching and then progressively throughout the day, my body started to ache. At the same time, my left arm that received the injection was sore and getting more difficult to use as the day progressed. By late afternoon/early evening, I started a low grade temperature from 99.3 - 100.1 all evening. The low-grade fever continued throughout the night and into the early morning hours with very little sleep. I took 2 extra-strength Tylenol at 3 different times from 12pm on 3/5 to 6am on 3/6. It didn&#39;t really seem to give me  much relief or reduce the fever/pain. I went back to sleep at 7am for 2 hours and when I woke up at 9am, I felt so much better. No fever. I took a shower and felt even better and the fever was gone. Aches and pains were gone, but I still have the soreness in the arm and it is lessening every day. It was almost like a delayed reaction but it was a 24 hour reaction definitely.

                                                I felt very lightheaded starting around 10 am Monday morning. Perhaps also some nausea but I did not vomit.  I had very slight pain at the injection site. I was not able to concentrate on my work for about 4 hours and felt unstable walking.  So I just rested.   I felt better later in the day, and was completely normal the next day.  I took more Aleve after I was already feeling better from the lightheaded feelings as I was continuing to experience cramping from my menstruation beginning early Monday (woke up a 4 am from pain and took Aleve then).  I have not experienced lightheaded feelings or inability to concentrate or unstable walking when I have had cramping or taken Aleve in the past.

Felt like a sting going up my arm, over my shoulder into my back.  Felt a little dizzy but it went away with sitting for 15 min.  When I got home I then realized my heart was fluttering but it went away within an hour.  6pm got chills and very tired.  Didn&#39;t sleep much and took tylenol in am to help with pain in arm, headache, burning eyes, chills and nausea.  I was still very tired and stayed in bed all day Sunday.  Today, I feel better with taking Tylenol but still nausea and headache and a little dizzy.   I now have a rash on my arm near injection site.

                                                Got the shot around noon on Friday, At midnight that same day. woken up out of a sound sleep with very loud ringing in right ear (thought my fire alarm was going off).  By that morning it was not as loud but still always present high pitched ringing that sometimes pulses and an ear ache.  Went to CVS minute clinic on Monday. Said inner ear was inflamed and had some fluid. Prescribed  amoxicillin. No change yet except ringing has also given me a headache.

Started yesterday morning, more a bother at night than during the day hours. Slight change of smell sensitivity.  Sensation of tight chest, shortness of breath last night during the itchy scratchy episode, only of short duration. Had not reoccurred.  Insomnia last two nights, maybe unrelated, maybe just due to the itches.   Additionally: the injection site was hot and rather painful, for three days only, right after the injection.

                                                My left shoulder was moderately sore for about 3 days after the injection.  The soreness didn&#39;t interfere with activities but did interfere with  my sleep.  Other than that I had no immediate reaction.  However, early on day 7 (01/11), I developed itching at the injection site and as the day progressed I developed redness, irritation, hotness, and continued itching.  It began as a small area about the circumference of a golf ball and spread, over the course of the day, to about the size of a grapefruit.  The symptoms lasted about 2 days (01/11-12).  By the evening of day 9 (01/13), hives began to appear, mostly on my arms and legs, with minimal bumps also on my torso and neck.  I&#39;m submitting this report on the evening of day 10 and the hives are still present.  The hives itch and are easily irritated.

That night I had severe left arm soreness to the point where I needed a narcotic, I had some at home. The pain woke me up. The next day I was more tired and had a stomach ache and more fatigue, left arm sore took Tylenol, fluids and did not call my doctor. Went to bed with a narcotic. Sunday into Monday 1/9 -1/10 I had severe diarrhea and could not eat, sore throat, muscle aches, decreased left arm soreness.  Full relief by Thursday.

I visited my PCP the next afternoon, on Tuesday, January 12th. He said it was not a systemic reaction but a localized reaction to the vaccine and prescribed a 5-day Medrol pack and Hydroxyzine. I was also experiencing episodes of anxiety beginning 2 days following my injection, on Wednesday, January 6 th. The redness is subsiding at this time - approximately 50% improvement; some itchiness persists if I don&#39;t take the hydroxyzine regularly (I don&#39;t because I have to work and it makes me very sleepy). Anxiety is improved, as well.

I could not ambulate without looking down at the ground. This grew worse over the next few days. I was seen by a Neurologist on January 12, 2021 who based on my neurological exam ordered me an MRI of the brain with gadolinium. Dizziness persisted and I could not work for three days that week . After a two week period,  it became more intermittent in nature.

                                                I got my vaccine at 4:00 p.m. About 10 hours (2:00 a.m.) after the vaccine I started getting aching back pain and bilateral shoulder pain.  About 12 hours after the vaccine I spiked a fever and felt like I was hallucinating.  I was unable to check my temperature until 10:30 a.m. the next morning and it was 102.4.  I had a fever, body aches, and headache the entire following day. My fever broke to 99.0 around 6:00 p.m.  I also had severe pain at the injection site that started several hours after my injection and continued to get worse.  The pain was so bad it was too painful to move my arm.  Today is day two post-vaccine, I have no fever but feel very weak and lethargic.

Then I felt really bad everything hurt. Around 10pm I had 100.7 fever and my head was still pounding.  I took Advil for my head but it did nothing at all. I could not sleep at all. Then around 3:30 Am I finely fell asleep. I woke up at 10 am I hurt a little but no temp it was 98.1

                                                Roughly 34-36 hours after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I started having chills and could not get warm.  I took my temperature thinking I was running a fever, but temperature was 97.3. I went and soaked in a really hot tub of water trying to get warm. After a little while (20-30 minutes) I started feeling achy all over. I went to bed feeling really horrible with chills and achiness, but I could not go to sleep. Finally, sometime after midnight, I fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning I felt fine. The chills and achiness from the previous night were gone with no lingering effects.

                                                First three days was just muscle soreness and fatigue.  On day 4 I started having tight chest and SOB while snowshoeing, which I did not have the day before on same activity.  That night I woke up with SOB and tightness in my chest and severe pain in area of my heart.  I could not lay on my left side.  It seemed like I was having heart attack symptoms.  Barley slept but upon waking my heart rate was 94 and the pain remained in LT Axilla area.  Took it easy for day and that night again had trouble sleeping, SOB but not as bad.  Woke up with excrutiating pain radiating up the base of my RT skull.  Was concerned about blood clot potential??  Had SOB when walking up stairs.  My throat hurt when bending over, as if my esophagus was crushing.  Friends said my face looked puffy and I felt bloated.  Landed up reporting to ER at the Hospital on Monday, Feb. 1st as directed by my PCP.  Hospital was told I had just had 2nd dose of vaccine, but did not think it was related.  I will mention all tests below, but upon arriving home on Feb. 2nd, I discovered a rash breaking out on underside of my LT upper arm, LT inner thigh and LT lower leg.

I came to work but was dragging the entire day.  Wednesday morning, after a good sleep, soreness was gone, but I was tired early the next afternoon.  I was fine Thursday but continued to have sore lymph nodes in the armpit of the arm that got the shot for several days after.

I was given Benadryl 25mg and salumedrol IV. Before the 30 min mark I had tingling on the tip of my tongue and lips. I was monitored for 2&#43; hours and was sent home. The doctor prescribed 40mg prednisone for 4 days an Epipen, and antihistamines, recommended I see an allergist.  I saw APN 1/18/21 after the tingling and throat tightness persisted, she prescribed a taper of the prednisone.  Went to allergist 1/21/21 where we discussed continued symptoms and longer taper of prednisone and she asked me to call her 1/25/21. We spoke 1/25/21 and she recommended I see an ENT. Saw ENT on 1/29/21 who examined my throat with no concerns there. We discussed the ?burning mouth syndrome? symptoms and he recommended I return for medicated mouth wash if the symptoms continue. I am no longer taking any medication. I still have mild tingling on the lips and tongue, slight peppery feel/taste and occasional tightness at the base of my throat. We

There was really no pain and went away within a couple of day but turned red again exactly a week later from injection date. This time it was hard, hot, red, itchy, and bigger. Dr treated it with clindamycin and dose pack of steroids. It got better after a few days. Next, I got a UTI and called my primary care physician. She ordered CIPRO and phenazopyridine. That got better but before CIPRO was finished, I got a crick in my neck that turned into excruciating pain in my neck and was unable to turn head from side to side. At the same time, my left foot became painful, red and swelled. I have been treated for arthritis in that foot 6 years ago with an injection. I have not had any problems with it since the injection.  Dr. treated my neck problem with Robaxin and a steroid dose pack. This seemed to help my foot too temporarily. Neck pain improved but not gone. It was excruciating pain up the back of my scalp at times. I can turn my head some now but it&#39;s not back normal. Can&#39;t turn it all the way.  Dr. did another injection in my foot but did not work this time. I got worse and I can no longer put any weight on that foot. I have not been able to work since January 20. Have had to apply for leave of absence and short-term disability

                                                On the afternoon of the day of vaccination (2/6/21) I have developed a skin rash on my chest and neck, but it went away after few hours.  On Sunday I felt a strong pain in my right arm. In the afternoon (2/7/21) I developed a severe headache, started to feel chest pain, a bit of nausea, flushed skin on my cheeks. By about 5:00 pm I felt really bad and I checked my blood pressure- using electronic meter. The reading was 171/105 with pulse 91. I have no history of high blood pressure. I called my physician but there was only recorded message to go to ER in case of emergency. I didn&#39;t feel that urgent need so I called my friend who is a nurse and she advise me to take aspirin. I did not have one on hand so my husband went to the store and I took it (325mg) after 6 pm. By 5:50 pm my blood pressure went up to 181/108, with pulse 98. At 6:54 pm it went down to 148/95 with pulse 91. The headache was becoming dull and I started to feel a bit better. This morning my blood pressure continues to be high- 149/95 with pulse 70.

                                                On Tuesday went to work and at around 1:30 she told her boss that she was not feeling good.  Felt achy in her body, her arm was hurting and was not feeling like herself.  She went home, sat on the sofa and drank something and went to sleep and felt drained, and slept for 4 hours.  She then woke up with runny nose, low grade temp, and felt really weak.  The next day, 1/6/21 her body ached bad.  She slept a lot that day and drank a lot of water, didn&#39;t eat and just felt really sick.  Then on Saturday evening, she looked at her leg and felt cold chills and her leg was hot.  She looked at her leg and had an area that was like a red dot, and she then realized that her leg was about to be inflamed.  She went to bed, woke up and her entire leg was blotchy red, swollen and hot.  She then called her family and around 12:00 on Monday 1/11/21.  She went to the hospital, and they treated her like she had COVID, isolated her and was negative.  Sent her to vascular and did not have a blood clot in her leg, and told her she had an cellulitis flair, and she started being treated with IV antibiotics.  Was in the hospital for 5 days.  She was discharged and went home after infectious disease team told her to go home with a nurse on IV antibiotics.  She came home on 1/15/21, and was off the IV antibiotics on 1/22/21.   She has been home and unable to work.  She is going to therapy for her legs.  They changed her hypertension medications, and put back on her antibiotics last week as they told her that the swelling was not going down.  Her kidney function is low and told today, 2/9/21 that she is concerned about her kidney function.  She is to have more labs drawn on Monday, 2/15/21.

Symptoms were even worse in the morning the next day (18-20 hours after the vaccination). Headache across scalp, pain and swelling at injection site, body aches and stiffness diffusely, significant fatigue, loss of appetite. I had to take the day following the vaccine off work--I stayed in bed most of the day until about 2:30 PM. I did not take any medication/pain medicine and the headache went away around 2 PM (26 hours after the vaccination). Other symptoms improved gradually at that time, too. By 3:00 PM (27 hours after the shot), I felt well enough to file this VAERS report.

Day 4 pain in left arm grew to more intense pain and spread up left shoulder to neck and left side of face and around eye area. Same exact feeling as Bell&#39;s Palsy.  Day 5 - I took Valtrex I already had 1 gm Day 6-13 doctor prescribed Prednisone 60 mg &#43; Valtrez 1 gm for first day (adjusted to 50 mg Prednisone days 7-12 due to Prednisone side effects, then 20 mg on day 13).   After day 7 facial palsy began to decrease in eye area. Overall Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms after full course of treatment have finally subsided after day  20, for now.  Hoping they will not return.  Very scary and intense experience.  Exercise and PT helpful.

                                                Significant pain in left arm approx. 1.5 hours post-vaccine. Felt a little under the weather the rest of the day yesterday, then started feeling very sick in the middle of the night at approx. 1:30 a.m. Flu like symptoms ever since then, with severe headache and body aches and pains. I have been taking max doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen all day.

Not sure if I would call it short of breath but it took a lot more effort to take a breath.  I am a shallow breather.  I could not walk my dog as I always do. Walking across the room was tough.  All this for 6 days.  7th day was much better.  8th day same but mild.  9th day woke up with a horrible headache and diarrhea.  Dizziness and breathing wasn&#39;t better until 10th day.

                                                Ongoing headache and light sensitivity. Began day 3. Gets progressively worse as the day goes on. Tylenol alone is ineffective. Tylenol  3 works.   The left side of my neck - the node under my chin/ear area was tender to the touch for 5-6 days. Very uncomfortable to turn my head and the pain interrupted sleep at night.  The tenderness is still noticeable still today but not painful or causing sleep interruptions. Tenderness at the injection site for the first couple of days has subsided but the redness, swelling, and now &#34;hot&#34; to the touch (Temp 102.5 at the injection site) continues still 3.10.21,  which is 10 days after injection.

                                                About 40 min after my shot I started feeling tightness (like asthma) in my chest. I ended up needing 6 puffs from my inhaler. (I had also experienced feeling very agitated throughout that day and night). The periodic daily need for the i hailer continued and so I called Moderna and the woman I spoke with told me that the breathing issue was a reaction (she was not as sure about the feeling of agitation) and that when I got my second dose to have them observe for an hour. Over the weeks since that first breathing episode it has continued daily and required the use of my in hailer. In the last few days it has been worse than before and I?ve had a mild headache for about 3 days.  Tomorrow is my shot. I didn?t realize about reporting here until I read about it today.  Since I have a n old history of asthma (though it?s been a relative ?non issue? for years (except  when I get a cold in my chest), but I would want this known for other people with asthma, because it?s definitely going on and strange. (Nothing preventing me from my normal day - but for sure my days have not been ?normal?.  I plan on seeing my doctor to get new medicine for the nebulizer and  likely stronger type asthma medication until it goes away)

Could not get warm no matter how many layers I put on.  Chills along with extreme headache and body aches that wouldn&#39;t subside with either Tylenol or Motrin. Couldn&#39;t fall back asleep.   Injection site extremely painful. Couldn&#39;t put any pressure on that arm. No appetite and no energy all day.  Woke up this morning completely soaked and temperature down to 99.  Headache less painful and receptive to Tylenol. Injectiion site still sore but not as painful.

                                                Started Feb 28 with pain going up the left side of my neck.  From there a lump that I had gotten checked out before the shot started hurting.  March 1, didn&#39;t feel like myself, pain up neck, and under my arm was really hurting.  Feeling worse everyday, March 4, 21 about 12:30 am, my chest started really hurting, woke me up from a deep sleep, through out the day I started feeling worse, March 5, 21 about 1:00 am, I started getting a very sharp pain in my left leg.  I was about to go to the ER but thought I would wait to see how I felt when I got up for work.  At 5:30 am, I was feeling so bad, I felt like a bus hit me that I sent a message to my Dr. describing my symptoms, and later on I got a message with her telling me I should go to the ER and get checked out.  After taking my vitals my blood pressure was 192/100.  I was there for 4 hours and was finally put on medication.  After being on it for a couple of days, I started feeling like myself and still on blood pressure medication.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID19 Moderna on 4/2/21 @7:40  through my employer, where I&#39;ve worked over 11 years. By that evening, I had the normal fatigue, headache, and sore arm at my injection site that evening which even became swollen, red, and rashy by that next morning with some joint pain but attributed to normal side effects and dismissed it. But I woke up early Sunday morning, 04:30, very sick, with a fever, chills, diarrhea, cramping and aching abdomen and joints and also developed a rash and hives on my arm, up my neck, into my hair and down my chest left chest with some swelling as well. I took some Benadryl, it went down some but continued but I called the Tele service line to be evaluated as my symptoms were getting worse, not better. I continued experiencing these side effects as they increased intensity, especially the watery diarrhea that occured almost immediately everytime I drank and the rash and hives and ache in joints. I lost all appetite and even got so nauseas it woke me from a 10 minute nap vomitingI had an appointment w/MD 04/06/2021where she prescribed Zofran and told me to take Imodium, which I did not think I could since I was told nothing but Tylenol after the vaccine.She told me to follow -up with my primary or ER if I wasn&#39;t better by Thursday, today, but didn&#39;t think my diarrhea and stomach had anything to do with my vaccine.My fever, chills, rash, hives and itchiness came back and continued throughout yesterday as soon as I tried to stop taking Benadryl and Tylenol for a day as my stomach was so upset, cramping and sore. I went online to request an appointment with my PMD for follow-up and further evaluation as I am still nauseous too, and as I discovered after trying to eat toast and rice again, my taste is off.I received no response to my requests online so I called my doctors office today and they made a special appointment by telephone @08:30pm with Dr. so I do not have to come into the Clinic and get others sick.I&#39;ve had to submit a LOA claim as well from missing now what will be 5 days of work. I hoping to be better soon.

This happened right away, and within a few hours increased in size and then remained very swollen for several days. Pain was tolerable. Sinuses are aggravated which is a usual immune response for my body.  By 2nd day, experience sleep disruption in morning (jerking awake every hour) and then slept most of the afternoon. I also started getting a pain under my armpit, like a swollen lymph node that hurt., I put up with it for two days and then took an NSAID and the pain was faint by the next day until it faded out two days later. No other side effects were experienced.

These all started to improve Sunday evening, 4/18,, and I was able to eat a meal.  Around 9:00 pm on 4/18, I noticed a red area around the injection site on my arm.  It felt warm to the touch.  It didn?t seem too swollen, so I went to bed.  I woke up around 2:00am on 4/19 and my upper arm had a large, hard swollen lump at injection site.  It was still red and hot.  I have been taking ibuprofen which is helping with the swelling.  I still have some swelling, a red ?sunburned? area around the injection, and warm to the touch.  I do not have pain or itching? at least at this point at 11:45pm on 4/19.   I was surprised to have a new symptom almost 2.5 days after my shot.

My speech was Ok, my BP was monitored and was  a little elevated, nurse thought I was a little anxious because of my symptoms, BP was checked again about 10 minutes later and it was normal, they listened to my lungs to-all seemed to be well, except for these changing sensations going up my face, and lip. I stayed for about 20 minutes more, and returned to my office. Throughout the day changing sensations/lip area-that evening, my family said my lower lip was  drooping slightly downward-it seemed a bit swollen as well.  I checked in with the Covid Vaccine Clinic Wed. 01/13/20 in the AM as asked, and let them know i was still having symptoms in my lips, and felt slightly swollen on the one side.   It is 1/13/2020 @ 8:45PM and my bottom lip still feels strange(fluttery/tinglingly-not quite numb in sensation/  my cheeks/chin have intermittent differences in sensation

                                                I was asked to sit after shot for 30 minutes vs 15 minutes (shot was at 9:33 A.M., because I have a sensitivity to sugar alcohols. At 25 minutes, my heart rate increased in the chair,, the tip of my tongue began to tingle. When I stood up to alert a staff member, my head began to &#39;swim&#39;, like it was full of water. My speech became slow and I couldn&#39;t quite find the words to speak quickly to answer the staff&#39;s questions. My walking was slow and wobbly. Staff took me to a secluded room, where vitals were taken four different times throughout my seclusion. My b/p was high at first, I was dizzy and not thinking clearly. It took until 10:55 A.M. before my tongue tip no longer tingled, but became numbish, and my head became clearer. I was able to stand on my own, and then walk out to my car.

By the next day  I had a fever, chills, then sweating (back and forth for hours), body aches, very sore arm (sore enough it kept me awake for two nights),  fatigue, and a general feeling of being &#34;sick&#34;. On Sunday,  the fever was gone, but a headache took its place. The other symptoms were still there. When I woke on Monday morning, I felt back to normal (with very mild soreness in my arm). However, on Monday I was walking uphill on the same route I&#39;d taken the previous two days and ran out of breath to the point I had to stop and focus on breathing for several minutes. That&#39;s never happened to me before and I walk that route a lot. Though I was uncomfortable, none of these symptoms was bad enough to visit a Dr. I just wanted to report these side effects so people know that you can get them after the very first shot in the series.

Developed a delayed reaction to the vaccine 12 days after receiving  it.  Developed a rash that is approxiamently 3.5 inches wide by  5 inches in length.  It is dark in color and raised as well as itchy.  I am also experiencing tingling in my tongue and lips as well as feeling that my tongue is slightly swollen as well as my throat.   The rash is warm to the touch and slightly sensitive to touch as well, and is  giving off heat.  It has gotten slightly larger in the past 2 days.  I DO NOT have a fever. Monday evening started taking Allegra.  It helps to keep the reaction I am having in my mouth and the itchiness for about 12 hours

Swelling, soreness and redness at sight of injection for about three days after injection.  This cleared up.   Then about a week after injection the injection site became swollen and red again.  The swelling lasted another 3 days but has now resided.  The redness is less noticeable but the circle has grown to approximately 4 1/2 inches in length and 2 1/4 inches in width.

                                                Right shoulder impingement for 4 weeks prior to immunization.  Much improved with RICE and OTC ibuprofen.  So much better that I did not think twice about receiving injection in that same arm.  I  had been pain free for over one week.  Received injection to right deltoid without a problem at time of administration.  About 36 hours later injection site was so painful that it resulted in nausea, waking during the night, unable to perform ADLs, having to seek orthopedic physicians care for evaluation and meloxicam daily.  Pain has persisted beyond 3 weeks post injection.  I received a referral for physical therapy.  I am still struggling with pain that continues to wake me during the night.  I am a 55 year old female who has delivered three children and I would describe this pain at injection site from three weeks ago as the most pain I have ver experienced in my life time.  Pain still remains at injection site and radiates to the shoulder joint and up into the neck.  Currently receiving  physical therapy treatment for the pain and discomfort.  Unsure as to whether or not I will receive the second dose.  Looking for some guidance.

It was not red, it was not swollen, it was just sore. I decided to take a bath, and went to bed. Felt tired and my arm was sore but it was mild, around 8 or 9 o&#39;clock.  I went to bed at 8 or 9 o&#39;clock and woke up around 2 or 3 in the morning and arm was very sore, would call it moderate. I took 500 Tylenol and 200 ibuprofen together.  Throughout the night my head hurt and i tried to go back to sleep. at 5 in the morning my head was excruciating, I would it an 8. My arm was very sore, I would give it an 8. My body hurt really bad so i give that an 8. so I&#39;m thinking ok this is what you get when you get a vaccine so I went back to bed. from 5-8 am  tossed and turned. at 8 o&#39;clock i got up and was very wobbly and weak and had chills. I checked my temp and it was 101.5. I went down stairs but had to take one stairs at a time because I was so weak, I went to kitchen because I was so thirsty. I tried to fix some ice water and lemon but it spilled. Went back upstairs because I had so many chills. I called my job at the Clinic but all they had was a voicemail. My face hurts my jaw hurts and my neck on the side where they gave me the shot, my right side. I was trying to put something in my stomach but I could only eat a few sunflower seeds. My body head and arm hurts so bad, moving is excruciating. I felt great all week and yesterday.

                                                I started with a pain in the left arm similar to the aching I felt the day after my  vaccine.  It felt worse this morning, and I looked in  the mirror since it felt so hot and it is a very large oval- red outline rash.  Not raised,  just mostly red on the border and hot and angry .  Feels more painful inside , like &#34;sharp, and achy&#34; and a worse headache than the day after the shot .   The headache is progressively getting worse.  I have taken my migraine Rx- 1- Fioricet earlier so I could work, but it did not help.  My PCP suggested putting a  topical cortisone cream on the rash, I have not gotten that yet.  Perhaps unrelated, but for the record, this past Tuesday, 1/19/21, I had such bad vertigo that I could not even telework, and that&#39;s a 1st.

                                                Immediately once the shot pulled out of her arm, she was dizzy. Walked slowly to the post vaccine area and spoke with the volunteer MD that was there.  The nursing students stayed with her and gave her apple juice. She has felt dizzy ever since.   Dizziness has eased up as far as severity goes, but she feels like it stays with her longer than it should have. Had to miss work last week a few days because of this.

I just could not wake up during this time my eyes were heavy and my body felt wiped out, very tired. I feel better today although I am extremley weak with little strength. It has been a horrible experience. I was afraid that I was not ever going to be able to wake up again.  What would cause my body to shut down like this????????  Wishing I did not get that second dose

                                                About 5 minutes into sitting in my chair during the 15 minute waiting period, I felt very faint and nauseous and clammy.   I looked around for a medical person, but it was a very busy time and there were lots of people in the room.  I leaned back in my chair and just tried to take some deep breaths until the feelings went away, about 2 minutes later.   I also had a strange sensation at the time of the vaccine - I felt the liquid from the injection going in and then i had a sensation across my upper back and neck.  I was a very weird feeling. After my 15 minute period was up, the scheduler came and booked my next appointment.  I asked her if I could speak to a nurse.  I did find a nurse and report my reaction.  She asked how I felt now - which was okay, and she asked if I needed something to eat or drink, but I said no and that was it.  I asked her if I should get the 2nd vaccine and she said yes.   I have never had this reaction to any vaccine or yearly flu shot.  I am not afraid of needles.  It was very strange and I felt off for the next 3 days.

                                                Extreme arm and shoulder pain and great difficulty moving arm and shoulder.  Onset of pain and difficulty in use was within hours of vaccine administration and worsened over the next three days.  The pain was significant enough to require use of pain relieving medications throughout the day and night.  The pain woke me up at night.  Unable to lift arm more than a few inches for several days.  Difficulty moving arm, arm felt very heavy, so much so that if I was rolling over in bed I couldn&#39;t move my arm and needed to use the hand of  my other arm to do so.  Unable to lift arm to the back of my head (for example to put an elastic in my hair) for a week.  A high degree of pain for about 5 days, reducing somewhat after that and lasted about 2 weeks.  Still, nearly 4 weeks later, my arm is sore when I move it at the very top into the shoulder.  It&#39;s difficult to hook my bra.  I am not in pain but often have little twinges of pain/discomfort in the upper arm/shoulder, particularly when I lift my arm upward from the side of my body.

Pt&#39;s husband shows up and she recognizes him but doesn&#39;t know why he is there. Husband says she acts like this when she is anxious and he can take care of her. The nausea/dry heaving is a new symptom. Recommended to go to hospital but leaves with husband. Later spoke with patient and she seems better and has been taking Benadryl every 4 hours. She is still experiencing tongue numbness and is going to her PCP.

I also had serious mental fog, nearly fugue level as I lost time (on the drive home I ended up 2 hours off track in an unfamiliar location, with no recollection as to how I got there). I was foggy for about a week. I had a fever the night after the vaccine (102). This has all mostly resolved now at the 2 week mark, and I&#39;ve only had a little body ache that seems to be holding on (nothing unmanageable). I am prone to anxiety and I&#39;m sure that made the dissociation worse, but it is new to me at that level. I was concerned about the irregular heartbeat but am told this is not dangerous. I did not take any medication or anything to offset the symptoms as I want to make sure the vaccine works best.

I was freezing cold.  I had 4 fleece blankets on plus wool pajamas.  Four nights I had to sleep in a recliner because it felt like there was an elephant on my chest and I could not breathe.  Two mornings I was coming to work, left my driveway and threw up all over myself; had to turn around, take a shower, and come into work, only to only be able to work 2-4 hours per day for 3 weeks.  The Sat. and Sun. following the injection, I slept until Mon. morning.  I had pure exhaustion from the shot.

                                                After receiving the second COVID Moderna vaccine, Patient reports that she is dizzy and her tongue feels thick. She is having trouble coming up with words, having difficulty focusing eyes, and feels like she is in a brain fog. She denies any issues with first vaccine. She consents to Benadryl administration. She would like to stay here to be monitored rather than call an ambulance at this time. She has no facial droop, no weakness or unequal grips.    After about 10-15 minutes, she reports her dizziness and thick tongue feeling is improving.    After another 5 minutes, symptoms have not fully resolved. She still feels like her mentation is abnormal, and her tongue is still feeling &#34;sticky.&#34;    After another 5 minutes, patient continues to be mildly dizzy, and still reports difficulty finding words, difficulty thinking, and persistent visual disturbance. I discussed with patient that she needs to be seen in the ER. She declines an ambulance, states she would like her husband to drive her.    Patient left.

Scheduled apt with PCP same day.  Also had just began three treatments of a new product, Olay Peptide 24.  Not sure if swollen lymphnode due to vaccine or new product.  PCP instructed to monitor and take ibuprofen for pain/inflamation.  When receiving both doses of the moderna vaccine, I experienced right neck stiffness within 2 hours of vaccination that lasted approximately 36 hours each time.  To note previous medical history, I had Bells Palsy at the age of 12 years and Shingles around age 45, both impacting my right side.

Lasted for ten hours followed by extreme weakness. Two weeks later I am still weak and tired constantly. Also had weird nerve like pains in various parts of the body. Now still with body aches especially in right leg.

I checked my blood pressure around 3:30 AM on the 27th and it was 124/70 Pulse 113. At that point I decided to wait until the morning to contact my doctor rather than go to the hospital.  I got up around 8 AM and my pulse was still fast, but had slowed down from the night before.  By around 9:30 AM my heart rate had normalized.  I did not go to the hospital or call my doctor as I believed things had subsided.

I drove home and felt fine until I became very tired and went to bed at 7:00 pm. I slept straight through until 7:00 am and woke with a headache, (something that I get around once every year or two). I slept most of the day, (was up around eight hours), and then slept through Saturday night and woke around 9:00 am and felt like my old self. The headache was severe enough to take ibuprofen but only took it the one time in the morning.

Pain rated at 8 1/2-9 on 1-10 scale.  It continued for 2&#43; weeks.  Exponentially  worse with any increase in heart rate.  Diagnosed via email with cardiologist as probable pericarditis and instructed to take OTC NSAIDs until symptoms resolved.  At 3 weeks out I still feel mild chest pain, but pain no longer increases with an increase in heart rate.  IgG titers pulled 3/5/21 and I will get the second dose depending on my immune response to the first dose.

                                                I waited the requested 15 minutes as requested after my shot and felt fine although in hindsight i realize my finger joints were hurting/swelling. I left the facility as planned and while sitting at a red light  ( about 2 mins after leaving) my cheeks suddenly got very flushed and were burning. I looked in my car mirror they were bright red. The light turned green and I turned then under my chin suddenly felt like a bug bit it and started itching intensely. This sensation reminded me of the last time I reacted to a medication so I pulled into a parking lot and parked. i looked in the mirror again and my neck./ throat had angry red hives/rash all over it , my tongue and throat began feeling strange ( swelling?) and I felt very light headed and shaky. I drove back across the road to the vaccination clinic and showed a nurse. She said I was reacting to the shot. The nurses had me lay down and gave me benedryl. At that time my blood pressure was also very high  ( unusual , I usually have great blood pressure) . All of this happened in the 30 minutes of me leaving the clinic ( 11.00-11.30) I responded positively to the benedryl and my rash/hives and swelling subsided . I had a family member drive me home and I was advised to keep taking benedryl every 6 hrs. I woke up the next day ( March 9th) at 5.00 A.M expecting to feel ok and quickly realized i was really not feeling good. My entire body ached ,and my muscles all down my left side were incredibly painful to move. My joints hurt and my fingers and feet/toes were swollen. My neck /lymph nodes were also swollen and my rash on my neck came back for at 8.30 A.M ( I took more benedryl) . I also had an awful headache and fever and was exhausted. I ended up sleeping most of the day and could not go to work. I woke up at 5,00 A.M today ( March 10th ) and fel weak but much better

                                                Right after the vaccination ion Friday,  I felt fatigue. (at the 15 minutes wait time), I left the facility at 130, Took Prednisone 20 mg per my pulmonologist request at 235pm.  I felt the lungs are heavy, by around 545 pm, I started to have  shortness of breath, at 11 pm that evening, wheezing started.  I started  xopenex, and atrovent neb solution and tylenol for the headache (which started around time of wheezing) By Saturday afternoon, the ribcage is very tight, hard for me to breath, can only take short breath.  I continue to take prednisone 20 mg daily per doctor.  On Monday, telemedicine visit with the pulmonologist, he increase to 60 mg, Ribcage tightness relieved about 1 hour and 45 minutes, back to tightness again.  Tuesday morning, I went to Emergency room, admitted as observation.  Discharged on Thursday.  I was given iv solumedrol while under observation in the hospital.  I return home with oral prednisone prescription.   I feel fine on Friday, Saturday, the ribcage started to tighten again, along with shortness of breath.  Doctor contacted on Monday 3/8/21 with continuation of prednisone and taper down by 10 mg a week.  I am still having shortness of breath and ribcage tightness, especially, when walk, stand, talk.  As of now, I am still home and have not return to work.

I had taken 2 Motrin at approximately 8pm. I had terrible pain in lower back, hips and legs and was unable to go back to sleep. The nausea subsided enough around 4am to allow me to take my temperature (101.9) and take Tylenol. Temperature was reduced to 100 by 6am. I was unable to get back to sleep after waking at 12:30am and suffered back and hip pain all day on the 23rd. On the 24th through the 26th I had a headache and was unable to sleep without taking a PM product (Tylenol PM). Symptoms continued to get better over the course of the next 3 days.

                                                Patient stated she was initially light headed, dizzy, and shaky.  After talking to her, she said has anxiety and did not have her medication with her.  When asked if she has had similar reaction to shots in the past she said she has had similar reaction.  She stated she was not having any trouble breathing but that her hand felt tingly.  (I did not observe any rash or hives on her.)  After 20 minutes, she said she felt is was her anxiety and was not getting better and requested we call an ambulance.  Store management called an ambulance and when they arrived, she stated she wanted to walk to the ambulance and the EMT&#39;s walked with her to the ambulance.

                                                I felt bad immediately afterward, headache. Treated with Tylenol. By the next day, a very large tongue ulcer appeared or the front right side of my tongue, and that night I felt the beginnings of Bells Palsey.  On Monday 3/8 I went to the clinic and explained that I have Ramsey Hunt and could feel Bells Palsey starting. They began me on antivirals, steroids, and topical lidocaine because of the extreme pain of the ulcer.

Took 2 625 mg Tylenol extended release tabs, layered up clothing, put heating pad on and two comforters and cried myself to sleep.  Awoke around 8:00 AM with all symptoms except chills and tested for 99.9 temperature. Extreme fatigue and sleepiness, along with continued body aches for the next 24 hours.  Then body aches finally lessened and strength returning, but still headache, arm pain and itching in arm below where shot was given into day 5.

She leaned herself forward in her chair saying I don&#39;t feel good. She then attempted to through herself onto the floor. She was assisted to the ground. On the way down to the floor she kept saying I don&#39;t feel good. Once on the floor she continued to speak and started to shake her whole body around, kicking her legs about and flailing her arms and shaking her head. She initially was speaking then she stopped speaking and alternated between having her eyes open and her eyes closed. She shook for about 30 seconds then she stopped but she did not speak for about 5 minutes. She shook intermittently shake briefly when someone tried to speak to her or take her vital signs.

I was thirsty, then extremely weak and light-headed.  While sitting, I started tilting over to the side and thought I would pass out.  They called EMTs who took my blood pressure -it was 166 over about 82.  They gave me oxygen and took me to the hospital.  I was incredibly thirsty and drank a huge glass of ice water.   After being monitored and released within about  2 hours, I felt brain fog.  The brain fog worsened the next day and significantly worsened on the second day after the vaccine.  It was so bad that it felt like having a concussion:  I had trouble word-finding and was stumbling all over my words.  The night of the vaccine, I had hot flashes all night long.  Eight days after the vaccine, I developed &#34;COVID-arm&#34;.

Then I had fatigue  on the third day.  On the fifth day after vaccine, I began having pain and tingling sensation in extremities, back and joints, along with a feeling of numbness. This lasted for about 3 days.  It was like the feeling of being thawed out...my bones ached.   My heart rate also would rise when resting. I also had a rash under my left breast and stomach area. In addition I had swelling in my knee and slight swelling in my toes, hands.  Now, that has subsided but I had severe exhaustion to the point I could not do daily activities without having to lie down in between. I also am very forgetful and have fogginess that still resides.  I went to my PCP on Monday who is doing bloodwork....waiting on results.

                                                after the shot I had pain at the injection site and unable to lift arm or sleep on it. After a few days the initial injection site pain went away but pain inside the arm did not. I kept lifting the arm throughout the day and trying to move it  to keep the muscle moving. Unable to sleep on that arm continued as with the pain inside. I struggled at night to be comfortable having to change sleeping habits and it would awake me from a sound sleep if I turned over and laid  on it. I cannot reach behind to grab something with that arm or get milk from the fridge etc with out the pain. Most daily activities have changed with limited range of motion reaching backwards with my left arm.   I went to get the 2nd shot and told them about it and did not want to get the 2nd injection in the right arm for fear of it effecting that arm so I got 2nd injection in the left arm as well. They told me if the pain continued to go see my primary care doctor. After the 2nd injection and the normal injection site pain went away the pain continued and has not gone away. I went to my doctor who gave me this website to report the injury. I did not have any problems with my left arm prior to the injection and now I am having issues inside around the muscle area where the injection was given . There is no redness or swelling.

                                                I was fine until midnight. I was experiencing a fever, chills, my wrist and ankle joints were hurting really bad, I had a headache in the back of my head and I was nauseated. When I got up to get some Tylenol and check my temp, I got really diaphoretic and I was so dizzy that everything started going black. I felt like I was about to pass out. I was freezing cold. I just got back in bed. I never was able to get the meds and I didn&#39;t have anyone I could call. That lasted for about 5 hours and then it started to ease up. I was able to check my temp and it was over 101. I took some Tylenol because I still had a headache, but my body was no longer hurting. I was still dealing with a temp, but I didn&#39;t feel sick. All day Friday and Saturday, I had the headache, fever and fatigue. On Sunday, I was tired, but I ended up going to work and did okay with the exception of being a little foggy. I&#39;ve been fine since then. I itch occasionally and I just put a little cream on it.

From the top of my arm to my elbow, I couldn&#39;t move, but the rest of my arm was fine. That lasted for about 2 days. On Sunday, when I was getting ready for work, I was still having a hard time brushing my hair. After being at work for a few hours, I was suddenly able to move it again. All that remained was a little soreness at the top of the joint, but the injection site was fine. It eventually went away.

I took Advil,  it was like the worst &#34;flu shot&#34; I ever got. Then the muscle pain started. I went home and took some Advil, tried to walk my dogs and couldn&#39;t. I usually walk 3 miles with them and did not walk even 1/2 mile. Went home and took a hot shower with Epson salt and laid down. My arm started aching. I can&#39;t even wash my hair, the injection site itches and is painful and my scalp was itching too. Overall headache, joint/ muscle pain like flu like symptoms. Wednesday morning before I left work my back started hurting really bad, severe back pain. When I arrived home and used the bathroom I was having abd pain, and diarrhea. It was all fluid. I ate some chili the day before and when I wiped my bottom it was red like bloody. My PCP was closed. It happened about 4 times. It is like I have a kidney pain (the back pain)

As the evening progressed, I felt worse and worse, had no appetite, very slight nausea, but no vomiting. During the night, my fever went up.  I only checked it once and it was 100.1, but I was having severe chills, my knee joints were aching, as well as some of my fingers.  The next morning I had a headache, and was dizzy (which may have been from not eating the night before). The symptoms continued throughout the day, but were managed fairly well with Tylenol.  Additionally, my arm was extremely sore.  It hurt to move it in any way.  Even worse arm pain than with a Tetanus shot, which has always caused me a great deal of pain.  Thankfully the symptoms only lasted about 28 hours.

Returned to the site to be monitored by the doctor. Was advised to take a Benadryl (within 30 minutes of injection). The head issues continued in waves for about 2 hours. My throat felt tight, but never closed off. Once home I experienced a fever of 100 for approximately 2 hours. Remedied by acetaminophen.  Slept well and woke with no further symptoms except slight injection site soreness.

Home from work on January 6th, day of initial dose. Started with chills after arriving  home at approx 8pm.  Went to bed and woke sometime around midnight with the above described symptoms. Symptoms  cont throughout the day (January 8th) . Finally out of bed by evening and was able to hold down food. Back to bed and woke sometime around 3 am after breaking a sweat. Fever was gone and my body cooler. Up that morning around 9. Normal, tolerable body aches, mild headache and left arm very sore but could tolerate it being touched.   Side Note: I had contracted the virus in March 2020.  The symptoms from the vaccine were so much worse than the actual virus. I am too scared to get the second dose.

                                                Did okay in the first hour, no issues.   Began to get mild muscle cramps in side of face, jaw, down both sides of neck, upper left shoulder with finger and upper right foot tingling, left wrist tightness, and itching in both armpits, upper inner arms and upper back and irritability while driving home. Went to Urgent Care. All seemed to resolve except itching, muscle pain, irritability. Itching started in legs. Was given shot of Benadryl and oral Prednisone which helped. Woke up with nausea, headache, fever, abdominal pain, muscle aches, but no itchiness. No continued irritability. Feel dehydrated now. Have had fluids. Still very dry. Headache is worse. Having some trouble getting enough  fluids  in. Will keep trying and call physician next.

When I was driving home at 1310, I developed itching to my face and head, I felt like my lower lip was numb and swollen. Like when you go to the dentist and get novocaine. I drove home and took 50 mg benadryl and called the ER. I went to the local ER and  felt hot, diaphoretic, anxious and was given 40 mg Prednisone orally. I was observed for one hour. NO SOB occurred. I was discharged home with Prednisone 20 mg daily for 8 days, epi pen and told to take Benadryl and pepcid.

On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest degree of pain) my pain was a 9 for 2 days.

Fatigue for 60 hours (2.5 days, where my work was compromised).  I napped throughout the day and slept long hours at night.   Onset of chills at 4 p.m. (about 7 hours after shot) lasting until about 4 a.m. (12 hours) This was not a pleasant experience, especially the fatigue and the chills, and the ongoing pain -- all of it.  Two weeks later I still have a sore bump at the injection site.  I have in my years never experienced an adverse reaction to shots or medication, and I have lived abroad and traveled many regions of the world.

                                                That evening my heart was pounding very hard throughout my entire body that&#39;s all I could hear laying down I thought that I was going to either have a heart attack or a stroke. I got up and took one of my blood pressure medications. It&#39;s slowed down but I was unable to sleep due to feeling jittery and my heart pounding hard. The next day I felt exhausted my stomach hurt. I have had a sore throat the worst being on the Thursday following. Today Friday things seem to be subsiding.  However my concern is not to get the second dose if I had such a bad reaction the first time I definitely will have a heart attack the second time.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving 2nd Moderna vaccination I spiked a fever and had severe chills.  I was too weak to get out of bed and took Tylenol.  This brought temp down to 99.7, but I&#39;m certain it was much higher than this before (I couldn&#39;t check my temp before because I was too weak to get up and temp gauge was downstairs, luckily, Tylenol was close by).  I was also extremely nauseated and could not eat or drink anything except small sips of water.   I also had a terrible headache and body aches and I could not rest due to the extreme discomfort.  These symptoms lasted about 36 hours, and I&#39;m still very weak at present.

                                                Approximately 4 inches of redness and swelling with pain just below injection site. Symptoms began 24 hours after injection and are still present on day 4 after the injection. Site is very tender to the touch and I am not able to sleep on that side. I am not able to medicate with anti-inflammatories due to kidney disease but am using  ice packs with some relief.

                                                Immediately, my arm was in pain. It was like I had been stung by 100 bees. I went back to school but I couldn&#39;t use my arm. It lasted two or three days. On second day, I took Ibuprofen and that helped. In the middle of the night (the night after I got my shot, it woke me up with terrible abdominal pains; chills; body aches. By the morning, the abdominal pain was gone - chills, aches and some fatigue. I went and taught school but it got progressively worse and I went home at lunch time. I had a slight fever - it was a high fever for me as I usually run low (96.5). It was about 100.9. I called the clinic the next day (Saturday) because my other symptoms had more or less abated but my left arm was very, very swollen from shoulder to elbow. My coat was too tight on my arm when I tried to put my coat. My arm was cold and my fingers were number. He is the one who told me to take Ibuprofen and elevate my arm and ice it. After the next three days, gradually my swelling went down and my doctor told me to keep using it and keep it moving which I did. Monday, the clinic called to have me talk to the doctor to see about taking the second dose. Doctor said to take the second dose. 2nd dose was much easier for me. My arm symptoms were resolved after about a week.

                                                &#34;I am reporting a reaction to my second Moderna vaccine given on 02/05/2021 around 10 AM . Initial headache/nausea/tiredness started on 02/06/2021 and lasted for 3 days. Missed work on 02/08/2021 due to nausea/HA /tiredness. Slight Headache alone for another 4 days- through 02/12/2021. On Saturday (02/13/2021) I started feeling a bit ?off?. I was having trouble remembering things and just in general feeling slow and not right. My husband was concerned, and I was frustrated. He was checking me for TIA symptoms. Sunday I had a mild HA ( 3-4 pain scale) but it did not bother me too much. Monday 02/15/2021 I would not have been able to work if I was scheduled- nausea/HA (level 8) with visual migraine aura. I had to go to bed. I slept for 5 hours. Again today 02/16/2021. I am leaving work early because I have nausea/HA (level 8) with pressure and having trouble focusing. Feels a lot like the migraines I had 20 plus years ago. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.&#34;

                                                On February 8th, 2021 patient came home early from work around noon due to not feeling well. She was feeling tired, slightly nauseous and very low energy. At about 4:50 PM that day, patient got up to walk to the pantry after eating some peanut butter toast. She suddenly stopped and shut her eyes and froze and then she began having a seizure (and she has never had a seizure before and seizures do not run in her family). After the shaking from the seizure ceased, her body tensed up and she fell flat backwards and she hit her head on the refrigerator. She then was going in and out of consciousness, she had a big laceration on her forehead and was bleeding rapidly. I, her daughter, witnessed this and then at 4:54 PM I called emergency services and paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Later that evening, the family was notified that the patient had bleeding in her brain, a concussion, a forehead laceration that received 15 stitches and a broken neck (C2 fracture). She was taken to the hospital that evening on February 8, 2021. Patuent experienced a second seizure while at the hospital during a CT scan. Patient later was able to come home February 11, 2021 in the afternoon. Patient now has to wear a neck brace for up to 12 weeks, cannot drive, cannot work for up to 12 weeks, and is still recovering cognitively from the concussion.

I could not take shower. I turned on all heaters and 3 heat pads in my bed, and I put 4 comforters on top of me, wearing  my down coat in my bed, and tried to sleep. I was afraid to not able to wake up in the morning if I fall into sleep, so I made myself wake up every 15-20 min, to get up and drink hot water. I woke up about 25 times in the whole night to go to the bathroom to pee and flush out medicine, and I kept drinking hot water each time. In the morning, I started to felt better. That is said, I also felt right head a kind of pain , it is around my ears, I say. It lasted about 5 days including today, still felt a little bit, but a lot of better than before.

                                                About 12 minutes after my injection my head and neck started tingling. I alerted the staff at the site. They checked my blood pressure. It was 160/110.  I was taken to lie down on a cot. My blood pressure was checked three more times at the site. The lowest it went was 147/97.  I was allowed to leave so I went home . I was waiting for the tingling head and pounding heart to go away. It stayed so a few days later I went to the emergency room as I thought I was having a heart attack. The paramedics checked my bp and it was still 160/108.  At the emergency room I was given nitroglycerin. After about 6 hours my blood pressure came down to 147/90. I was discharged , prescribed omeprazole,  and told to follow up with cardiologist.  I went to cardiologist. My blood pressure was 164/98 in left arm and 148/102 in right arm. He scheduled tests but gave me no medication.  The next day I still felt really bad so I called  my primary and he prescribed blood pressure pills. They brought my blood pressure back under control.

                                                I started with mild tiredness on Sunday, March 7th and then Monday night I started feeling achy. I tossed and turned throughout the night switching from being warm to cold. Tuesday morning I woke up for work, but was very, very tired. I had mild body aches. The body aches continued to get worse throughout the day on Tuesday. I also started running a mild fever that morning. Most of the day my fever was around 100.3-.5, but I did have one reading of 101.1. I also had insane chills throughout Tuesday. I stayed under a sheet, blanket, bedspread , and electric blanket set to high. I felt too weak to get out of bed and when I did have to go to the restroom, it took every bit of strength I had to get out of bed to handle it.  On Wednesday all of my body aches and chills were gone. I still ran a temp of around 100 throughout the day and I was tired and unable to focus (brain fog). On Thursday, all of the symptoms were gone and I just felt as if I was just beaten with a baseball bat. I spent Thursday basically recuperating from this &#34;beating&#34;. I did have a minor headache late Tuesday, but Tylenol quickly took care of it.

                                                Approximately 1 hr. and 45 minutes after receiving my first dose of the Moderna Vaccine I started to cough as if I was starting the initial phase of asthma. No difficulty breathing nor wheezing just a slight tightness in my bronchioles with the cough. I sat down took a cough drop had my asthma nebulizing treatment at hand if needed and a small oxygen canister , but didn&#39;t need if and symptom subsided about after an hour or so. Later that night at around  10 p.m. I started to get a headache went to bed, but at around 4 a.m. the next morning( now Saturday) the headache was getting worst so I inserted rectally a pediatric acetaminophen suppository. It helped a bit. At around 10 a.m. that morning the headache intensified so I took one Advil 200mg tablet and I felt better. My stomach started to bother me around 3 p.m. the same day so I took a Prilosec OTC tablet. The next morning Sunday I had a bit of a loomy headache so I took a Tylenol tablet first, it didn&#39;t help so about 2 hours after I took an Advil 200mg tablet, but it just helped slightly. At around 4:30 to 4:45pm on that Sunday I felt a strong pressure in the center of my chest, almost as if there was something blocking my airway and heart a bit. I went home and had a feeling of something traveling from my chest to my neck and head and a throbbing pain in my head. I took a shower and headed to the ER. I also had tingling and some numbness in my are and leg and face. by 2 a.m. the next morning I was discharged. The EKG was normal, no sign of heart attack nor stroke. I have a really bad headache still, some swelling under my left armpit and a low grade fever.

                                                Day of vaccine: waiting a few hours, I started feeling aches and pains, with bad pain at the injection site. By 10 PM, I had a low fever (100) and felt exhausted and weak. Tossed and turned all night, waking up chattering with cold, then burning hot. The next morning, I had a temperature of 101, where it  hovered throughout the day, going up to 101.7 at the highest measured. The whole day I was completely wiped out with worsened aches and pains, and now also stiffness, especially in my neck (where I do have issues) and in my back (where I do not have issues). All I could really do is sleep all day. On the recommendation of my doctor&#39;s office, I took Aleve. That night I slept much better, and woke up with a lower fever (100). I am continuing to feel better.

I told the nurses I didn&#39;t feel right, and I sat down for about 10 minutes and drank 3 glasses of water.  Initially I felt better, but then I felt weak and &#34;not right&#34;,  so I lay down on a cot for approximately 40 minutes.  My B/P was elevated (165/95), which is very high for me.  I did not have any trouble breathing.  I continued to drink water, and eventually my B/P lowered, and I felt better.  I took an antihistamine (10 mg Zyrtec) when I arrived home at 11:00 AM, and felt very tired until about 3:30 PM,  when I felt just about back to normal.  I was assessed by an ER physician at the clinic site.

I had fever, headache, chills, muscle and joint pain, extreme fatigue and slept for hours all day Saturday, Sunday into Monday, which I called off work. I felt as if I had the virus all over again , except this time it felt much worse. I am worried to get the second vaccine as it states it is worse than the first. Would like and appreciate any feedback on this.

                                                First shot of Moderna vaccine.  Had the shot and waited around 35 minutes and I felt fine.  I left and was a few minutes down the street and my lips started going numb. I turned around and went back to the hospital where the shot was administered and they had me see the emergency room doctor.  My throat did not start closing, my lips just were numb.  I have had serious reactions before and they start with the lips usually so I was concerned.  My blood pressure was high as well as my pulse.  The doctor gave me prednisone and benadryl and I was feeling good after 15 minutes.  I was in the ER 45 minutes to an hour and then was released with a script to take prednisone and benadryl for the next 4 days.and to come back if I got worse.  I never got a rash or anything else, just the numb lips and increase in blood pressure.  I did have a bit of a headache as well.  I am at work now (the next day) and feeling fine.  I did speak to my doctor and she did advise me not to get the second shot in the vaccine series. .

                                                I had underlying body inflammation prior to getting vaccine, but otherwise no illnesses or issues.  Two days after vaccine I came down with a UTI.  Another 3 days after that my body went into an acute inflammatory response.  I had extremely pronounced pinkeye (first time ever) followed by acute gout flare-up (first time ever) followed by extreme edema in lower extremities (first time ever).  I&#39;m being treated with steroids, but these issues have yet to resolve.  I have not been able to work since Jan 4.  I can only stand for a few minutes and walk a short distance with the aid of crutches.  In all of my life, I have never had pinkeye or gout or edema, or a UTI for that matter.  I am a healthcare worker and I&#39;m needed back at my job asap.

Increased pain through the night and in morning of 1/6/21 only able to raise arm to 30 degrees with significant pain and had to help with my right arm to raise the left and to dress myself. The pain woke me up at night. I could not go to work for 3 days because of limited active movement to 45 degrees and significant pain and weakness. I am  taking 600-800mg Advil every 6 hours, icing and performing range of motion and massage and kinesiotaping my shoulder. 1/11/21 to present, pain has decreased but soreness still present with internal rotation of my arm and muscle weakness in shoulder muscles and occasionally discomfort with arm positioning at night wakes me up still.

                                                Beginning at midnight the night of my vaccine I began to shiver uncontrollably. I took 2  Tylenol and was able to sleep for a few hours. I awoke around 6 am with severe body aches, shivering, severe fatigue, upset stomach and extremely disoriented. This lasted for the next 30 hours. I continued to take Tylenol as needed for headaches and body aches. Eventually, the body aches subsided, but the head aches and sense of confusion and disorientation lasted for 2 more days. It has been 4 days since the vaccine and I still am experiencing what I would call a brain fog. It?s very scary and concerning to me.

                                                Two hours post vaccination:  tongue heaviness followed by metallic taste sensation, vomited once after this.  Four hours post vaccination:  nausea, bilateral forearm pain evolving to all over body aches and muscle cramping along with a pulsating headache.  Spiked a fever of 102 F that I treated with 500 mg of Tylenol.  Later took ibuprofen for body aches.  Had frequent urination along with unexplained crying.  The lowest the fever would measure for the next 24 hours was 100 F.  I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen as directed on a regular basis.  On Thursday 1/21/2021 at 5:55 pm, I woke up drenched in sweat.  I felt weak yet improved.  Headache and back pain were less.  Showered and moved to the couch in living room attempting to watch TV.  Could not stay awake.  Woke up three hours later again drenched in sweat.  Showered and went to bed.  Slept through the night and woke up at 8 am with body aches, muscle cramping and nausea gone.  Night gown and sheets were damp with sweat. Lingering symptoms:  Skin from lips and inside my mouth appears to be sloughing off.  There are very tiny cuts on my bottom lip.  Left with mild headache I attribute to dehydration.  No longer nauseous although I have no appetite.

Arm progressively got worse. Took Tylenol and headache improved.  Went to bed abut 10:30 pm was doing ok except for arm pain.  Woke up at 2:40 AM with the chills (shaking really bad and very cold) got another comforter and went back to sleep woke up about 4:15 am  a little better but just kind of sore all over.  Laid in bed but couldn&#39;t sleep, got up and tried to log on about 8:45am for work.  Felt completely drained and couldn&#39;t concentrate, took PTO.  Took more tylenol and went back to bed, fell asleep about 11:00 am and slept until 2:00 PM.  Felt much better when I got up just still kind of drained.  By 8:00 PM that night (wednesday the 27th) my arm didn&#39;t hurt any more and I was basically back to normally.  Have had a mild sore throat off and on since then but really nothing more than an irritation.

                                                Patient felt unwell and had a fever on Wednesday (1/27) and went home early from work. On Thursday morning (1/28), she threw up once and then laid down to rest. Her son reported seeing her that morning with the episode of emesis prior to her getting on the couch. Son reports that when he came home at 5pm, she was asleep on the couch. Teenage daughter reports patient had been asleep on couch all day. Son tried to wake patient up and she was disoriented and lethargic.  Daughter (reporter) was contacted to come see patient and on arrival to house (5;45pm), noted patient was confused, lethargic, febrile (104), and hypoxic at 83% on room air with portable pulse oximeter. Patient was able to stand and ambulate to car with assistance and was driven to Emergency Department for evaluation.   At emergency department, patient was hypotensive 80/40s but was able to increase blood pressure with 3 L of normal saline to blood pressure of 90/50s. See all tests performed and results below.  Patient received antibiotics, anti-virals and tylenol for fever of 102.7 while in emergency department. She was admitted to ICU that evening at approximately 11pm and had a foley catheter placed overnight due to decreased urine output. patient continued to have low blood pressure through morning of 1/28 and was placed on levophed for blood pressure control at approx 10 am. Her blood pressures continued to improve through afternoon and levophed was titrated down and then discontinued around 4pm.  She continued to received antibiotics for 24 hours after initiation and continued acyclovir during course of hospitalization and is still receiving doses on 2/2. Patient&#39;s initial mental status was confused, lethargic, and unable to communicate. She was intermittently oriented to herself only and would not follow commands. She would localize painful stimuli. Her mental status began to improve on Saturday when she started to become more awake but was still unable to follow commands or communicate clearly. She was moved from ICU to IMCU (step down unit) on Saturday once mental status was improving and blood pressure was stabilized. Her mental status continued to improve from Saturday 1/ 30 to Tuesday 2/2 (current). She began to have diarrhea on Saturday afternoon that continued through Monday and occurred every 1-2 hours. She was unable to stand or move body on her own and had to be assisted by staff to be cleaned. She remained awake and alert and was able to get up and walk on Monday and began to eat. She continued acyclovir treatment pending HSV meningitis panel PCR results (still pending currently 2/2). Mental status not currently at baseline but continuing to improve. She is also still experiencing generalized weakness. Hospitalist team and infectious disease doctors report she should be discharged tomorrow (2/3).  No source for confusion and hypotension has been found at this time. Physician team think HSV is unlikely but awaiting final diagnosis until test is resulted.

                                                I awoke at 2 am and got up to go to the bathroom.  I was extremely, severely weak, rapid heart beat, could hardly stand- had to support myself by leaning over sink and hanging onto walls to get back to bed.   I felt some dizziness and had slight nauseau but did not vomit.  I could not stand.  I had to get back to lay down.  Felt like my pulse and blood pressure was all over the place.  I normally have low blood pressure.  I thought I was going to pass out.  I was very shaky and felt terrible.    Felt completely debilitated.  When I laid back down and rest, things calmed back down.  I did take more ibuprofen. Arm is sore but expected that.   When I got up this morning i was still very weak feeling but somewhat better.   I have just been taking it easy.  Have little dizziness, but not debilitating like it was in the middle of the night.  did take some tylenol this morning for arm soreness.

At approx. 3am on 2/16/21 - 12 hrs after shot, I was sleeping and awoke to chills, the coldest I&#39;ve been, and extremely thirsty.  I got up to put more clothes on and some sips of water and returned to bed.  The chills lasted for approx. 5 hours, and subsided.  I awoke at 11am, feeling dehydrated, weak, and like my body had been through the washing machine! It is now noon on 2/16/21 as I type this report, and I will be returning to bed for the day. I hope my immune system settles down so I can work tomorrow.

                                                Right after vaccine I felt tingly in neck and started sweating and then I was shaking and slumped forward in chair, at this point I didn&#39;t know where I was (thought I was dreaming) couldn&#39;t see or hear but felt my arms moving. Then I could see and hear and sat upright realizing where I was. I felt nauseous and strange and continued to be very clammy. I was given cranberry juice and watched for 30 mins. Felt much better. Husband drove me home and took my blood pressure which was first 70/50 did again 76/52.  I layer down and retook about an hour later 89/59.  no more adverse effects other than sore arm. Today Feb 25th feel fine, little tired, sore arm.

Patient also takes Tylenol and intermittent Motrin - does not seem to help. I advised the patient to return to PCP for further clinical evaluation. Patient stated she is unable to work since 2/17/2021

I had dizziness that caused me to feel light headed and have a &#34;weird&#34; feeling with my vision.  It caused me to sit down and wait about 5 minutes for it to pass.  I have a service dog that is sensitive to medical conditions and he came and sat very close to me for 30 minutes (unusual in my home) while this occurred.   Then it passed.

Body aches all over (most likely the shot caused a flare to my ostearthritis). Stomach ache, vomiting, chills,  runny nose and fever. Symptoms similar to the flu. Started Wednesday evening after shot received and got worse over the next few days.  Went to bed early during the week after work. Was totally exhausted. Was in bed all day Saturday, Sunday and had to take off work on Monday. Seem to be feeling a little better this evening. Fever broke; sweated on and off all day.

                                                11:00pm when I was asleep I awoke to horrible shaking, chill and could not get warm. I do not know if I was delirious but when I got up for the extra blankets, I could hardly walk. I then got the electronic thermometer, and it read that my body temp was 80  and my surface temp was 101.1.  I took a horse size Tylenol.  Did not sleep much, when I woke up I had this horrible headache and a fever of 100.  Sleep all day on Sunday, Feb28.  Still feverish and very fatigued.   Monday March 1, still, achy and foggy feeling and took a nap mid day.

                                                About 30 to 45 min after my first shot of the COVID vaccine, I did not feel well.  Thinking I would feel better when I got home,  I left.    I did not say anything to the pharmacist.  Within two hours after the shot, I was confused (reality and what wasn&#39;t, had anxiety, rapid heart rate).   I have never had any of these before in my life.   I took two Benadryl and laid down  and  started feeling better about an hour or two later.  The next 4  days  I was extremely nauseous.  A week after the shot I am having the same feeling in my legs as I got a week after I got the TDAP in  2017.  Weak painful legs with a gurgling sensation in my veins due to inflammation.  In 2017, I was tested and my ANA was high.  I have not ever had this problem in my life except after the TDAP in 2017 and the COVID vaccine in 2021.

                                                First 24 hours I experienced soreness which I expected - where I received the shot.  It seemed like the soreness was getting better, but then during the second night, it turned into excruciating pain. I had bursitis after shoulder surgery in 2018 on my other arm - and this pain was very similar.  I experienced 10 out of 10 pain for 2 weeks after getting the shot. During this time, I could not sleep well...and developed a frozen shoulder. I did not want to take any paid meds initially because I was afraid it would reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. I began taking pain meds on the Thursday after getting my shot (4 days after) because I could not take the pain anymore. After taking Advil, Tylenol and icing my arm for 2 weeks it began to feel somewhat better. Week 3 was more of a soreness. It&#39;s now week 4 and I am trying to move my arm to increase mobility. It is still stiff and I cannot sleep on that arm.

They worsen when my fever goes up, but are continuing to happen even when my temp is a 98.0. I have missed work the past few days &amp; feel overall much better from my sinus infection, but I assumed these tremors would go away when my fever went away. I have difficulty writing &amp; poor fine motor control at this time. I have not contacted my MD because I know what these tremors are.

Friday today - I  am taking 4000 milligrams of Tylenol per day and it is helping.  I am much better today.   I hope I will be all better tomorrow.

                                                The day of the shot within 5 minutes. I felt hot and flushed. The nurse gave me the juice and I started sweating. I was unaware of what was going on and I had trouble breathing. The next thing I remember is being on a cart and they gave me the EpiPen in the left leg. My lips and right side of my face was swollen. I began to get numb again after a while so they had to give me another EpiPen in the right leg. I was taken to the ER for 4 hours I received some allergy medicine which I took for 4 days because my lips were still swelling. I had a facial recently and had a reaction again. My system is still on alert and I carry an EpiPen.

When I woke up on Tuesday, after receiving the shot on Monday, I had diarrhea which reminded me of having covid. 3.  I was weak or exhausted until today (Friday) after receiving the shot on Monday.  I am scheduled to receive my second shot and I will do it, but I am apprehensive about it.

Not enough information is available about affects of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on underlying mental health conditions, so am reporting in hopes others can find help and validation if they experience the same kind of acute amplification of mental health symptoms.  Patient had to seek professional mental health care and was unable to perform complex intellectual tasks--had to cancel an important legal meeting due to impairment.  This is not typical for patient, became acute following 1st vaccine of Moderna.

                                                One day after vaccine my eye felt slightly irritated. The next day I felt a little swelling in the corner of my left eye on the same side of vaccine. It became visible as an irritation on the outside corner of my eye. It was very painful and my lower eyelid was swollen. I was trying to massage but the pain seemed to be internal. There was a large red pimple like lesion inside my eyelid. I went to an eye doctor and was diagnosed with an internal sty on my eye. I have never had a Sty before. I was prescribed an antibiotic and it not not resolve so I was prescribed a antibiotic cream which helped. The lesion burst by then. I took two to three weeks to resolve. I since also received the second dose. I had a very strong immune response to the second dose. Chills, headaches and all over body ache. I was unable to work for two days. I was bed ridden for two days. My Asthma seemed very reactive during that time. My Asthma seemed worse for a few weeks and it is still a little worse than normal.

                                                One week later (on a Wednesday morning after receiving the vaccine the previous Wednesday afternoon) I had the onset of a headache, body aches, chills and extreme fatigue making it impossible to work. Slept most of the day.  Next couple days with less severe symptoms and mostly resolved this morning (Saturday) aside from some fatigue.  ALSO the site of the injection became red, tender, warm, swollen and slightly itchy with the onset of these symptoms after a milder injection reaction had resolved for several days.  This  makes me question if this is a late reaction to the vaccine and hence reportable as I have not read about this possibility

On the next day more dizziness and elevated blood pressure I was unable to finish my shift. Called employee health they documented I told them how high my blood pressure was their advice was see my PCP or go to the nearest emergency room. I called my PCP she had me to increase my amlodipine to 10 mg and fluids followed by rest and to monitor my blood pressure.

I called out sick and had to use a vacation day because still had headache, fogginess, and temp of 98.8.  At 3pm I started to have a lower back ache that went in to my mid back.  I was tired.  Then on Tuesday, 01/12/2021 I started with diarrhea at 11AM.  I called work and explained that it was a side effect of the Covid vaccine.  They still would not let me go to work even though I was covid negative.  I took 2 Imodium tablets. I will email you tomorrow, 1/13/2021 and continue to monitor.  Yes I am a RN.

                                                On 12/31 finished having dinner. Thought sudden slight shortness of breath may be do to appetizer type foods we had. Drank water to help subside it with little effect. Went outside into cold air. Still had some slight shortness of breath. At 8PM continued to my other daughters home( where I&#39;ve been going since pandemic) upon sitting there still felt slight shortness of breath but again manageable. We left at 11:30 as my breathing never really got better or worse. When I arrived home I Took my PROAIR-HFA inhaler that I use PRN. My symptoms resolved and went to bed. On Friday 1/1 I had again slight shortness of breath with no real excertion.  On 1/2 I went to work at Hospital in neurology dept. I was pushing collector up to SICU unit and then to M2 unit. On arrival to M2 I felt very winded and took my inhaler with results.  I then called my manager to make him aware that I was having dilemma do to fact that I didn&#39;t want to call Covid hot line as I felt symptoms were from vaccine not Covid!  I was put out of work by Covid hot line had test on 1/4 and negative results on 1/6. My symptoms seemed to subside on 1/6. I returned to work on 1/9 and am pushing collectors and patients with no symptoms

                                                Unable to make out the Lot number due to illegible.  The pain in my right arm and around the back of my head and neck increased all day on Saturday, latter that night the pain woke me out of my sleep, and as I attempted to go to the restroom, I passed out.  I woke up on the floor where I had passed out face down, with a busted bloody lip and bruises and broken skin on both knees.  Very frightening, Thank God that I woke up because I live alone.   Thank you.

Felt like a ragdoll. Kept staring into space slow to answer the questions. Her phone rang and she started petting the phone. Couldn&#39;t remember the passcode to get in the phone. Wanted to drive home but the ER would not allow it. Had a red patch on the arm and it was hard. Muscles on both arms hurt all the way down to the forearm.

Anaphylaxis is often referred to as slow roll and without the typical face swelling and rash. It is more subtle and can be harder to detect.  And that was my experience: as follows: I became faint and briefly passed out within 2 minutes of injection. I stabilized quickly within a 30 minute hold although developed increasing nausea, I and med tech was satisfied that it might just be my dysautanomia. I spent the evening with severe headache vomiting as passed out again. I experienced throat tightening but not full closure. The next day I had flue like symptoms that I assume were normaland vaccine related. When this passed in the evening I again suffered nausea and dizziness, vomiting and throat tightening when I tried to eat.  These symptoms were not similar to the flush feelings earlier in the day. The symptoms ebbed and waned for 2 days with increased frequency as I took chromalyn , Benadryl with some effect at first and ate with great care as not to introduce more allergens.  I had increased chest pain,  sweating, fainting, throat tightening became severe Benadryl was not effective. I was having trouble swallowing. I was forced to us an epi pen and call 911. This  is a typical anaphylactic response for EDS&lt; Mast Cell patients. It became clear that I could not get past this on my own and the symptoms were increasing. I started to shake with chills and feared shock as my chest pains increased. The epi pen injection and hospital visit via ambulance occurred Monday 1/25-1/26. I became very faint during the Ems intake with the techs having to hold me up to check vitals etc.. My HR dropped despite the EPi. At the ER I was given IV steroids,  IV Benedryl and Potassium,  tablets and fluids throughout the night, admitted for evaluation.

                                                1st dose December 23, 2020.  Arm pain, swelling, raised red 3 inch bump developed within 12 hours.  Subsided, and reoccurred about 10 days post vaccine.  10-14 days post vaccine I developed New onset forefoot weakness (foot drop) Right, new onset trigger finger Right middle finger, new onset bladder spasms with immediacy and incontinence - not bladder volume dependent, resurgence of body aches, new bilateral knee pain requiring two arm support for sit to stand,  Mental status changes including anxiety, paranoia, mania and depression (personality change!), motion induced nausea and dizziness, visual changes (blurry vision), New intensification of nocturnal muscles spasms - bilateral and progressive and intermittent headache up the Right neck to crown, New onset (01/14/21 - present) burning rubber scent when some food being cooked.  The muscle and joint pain were present with February illness, subsided by April, and came back with a vengeance within two weeks of the 1st injection.  I also lost three teeth (fracture vertically while flossing), thinned hair, and had intermittent dizziness during the initial illness in February.   February Initial loss of taste/smell included metallic taste with artificial flavors, rotten garbage - random, and ?iron taste with meats.  I can now taste some fruits but only get bitterness with other fruits and vegetables.  I had one sided facial paralysis after tooth extractions in September - resolved in 1 week.  I required dental implants to replace the fractured teeth.  I am a vaccinator, and have been administering our vaccines and swabbing for Covid testing since we reopened elective procedures.  I strongly encourage our staff to get the vaccines - and I am the one who gets the reaction.  The constellation of symptoms, temporal proximity to the vaccine with no intervening illness or injury, and commonality of some symptoms with my February illness have prompted further testing and evaluation for central nervous system insult.

The lump is shaped approx like an egg after 12 hours (not the thicknesss of an egg). I feel a strange sensation like I do with allergies and had  a slight headache off and on though the day.

During the night, early 01/28/2021, I got up and had horrible cold chills that actually hurt.  I have never felt anything like this terrible feeling.  I took Ibuprofen and drank lots of water and returned to bed.  I was drenched with sweat when I awoke for the day.  I felt fair the 28th when I went to work and by that afternoon, my temperature raised a degree up to 100.3 with feelings of general malaise.  I continued to take Ibuprofen.  I took Ibuprofen during the night on the 29th and again had broke a fever; the neck of my pajamas were soaked.  My left deltoid is still very painful as of the 29th as I type this.  Swollen, hard with red area in the center.

Later in the day, late evening I could barely lift the arm that had received the injection; I also developed severe headache, fever (T max 101.9), sever body aches and chills/sweats.  I was nearly unable to get out of bed the following day, called out from work due to symptoms.  Nearly 48 hours later, still not feeling well, went to work but left early due to symptoms.  By Friday, 2/5 I was much improved.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after injection, I woke up during the night and had a weird feeling like restless leg syndrome and felt nauseous.  I got up to go to the bathroom and passed out.  My husband helped me to the bed and got me some orange juice.  I then experienced extreme uncontrollable shaking for about 10 minutes.   The next day, I had a sore arm where the vaccine was administered.  I have only had one flu vaccine in my whole life.  I am not allergic to anything that I know about.  I have had problems with passing out and have been diagnosed with vasovagal syncope.   However, I have not passed out in over 10 years.

It felt like a flu-shot and  I had mild fatigue, soreness of my arm and my sleep was not deep for 2 nights. After that, I was feeling fine.  However, 10 days after the vaccination, I had like a weld type of rash of 2.5 inches in diameter on the injection site.. It was warm and little itchy when touched. Following, some rashes formed in my left inner thigh and small rash on my chest. It took 3-5 days before the rashes went away. The rashes on the thigh were scattered and fine, and they were not  painful and neither was my injection site.  Putting cold compress on the injection site helped tremendously and staying away from hot shower helped the rashes stayed at bay.

At 3:30 in the morning of Wednesday, I was awoken by a feeling of a substance moving through my lymph nodes and a feeling of severe foreboding. This lasted 20 minutes. I didn&#39;t have any other symptoms. The next day I felt chills and a slight temp and lots of achiness. By that evening (Wed) I had a severe headache. I missed half the work day. The severe headache continue all the way till Friday evening and I missed two more days of work. I felt very nauseas and almost went to the ER. I do get migraines but it has been awhile. It was fairly severe and I just avoided the ER. My arm swelled up on Wednesday and was very swollen and red along with my lymph nodes. The migraine ended on Friday of that week but it has taken me the whole month to feel okay. I have continued to feel woozy and feel headachy sometimes. Just now feeling like myself.

                                                9 hrs after second dose, around 7pm on 2/1, the skin on my back began hurting. Within an hour, i had severe joint pain in my hips and my backbone hurt up into my neck.  For the next 10-11 hours every inch of my body was in severe pain. It was excruciating. My bones felt fractured. I could barely walk to the bathroom. I couldnt push myself upright in bed to take tylenol. My husband had to pull me up and hold the glass of water for me to drink. I ran a high fever for several hours, around 101, and I truly thought i might die. By 9 am the following day, 2/2,  i began to feel better. I could walk slowly without much difficulty and fever was gone. The next day, 2/3, i went back to work but still had hip pain and neck pain. That day around 4 pm, all side effects were completely gone and I had alot of energy. I do have pain on left side of my head periodically but it isnt bad.

                                                I woke from a full deep sleep with stomach nausea that lasted through to the early morning. I spent the day extremely lethargic on the couch with no energy for even low-level activity.  I fell asleep early in the evening, but then woke up around 2 am and could not fall back to sleep so despite feeling 80% better the next day, I was still tired.     Also, I had the tell-tale sore arm.  Obviously, the protection of the Moderna Covid vaccine far outweighs any passing discomfort or lack of sleep and I would absolutely do it again!

I wear a FitBit and my pulse was ranging 120-150 on a SLOW walk inside the store.  I rested against a display, got what I needed, drove 10 miles home. My b/p was up because I also got a headache, and the ANXIETY and nausea I experienced was outrageous. My pulse raced throughout the rest of the afternoon into evening, I laid down in bed and rested quietly. Seems like I feel okay today, the anxiety and racing pulse are gone for good. Arm is hot, swollen, red at injection site, could not lie on my left side during the night.

Bathed, morning chores then onto an 8:45 pre-trial meeting and feeling off, lethargic all morning, I kept hydrating.  Interacting with others via internet was too taxing and the crash began.  Meeting ended about 9:10 I went back to bed and that is when I began to vomit.  From then until about 5 p.m. I had non-stop nausea, vomiting, coughing, sweats and chills.  Today I am still feeling the dehydration and lethargy still.  Did some work but not near a full day, which after yesterday I REALLY NEED TO DO.  Much to catch up, glad i only had one curt appearance.  I was given Moderna.  Friend of mine who I was in contact with during this time told me of this service and encouraged me to report.

                                                By evening of vaccination on Feb 12 2021, I could barely lift arm without pain, I needed to use other hand to assist lifting arm from lap to armrest of chair.  Pain was down length of arm. Different than 1st covid vaccine in Left arm, when only injection site and surrounding area was sore as common with vaccines.  Pain continued and increased throughout next days.  Other vaccine effects were as expected (slight chills, nausea, general aches and fatigue..........all resolved by 3rd day)  Arm pain has continued to hurt with pain and weakness similar to rotator cuff injury with pain reaching behind neck, only able to do full range of motion with pain and assist of other arm. This impacted simple self care tasks, grocery shopping, home management tasks. Luckily I am currently not working at usual job of  Occupational Therapist where I would have needed to lift patients, train in exercise and locomotion, maneuver wheelchairs etc. Symptoms are resolving slowly, but as an example it is still painful to lift a gallon of milk from the refrigerator.   I start each day with active assist range of motion though uncomfortable in order to avoid a frozen shoulder, and have used heat pad. My health practitioner today suggested I start using NSAID cream as well.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like a truck had rolled over me.  Every muscle in my body was in pain from my neck to my toes.  I normally have some muscle pain each day but this was unbearable.  I had to stay in bed for 4 days because of the pain.  During that time I took Ibuprofen which did not work.  On the 5th day my Dr. told me to take a pain pill so I started taking Tramadol.  That made the pain go away but also put me into a fog.  On the 7th day I went to see my Dr.  She then put me on Prednisone for 4 days.  I am still hurting on this the 8th day.  My chest and rib muscles are hurting, my middle and lower back along with my hips, thighs, calves and ankles.  I also have swollen ankles and my orthostatic hypotension has gotten worse.

At 1730 I suddenly felt clear headed and coherent. Duration of symptoms was 49 hrs. The sudden clarity and no longer dizzy was interesting and unexpected and noticeable.  The symptoms were fast onset and sudden termination.  Only a mild headache for an additional 24hrs.

After about 2 minutes I began to drive away.  I then became to dizzy, I had to pull into the lot of a vacant store.  I was incapacitated with dizziness!  I notified my two daughters in case something worse happened.  The dizziness was so extreme.  Vertigo.  I laid my car seat back and opened my car windows and did some deep breathing.  Still too dizzy to drive back to the vaccination site.  I then ate a granola bar, hoping it might help.  It did.  After about 15 minutes the dizziness subsided and I was able to drive away.  It was quite severe and scary at the time.

                                                On or about 09:40-09:45 I felt a heaviness on the left side of my tongue and a general unwellness feeling, the heaviness persisted  and then as then somewhat of a continued presence that did not go away, later followed by a metallic taste in my mouth.  As I previously had a reaction to the first H1N1 vaccine years ago, I notified the person administering the vaccine before hand and also the nurse after the vaccine who was making her rounds.  I called her over to left her know I felt a little off/different, and described what I was feeling.  She escorted me to a private area where I was further assessed and given Benadryl 25mg po x 2.  The feeling never left my tongue and reportedly there was notation of questionable welts on the left side of my tongue. .I was able to speak clearly and swallow.  I was monitored and then discharged in the company of two of my colleagues (one an ICU nurse who works with me, and the other an ICU MD/anesthesiologist) who happened to be getting their vaccinations at the same time.  The tongue feeling did not leave me until late the next day and my lips felt a little off that night of the vaccine and the next day.  I continued to take the Tylenol and allegra as well as Benadryl.  By Friday night(1/8) I was feeling better, enough to work the weekend. Tylenol helped greatly for pain at injection site.  Today (1/12) I&#39;m feeling not my best and  tired like yesterday but I had a busy weekend at work (RN in the COVID ICU), some malaise and achy (maybe my fibromyalgia or the weather), minor headache and fatigued, had a minor sore throat this am that has resolved, and Tylenol has resolved the headache.  Not sure if this needed to be included but I thought I&#39;d mention it.

                                                Monday evening - Extreme pain in the arm where the injection was given. Swollen (like a baseball) and very red. I realize it would be sore; however, the pain radiated down the arm to the hand and upwards into my neck. A fever of 100 so I took tylenol.  Headache throughout the night and by morning my whole body hurt to the point I could not get out of bed.  Tuesday - I got up to go to the bathroom with help and lost consciousness. When checked at that time, I had a fever of 102, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms took place all day. I continued taking Tylenol for the pain. Not much sleep due to pain.  Wednesday - Some of the pain in the arm subsided; however, the spine pain was extreme. I struggled walking the pain severe. Throughout the day I was feeling a little better. Thursday - still body pain but tolerable.

Next morning a red rash showed up about 2 &#34; x 3 &#34; oval shape. Minor pain and itching continues.  Thinking back Thursday night, January 21, I was woke up with a tremendous headache. I took Tylenol and 2 sudafed thinking it may be allergies. The pain subsided enough for me to go back to sleep. The headache as been on and off since, but not as bad as Thursday night.

After 20 min or longer the symptoms begin to dissipate. 1st event 1/8/21 in the evening. The following week another episode while driving home from work. During work 1/21/21 another episode took place and EKG done with negative result. That same evening during sleep another episode woke me up, although it was not as bad as the other ones and 20 minutes later i was able to go back to sleep.  As of today 1/25/20 no other episodes. I do take Famotidine daily and have been for several years due to acid reflux and heartburn, but never have I experienced chest pain.

It seems that I had a ?flare? or worsening in condition following the injection.  Arm hurt where vaccine given is also but that happens with most all vaccines.  That was not the reason I am writing this up.  Writing it up to the the inflamed state I was in.

                                                After receiving the injection I experienced slight soreness at the injection site, which was expected.  later that evening I experienced swelling in the left axilla lymph nodes. The swelling in that area was extreme on 01/20/2021 throughout the night and has continued until day of reporting on 01/27/2021. The pain and swelling involved the entire underarm and pain could be felt deep in the tissue. On pain scale of 1-10 with 10 as extreme, I would rate pain as a 9 on days 1-5. Pain has gradually diminished in severity on subsequent days and is a 2 today. Measures to reduce the pain included elevation of arm and shoulder during the night, discontinuation of deodorant during period of discomfort and application of warm and cold compresses to decrease pain and swelling.  Initially contemplated seeking emergency room evaluation and treatment for evaluation , but decided against because there is no way to remove the vaccine and treatment would probably include measures already implemented.

                                                Within 5 minutes I started feeling &#39;not quite right&#39;. I had a strange metallic taste and itchiness on the back of my tongue. I tried to meditate for my 15 minutes. When I got up I felt very stressed, nauseous, foggy. I waited another 10 minutes in the hall. I felt more nauseated and went back to holding area. The nurse had me lay down. My blood pressure was around 145/100 and is usually around 100/68. My pulse was between 44-60 which is typical form me. I felt very very cold and was shivering. My hands and feet were like ice. I typically have good circulation. I rested another 30 minutes or so and went home. It took hours to warm up. The next few days were more of what I had expected: flu like symptoms, chills, tiredness, malaise, fatigue, sore arm.

Later iin evening, I felt something a lot like a hot flash, I felt my face flusing, followed by hives on my chest and abdoman.  The left deltoid muscle started to itch incessantly, and the deltoid muscle began to swell.  A hard nodule at the injection site formed, initially the size of an m&amp;m.   It grew to the size of a golf ball, then to the size of a tennis ball over the next two days.  It resolved on it&#39;s own over the next week.

I THOUGHT I was having a blood sugar issue, but that was not the case.  I went to sleep for about two hours, then woke up about 9pm feeling a little better.  I had NO pain in my arm or anywhere else and slept the entire night.    Friday (1/22), I developed pain and swelling in my breast, armpit, and injection site.  I literally  felt crappy all weekend.  Weird...????  I was confused this happened about ONE WEEK AFTER the vaccine. The injection site was the size of a golf ball, hard, and  quite warm.  I began to feel better after about 3 days, but the arm was still slightly red, sore, and there&#39;s a slight bump.

It lasted all that day and into the next especially when walking and talking. My chest felt tight. I took my inhaler yesterday and this morning and am fine now. I didn?t want Togo to the doctor and make a big deal of it.

I live across the street from the store and went home to sleep instead of back to work. The tingling subsided after resting, but  still feeling  a bit dizzy/off a day later.

                                                The day after I had my vaccine I was very drained and had a headache.  This was to be expected.  On the second day after I slept 14 hours.   On the third day I woke up at noon and noticed that the right side of my lower cheek just above the jawline was markedly swollen, as well as half of my lower lip. There was no pain; the skin felt a bit numb, but it did itch at times, though not very intensely.  During the night of the third day, my full bottom lip swelled, and cracked open and oozed a clear liquid the thickness of water, though not a lot of it.  The whole lip looked as if it were a water balloon encased in a thin layer of skin.  Also this day I had a mild sore throat, but no other symptoms.   On the fourth day when I awoke, the swelling was all across the lower portion of my face, but was notably worse on the left side.  It looked like a golf ball was in my cheek.  Also the left side of my lips were so swollen I couldn&#39;t close my teeth.   In the afternoon, as I was eating biscuits my upper lip swelled enormously.   At this point it was hard to drink liquids as I couldn&#39;t make a seal as my lower lip was swollen unevenly. On the fifth day (today) I awoke with my upper lip extremely swollen.  My lower cheeks were still swollen, but not grotesquely so.  I had a tepid cup of coffee and when I finished my upper lip was no longer swollen!  My cheeks remain mildly swollen.  I didn&#39;t go into work today as the upper lip was so horrid, I couldn&#39;t be seen, but I will return to work tomorrow.   I should add that I tried EVERY conceivable home treatment for this: hot and cold compresses, ibuprofen, gargling salt, benadryl, hydrocortisone cream...nothing had ANY effect.

Pain was deep in bones(all bones)@ intensity 7-10 for 4 days. Unable to sit or stand d/t pain. For 1st 2 days bone pain accompanied by shooting pulsations. Day 5 is today and most bone aches improved except for sacral bones and iliac crests. This pain is still 4-5 and increase to 7 with wrong movement or sitting. I am a nurse so if this sounds too medical that is why. Have a call to my FNP for possible appointment waiting to hear back.

Pt was monitored for vaccine reaction with no known adverse reaction. Approximately  18 hours post-vaccine, she was found deceased in her sleep at 0540 on 2/20/21. Per circumstances/pt history, it is presumed that the patient aspirated while sleeping, perhaps secondary to a seizure. Coroner was notified and declined as coroner&#39;s case. VAERS notification being made due to pt death within 24 hours of receiving a vaccine.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot, I did get a fine rash and began to itch, but this time was not as bad because I had taken the 50 mg of Benadryl two hours prior to taking the shot, after the shot I began tylenol,  because I was already aching and my arm hurt and was swollen and this time had a big red rash and knot., took Zofran because I was already getting nauseous.  Went home, laid down,  late afternoon, checked blood pressure, 2-21-21 110-74 heart rate 90, I was beginning to feel bad, was very tired, so went to bed woke up around 2:00 a.m. with severe headache, hurting head to toe, rash, head to toe, very nauseous, took tylenol, was unable to get Zofran, so woke my husband up he got the Zofran and also got the Blood pressure machine to check my blood pressure, it was (2 a.m.) 128-103 heart rate 75.  I was unable to go anywhere, was freezing to death, so wrapped up and finally fell back to sleep, woke up the next morning blood pressure was 2-22-21 108-78 hr 64, that night 119-72 hr 86, 2-23-21 108-78 hr 69, that night 135-85 hr 75, 2-24-21 120-73 hr 64 that night 133-80-78, 2-25-21 117-73 hr 72,/  blood pressure and heart rate have settled down, and the rash is gone, I still feel tired and arm is just a little sore, no longer having the shooting pains down my arm and out my fingers.  Have stopped tylenol and zofran, none yesterday nor today.  Feel pretty good today and the cold like symptoms are better.

                                                I received my vaccination on Friday, February 19th.  On Sunday, February 21st, my tongue felt like I had scalded it with a hot drink, and my taste buds were very sensitive.  My tongue also felt thick and there were bumps on the sides of it.  On Tuesday, February 23rd, I noticed I couldn&#39;t whistle, and I couldn&#39;t spit correctly when I brushed my teeth.  On Wednesday, February 24th, I noticed my right eyebrow was lower than my left, and my mouth was drooping on the right side.  I couldn&#39;t put my lips together to put my chapstick on,  and my smile was very crooked.  Additionally I felt my eyelid twitching and the right side of my face felt very strange in general.  So I contacted the nurse who administered the vaccine.  She said that Bell&#39;s Palsey could be symptom from the vaccine, and that I should contact my physician.  So I called Dr. office and they did a virtual appointment with me on Wednesday afternoon.  He immediately told me I have Bell&#39;s Palsey as a result of the vaccine and sent in some prescriptions for me to take.  They are Toradol Oral, Prednisone, and Erythromycin Ointment for my eye because it won&#39;t close all the way, and it doesn&#39;t blink properly.

                                                Injection was initially very painful during dose, seemed a bit lower in arm than last. The injection was given through a band aid (circular) when I later removed band aid fluid was under the band aid (clear). The next day the circumference of my arm was slightly edematous and warm. It hurt but I thought it was just the normal arm pain. It did not go away I kept googling it to see what was going on because it was affecting my sleep and I could not move it above my chest. It is going on a 2.5 weeks and still is causing pain. I saw on the news SIRVA could occur and this seems to be the symptoms I am having. I have not been to a Dr. yet as the report said it may take 2 months to resolve. I did feel like I should report this however.

She ended up with a headache.   She has had several injuries and these areas were accentuated x3 since the vaccine.  She has a history of shingles and it felt like shingles pain.   Due to the pain she did not sleep Saturday or Sunday 2/7 and 2/8 and was in the bed for most of these days.   She has stomach problems, and this was not good either.  She still can feel in the right arm where she received the vaccine and  not unless she presses on it.  Everything quieted down on 2/8/21, and back to her usual self.  She did not take anything for relieve of the pain.   She also had fever of 99.6 with this.

                                                48 hours after receiving dose 2 of the Moderna vaccine, patient developed alterations in mental status - cannot recall the events. She was taken to the ED and was found to have a BP of  &gt;200/130. Patient had a seizure in the ED - was intubated to protect airway. CT showed some decreased areas of attenuation in the bilateral occipital lobes and cerebellum. MRI showed vasogenic and cytotoxic edema in posterior temporal, parietal and BL occipital and BL cerebellar hemisphere which can be seen with PRES. Patient required inpatient treatment for her elevated BP and neurological evaluation. Was started on Norvasc and Keppra due to concern for PRES.  Discharged with follow up in cancer center and with neurology. Hospitalist and neuro teams thought PRES was likely due to her  chemo regimen, patient&#39;s oncology team though PRES may have been triggered by vaccine due to timing and her dose of Avastin.   Pt has extensive oncological history including ovarian cancer w/ metastatic breast cancer in L axilla. Pt recently started on cytoxan, Avastin, pembrolizumab. Also has malignant abdominal ascites.

                                                HUGE red knot developed on arm the next day.  Warm to touch.  Can barely move arm.  It?s been three days and I?ve had a fever every single day.  I vomited the first day six times.  I couldn?t keep food down.  Horrendous chills, body aches, fatigue, insomnia, diarrhea on day 3, headache.  Cannot get rid of fever.  I have to constantly keep taking Tylenol or Ibuprofen.  This shot sucks and y?all do NOT know the full extent of what will happen.  I feel like a guinea pig and I?m pissed off.  I feel as bad as I did when I had COVID.  My arm three days later now is red all the way down to my elbow and itches; however, that started the next day - not several days as every article I have read about COVID arm.  I am SERIOUSLY considering NOT getting the second shot.  It will probably kill me.  My only co-morbidly is age and weight.  I wear a size 12 yet I?m obese somehow by antiquated BMI standards.  I don?t have high blood pressure, don?t have diabetes, don?t have heart disease, nothing.  I?ve never been so miserable in my life.

It&#39;s been 4 days of dizziness to the point that I can only be up for 10-15 minutes at a time, can&#39;t drive.  Any exercise at all (even going up a single flight of stairs) makes me dizzy. There is also a general feeling of &#34;unwell&#34;, but it&#39;s hard to describe, like a brain fog.

Chills, fatigue, muscle and body aches through out which made me very unstable, massive headache, constant running nose, nausea and diarrhea.    I also had a low grade fever as well as my  heart bpm were erratic.  The chills were so bad that 3 comforters and a heating blanket would not help.  During the time I was so cold I also had numbness in my finger tips and toes.   Treatment :   solid bed rest, electrolyte fluids, Tylenol and Advil, several boxes of tissues  Outcome:  Day three of reporting this information.  I still have all the systems above except I no longer have the chills or fevers.

After that, I continued to have arm pain in the entire upper half of my arm for another 3 days. Additionally, when I awoke the following morning after I received the vaccine, I could barely get up. I had debilitating fatigue. I was also lightheaded. I was in a deep mental fog and had a very difficult time performing even the most simple tasks. The mental fog lifted after another 24 hours. My fatigue has lessened with each day, however, after one week I still feel much more tired than I usually feel.

                                                I was fine until 12 hours later when I woke up to use the potty and laid back down to sleep and started shaking uncontrollably.  I felt extremely cold and tried to calm my body down. I shook for two hours until I got up the energy to get up and put more clothing on, including a hat to cover my head and eyes, socks sweats and many wool blankets. My head was aching immensely. I probably had a fever, but did not have the energy to check.  I took 800 milligrams of IB and 10 milligrams of Diazapam to help me sleep.  The next day I slept after every small activity, and felt poorly with headaches and extreme fatigue all day long.  I took another 10mg diazapam to sleep that night and woke up feeling much, much better.  I am very active and have suffered from fatigue and headaches all week.  I do not have my usual energy back, as of yet.  Body aches from the first night have continued.   I had Covid in early December, and this felt more intense, but for a mere 24 hours.  I also feel I have a few lasting effects from Covid in December.  Basically fatigue and a bit of focusing problems.  Feeling better every day, I hope!!

                                                I felt pain with injection. 2 hours later I was unable to move my arm. Knife like pain in upper arm from elbow to shoulder with limited range of motion. Injection site was unusually high on my shoulder. I emailed my doctor who prescribed cold packs and Tylenol. Tried all of that. 5 days later slight improvement and finally some range of motion. We are now 10 days post injection and stabbing pain continues with certain movements. Difficulty with getting dressed, pulling clothes over head. Restricted use of arm without pain. I feel like it&#39;s not the shot itself but the administration site that is causing the problems.

                                                45 minutes after injection I felt very strange, this increased to a point where I felt as if I were on drugs. I never take drugs, I was fortunate that my boyfriend had driven me there as I was really out of it. I felt like my brain was disconnected and expanded at the same time. This unconnected sensation went on for hours. I had to stay home as I was so spaced out. At night I lay in bed singing songs that had no meaning and then laughing!  What!  The next day I was still not properly connected and spaced out. I could work instinctively but the more rational part of my brain was not working. A week on I still feel a disconnection in the center of my brain.  The second day I had a slight fever, and by the 4 th day I had diarreha.  I am still not properly &#39;right&#39;.  I am deeply concerned about getting a second shot, I don&#39;t want some kind of permanent brain disfunction.  I want you to know that this is not in any way normal for me. I don;t take hallucinogens, a barely even take aspirin.  My boyfriend thought it was hysterical because he had never seen me like that before. I was babbling on about my internal (now its going into my brain, now its in my feet) and external (look at the river, oh its a house, we&#39;re on the road)experiences not able to connect to him at all.   So as you can imagine I am in a quandary about the second shot. I just don&#39;t know what to do, and if I have the never to get it. I&#39;m schedule for April 14th.

A few hours later, I felt dizzy with vertigo, my ears closed up and I couldn&#39;t hear very well. I felt weak.   It has been almost 24 hours since I received the vaccine and I still am dizzy with vertigo and I cannot hear. I woke up with a severe headache.  My ears are closed as if I am extremely congested. I feel weak, cannot work. Condition is not improving.  I am angry. The CDC is not putting out all of the information. That is understandably why people are not wanting to get the vaccine. I see now that many people are having these same symptoms and they are being dismissed. I will not be getting a second shot unless the government wants to pay me for lost wages. This is outrageous. Shame on you.
