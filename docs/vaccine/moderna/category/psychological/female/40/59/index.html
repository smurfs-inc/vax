I didn&#39;t experience any diarrhea or vomiting that night.  The stomach cramps were enough to keep me up for most of the night, but not as bad as food poisoning.  The next morning when I got out of bed I immediately got sick and vomited.  I was very shaky and light headed.  These symptoms continued until about 7 pm on the 30th.

                                                About 1  hour after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19, I started feeling extreme pain in my left shoulder and arm, where the shot was administered. The pain continued to intensify throughout the day and night and was 10/10 on a pain scale. In addition, I began to lose my ability to lift my left arm or use it. It became so weak that I had to use my right hand/arm to pick up my left arm to move it. My left arm was &#39;hanging and drooping&#39; and my left shoulder was very  noticeably lower then my right shoulder. I called my primary care and employee health. My primary care doctor advised me to take advil and go to urgent care if the pain persisted and worsened. I could not sleep at all that evening of 12/29/20 because the pain was so intense and I had to keep picking my left arm up with my right arm to keep re-adjusting to try and get comfortable. The next morning I went to an orthopedic urgent care where I was diagnosed with nerve damage from the shot and prescribed Methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack. The doctor who saw me explained that he could not assess the extent of the damage at this time because my nerves were so agitated and inflamed. He scheduled a follow up visit with me for Thursday, January 7th and stated he will then proceed with an MRI and further investigation to assess the extent of the nerve damage.  During the days that followed my immunization, I was unable to do anything with my left arm and was dependent on my husband to help me get dressed, showered, household chores, etc. It is unknown at this time whether this will be temporary or permanent damage and disability.

                                                I got the shot, didn?t feel it at all so it went good. I went to the bathroom and went pee and got my arm back in my long sleeve shirt under my scrub top. I wasn?t anxious about getting the vaccine. Then I went to sit down and be monitored. After about another minute I felt very weird like a warm feeling going all over my body.  I started pulling my mask away from my face to get a deep breath. Then I broke out in a sweat from head to toe. I think I became pale (I apparently didn?t look good).  I started feeling more ?weird? as I had never felt this way before and I stood up to walk because the nurse there wanted me upstairs near the ED but I was weak so I sat down and had tunnel vision. After that it?s a bit of a blur. After I stopped sweating I got very cold and shaky but vitals were ok.  It scared me because I have never had a reaction before to a vaccine.

                                                1/5/2021 - Day 1:  R) deltoid pain at injection site around 1600, mild headache viewing around 2100 when going to bed. I took ibuprofen prophylactically to prevent pain getting worse.  1/6/2021- Day 2 around 00:00, I was woken up out of bed with severe body aches all over. Mostly to bilateral hip joints and lower. Arm pain and headache were barely noticeable d/t other pain. Pain radiated to arms down to both shins. It hurt to touch skin and took ibuprofen around 0130-0200. It was so bad I couldn&#39;t roll my body up without assistance and I&#39;d need to use restroom for almost 2 hours at this point. Had to call out of work because I knew this pain wouldn&#39;t go away in a few hours in addition to lack of sleep, I knew it&#39;d be better to rest with OTC, rest, And heating pad.  Later this day I was still feeling the same, went to store to get something for body aches. It wasn&#39;t until I was in this store, when my left femur bone hurt so bad I had to grab onto a shelf. I felt my bone was about to break - scary. (My1 st time experience the bone pain symptom) Later at home same day, spent an hour going back and forth to bathroom with large loose/water diarrhea. I slept most of the day, as I was too fatigued to do simple tasks. Went to bed around 21:00 after taking ibuprofen, laying on heated and covered in electric blanket.  1/7/2020 woke up at 05:50 to get ready for work and instantly felt the pain again and headache, I&#39;m usually not so tired after sleeping, so contributed that to same fatigue. Although is not pounding, still dull.  1/7/2021 0900 took my HCTZ, Propranolol, and Potassium. Today the pain is not as high, but better than yesterday. I expect to feel a lot better tomorrow to go into work.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I went into a waiting room for the post-vaccine 15 minute observation. Approximately 2 minutes after sitting down I felt a sensation that can be described as a wave through my body. It only lasted for 10 seconds; however, it was immediately followed by a rapid heartbeat. It almost felt as though I might pass out (I have never passed out before). I alerted a nurse, and she monitored me for the 15 minute duration. After about 2 minutes, I felt &#39;normal&#39; again.

It is painful, burns, stings and has a tingling type feeling. She has not changed medications, no new laundry soaps, she believes the only change has been the COVID vaccine. She also explained what she described as &#34;electricity&#34; the afternoon following the injection. She said the best way to describe it was the sensation as if she put her tongue on a battery however much more intense and throughout her whole body.  She has had extreme fatigue as well as body aches as well.

Within 24 hours of vaccination, she developed a headache that lasted approximately 1 week. Within 36 hours of vaccination, she developed an itchy rash that covered her trunk (abdomen and chest). Upon assessment of her injection site one  week after vaccination, it was extremely red with very defined borders of erythema.

The chills subsided on 1/4/21. The arm pain started to subside 1/6/21, to the point where it was just the area where the shot was administered, but still hasn&#39;t gone away. It still hurts to move that muscle. The pain is worst in the morning, but my arm will loosen up by the afternoon. The pain doesn&#39;t go away completely. It hurts to lift or push if that muscle is involved. I have not been able to sleep comfortably because if it. I have been taking advil and tylenol multiple times a day, as well as trying hot packs on my arm at night.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, January 4. I had a mildly sore arm for the first couple of days following the vaccine, but that was about it for side effects. I noticed my face was a little flushed when I was driving home afterward, but I chalked it up to being excited and nervous and wearing a face mask.  Seven days later, it started to feel itchy around my vaccination site (upper left arm). There has been some mild swelling around the site, in addition to being itchy. The area is also warmer than the rest of my arm or body. For one night, it was uncomfortable sleeping on my left side.  Starting on the 8th day after the vaccine, there is a small amount of redness just above the vaccine site, about an inch and a half wide, a little larger than a quarter.  Here are my doctor&#39;s notes, who I saw on January 12: Patient is a 40 y.o. female who presents for evaluation of rash/ possible injection reaction  involving the left upper arm. Rash started yesterday.. she noted slight swelling, warmth, and itching with pink erythema in a spot just above the area of her arm where she had her COVID injection 1 week ago. She received the Moderna vaccine.   Associated symptoms: no associated symptoms. Patient denies: fever, headache, arthralgia, abdominal pain, nausea, myalgia, decrease in energy level. She did not have significant pain at the time of the injection, and had a mild sore arm the following few days but no other symptoms after the shot. The warmth and swelling began just yesterday, almost a week later. She has reported this to the VARS website. She is employed by public health and is going to work at a covid vaccination site tonight, checking in people who are getting vaccines.  She has a h/o sensitive skin, but no h/o hives or urticaria, no previous injection reactions. She get racing heart from epinephrine but no other known allergies.  She denies dizziness, dyspnea, SOB, cough, or sensation of swelling in throat.  She has been using ibuprofen, cold compresses for sxs with some relief.  Assessment:  Probable injection site reaction, delayed reaction No strong evidence of cellulitis but we discussed signs and symptoms to be watchful for such as increased swelling and redness or tenderness of the overlying skin, fevers, chills, body aches.  Plan:  Medications: Benadryl 25 mg administered in clinic and discussed use of antihistamines to reduce injection site reaction. She can continue use of ibuprofen and cool compresses as well. Avoid over cooling of skin as this may also cause local reaction.  If pain, redness, or other sxs of concern progress she should follow up.  Verbal patient instruction given. Follow up: as needed.   If no further increase in sxs she should be able to receive her second vaccine but would premedicate with Benadryl to prevent local reaction again.

On Tuesday 1/12/21 my arm was hot and had developed a knot at the injection site and continued to itch and hurt, on Wednesday 01/13/21 when I woke up I had a red rash on top of all the other symptoms at the injection site. I have been very tired and had a headache since I got the vaccine. And over the last few days I have felt worse and my joints and muscle ache, I have been nauseas and mild chills with low grade fever.

Racing heart began within the 15 min waiting period but I interpreted as anxiety.  Other symptoms began roughly 3 hrs post-vaccination.  Remedy was to leave work and go home, lay down in bed, and wait.  After a few hours symptoms mostly resolved, but face still feels strange (slight numbness and slight tingling).

This pain felt between a horrible migraine headache and as if I was hit by a baseball bat. The pain woke me out of my sleep and kept me awake for at least an hour&#43;. (approx 2:30am-4:00am). When I woke up a couple hours later the intensity had gone down and I went to work. As time passed, the pain/discomfort dulled and by midafternoon I was barely able to notice it (I had to focus on it).

Everything was good until about an hour after I got home, and I developed a headache and was very tired. Went to bed at my normal time which is 9o?clock, and slept all night. When I woke up the next morning which is January 15, 2021 my left arm was very sore and my headache was gone. Went to work at normal time, 7:00 am and began feeling very fatigued with muscle soreness and joint pain. Left work and came home and slept for two hours. Still experiencing aches and pains and fatigue. I do feel it necessary to report I have had a positive covid-19 result in April of 2020.

                                                This facility staff member received her first dose of the MODERNA COVID-19 vaccine (Lot037K20A/EXP 6/22/21) at clinic at approximately 9:15AM on 1/14/21. She initially answered &#34;no&#34; to any allergies on the VAR but revealed to the pharmacist reviewing the VAR that she had experienced an allergy to food and contrast dye that required an epi-pen and hospital attention. She did not offer additional details and explained that she had tolerated other shots (including the 2020 flu shot) without incident. I advised patient to remain for a 30 minute monitoring period post-vaccination due to history of allergic reaction. Patient presented with some anxiety before the shot and immediately started to complain of feeling &#34;sick&#34; and said she was having trouble breathing due to chest pressure. We advised patient to remove her mask and provided her with water and a trash can though no vomiting occurred. After 15-20 minutes, patient still complained of chest pressure and difficulty breathing. When asked if she was experiencing any itchiness or throat swelling, patient said she did feel some throat swelling so she was given 25MG of Benadryl. After an additional 15 minutes, patient&#39;s condition seemed unchanged (not worsening, not improving) so the facility&#39;s nursing team was called to evaluate patient. Patient said she was still experiencing difficulty breathing and throat swelling so nursing advised use of EPI-PEN and patient consented. I administered a dose of 0.3MG (LOT0FM4066/EXP 02/2022) to the right lateral thigh and nurse called for EMS. Immediately after injection, patient&#39;s eyes fluttered and she seemed to be on the verge of fainting. Nursing checked her oxygen saturation which was 100%. Patient reported no improvement after 5 minutes so another EPI-PEN 0.3MG was administered to the left lateral thigh. Nursing also gave the patient 81MG chewable aspirin due to the patient experiencing a stroke last month. EMS arrived a few minutes after the second EPI-PEN dose and patient was transported to the hospital for evaluation. Facility reported that patient went home that afternoon but did not provide details. Based on my assessment of patient&#39;s symptoms and behavior, I feel it is likely that she experienced either an acute panic attack or anaphylaxis due to vaccine administration. I called the patient today (the day after the incident) and she confirms that she received treatment for an anaphylactic reaction to the Moderna COVID shot and is doing well without any lasting adverse effects.

                                                Patient received her vaccine and was taken to the observation area to be observed for a 15-minute period. In the observation area, she immediately reported &#34;feeling funny&#34; and was noted to be &#34;sweaty&#34;. The advanced practice nurses and pharmacist were called for assistance immediately. She was placed on a stretcher, had her legs elevated, and was moved to a quieter area. She was responsive to commands and her vitals at this time were as follows: blood pressure 96/56 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 96%, and heart rate in mid 60s.  She did not require treatment and within several minutes of lying down on the stretcher felt better. She did not have any rashes or swelling, and she denied difficulty breathing. She was observed for about half an hour in this area and was also evaluated Emergency Medical Services who had been called. It was suggested that the patient should visit the Emergency Department for observation but she refused as she felt better and due to concerns of being exposed to Covid-19. We were able to walk with her escort her to the exit area at the end of the observation period.   We questioned her about potential allergies again and she denied a history of allergic reactions. The advanced practice nurse evaluating the patient suggested this episode was consistent with a vasovagal episode and that anxiety could have also played a role.

There was also a huge lump at the injection site that was really warm - way warmer than usual.  It lasted approx. 4 days.   I also had a 4 day migraine and was really sleepy.   Since the injection, I haven&#39;t slept through the night and I take a prescription sleeping medication.   I just dealt with all of it; it wasn&#39;t severe enough to warrant a Dr&#39;s office visit.

Began with an itchy arm at injection site and thought nothing of it b/c there were not marks. by the end of that Sunday my arm was red and warm with round spots. I took some Cetirizine and used a topical cortisone. Monday morning I woke to two lumps, itchiness, heat, tenderness, sore muscles, headache. I took some APAP and IBU and applied some more cortisone, went about my day with a two hour car ride and a walk. i was stiff through the day so i completed stretches several times through the day. When i got home that night most of my major joints hurt enough that I could not sleep through the night even with Naproxen 440 mg , APAP 1000 mg, Cetirizine 10 mg on board. My arm began to be more swollen, my nervous system began to be off. I had no appetite, was dizzy, felt shaky but when I held my arm and hand out, I did not shake. I have continued on a with Naproxen an d APAP since Tuesday after read not to take PO IBU if had Moderna vaccine.  I have not been able to complete house hold chores, missed three days of work, and been able to be with family.

                                                Got my vaccine early morning.  Left arm where injection site given,  started to become really sore 30 minutes after injection.  I ate breakfast at around 9:30am. Went to my Doctor&#39;s appointment for 1030am, started having mild chills that would come and go. After Doctor&#39;s appointment,  around 1130-12pm, started to feel nauseous and loss of thirst and appetite.  I called the vaccine line at my job at around 2:59pm, but nurse just stated nothing to do right now, to call back following morning.  I knew things would get worse so I made the judgement call to call out this was close to 4pm. My chills started increasing,  despite not having any high temp was 98.9 f. Then around 5pm started having mild joint pain all over my body. Around 7pm joint pain got unbearable,  that I even started to shiver from more chills and pain.  I couldn&#39;t sleep,  except just laying and tossing and turning in bed, I also started having stomach cramping . Finally I fell asleep at around 12:30 midnight,  due to the pain. I finally woke up around 3:30am, took 2 Motrins. Then I woke up around 06:30am with body aches all over. Last night just took sips of ginger ale, didn&#39;t eat anything since 9:30am yesterday.  Finally had a small breakfast at around 7:30am with a glass of water. Still feel warm at times, with body aches, and nausea.  Will call vaccine line again today.

                                                &#34;I received my covid vaccine (Moderna) first dose on 1/7. I developed a fever up to 102F over the following few days and severe pain at the injection site. On about 1/18 my ankles started swelling and turning bright red. I took tylenol / motrin not knowing this could even be associated and thinking maybe I overworked my muscles running around at work that weekend. Over the following few days the reaction has become much more severe. I have nodules that are red, painful and flat all over the front of my legs and thighs and continued swelling and pain to my ankles and knees. This makes it difficult to walk. I followed up with a Dr. on health online as I am unable to drive myself to an appointment at an office at this time who diagosed me with Erythema Nodusum and started me on prednisone. I missed 2 days of work with the initial reaction to the vaccine and will miss 3 shifts this weekend as I cannot walk and need to start prednisone&#34;

                                                &#34;I received my covid vaccine (Moderna) first dose on 1/7. I developed a fever up to 102F over the following few days and severe pain at the injection site. On about 1/18 my ankles started swelling and turning bright red. I took tylenol / motrin not knowing this could even be associated and thinking maybe I overworked my muscles running around at work that weekend. Over the following few days the reaction has become much more severe. I have nodules that are red, painful and flat all over the front of my legs and thighs and continued swelling and pain to my ankles and knees. This makes it difficult to walk. I followed up with a Dr. on online as I am unable to drive myself to an appointment at an office at this time who diagnosed me with Erythema Nodusum and started me on prednisone. I missed 2 days of work with the initial reaction to the vaccine and will miss 3 shifts this weekend as I cannot walk and need to start prednisone&#34;

                                                Symptoms began with severely sore muscles about 3-4 hours after the vaccine.  I&#39;m healthy and 40 years old and I was barely able to walk to my bed, like a 90 year old.  Followed by uncontrollable shaking for 1-2 hours (like extreme chills, though I wasn&#39;t cold and was covered in blankets).  Following that,  I was unable to walk or crawl and almost any movement of any part of my body was excruciating, including picking up a glass of water and even wiggling my toes.   It felt similar to the physical trauma of recovering from a car accident, when every muscle is tensed for impact. That severity decreased within 24 hours of the vaccine.  Muscle pain, extreme fatigue, headaches and dizziness have continued for 4&#43; days and are still present and prevented me from working and going about day-to-day activity.

It progressed to a panic attack with uncontrollable crying and breathing issues for ~5-10 minutes. I was able to calm down, but continued to feel horrible all night. I threw up twice about an hour later. Muscle aches in both my shoulders (far worse in the one I got the injection in), back, buttocks, hips, and feet all night that kept me from being able to sleep. Ongoing nausea, headache, and fatigue all morning. Mostly has resolved now (2 pm) aside from fatigue.

                                                About 24 hours after the vaccination (NYE), my last knee was achy, first I did not correlate it to the vaccine, but by the end of the day I could not walk. The next morning (01/01) my knee was better but my left hand was very stiff and painful and in the afternoon my left shoulder was very painful and I could not lift my arm. Next day (01/02) my shoulder was better but my left hand was swollen and very painful.  I went to bed with a swollen hand and next morning (01/03) the hand was a little better, maybe 80% better, but my right shoulder was ridiculously sore that I could not lift my arm and I could not go to work because of that. That day I also had stiffness on both hands. I went to bed that night and when I woke up my shoulders and knees were ok but my hands were still stiff and sore.  My feet were painful and bluish. Woke up the next day and my feet were fine but then my right hand was like 5 times its normal size, I could not open or close it, and that is when I ended up at the ER with lots of joint pain, my feet and knees were hurting again and I also had shortness of breath and   chest pains at that moment. They prescribed me prednisone for the swelling. The day after the ER my fingers were numb, I totally lost the feeling on my fingers until 01/28/2021.

Woke up with 99.3 temp. I feel okay and not as tired. I just have severe left arm pain still.

                                                Developed a mild headache about five hours after injection. That was not uncomfortable. I then developed intense chills that woke me up from sleep  14 hours after injection.   I had pain in injection site, fatigue, non-stop chills, body aches, joint pain, muscle pain, cough, and difficulty eating (but not nauseated) and slight fever - just less than 100 degrees the entire first night, next day and night from the second injection. The joint and muscle pain was so intense in my elbows and wrists, that it caused me to break down crying as I was trying to drive home from work at 9 AM the following day after injection. The joint/muscle pain persisted and I would get some shooting pains in my toes, feet, hands, and wrists on and off for roughly 12 hours the day after injection. Lymph nodes have also been swollen in my throat since 14 hours after injection.   Naproxen did not ease this pain or discomfort but it did keep a fever at bay (but still with chills nonetheless) so at the recommendation of my sister who&#39;s a doctor, she said I should take the max dose for short periods of time at 2 pills, 3x a day. After taking two at once, that made the chills go away but not the body aches.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine I had a rush feeling like someone pushed IV fluids in really fast causing me to get dizzy and nauseaed.  I went home and took benedryl and tylenol which I did until about Wed when I finally was able to get up and  got nausea meds.  By the Monday of the next week the dizziness and nausea returned.  I  visited my dr. on Tues who gave Zofran for the nausea and Meclozine for the dizzines and by Friday I felt a little better and was able to return to work.  I experienced the up and down feeling within my body for about 2 1/2 weeks before all symptoms finally resided.  My brain felt foggy thoughout the entire time as well

Additionally, for 4-5 days following the vaccination: minor itching and swelling of injection site. Low grade fever (99.7 to 100.8), chills, extreme fatigue, weakness and mild nausea. Unable to perform many work tasks/chores. These symptoms all subsided prior to the onset of the severe arm rash and swelling.

Fatigue,  severe muscle aches, joint pain, headache,  nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, chills to point shaking still come in waves.  This is day 7 and I could barely put one foot in front other after work to get in bed but vomited first.  Today, odd pressure in my face developed and headache came and went and again, the fatigue, muscle and joint pain are intense.  I&#39;m still working, but have had to take time off, go in late, etc.  Brain fog is a thing.  It feels like it did when I &#34;didn&#39;t have COVID-19&#34; before but had every symptoms and I was going to die, but in waves.  I was dizzy, saw stars and black spots in my right eye today on and off and vision in my right eye honestly seems to have significantly decline.  I&#39;m really just concerned that it is day 7.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, I walked about 40-50 feet and experienced extreme dizziness and shortness of breath, and could not stand straight. I was able to stop my own fall due to a wall being next to me, and I stooped down close to the floor so as to prevent a fall. I then was able to walk about 20 feet to an office where I could sit and the dizziness continued. I noticed I was shaking and heartrate was elevated (that could have been the anxiety caused by the dizziness and being unable to walk straight). I sat for a total of 30 minutes before I walked to my office, which is a couple minute walk. I continued to have dizzy spells (not as severe) while sitting in my office for a few more hours. Also, I&#39;m having a hard time focusing, feel dazed.

                                                This may not be related but, the fatigue associated with my autoimmune disease had been well-controlled for 11 months through the oral biologic treatment Otezla. Three weeks post vaccination, I&#39;m starting to have the same fatigue as before when my autoimmune disease was untreated. I did experience some fatigue in the days following the second injection but, this is different. This is the debilitating fatigue that interferes with my daily life. I realize this may not be related but, I know people with autoimmune diseases were not part of clinical trials. I am just submitting my experience in case others report the same.

I saw my doctor and just thought I was having anxiety. Started medication for anxiety.  Three to four days post second shot, the side effects came back and are not yet resolved at this time. I am currently working with my doctor to determine what I need to do to lower my blood pressure and stop the anxiety attacks.

I fell asleep for 2 hours and woke up with a headache, some disorientation and feeling slightly nauseated. I had gotten plenty of good sleep the night before these symptoms and hadn&#39;t felt any immediate side-effects.  ...I don&#39;t feel that these are serious side-effects, but thought maybe the feedback would be worthwhile.

                                                Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

I had a low grade fever of 99.9 that went up to 100.0 measured by ear thermometer  I had joint pain and over all muscle pain By the evening I had mucous in nose, post nasal drip and slight difficulty breathing. I took 2 advils which relieved the fever and body aches On Saturday and into Sunday, I continue to have an over arching malaise, I do not feel healthy.  I feel like my body is fighting something, I developed a slight sore throat and my head feels heavy and foggy. I&#39;ve continued to take advil.

                                                12/31/20 10:30a Vaccine given 10:48a Left the vaccine observation room 11:30a Started feeling warm like maybe my temp was increasing, face was red 12:00p had what felt like an adrenaline spike through my body became hot and jittery feeling. 12:30p The spikes started coming in waves, like a full body hot flash. Was very shaky and my tongue felt itchy and tight; not swollen just tight 12:40p made it home and took Benadryl 1:00p symptoms dissipated, ate a chicken salad sandwich thinking that would help with the jittery feeling. 1:25p The whole body flash came back and the tightness in the tongue increased. 1:27p Called employee health for information on this type of reaction. Wanted to call me an ambulance, I declined. After much discussion they suggested I come back to the vaccination observation room where they have epi, then decided it best that I go to Urgent Care. 1:40 on the way to town I told my husband to take me to the ED instead as my bottom lip felt swollen and tight, and my tongue felt thick like it was a bit swollen too. Was not short of breath, airway did not feel compromised, breathing normal, and heart rate normal. 3:01 Was given 40mg Methylpredinisone (solumedrol) &amp; 20mg famotidine (Pepcid) given- immediate improvement in tongue thickness and swollen lips. 440p 50mg Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 10mg loratadine (Claritin), &amp; 40mg prednisone given prior to discharge 8:20p Top lip started to swell just before my next dose of Benadryl 8:30p Took next dose of Benadryl, once it kicked in had quick resolution of lip swelling 9:00p joint pain started setting in, was uncomfortable but not too painful 1/121 Joint pain is still present but not uncomfortable. Injection arm a little sore, no redness or swelling at site of injection. Swelling of mouth, face and tongue is persistent as it nears the 4-hour mark for 50mg of Benadryl. 1p ate a couple of bites of chicken fried steak, face is increasing in redness and swelling, and mild tongue swelling. At max dose of Benadryl per box states to only take 6 doses in a 24 hour period. 2p Mouth and face swelling not relieved with Benadryl 2:52p checked into ED for 2nd time. 4:08 Given 10mg dexamethasone (decadron), 20mg famotidine (Pepcid), 10mg montelukast (singular) Swelling improved. 5:54p Potassium low on lab work given 40 mEq of potassium chloride 6:00p discharge with scripts for famotidine, epi pen, montelukast 7:00p taken 25mg of Benadryl 8:20p lips feel mildly swollen again. 8:45p next dose of 25mg Benadryl. Did not have complete resolution of swelling but did improve. Mild hives, swelling of hands and feet. 1/2/21 All joint pain is gone, and injection site pain is only noticeable if someone bumps into my arm. 6a 25mg Benadryl &amp; Pepcid 10a 25mg Benadryl 2p 25mg of Benadryl 3:30pm felt fine all day with only mild swelling and redness to hands, ate chicken nachos. Face became very hot (like my face was too close to the oven when I open it), redness from eyes down, lips swollen, mild itchiness too the tongue but nothing too concerning. 4p 25mg Benadryl I strongly believe the exacerbating factor is eating as all times the symptoms increased in intensity I had just eaten. After discussion with Dr. will be cutting out chicken (chicken was eaten before all 3 instances) and all other meats until complete resolution of symptoms and will avoid any inflammatory foods such as nuts, berries and shellfish. 7p 25mg Benadryl &amp; Claritin taken 7:30p ate a banana, no reaction 8p Singular taken 9:30p put Vaseline on my lips, face &amp; ears flamed hot and swelling and redness followed. 9:45p took 25mg Benadryl 10:25p tongue thick feeling 11p took 25mg Benadryl tongue still feels thick 1/3/21 Fevers 101.6 and chills started in the night Face and lips are permanently swollen and red despite all the meds I?m taking.Lymph nodes are all swollen. I?m too afraid to eat for fear of more swelling while my face is already so swollen.

                                                I received the injection around 2:15 pm.  There were no immediate effects. By late afternoon/early evening, my arm was a bit sore and later started to feel warm near the injection site.  However, I otherwise felt fine.  At 9 pm, I suddenly became very dizzy and passed out for several minutes. When I regained consciousness, I felt a little short of breath, which resolved within 20 minutes or so. However, I was also extremely nauseous, which got worse any time I tried to move. This continued for several hours.  I also alternated between being very warm and chills during this time - it was like waves of heat. I did not have a fever. Later, my head began to hurt and I took tylenol to help with that. I also had diarrhea. These symptoms began to gradually lessen after a couple of hours and I was able to fall asleep around 12:30 pm. I woke up hot and sweaty several times throughout the night. The following day, 1/6, I was very tired and had a headache and could not eat much, but otherwise felt much better.

I had COVID-19 disease in September, so I was expecting to have a robust response to the vaccine. I received my Moderna vaccine on 12/29. I developed fever, shaking chills, and terrible body aches about 13 hours after the dose. I felt a bit better in the morning, so I went to work as usual but was still sore with body aches. I developed shaking chills, nausea, and worsening aches at lunch time and left work early because the nausea and chills were so significant. I slept the remainder of the day and by the morning of 12/31 felt well again. My symptoms probably lasted around 24-30 hours total. I did miss a half day of work but otherwise had no significant effects.

If that is any sign of how covid feels, I am so grateful for the shot.  I did not take anything because I wanted my body to fight it off.

                                                I had my first COVID 19 Moderna vaccine Lot: 025J20-2A at hospital. Within about 60 seconds of receiving it, my heart started pounding hard and rapidly and I let a nurse know. She took my vitals and my heart rate was very high, as was my blood pressure. My O2 was fine. I had some tightness and heaviness I my chest. I felt flush in my cheeks, but did not have hives. The nurse said my color was very pale. I was warm, given an ice pack, and then a bit later cold. At one point they wanted me to go to the Emergency Department, which I refused (perhaps stupidly). I&#39;m not sure I was thinking clearly. I was trying very hard to stay calm and relaxed. My blood pressure was very elevated for about an hour and a half. They finally let me go home when I was 140/95 (my usual is 110 over 70 ish). I had some tongue tingling at home, very briefly.

                                                Right at the 15 minute mark I developed a full body sense of warmth followed by tremors and my HR rose from 70 to 138 very rapidly.  My mom was on the phone with me and stated I didn?t quite know what I was saying to her and she became worried.  The RN came by asking how I felt and I told her I was jittery and decided to wait at the site a few more minutes.  The sensation passed after about 3-4 minutes and then I felt ok.  I drove home and showered.  The rest of the night I would get random bouts of tachycardia and felt overall not well.  Also a small amount of chest tightness.  I also noticed things such as climbing by stairs cause me to become winded very fast and my HR would elevate rapidly.  Today I woke up and am feeling almost normal. HR has not been elevated but when I ate I did notice a small amount of lightheadedness.

I am still having symptoms now, but getting better.

                                                A day after the shot I was in the shower and started experiencing exhaustion and shortness of breath. I also had tachycardia. I proceeded not to feel well they?re very next day. Then on Friday I was dizzy and a coworker said that I was flushed and I wasn?t feeling well. I proceeded to go see patients and while examining a patient I became very dizzy and lightheaded while bent over and almost passed out when I came up.. at that time I decided to leave work and go to my PCP. Orthostatic?s were positive and EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and an echo is ordered. Echo was normal. Throughout the week I continued to have tachycardia and shortness of breath with any type of exertion. I left work this morning and was tested for Covid because of my symptoms.

I stayed home from work and reported it and was told I could return to work on 1/11 (my next scheduled day) by workplace health. I felt fatigue and eye pressure headaches on and off since. I also felt like I was having vision changes. On 1/14/21 I noticed a small, raised, red area at the injection site. Over the weekend it continued to spread over my arm. It is warm and very mild tenderness to palpation but does not itch. I am also feeling tight muscle pain in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.

                                                When I received the shot, I felt pain radiating down my arm to my wrist.  This continued for about 12 hours after the shot.  I also felt some numbness/tingling in my left hand.  Since this went away within 24 hours, I did nothing extra to treat it.  On the 4th day after the shot (1/19/21), I began to itch.  It started in my arm near the shot site and then spread throughout my left arm, up the left side of my neck, and on the left side of my face.  By the evening, my entire upper body was itching to the point that my skin felt like it was crawling/I wanted to rip my skin off.   I had to take Benadryl in order to sleep.  The itching has continued throughout today and seems worse on the left side of my body.  I cannot take Benadryl during the day as it puts me to sleep.  I cannot be asleep at work, nor can I take off of work in order to stay home to take Benadryl.  The itching is making basic tasks difficult.  I know I will have to take Benadryl again tonight or I won&#39;t be able to sleep due to the itching.  Is there any idea on how long this will last?  Is it safe for me to get the 2nd dose of this vaccine?

                                                Approximately 36 hours of fever of 101, chills, shivering, sweats, aches and pain in every joint in my body, back pain, headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, nausea, difficulty completing my daily work duties and household activities due to pain and not feeling well. This was not much helped by Alleve, therefore I took Tylenol which was mildly helpful. After the first 36 hours, the symptoms lessened in severity and lasted for about another 12 hours. After that, I felt well for several days in a row, then about 1 week later I felt sore, weak, tired and nauseous. This resolved in its own in about 2 hours. I have felt well since then. I am choosing to receive my second dose of moderna vaccine tomorrow, because I would rather experience these side effects then catch COVID ever again. I caught COVID19 in March 2020. With my COVID infection, I was sick for about 21 days with fever of 101 and more, bone pain, body aches, chest pain, back pain, headaches, nausea, shaking chills, sweats, trouble breathing, dyspnea, cough, runny nose, sore throat, pink eye, dizziness, tiredness, ?brain fog? and fatigue. I was not hospitalized. After about 21 days I began to recover, but the first week after my recovery began I was very weak and tired, and spent most of my time sleeping. I was 41 years old at the time, with health problems including well controlled asthma and being overweight. I never wish to experience this again and I am grateful that I am receiving the Modena vaccine. Thank you so much for logging my side effects.

I told the staff and she said to tell the nurse in the waiting area. I walked over to the nurse and told her my symptoms. She had me lay in a reclining chair, relax, drank juice. She took my blood pressure (144/78 and pulse was 100). I sat in the reclining chair for 30 minutes then walked around to see if I felt safe to leave. By then my pulse was down to 70bpm.

I got very sick at about 4:30pm Symptoms: muscle aches, chills, fever, headache, SOB, chest pain, sore throat, cough. I ended in the ED because I couldn?t manage my asthma and my HR was high on Wed. I was diagnosed with Covid as I found out my husband gave it to me. Then a couple days later my asthma got worse and I ended up in the ED overnight. They were able to get better management in my Asthma.  I was sick for 3 weeks. Went back to work week four 1/25 Monday and 1/27 they cleared me to get the second dosage of the vaccine. I got the vaccine 3:20 pm and at 5:00 I walked my son in Kung Fu and then waited in my car. I ended up passing out in my car at approx 5:15 pm and my 8 year old son knew something was wrong and had to wake me up.  I could barely drive home I felt very drunk. When I got home my temp spikes to 101.3. I had extreme muscle pain, fatigue, chills, sore throat, chest pain, cough, SOB. My left arm swelled up where I was injected and I couldn?t move my arm. I was told I couldn?t take anything tylonel or Ibuprofen for 8 hours. I suffered. Even when I could take something my body was very painful. This lasted  wed, thurs, and Friday morning.

                                                Will call back later this week with lot number. Two days later my body started tingling, I ended up leaving work early. I called the doctor who said and take some Benadryl and rest it off. I was nausea all weekend and slept most of the weekend. I went to work on Monday and worked through Thursday. Friday 1/22/2021 afternoon my body began tingling again, I became so weak that I couldn&#39;t walk. I had to leave work early and they made my husband come pick up because the staff at my job did not think I was safe to drive. I was nauseous again. I had major diarrhea and vomiting about a week after receiving the vaccine. This lasted around 3 days. I finally went into the ER on 1/24/2021. They treated me Magnesium and Potassium and 2 bags of IV fluid and said I was dehydrated and sent me home.  I went from the ER and I could not sleep that night, the ER gave me so much Zofran it was just to much. I still continued to throw up at home. Went back to ER this time  in  on 1/25/2021 around 5AM I was losing feeling in my fingers and toes, they were completely numb. I was also still vomiting. They said I my electrolytes were still out of balance and gave more nausea medicine, medicine to help with the cramping and more IV fluids.  I was sent home later that afternoon. I went to work on the 26th, I felt slow to react, trouble concentrating, very lethargic, and off balance. I was still nauseous but it was getting better with medicine. My eyes yellows turn straight yellow, I thought I had jaundice.  I was able to work all day. I left work and when I pulled into driveway at home 7:01 PM and EMS was in front of my house 7:14  PM.  I went inside and went to bathroom and my husband found me and I was having a full blown seizure, foaming at the mouth. EMS took my to  ER and I was treated for a seizure and an elbow injury and went home. I have seen the neurologist and my physician since being discharged. They did more blood work. I have been having high blood pressure since then. I am trying to get an MRI scheduled that my neurologist ordered. They started Keppra 500 MG to control the seizures. I have been taking Tizanadine for muscle spams from the elbow injury when I feel during the seizure.   I did have an MRI 6 months ago.

Upon trying to drink water, she started to feel sick and dry heaved (never vomited) then she said she had problems trying to swallow.  She did not report trouble breathing.  I called 911, they had me ask her a series of questions.  As soon as she said her throat was bothering her again, I administered the EpiPen at 12:10. We also called her emergency contact person.

                                                About 7 hours after receiving my injection I started experiencing neck stiffness and body aches. The following day I had really bad flu symptoms and was unable to do anything except use the restroom (with assistance walking) and sleep. I had a fever between 100 and 102.9 all day, it never broke. I would take Tylenol and it would decrease slightly after a bout of sweats so bad I had to change my clothes (3x). I also experienced chills and extreme fatigue. The 2nd day following injection fever and body aches were gone and I was now experiencing headaches and mental fogginess. This lasted almost the entire day. Once these symptoms cleared (early evening) I started experiencing bouts of dizziness, 2 instances prior to bed and 2 instances so far today.

I told the nurse on stand by, what I was feeling and she said to seat down because she was going to check my blood pressure. She checked by BP and it was on 160/80&#39;s ranges, was checked 3 times and they were the same  ranges. I don&#39;t suffer from high blood pressure I told her. So she gave me cranberry juice and water and I stayed for another 30-45 minutes. She rechecked my BP and it went down to 138/70&#39;s. I was told if I want it to go to the ER to get check, I told her that I felt much better that the dizziness went away and my accelerated heart had lessen. I feel much better today and BP it&#39;s back to normal ranges.

Interrupts sleep when I accidently roll over on the the left arm. Woke up this morning with an area of redness, firmness, and warmth to left arm just below where injection was given. Deep pain now radiating in to my axilla. Increased pain with arm movement today. Treatment: I have been taking ibuprofen 800mg every 8 hours since Tuesday morning 2/9/21.

                                                I felt a little lightheaded after the first shot on 1/28/21, they had me stay an additional 15&#34; and I felt ok. After the 2nd shot on 2/25, I immediately felt a little lightheaded, sat for 15&#34;, when I stood up to leave I felt lightheaded and had to sit down. The staff member got me a cup of juice and some water. I stayed for another 15&#34;, I felt better, a little kind of &#34;flighty&#34; feeling but not like I did when I had to sit. I went home and did ok. I dont think i drank enough fluids that evening. That night around midnight I had chills and could not sleep, muscle aches, headache. Around 8 am when I woke up to go to the bathroom, I felt so lightheaded that I had to lay back down, my temp was 100.4. I drank some water. I got back up to take tylenol and get more to drink. I still felt lightheaded and fatigue, temp was down to 99.6. I drank 3 bottles of water and a gatorade before I needed to urinate. I dont know if the lightheaded feelings were a drop in blood pressure and the more intense lightheadedness the next day after the 2nd shot was a presyncopal episode. I continued to nap and drink fluids until about 2p when I woke up I no longer felt lightheaded and the fatigue was getting better. I still had a headache til that night. I did call Occupational Health to go over my symptoms, they told me to push fluids and rest.  Today I emailed my doctor, PCP to go over things and see if he thinks this was a reaction to the vaccine vs not drinking enough the night before, I am leaning toward a reaction since it made me feel weird right after the shot for both times. As of Saturday 2/27 AM I am feeling more like myself, still drinking alot and resting though.

My balance felt off, low grade fever, weakness upon exertion, headache and fatigue ad injection site very red and tender x24 hours. nothing helped the dizziness. Tylenol was taken q4 hours for fever/bodyaches. The second day post vaccine i had trouble thinking of common words that ive used all of my life. I felt very confused and had a hard time getting my thoughts out. Continued with fatigue but after several hours of exertion. Day 4, some nausea and loose stool. Day 5 post vaccine, injection site has become very itchy, feeling like an insect bite.

Tuesday no fever but pain in arm got worse and a large red rash developed. Rash continued to grow daily and became hot to touch. Saw my doctor on Thursday I drew a circle under the rash and it grew outside the circle, doctor prescribed prednisone and antibiotics as a precaution in case not an allergic reaction but possible infection at the injection site.

All my glands continued to swell on and off.  They were tender and irritated and i could feel them externally and internally.  I became extremely fatigued but could not sleep.  I continued to have gland swelling and irritation and extreme fatigue.  The fatigue never cleared up and neither did the swollen glands specifically in my neck and armpits.  I started having some dizzy spells, brain fog, memory lapses and continued extreme fatigue.  I called my PCP to let her know what was going on on at week 3 before my scheduled second as i was worried and did not want to get a second dose.  She ordered blood work CBC and a EBV panel and COVID testing

                                                On 2/25/21 I received my first Moderna vaccine.  Later that day, I started to experience some brain fog and fatigue. this resolved itself after approximately 4 hours. On  3/3/21 I took my dose of Humira that I use for Crohn&#39;s Disease and about 3 hours later experienced extreme fatigue. I have been on Humira for 3.5 years and I have never experienced a reaction to the Humira like this. On 3/4/21, the next day after taking my Humira, I once again experienced extreme fatigue, a very bad headache and horrible brain fog to the point where the things I was reading on my computer and things people were saying to me was not making sense. I was also very nauseated and had severe diarrhea. I was tested for Covid just to be sure and I was negative. I went home and fell asleep and slept for 6 hours. I did feel better upon waking up.  Approximately one week later I experienced a sever migraine with visual disturbances.  On 3/15/21 I began having  a Crohn&#39;s flare. I had been in remission for 3.5 years with my last colonoscopy in October of 2019 showing  this and that my Crohn&#39;s ulcers had improved. I went to the ER on 3/16/21 in severe pain, was found to be in a flare with inflammation and swelling in my small intestine and a partial blockage. I was admitted to the hospital for 2 days where I received IV steroids and fluids. I was sent home on oral prednisone and now have to add additional medication to my Humira regimen for my Crohn&#39;s.  I am sure that some will say that none of this is related to the Moderna vaccine I received, but I have had no issues with my Crohn&#39;s in 3.5 years until I had this vaccine. All of my issues this past month coincide with receiving the vaccine and I have never had any side effects whatsoever from the Humira. In fact, it&#39;s always made me feel better when I&#39;ve been due to take it, so I know that my symptoms are not from the Humira. I cannot say for sure if the vaccine caused my issues, however, it&#39;s pretty coincidental that I was feeling good and otherwise healthy until I had this vaccine.

                                                I developed a sudden, sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my head while at work. I had not fallen nor had any injuries/illness. I went to ER; CT scan was concerning for clot in sinus so I was sent via ambulance to inpatient neurology where further MRI/MRV scans determined it was not in fact a clot, but a small bleed of unknown origin. Again, I had no injuries. I was hospitalized while multiple scans were completed along with lab work. Home now following up with neurology, still have head pain, unable to fully work, etc. Hematoma is still there but not growing.

I don?t plan to get vaccinated again if this is what I have to go through every time.

The next day, the aches were subsided but I felt tired and sleepy with sore arm the entire day. I went to sleep early and lasted for 11 hrs  (something that is unusual for me).

She was diaphoretic at the onset of symptoms she was able to follow commands and answer questions but that became increasingly difficult. Symptoms worsen and patient started to vomit. Ambulance was called but patient refused to go with them. Felt better approximately 40 minutes after being vaccinated. Left accompanied by her husband.

                                                This is another reaction I experienced. My  left arm started to be sore again  8 days after vaccination, on 1/7/21 (I originally had sore arm on left the first 3 days of vaccination but then it was recovered).  I also feel there is some weakness on my left arm as well.  I wonder if this is a delayed reaction and if it would be permanent? I previously filed  an report on early adverse events-left arm soreness within an hour of vaccination, then spread  across shoulder, in the middle of night, I woke up with whole body muscle ache that lasted till next morning. The next day of vaccination, I was tired , yawning frequently and very sleepy. I slept for 11 hours on the second night of vaccination which was unusual for me. The sore arm disappeared after about 3 days. But 8 days later it occurs again with some weakness on upper left arm.

                                                Thursday night shortly after the vaccine I was exhausted and headed home to go lay down. While driving, I developed a severe headache. I went home and went to sleep really early. Friday morning, woke up, went to work. Extreme lethargy and severe headache. Left work early (2 ish) with joint pain, headache, lethargy. In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and &#34;buzzing&#34; throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled. Still lethargy and dizzy yesterday but no joint pain, no nausea. Now, Monday morning, still dizzy/lightheaded. Symptoms are subsiding, but not gone.

Fever (100.5) and chills within 16 hrs of vaccine; extreme fatigue and mild headache. 48 hours after vaccine: headaches that became a migraine, fatigue continued but less severe than previous day,  and runny nose (no further fever or chills). 72 hours after vaccine:  headache/migraine, but no other symptoms. Migraines resolved once I took my Rx (Maxalt).  **I think it is important to note I tested positive on Oct 14th, 2020; my symptoms were mild/moderate (headaches, runny nose, very mild fever, lost of taste and smell, fatigue; all symptoms resolved after 10 days, with the exception of lost of taste and smell which I still struggle with).

                                                When I woke up on Dec 31 (the day after my shot), my face was swollen and my the area around my eyes was very swollen. I began taking Benedryl and continued to take Benedryl every 4-6 hours over approximately the next 48 hours. Also, I originally had no injection site reaction, however, on Jan 9th, my right arm began to itch. Upon assessment, I noted a 1.5&#34; diameter red, warm area where the vaccine had been administered. This lasted for three days, and now, January 12th it no longer itches, and looks more like a bullseye that is approximately 2.5&#34; in diameter around where the redness was. I have also noticed that since the vaccine I feel cloudy or like I have a constant mild headache.

My BP was rather normal but  my heart rate was up to 125bpm.  I am uncertain when my heart rate regulated but do know I slept regularly that night.  I also have severe anxiety so I was hesitant to report this issue due to being unable to distinguish between the two.  Day after injection was sore arm, mild fatigue and headache for most of the day

                                                On the 1st day, I had a migraine. 2nd day (29th) fever, chills, nausea, vomiting - woke up with it and that lasted about four or five days And I had meds to treat it.. Went to work but had to leave work - acutely ill. When I went home, I had a rash across my abdomen. On the 30th I went to urgent care, I had a rash across my neck when I woke up. Rash kept spreading. They gave me a prescription for steroids and a cocktail of meds to reduce spread of rash. Watched me for 30 min to make sure I wasn&#39;t having airway restrictions and they sent me home. Had it for a week and a half. Went to PCP and came up with an action plan to get my next shot.

I got up tp get ready to go to work, I felt really  light headed while I was brushing my teeth but went in to work. I started felling shortened of breathe and achy. I started feeling  bad and told my Head Nurse and he took my BP and I have a fever. My heart beat was rapid. I went home, slept and had no appetite . The I ended up going to the Hospital  my chest was hurting bad in my lung area, everything about me just hurt I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  They did xray on my lungs, they were clear, my BP was still high, my heart rate had calmed down. They had me sit and relax. The next day I woke up and was ready to put my scrubs on, it was like nothing has ever happened to me. I felt worse with the vaccine then I did when I got the Covid, all I had with Covid headache.  Everything hit so rapid and fast after the shot.

                                                I received my second dose of the moderna vaccine on a Sunday at 10:30 am in my left deltoid.   Symptoms started with chills and swollen supraclavicular lymph nodes around 10:30 that night, and progressed to body aches,  joint pain, muscle pain,  and a low grade fever.   I was unable to sleep due to chills and pain.   The muscle pain would radiate down my arms and legs, and I would sometimes have a pinpoint sharp pain in the bottom of my left foot.  Symptoms persisted the next day, and also included extreme fatigue, nausea, and enlarged and painful axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  The  supraclavicular lymph nodes were large enough to visibly see.   A round rash/redness started around the injection site started on Monday as well.   This also occurred with the first vaccine, but is much larger this time.   Most symptoms had resolved as of Tuesday, except for fatigue and the rash which are still on going.

In the evening (around 1700), I began to feel muscle aches and pain in my joints (wrists, knees, ankles). I also felt fatigue and brain fog. My injection site (L upper arm) was sore, felt hot to touch and was about 5/10 pain-wise.  I took Tylenol 1,000mg PO and rested for the next 24 hours. The muscle aches and joint pain resolved after 24 hours. However, up to 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt extreme fatigue and could not resume my regular level of activity. After 48 hours, I returned to regular activities.

I took some ibuprofen but was still unable to sleep that night due to the discomfort. The next morning the swelling and pain was worse - I called and spoke to a nurse. Gave her my symptoms and medical history. She shared my concern about a possible DVT (I previously had a DVT in my right arm in 2008). I then went to the ER to have an ultrasound - Dr did rule out a DVT and stated that it was likely just an adverse reaction to the vaccine. Over the next several days the swelling went down, but a red itchy rash continued for the next 7 days.

                                                I had feverish symptoms - 99.6. Body aches were worse this time and headache was worse this time than first dose. It lasted until Monday the next week - so that was until January 25th when I finally started feeling normal. Tylenol was taken - 1000 mg - I took it every 6-12 hours. That helped. I also added benadryl - 25 mg - I took that every night because I was having a hard time going to sleep with body aches.

                                                I cannot think of an illness or previous vaccine response where I felt worse than I did following this vaccination. Fever 105.8F for roughly 54 hours. After the first 24 hours, the fever would reduce to about 103F with Tylenol. I continued to fever/chill intermittently (ranging from normal to 103F) until 5 days post-vaccination. Brain fog (inability to think or reason normally for about 5 days--the brain fog decreased over time--it was the worst when the ever was the highest) I took aspirin once, although I don&#39;t know why I chose aspirin and not Tylenol. I wasn&#39;t thinking very well. Rigors-duration of the fever, very strong and intense Body aches-severe Headache-possibly the worst I have ever experienced Fatigue Enlarged/swollen lymph node, very painful,  (right side/side of vaccine)--roughly 2 1/2-3 inches in diameter. Weakness--barely able to get out of bed when I absolutely need to use the restroom. Required help. Nausea/Loss of appetite-I did not eat while the fever was high. I struggled to even drink water My reaction symptoms were what I anticipated but much for profound than I expected.

                                                I had immediate pain with the first dose. Within 24-48 hrs I experienced sever pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite. The fatigue tapered off after about a week, but did not fully resolve, I attributed the signs and symptoms to an immune response.. I received my second dose of Moderna on 2\7\21. The reaction was significantly more intense, the body pain( not aches, this was racking pain) was bad enough that I nearly called an ambulance. After 12 hours of pain, I slept for almost an entire day, and was exhausted for a week. Depression and apathy made activities of life almost impossible.  I do have fibromyalgia, and its like the worst never ending flare. The fatigue won&#39;t break. Depression and mental fog will not lift either. I will discuss with my doctor what,if anything, can be done. But it just really hit me this morning that I&#39;m not getting better.

                                                Had the injection Friday evening. Very quickly had my heart rise and felt shaky (like when you take an inhaler). Heart rate stayed up for about 30 min, shaky for about another 1 and half.  but left factily after 15 minutes, as I was shaky, but ok.  About 20 min after shot, the tip of my tongue and lips got tingly/numbish. Not swollen, just tingly.  (They were very slightly the same way the next day). I went home and contacted  hotline. She suggested I call a dr. I called a dr who told me to take a benadryl.  I ate some food and took the benadryl. I fell asleep and slept for 14 hours (definitely not normal). That next day (Saturday) I had a headache, upset stomach, lowgrade fever (below 99.9) and pretty good pain in the injection arm. Stomach was settled by that evening, headache was gone Sunday. Off and on low grade fever (highest was 100.3) still ongoing (Tues 3/2, but highest today is 99.1))

                                                about 2 minutes after receiving the shot I felt like I was having an allergic reaction in my chest area. My lower esophagus got extremely tight and then it worked its way up to the back of my throat. It felt like there was a lump in the back of my throat, along with burning in my throat. This same reaction also occurs when I eat certain foods I&#39;m intolerant to. I felt very dizzy right after as well. After exactly one hour my throat symptoms went away but suffered from residual effects for the next few days.  The next day I couldn&#39;t lift my left arm(which went away 2 days later), I was out of breath with everything I did, dizzy, muscle cramps, chills, body aches(as though I had the flu) and had extreme fatigue. All of theses symptoms lasted for the next week almost two.

                                                The patient had a previous reaction to a flu vaccine.  She was treated for Bell&#39;s Palsy related to the flu vaccine 3 years ago.  The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

                                                Felt a burning sensation in my hands right after getting the shot.  Went home,  took 2  Aleve and iced my arm for 5 minutes at a time on and off about 4 times.  Hours later,  about 8 pm I was laying down on the couch on my left side for at least 20 minutes.  When I was getting up my upper left arm was very numb and I had a strange sensation on my left side like my blood had pooled over there but it was very numb in the area.  I never have felt anything like that.  The sensation did go away over the course of a few minutes.  Soon after I was having shooting pain in my hands.  It felt like arthritis pain.  This did not last too long but came back here and there.  My lower back started hurting a little bit out of nowhere.  And then when I went to bed I started having random body aches all over.  Like brief shooting pain in different parts of my body.  I did have some dryness, weird sensation in my throat at times. The body aches kept me up until 2 or 3 am.  It was resolved by the time I woke.  I never felt that I had a temperature.  And I was not sick prior so I felt it was a cause and effect from the vaccine.  I took 2 Aleve and I went to work.  Temperature checked at work and I was 97.1,  normal.  Wore a mask all day,  social distanced at work and I had mentioned to my manager upon arrival that I had symptoms/reaction? after my shot.  I did still have some residual,  arthritis type pain in my hands during the day and more so when I got home.  I also felt fatigued when I got home from work but I was half awake most of the night before due to the body aches.  Felt pretty good,  normal on the second day after the vaccine.

When I woke up in the morning to get ready for work I felt very weak.  I walked into my bathroom and lost conciousness.  I woke up on the floor and had hit my forehead on the tile floor.  I was confused when I got up, and proceeded to get into the shower.  I then passed out again in the shower and hit the back of my head against the shower wall.  My husband found me as I woke up on the shower floor.  He called my doctor and took me to the emergency department on doctors advice.

                                                &#34;I received my first shot and had only a little arm discomfort. I received my second Moderna shot Friday (1/22) at 1:50 PM. Approximately 8 hours later I suddenly became very tired. I could barely manage to get out of bed at 2 PM on Saturday to take my temperature. My temperature was 102.3 (I?m normally around 97.4 per my morning COVID symptom checks 2x/week). I had aches, chills, joint pain, extreme fatigue, and injection site pain, redness and bruising. I was so out of it that I am not sure I would have been able to navigate taking a fever reducer, eating food, and other basics. My partner assisted me with these things. The first round of Tylenol on Sunday eventually got me to 99.5 or 8 or some such. I continued to take Tylenol throughout Saturday and Sunday. Sunday I woke feeling fatigued and out of it, but definitely on the mend. Sunday late afternoon/ early eve, even more like myself. Today (Monday 1/25) generally back to normal&#34;

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine at my workplace at 10:12am on 1/14/21 and waited the 20 minute observation period with no problems. I returned to my work station and noted a &#34;typical&#34; sore arm and slight fatigue. Appx. 5-6 hours later, the soreness increased significantly and was very uncomfortable. Tylenol 1300mg helped me fall asleep that night. The second day, the pain continued at the deltoid muscle and I was unable to raise my arm more than 90 degrees. The pain interrupted my ability to go about my daily activities or perform my job duties. That second night, the pain was debilitating to the point of crying and Tylenol was not helping. The third day, the severe arm pain continued and I was still in tears. I could not even raise my left arm to the level of my wait. I switched to ibuprofen with moderate success.   By the fourth day, 1/18, the pain had rescinded. I had little to no pain for the next four days (1/19/21 to 1/23/21). On Saturday, 1/23, I noticed my left arm was becoming sore again. Over the past three days, the soreness and pain have returned and have limited my ability to use my left arm. The arm pain disrupts my ability to get a good night&#39;s sleep as there is no position of comfort. When not moving, my left shoulder feels sore and uncomfortable. When moving my left arm, I feel pain when moving it in certain motions/directions. My range of motion is reduced and this along with the pain is disrupting my ability to drive my car, reach for objects and take a shower.   Because it has now been 12 days since my vaccine, I went to urgent care for help this morning. Because the pain left and then returned again, the physician determined that my mechanism of injury is not mechanical in nature, but most likely related to inflammation caused by the vaccine. She prescribed me an anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxers, and home physical therapy exercises to see if we can improve my condition. She also recommended me to file this report with VAERS.

On 1/21/2021 I went to visit the optometrist and was immediatley referred to the  opthamologist for a same day appointment. I was told it looked like a herpetic keratis (HSV 1 virus) by both physicians. I have a left corneal transplant. I have never had an HSV virus affect my eye in the past. The last fever blister I had was &gt; 5 years ago.  Treated with maxitrol qid, Acyclovir five times a day, Cyclogel bid. Severe light sensitivity resolved after about 24 hours.  On f/u appointment on 1/26/2021 he said that the herpatic lesion was looking better. Eye pain resolved. I am continuing medication.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine I began to feel light headed, dizzy and my heart rate was climbing. I wear an Apple Watch and notice my heart rate was steadily climbing. I asked the exit secretaries to be seen by a nurse and as they were getting a nurse my heart rate reached 169 and I was feeling faint and beginning to shake. When the nurse came she noticed how white my hands were and my breathing was becoming labored. The nurse called a code white and an ICU nurse and respiratory specialist arrived to assess me. I thought I would pass out and they had me lay on my back with legs up. They tested my blood sugar and were assessing my vitals. My breathing was fast but I was still able to breathe. My heart rate started to slow down but remained somewhat high. they helped me into a wheelchair and escorted me to the emergency department. I was assessed for cardiac concerns and labs were taken. After a couple of hours in the ED the dizziness started to subside but I had excessive thirst and dry mouth and slightly swollen tongue. I had feeling of butterflies in my stomach off an on. My heart rate stabilized and I was cleared to go home after four hours.

After about 20 minutes, I grabbed my water bottle and both arms felt weak when I lifted them and they felt like they were floating. I had a sudden urge to cry when this happened that lasted for 30 seconds.  I was not anxious or nervous to take the vaccine but my body may have overreacted to the sensation of my arms but it didn&#39;t feel like a panic attack that I had a few in my earlier 20s after the birth of my child and undiagnosed thyroid disorder.

                                                I felt tremendous body aches all day (the following day), my skin even hurt to touch lightly and a headache.  I took Motrin and even needed Vicodin for the pain.  No fever or nausea.  This is still better than getting COVID and I am just reporting for data purposes.  I was told that this symptom could occur after the second dose.  Some people are talking about blood type being a factor, I am not sure if that is true, but I am A&#43; if that helps. Vaccine on Friday, Saturday felt horrible and Sunday was back to normal.

Sore arm started as slightly sore, became extremely sore within an hour, and remained extremely tender for 24 hours. Within 36 hours pain decreased. On day 5 barely noticeable. I noticed a sensation of racing heat at times, dizziness occasionally, feeling of anxiety, slight headache on day 5. Day 5 also very dizzy.

                                                Within 5 minutes after shot my lips were feeling tingly. at 15 minutes out a co-worker sat by me and I told her about my lips and she commented that I had a large red mark/rash on my neck. I went to the nurse and she asked if I was nervous - which I was. She told me that I should take a Benadryl. I took a single Benadryl.  I went home and was still feeling the tingling sensation and had the rash which had spread onto my chest.  I took another Benadryl about one hour after the initial shot. This reduced the rash and tingling sensation. as it wore off about 4.5 hours later the rash, tingling lips and facial swelling started to appear. I took two more Benadryl and called the on call doctor at my physicians office.  He advised me to continue taking Benadryl until 48 hours after the vaccine, I did this every 4-5 hours including waking during the night to keep up on it. I was also taking Advil at this point to try to help with the swelling and a dull headache that had set in. I should note that I have never had any facial injections or anything like unto it. For 40 hours post vaccine I did this. After 48  hours the symptoms seemed to go away. I did start feeling a metallic taste in my mouth that night and the following night so I took a single Benadryl at bedtime those nights and that seemed to resolve it. I have had a slight cough and congestion on days 3-6 when I woke up in the morning, but that would resolve itself within an hour of being up. The doctor on call that I spoke with the first night did advise me to still get the second dose, but to take some Benadryl ahead of time and to make sure that the clinic has a current EpiPen on site.

Intense body aches in whole body, especially back  and vey painful injection site. I halos had a headache and trouble sleeping. I too Tylenol at 5:00 a.m. and was able to sleep three hours. I took Tylenol/ibuprofen every 4 hours until evening. I was fatigued all day and spent the day sleeping/resting, which is very unusual. By 4:00 p.m.  I was mostly feeling normal. Other than arm pain, I am fine today.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA:  Around 4pm, began having normal side effects of fatigue, headache. That night at 12:30am, woke up with temp (99.9) and had chills. Was shaking so badly from them, i was having uncontrollable hand tremors and couldn&#39;t use my finger to type on my phone. Was awake for the rest of the night. In the morning had a 101 , also had loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, nausea, headache, weakness.  But the adverse event I&#39;m reporting is blurred vision. I think it began around 12pm on Wed, so almost 24 hours the shot. It was primarily my left eye. There was also a great deal of pressure from behind the eye. It was difficult to read. After about 2-3 hours it passed. It returned briefly again in the evening, although more mild. Today (2/4/21) when I woke up, my vision is fine and the pressure behind the eye is gone.

                                                I got after the first dose what some people are to experience after their second dose.  This could be because I had Covid in November and probably have circulating antibodies already.  My right arm had 10/10 pain starting around midnight waking me up and was persistent with any movement which extended up into my neck and down to my elbow area.  Ibuprofen and tylenol did not help with the pain. Currently on post-vaccine day 3 I still am unable to get full ROM to my right arm due to pain but it is better than yesterday.  Other symptoms I had was the fevers, chills, headache, extreme hypersensitivity to my skin, and bone pain with movement especially to my hips and back with walking which seems to be subsiding.  whole body aches/pain which seems to be subsiding as well.  What I don&#39;t see mentioned in a lot of the expected side effects is TINNITUS.  I am experiencing moderate tinnitus.  I have experienced this previously in my 20&#39;s when taking a full dose of aspirin and I avoid aspirin products because of that.  I did not see anywhere that there is aspirin products in these injections.  It has not subsided yet at this time and I am wanting to report this.  Not sure if others are experiencing this as well.

                                                The first shot I received on December 28th.  I have fatigue and a headache for about three days and my arm did hurt for close to 2 1/2 weeks,  the second week it was red, 3 inches in diameter, raised, also it itched very badly for 4-5 days.                I received the second maderna vaccine on 1/28/21 about 5:45 pm. I had noted about 8 pm mild burning to the lower part of my legs and bottom of my feet that evening.  Later I started to have mild nausea about 9 pm, but it resolved, and I went to bed.  I woke up about 3:11 with diarrhea and my body and mainly &#34;my skin&#34; started to hurt, as if someone was taking a wire brush to my legs, and slowly pulling out each hair, but at one time. After another hour or so, I started to have severe chills with increased nausea and more severe severe body/bone/joint pains. I took Tylenol at this time. I noted that the bottom of my ribs or rib cage hurt with breathing, also I had upper abdominal pain, severe lower back pain and a headache. The next morning I stayed in bed all day and took a few baths, I had multiple episodes of diarrhea. I was nauseated, but no vomiting.  I still had chills, bodily shaking, fatigue, muscle and joint pain.  I tried to sleep off and on through the day.  That evening I did have a temperature of 101.4 with using Tylenol and Motrin.  It did come down later that evening, but I still had severe pain of my body and my skin hurt, even the hair on my head, during the night about 2:45 am I took a bath and that did help with my body.  on Saturday evening I was able to start getting up and moving around, but a severe decreased appetite. I&#39;ve noted a drastic change in taste since having the vaccine and have lost 9 lbs in the past week.  I am able to taste, but everything has a different taste.  I have had two covid tests PCR&#39;s in order to return to work.  I also have had the continued bilateral leg burning from the calves to the bottom of my feet.  The sensation is if you are cold outside and come back in and run your hands or feet under warm water to warm them up and that pain you feel when they warm up is how they feel, but on a milder level than that pain.  I also have had post nasal drip that has started in past 5 days and while at work in the ER on Tuesday I had a PA look at my ears and I had a large amount of fluid behind both ears.  I had a zpack that I had at the pharmacy that I had refilled and have taken that for the past four days with some relief.  I still feel fluid in my ears, but mildly better.  The headache and fatigue is getting better each day.  My appetite is still very diminished as well as how things taste in my mouth, it is way different than anything I have ever experienced before.  I also had an Issue on Monday 2/1/21 when I was working, I felt in my brain, as if it was just not as sharp, cloudy. I had an issue with typing on my right hand for a few hours (upper row on rt side) that has since resolved, but it was a truly &#34;off&#34; day.  It has taken me this entire week to start to feel even a bit more back to human.  So what remains- the bilateral leg to bottom of feet weird burning sensation, decreased appetite,  taste alterations, post nasal congestion with bilateral fluid in ears, shortness of breath with activity, mild burning in lungs with activity (working out/running in the cold weather).           this was just a side note that was copied to the bottom.       I was unable to touch my arm right arm due to swelling and pain for about three day, which I know is to be expected and actually wasn&#39;t as sore as long as the first shot.  I did take a few doses of Motrin 800mg but tried to stay with Tylenol and Zofran, and hydrate.              I noted that warm baths helped the most and the use of a heating pad on my lower back and an ice pack on and off my head for the headaches.   Thank you

From the time of injection until current, chills, intermittent low grade fever, headache and body aches different from my normal aches. Worse GI issues, memory issues worse than normal, feeling of disorientation at times, little difficulty catching my breath (only used rescue inhaler once). I felt a bit better about a week and a half post injection. But, then, started to feel worse, including vaccinated arm feeling heavy and sore again - February 27, 2021 - noticed reddish/ pink abnormal circle around injection site this is new, delayed, overall worse malaise, I felt a general feeling of yuck. I know it?s not a great descriptor, but, it kind of fits. Basically, lupusy, but worse.

                                                2/2/21 1st Moderna shot was at 10 am, by 4 pm I was shaking uncontrollably with chills.  I had on fleece pjs and three blankets laying in front of fireplace and could not get warm.  Headache out of this world.  Every joint in my body hurt.  My ankles were so swollen I could barely walk.  I missed three days of work.  3/4/21 2nd dose of Moderna.  Same as above only joint pain was much worse.  Chills and then breaking out in sweats.  I?ve missed two days of work as of now with this shot.  It?s really wiped me out.  I haven?t been able to eat or sleep much because I hurt so bad.  My knees, ankles, and neck seem to be the worst.  I?ve never experienced joint pain as bad as these two times.  I could barely walk to the bathroom.

                                                2am woke up with severe chills and a severe migraine. At 10am severe migraine progressed to skin on scalp feeling like it was pulled too tight. From there I began to feel an internal tremor in my head, almost like if you ran a jack hammer all day and then stopped, that shaky, off-kilter feeling.  I used the bathroom that morning and had massive diarrhea, experience a vaso/syncope episode and passed out.  All week I felt like this and experienced nausea, dizziness, heart palpitations, severe migraine, internal tremor, severe anxiety and severe thirst.  By Friday, 2/26/21, it got so bad and my blood pressure dropped to 112/50, that I was taken via ambulance to the ER.  They gave me IV fluids, ran labs, EKG, etc.  Blood pressure went up to 137/91.  Released to rehab at home.  2nd ER visit to Hospital on Sunday where they repeated labs, EKG, gave me fluids and treated symptoms. Both trips I was labeled Tachy.

I took Tylenol for the fever, which did not really work until 3/4/2021.  Fever finally broke to just under 100 by 3/4/2021 and was gone completely by 3/5/2021. Headache was gone by 3/4/2021.  All other symptoms have subsided by 3/5/2021.

                                                Received vaccine on 3/3/21 at 2:30pm. Waited for 20 minutes at pharmacy for allergic reaction. Given the all clear, so headed home. Around 5pm, I started noticing how extremely sore my left arm was, almost as if somebody had hit it with a baseball bat (no bruising, redness, etc., just VERY sore). I also started noticing numbness and tingling in my left arm that traveled down the outside of my arm into my left hand and into my left pinky finger.   As the evening progressed, I lost my appetite, developed a headache, felt extremely fatigued, was dizzy, had muscle and joint aches, had left kidney pain, and began to feel flushed and hot. I took my temperature and it showed I was running a low-grade fever of 98.7F (my normal temperature is anywhere between 96.9F and 97.1F). I went to bed around 9pm.  Around 3am (which is now 3/4/21), I woke up with nausea, and my left arm/hand/finger really experiencing numbness and tingling (it&#39;s as if that portion of my arm/hand/finger was semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was on the verge of throwing up. I broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed and went back to sleep.  Around 5am (still 3/4/21), I woke up again with nausea and my left arm/hand/finger still numb and tingling (semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was again on the verge of throwing up. I, again, broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed. I decided to take a Zofran around 6am for the nausea.  I slept from 8am-12pm on 3/4/21 due to the Zofran. When I woke up, I called the pharmacist at pharmacy to notify them of my symptoms. The pharmacist everything I experienced was normal and should go away in 2-3 days (if they didn&#39;t then contact my regular doctor), that I could take Tylenol for any pain, and I still needed to keep my follow-up appointment for the second shot.  The entire day on 3/4/21 from 12pm until I went to bed around 10pm, I still experienced an extremely sore arm, loss of appetite, slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, muscle and joint aches, left kidney pain, low-grade fever (for me), and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger.  I was able to sleep through the night, and woke up around 6am on 3/5/21. Currently, I am still experiencing an extremely sore arm, fatigue, and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger. I am EXTREMELY concerned about the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger as it does not seem to be getting better.

The next couple of days I felt lousy so I didn&#39;t work out. When I started to work out again on Friday, Feb. 26th, I noticed I couldn&#39;t lift my arm across my body or directly above without severe pain. My range of motion was immediately impacted. It&#39;s been six weeks and I cannot put on a shirt or take it off without pain. I&#39;ve had to modify my typical workout routine. The pain wakes me up at night when I shift positions.

                                                Have had tiredness since 2nd vaccine in February and noticed shortness of breath when walking or going up stairs in mid March.  Around 4/1, I started having left rib pain preventing me from sleeping on my left side and then could not breath during a massage on 4/8.   On April 9th, I was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms (clots) in both lungs, reducing my lung capacity to only 30% of normal.  This could be due to Loestrin birth control but I have taken hormones in the past for IVF and when younger for birth control.  The reaction may be due to a combination of vaccine, Loestrin and iron but triggered by vaccine.  I am currently on Eliquis to treat pulmonary embolisms.

                                                12 hours after my 2nd dose of Moderna I felt somewhat nauseated and my abdomen felt sore. 18 hours after 2nd dose I started running a low fever of 100.7. The following day my fever jumped to 102.6 at 2pm and fever continued to return every 3 to 4 hrs. My abdomen aches when I have fever. The following day (Friday night) I went to sleep at 10:30 with a fever of 101, rooks some Tylenol and woke up at 12:30 to a 104.3 fever and severe chills. It took two hours, a cold bath and 4 Advil gel capsules to bring fever down to 101.5. This fever has continued and I still currently have a high fever, all day every day, every 3 to 4 hours.   My body is somewhat achy and I have mild to medium headaches off and on.  I met with a nurse practitioner and she ordered a RESPIRATORY PATHOGEN PANEL WITH COVID-19. I tested negative for all viruses.   I am managing the fever by setting alarms on my phone for every 3-4 hours so I don?t forget to take a fever reducer.  It?s a total nightmare. When will it end?  My appetite is also v small and I am weak. I am truly exhausted from this unending high fever.

After another hour at 6:30 pm, I felt a strong headache coming on. Throughout the evening I was drowsy and went to bed early.  In the middle of night, I woke twice due to headaches.  This morning 1/8/2020, my headaches continued even after I took 1000mg of acetaminophen at 11:00am.  That was my first dose of any type of pain medication.  I thought the side effects would go away therefore I delayed taking any pain medication.  I usually do not have headaches and healthy.   My arm is very sore at the injection site as compared to when I received the flu shot in November.   It is almost 2:30pm almost 24 hrs from the injection and my headache continues.

Was monitored on site by EMT for 45 minutes.  It did not seem to get much worse so, went home and took Benedryl.  About 1 hour later symptoms started to subside.  Next day, sore arm and still have a strange feeling in my tongue and lips.  Teeth feel a little numb or swollen.  Feels like I have lost some of my sense of taste on my tongue.

I began vomiting shortly thereafter and continued to vomit for several hours. It wasn&#39;t until late the evening after the vaccine that I was able to hold down solid food. The headache continued until the next day and I experienced extreme fatigue (Although that&#39;s likely due to the lack of sleep and vomiting for several hours).

                                                By 5:00pm the injected arm was very sore.  That night I woke up at 3:00am with total body aches and was unable to sleep anymore.  The next day the arm was still very sore and I had very little energy and total body aches.  I self medicated with 600mg of Ibuprofin several times through out the day.  My injected arm was 4 degrees warmer on the surface than my non-injected arm; as measured with an infrared thermometer.   I felt like when I had actually had Covid 91 days prior.  The next day I was about half as bad as the day before, and I was able to return to work on Monday.  The injected arm remained sore for more than a week at the injection site.  I also experienced some swelling of lymph nodes under my arm.

                                                My upper arm swelled. The site turned red and I now have a hardened, red area about the size of an egg. I also developed severe chills, fatigue, insomnia, diarrhea about 12 hours after receiving the injection. The symptoms improved after approximately 24 hours. I am still fatigued and my arm is no longer swollen other than the area the size of an egg.

My blood pressure spiked, temperature spiked to 101, heart rate was elevated and continued to be elevated for about 12 hours, and there was a rash across my chest and upper arms. On 1/14, I was extremely tired. On 1/15, I had a sore throat, headache, and still slightly tired. As the days went on, the cold symptoms got progressive worse. Extremely congested, runny nose, extremely painful headache, coughing up pflegm, sore throat, etc. On Wednesday, 1/20 I had a fever of 101. I had these cold symptoms for a week and a half and that was when I called my doctor. She gave me an antibiotic.  I was on the antibiotic 1/26 - 1/30.  Today is 2/4 and I&#39;m still coughing.   Something weird also happened, smells changed.  My coffee smelled awful and other things seemed extremely strong.

                                                1/28- Moderna vaccine to left deltoid approximately 1000 AM. Felt fine the rest of the day. Very tired in the evening and went to sleep early. Took PM medications- Xyzal 1 tab PO HS, Xanax 0.5 mg PO HS. 1/29-Woke to Left arm was sore, felt like I had received TDap injection, like I was punched in the arm- localized to Deltoid.  Took AM medications as normal- Wellbutrin XL 150 mg QD, Effexor 75 mg QD, B12 SL, Multivitamins QD As the day progressed, left arm soreness and discomfort became more pronounced and then went from localized to circumferential to left arm. Also noted discomfort and soreness to left axilla and soreness to left lateral/posterior cervical neck area. Became increasingly tired, weak, left arm was weaker than right arm with grip.  Headache was pounding and predominantly bilateral temporally.  Decreased appetite. Non productive cough.  Mid day, started to have freezing bilateral upper and lower extremities. Applied wool socks and clothing layers to accommodate. Temperature to forehead was 99.0, Right ear 101.4 and Left ear 102.0. Pulse ox 97% on room air. Took 1 gram APAP prophylactically, also took Zicam SL. Tolerated as much PO fluids as possible, water.  Increased flu like signs and symptoms for the rest of the day, no actual fever recorded. Literally had on thermals, top and bottoms. 2 pair of wool socks, gloves, and a hoodie. Wrapped in bed with 2 blankets.  Through the night, had discarded all clothing and remained in shirt and had sheet covering. Difficult night sleeping with the soreness to left arm and left axilla, was not able to get comfortable.  1/30- Woke, still, felt signs and symptoms of flu, body aches, pains, weak, tired, and decreased appetite.  A noticeable audible wheeze, shortness of breath with minimal exertion, and persistent dry cough. Cough remained non-productive.  All other signs and symptoms from the day before remained and the soreness to the left upper arm, left axilla, and left neck. Flu like signs and symptoms were just as intense as day before. Chills were consistently inconsistent with start and end, noticeable bilateral hands and feet were freezing. Afebrile, pulse ox 97% room air . Continued to treat prophylactically with APAP and Zicam, po fluids, rest.  1/31- Difficult night sleeping again related to discomfort to left side of upper torso. Felt a little better concerning weakness and being tired. Headache subsided some from it?s intensity. Started to have stomach discomfort, diarrhea, and remained short of breath with minimal exertion. Felt as if I was not able to expand my lungs to their full capacity, thus yawned a lot and had to continue to try to expand lungs. Continued to have flu signs and symptoms (not as intense as past 2 days), diarrhea STARTED, and feeling tired continued. Shortness of breath decreased in severity and lungs continued to feel a decline in expansion with inhalation. Continued to treat prophylactically and rest. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/1- Difficult night sleeping related to left upper torso soreness and discomfort. Diarrhea continued into this day. No nausea. Tolerating PO fluids; however, feeling weak and tired.  Left upper arm soreness and discomfort less than initial onset. Left axilla remained sore and left side of neck. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/2- Diarrhea subsided, flu signs and symptoms continued to decrease in initial intensity. Shortness of breath not as extreme; however, continued to feel as if not able to expand lungs to full capacity. Left upper arm soreness and discomfort almost resolved, left axilla beginning to decrease in soreness along with left side of neck. Only prominent s/s is feeling tired and inability to expand lungs to full capacity. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/3- Feeling 95% better, closer to baseline. Worst days were the first 2 after the injection; however, still remain unable to expand lung capacity to full expansion with inhaling, thus requiring multiple attempts and yawning. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile 2/4- 99% to baseline and feeling better, continue to have decreased expansion of lung capacity. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile

Day 3, felt fine. I could lift arm without any issues.  Day 4 to 5, started feeling the worse kind of fatigue, mild headache, all over body ache like my actual joints hurt and head feels pressure like it is in a fog.  I have a stuffy nose.  It is now February 5th and I still feel this way.  Everyone else I talked to had  just a sore arm and recovered within a day or two.  This is my 1st shot and I go back on February 26th for second shot.  I was asked by pharmacist that administered vaccine to report any side effects since this is a new vaccine.

It was sore from my neck down to just below my elbow. I began having chills and a low grade temp shortly after that. by 0130, I was dizzy, experiencing diarrhea, with episodes of diaphoresis, and acute nausea. I felt that I had some postural hypotension, was very pale and every time I would get up to walk I felt like I was going to end up on the ground. I remained in bed for approx. 16 hours before I felt like I comfortable even getting up and going to restroom. I still have intermittent dizziness, with syncope to this date.  I had to leave work early as well as calling in sick for the next shift.

                                                8 days after the vaccine, I developed a blotchy red rash that trailed down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was red, swollen and painful to touch. Mild itchiness noted on that arm. Otherwise, I was fine. Just seemed strange so long after the vaccination. It improved without intervention and was gone within 2-3 days. I did not seek professional help because I read that this reaction was noted with the Moderna vaccine and that it was just considered a mounting immune response and no cause for concern.  However, I still thought I should report it. I have since received the second dose of vaccine on 2/19/21. I had moderate side effects starting on 2/20/21 (lasting 15 hours) of fatigue, chills, body aches, joint pain, headache, generalized body swelling, swelling and pain at injection site and brain fog. I didn?t experience a rash (yet- the vaccine was only 3 days ago). Will update if that changes.

                                                Around 11 pm on 2/20/21 I had a sore neck. I began to get achy in the middle of the night and could not sleep. On 2/21 around 9:00am I had a fever of 101F and was very achy, tired and had a mild headache. At 7:00pm on 2/21 I had a fever of 101F and was still achy and had a headache. I took two regular strength Tylenol at 9:30pm on 2/21 and that took the edge off so I could sleep. I woke up on 2/22 feeling better but still had a sore neck and arm. The whole time I had a sore arm starting on 2/20 around 3pm.

                                                My left arm, where I received the shot, began hurting after a few hours. Approximately 12 hours after receiving the shot, fatigue began. Approximately two hours later, I was unable to walk, I collapsed on the floor, my heart was racing, I was sweating, my entire body went numb, and there was ringing and static in my ears. After about 20 minutes on the floor, I got back into bed. My fingers and hands wanted to curl up and not open and that lasted throughout the night. My arms and legs stayed numb all night long.  At around 24 hours post vaccine, the numbness started to subside, I could open my fingers and hands, and regular flu symptoms were present (fatigue, body aches, low grade fever). I could not work the day after receiving the shot. I slept all day. I was not able to drive until around 5PM the day after receiving the shot. The second night and throughout the following day (so 36-48&#43; hours post shot), I had cold sweats. It is now 3 days later and I still feel terrible. I am worried about getting the second Moderna shot.

My lips felt like they were drying out, my tongue felt like it was swelling and drying out, and it felt difficult to swallow.  The strong sensation only lasted a couple of minutes.  It is now 7:48 PM and I still have a &#34;very mild&#34; case where my lips feel they are either itchy or mildly burning and my tongue still feels weird and has a very mild metallic taste.  I did not have any issues with tasting anything.  I also have a very mild headache.

The next morning, I ended up have a lethargy reaction (9:00 am) - it was like I was a robot and I hd powered down. I couldn&#39;t sleep but I was sitting up and thought I was sleeping. I couldn&#39;t really talk. My co-workers were very concerned. Lasted a couple hours and I went home and I went to sleep and slept about 16 hours . I called off work the third day - I had slept so  much after that night before I had a  (first) gall bladder attack (in the middle of that 16 hours) it was very bad (the gall bladder attack). I had gall bladder attacks occur for the next few days. I ended up getting my gall bladder out last Friday - about a week ago. It was inflamed and full of pus. It was an emergent situation and I was hospitalized 18th and surgery on the February 19th. Lethargy eventually subsided (lasted a handful of hours)  and was then fatigued with no energy for about a week .

After day 3, I went to hospital thinking I had Meningitis because my head hurt so bad and my neck was stiff. They ran an urinalysis and found a pretty bad UTI.  The doctor said that the UTI exacerbated the side effects of shot. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true. I got I. V. Keflex and prescription. Migraine continued for another 3 or so days. I missed 4 days of work. Honestly the symptoms felt like I was doing chemo again. It was awful.

I still have leg achyness and dizziness that prompted me to call my doctor to note it in my chart. on March 1, 2021. I soaked my legs in an upsom salt bath for comfort.   I now have light bruises on my legs and some feet and left hand tingling/numbnes.  My heart rate is elevated at different times of the day with simple movement; walking to kitchen or bathroom. Some dizziness/brain fog at given moments throughout the day.

These continued until apx 24 hours later when additional mental fog set it, difficulty focusing attention, lethargy, trouble walking, dizziness then brief loss of consciousness occurred, extreme difficulty staying awake. I was taken to the emergency room where additional tests were done due to &#34;stroke- like&#34; symptoms.  Tests were okay with hospital staff reporting that likely/only known cause was the COVID  vaccine given the day before. Symptoms have gradually reduced but occasional mental fog, occasional dizzy spells &amp; chronic fatigue persist.

Initially, I took 600 mg of Advil and seemed to help. But fever spiked 102.5 - symptoms get worse throughout the day. Advil brought down the fever some. Sleeping helped the most. These symptoms lasted about 48 hours. I missed a day and a half of work because of it.

Said they thought vertigo. That week pulse was going up and blood pressure spikes started. I also started to not see things as clear getting bad pressure in face and forehead. I then had ent do epley maneuver that helped with spinning. However feeling like I wanted to spin would still happen even though I wouldn?t spin. Headaches on and off everyday couldnt sleep right for weeks. Pulse and blood pressure still going up. Then I never had this anxiety that started. Heart doctor put me on a beta blocker that?s been helping. I am 8 weeks from first shot and still not myself. Been on beta blocker for a little over a week starting to feel better bc pressure and headaches are under control. I have been to neurologist also. No one can really explain. I did get the second dose bc doctor said to on Feb 24th. I was fine till I took the vaccine on Jan 27th

Five minutes after injection on 3/31/2021, c/o chest tightness followed by nausea and heaving.  Treated for anaphylaxis, transferred by ambulance to Medical Center; and discharged to home later that afternoon.  The employee worked her regular schedule 4/2/21 and 4/5/21 with no stated complaints.  On 4/6/21, received notification from the Employee that she was to be off work through 4/12/21 as her physician feels that the vaccine has damaged her heart.  She states she has a heart rate down to 38 BPM, experiences black outs, has left sided head pain and weakness.  Her personal physician is scheduling her for Holter Monitor and Echocardiogram.  Her physician has now stated she cannot work through 4/16/21.  I have no supporting written documentation from the physician for these medical concerns.

Day 2: residual headache (50%), tiredness, weakness, sweating if doing things, residual knee joint pain, sense of smell/taste returned and heightened. Day 3: residual headache (25%), still not 100%, residual knee joint pain. Day 4 (today):  residual knee joint pain (comes and goes). I realize that these are not symptoms of an allergic reaction, but severe side effects.

                                                Patient had chest pain post administration of vaccine.  Patient attributed this to heartburn after eating a large meal just before getting her vaccine (though she didn&#39;t typically get heartburn). Since the pain continued to persist her BP was taken and was 160/110.  Patient said it may also be nerves but she didn&#39;t feel particularly anxious.  She also stated she hadn&#39;t had her BP medication that morning.  Patient took a couple of Tums and her BP was rechecked a few times.  Each time the BP stayed above what the patient said was her normal even without BP medication.  Due to the persistence of her hypertension and chest discomfort she was taken to the ED to be evaluated.  Once patient was in ED she had an EKG, CBC with diff, CMP, and troponin.  Provider eventually ruled it as an anxiety reaction (not cardiac related).

I immediately took 100mg of Benadryl and went to hospital emergency room.  Approximately 30-40 minutes later symptoms started to lessen.  Once at the ER, at the same time symptoms began to resolve, I was given PO Solumedrol and Pepcid.  I was monitored and then discharged with RX for prednisone, and EPIPEN (to use if needed).  No other issues with allergic reaction.  Mild injection site soreness, mild body aches, 99.3 temp persist at 36 hours post injection.

                                                On January 19th, 2021, i received the first dose of the moderna vaccination right after the following day i began to feel pain in the area where the vaccination was given and i thought the symptom was a normal effect of the vaccination.

Redness, swelling and bump at injection site. 29 Jan pain spreading to neck and back area.

Patient was instructed on waiting in the store for a 15 minute observation period.

The pharmacy technician called 911 and the medics arrived and she went to the hospital. The husband had stated he though it was her anxiety.

                                                Day of vaccine I experienced brain fog for about 3 hours. Typical soreness in arm for a few days and bruising at injection site. Arm remained tender but not bad and no concern until day 8, which was yesterday. That is when I experienced itching around injection site and swelling. Day 9 (today) the area below injection site is red, swollen (hard), tender, and the left shoulder joint aches. No other symptoms to report and this seems fairly normal. I&#39;m going to watch closely and take action if there are adverse changes. As of now, this seems like a typical reaction.

                                                Within 40 minutes my arm started to ache badly.  About 15 minutes after that while I was driving my head started to feel strange - almost lightheaded.  Within a couple of minutes my eyes involuntarily went to the left and the right and then my vision went black (this all happened in a matter of seconds).  I stopped at a store and felt light headed and confused/brain fog.  That continued at home for around 2 hours.  The pain in my arm continued to get worse.   I woke up several times throughout the night with pain in specific sites.  Today I was unable to go to work because of the full body muscular and joint pain, muscular weakness, headache, pain behind the eyes, and feel like I have fluid in my head (kind of like when you have a cold).   I had a significant reaction after the first dose as well (1/5/21 Moderna Lot 026L20A) but it was completely different - mainly arm pain, fever, chills, extreme fatigue, and what feels like fluid retention.  I gained 9 pounds without changing anything diet/exercise following the injection. On day 10 a large red welt appeared on my arm at the site of the injection.  On 2/1 my Endocrinologist sent me for lab work and urinalysis.  Those results are not back.   I likely would not have reported any of this if it wasn?t for the visual occurrence with the mental confusion and lightheadedness. I have never experienced anything like that in my life.

                                                Nurse did hit a capillary and I bled immediately after injection- enough where it ran down my arm and went onto floor. I felt pretty okay except for the feeling of my arm hot and fuzzy and fuzzy fingers on my left hand until my &#34;leave time&#39; of 10:03 am. I stayed a little longer, and was home by 10:30 when I became extremely nauseous, dry heaving, left side of face numb. Headache started at 10:40. Tried calling medical facility but was on hold for soo long- no one answered so since I don&#39;t have insurance I decided to just rest and drink fluids. By 11:40 my face was back to normal, no longer nauseous but extremely lethargic and was the rest of the day. The following day I felt ok -slight swelling on my arm at injection site and a bruise that I still have.

                                                Within about 45 minutes of receiving the vaccine I started getting mild hives spreading around the injection site and across my belly. I had mild wheezing and feeling of loose fluid in my brachial area of my chest. Now at 24 hr out, hives are head to toe, and I took diphenhydramine at bedtime in addition to my loratadine each AM.  I&#39;ve used my inhaler twice to see if that helped - it doesn&#39;t, so it&#39;s not a regular asthma attack.  Today I have intermittently dealt with mild sweats, moderate chills, mild nausea, shakes (might be the inhaler as that sometimes makes me shake), headache fluxing between mild to moderate, eyes watering and lids swollen slightly with hives, injection site soreness, swelling about the diameter of a softball (interfering with ROM on left arm - I am an interpreter, so this interfered with work a lot today!), left arm from shoulder to elbow is hot to the touch, and I have had mild disconnects with my ability to focus/breaks in completing thoughts today.    I am keeping my EpiPens close, just in case.  I live 3 miles to the nearest ER, and someone is here with me just in case I need to go.

Approximately 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, I starting having neck and shoulder pain. I reached out to my doctors office on 2/4/2021 and I was informed that some people have experienced neck pain. I woke on 2/5/2021 around 2:00 in the morning with excruciating pain in my neck, rating my pain at a 10 using a pain scale from 0-10. Zero being no pain and 10 being the worst pain. The pain was slightly better throughout the day but I woke at 11:30 pm on 2/5/2021 with the pain again being at a level 10. I went to the ER where they told me it&#39;s a side effect from the vaccine. I will have missed 3 days of work so far.

I was very worried about the dark urine because I had history of hemolytic anemia. I went to ER and got diagnosed with Hemolytic Anemia after blood and urine test. Admitted to hospital overnight and dismissed with my request to do so with steroid prescription of steroid prednisone 20MG 3 tablets a day for 7days to suppress  my immune response for for the vaccine that believed to be one which triggered the Hemolytic Anemia. following up with Hematologist on Monday with extra blood draw to monitor my situation. Still not feeling well with fatigue, back lower pain and dizzeness .i still look yellow and urine dark .

                                                9th, in the late afternoon, I started feeling really cold and I started getting headache and a lot of arm pain. It hurt to reach out to grab steering wheel. I felt very tired. I checked my temperature - 100.5. I got really cold and shivering at about 6:00 pm and I could not warm up for about 2 hours. It went to 101.5. Horrible pounding headache and dizziness. I started having stomach issues and diarrhea but didn&#39;t vomit. That went through the night - I felt like I had the flu. Back of my  neck was really stiff and achy - from shoulders up to the back of my skull. I didn&#39;t sleep much. I woke up completely soaked in the morning. My fever had broken. SUnday, I felt a little better. Dull headache ( it came and went). My temperature would go up and down -96.8 - to 100.1-ish all day. When my temp went up I got a headache and fatigue and down my headache would be better. Rolling every four hours. Monday, I stayed at 99.2 to about 100.2. Stayed at that the whole day. I was really tired. I had trouble thinking and concentrating. My arm was feeling better by Monday. Monday afternoon, about 1:00 my fever went to 100.5 and I called the nurse then. She told me to call my doctor&#39;s office. They sent me to a call to a triage nurse and she advised me to get tested for COVID. So Tuesday morning,  the 12th,at 9:00 am - healthcare clinic - the results were negative for COVID. Tuesday, I was feeling a little better - fever stayed around 99.2 to just over 100 and the headache was dull. I wasn&#39;t quite as tired. Wednesday, I was feeling better - like I could go to work but I didn&#39;t because of my fever the day before. I went to work on Thursday or Friday. The whole next week then I was better and felt fine. I got the second dose February 1.

                                                Hours after my injection my arm was extremely sore; much worse than the first vaccination.  I could barely move it.  I got in the hot tub which did help a bit.  I didn&#39;t sleep well that night and kept waking up feeling achy and hot.  Around 6am my temperature was 101 degrees F, I felt fatigued, had body aches, and the area where I received the shot was very sore and a bit swollen, so  I took IBU 200 mg.  A couple hours later my temperature was 102 degrees, my fatigue and my body aches persisted , so I took another IBU 200mg.  Around noon I started to get what felt like a migraine but my temperature was back to normal so I took an Excedrin migraine.  My body aches, fatigue, and headache were resolving as the day went on although my arm was still very sore.  I was a bit fatigued the following day but much improved.  My arm soreness resolved after a few days.

                                                Like others I had dizziness, headache after first vaccine. After second Moderna again like others, I was extremely ill with forceful vomiting and nausea, massive headache, dizziness, fever, chills, body aches. Etc.  My concern is that since the vaccine I have been having periods of major headaches with slight nausea but also bouts of dizziness.  I have NEVER had headaches. I also never got nausea while I lift weights,  workout or sometimes after sex. It seems when my heart rate gets elevated I?m having these reactions.   I?m writing tonight because I got a migraine style headache with dizziness after sex and I?m getting anxiety that these symptoms will not go away. Wanted to report them to see if I?m not alone. I?m a very healthy 46 year old. Had blood work tested recently.  I tested my blood sugars during these episodes as well and I used a pulse oximeter to test oxygen and all normal.   Thank you

Almost fell down from feeling dizzy/out of it.  Had to drop to the ground and stay there for a while.  Within about an hour felt mostly normal again.  Did NOT take temperature or blood pressure, would have if I hadn&#39;t been in a state of fear/shock.  Also itchiness in left deltoid 12 days after the vaccination, fingers on left hand accompanied this itchiness.  Felt irritated in general at injection site up to two weeks after. Digestion affected - loose stools for the week after and increased gas up to a month after injection (current)

                                                I have had a fever that keeps topping 99.5 (avg was 100.1) since Friday night. (It is Monday night) My entire body still hurts. As I write this it is currently 99.3. I normally run low at around 97. 99.3 is high for me and feels pretty crappy.  I have had some heart palpitations. Some of the worst chills I?ve ever had. A few dizzy spells. Fatigue. My arm still REALLY hurts. I?m dehydrated and keep having muscle cramps (I?m drinking lots of water and pedialyte). You need to know how people are reacting to this. This is day 4. I have no energy. I do NOT feel good.

                                                Following the vaccine I was slightly dizzy, after 25 minutes my chest started to get tight, had difficulty breathing, racing heart rate, some constriction in the throat.  I was taken to the ER, used Proair inhaler on the way to ER to ease breathing,  O2 sat slightly decreased but returned to normal in the ER.  Due to difficulty breathing, I had some increased anxiety which lessened after breathing became easier.  Nebulizer treatment given in the ER.  Benadryl 25mg taken.  Rash on L arm and upper chest, burning and pain in L arm.  Benadryl taken for 2 days due to returning rash and burning in arm.  Nebulizer treatments every 4 hrs on the day of the vaccine due to continued tightness and difficultly breathing.  The following day I had fatigue, slight fever, pain of 7 out of 10 in L arm, headache, neck and muscle pain.  Followed up w/ primary care physician on 12/29/2020, he advised not to take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  L arm pain lessened to 4 out of 10 on 12/30/2020.  L arm pain dissipated on 12/31/2020, but headache, neck pain and fatigue continued through 1/1/2021

                                                Two hours after the injection, I started to not feel &#34;right.&#34;  My head felt heavy, I was getting a little dizzy and all I wanted to do was to lie down.  By the third hour, my body completely shut down.  I was so tired I had no energy to move, to talk, and even breathing was difficult (not because I couldn&#39;t breathe, just that the effort was difficult).  I was dizzy, nauseous, and lost my appetite.  My temperature was elevated, 98.5, but no fever.  I slept for 5 hours as if in a coma.  Woke up to drink water, felt total-body aches, and slept the rest of the night again getting at least 12 more hours of sleep.  At some point during the night, I had chills so bad my body was shaking uncontrollably.  I had 2 layers of clothes and 3 layers of blankets and could not warm up.  Day #2 (today), I have a tremendous headache, dizzy, nauseous, my heart rate is abnormally fast and I am out of breath.  My resting heart rate is typically upper 50&#39;s and is currently averaging in the 70&#39;s, jumping into the 90&#39;s often.   Sitting up, my heart rate is between 80-100 (which is typically my rate when I exercise).  When I stand up or walk to the other room, my heart rate is around 115-120 (typical of when I am running/sprinting or participating in taxing exercise).  Along with this, I am out of breath as if I am exercising, although I am barely moving around. All I am doing is laying down, only getting up to go to the bathroom and my body feels like I ran a marathon.  Breathing is difficult even at rest.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12 at 1:30pm I felt the onset of chills, body aches, headache, fever, and  nausea. Additionally, the area where the vaccine was administered (left upper arm) was tender to the touch and red. On the same day, at 5:00pm all symptoms were at an extreme level where I had to lie down to rest, however, the pain of the body aches, headache, and chills made it difficult to rest (sleep) On the morning of Wednesday, January 13 and throughout the day all symptoms were still at an extreme level making it difficult to function (unable to get out of bed, no appetite to eat due to the nausea,  unable to sleep due to the headache, extreme discomfort) these symptoms continued on this level throughout the morning, into the afternoon and into the evening On the morning of Thursday, January 14 all symptoms with the exception of the nausea and headache had subsided The headache and nausea subsided by 11am on Thursday, January 14. I am now feeling better and could eat and function.

                                                My initial side effect on Monday 1/11/2021, was slight dizziness after about 5 minutes. I was not impaired, and it faded after about 10 more minutes. The next day, the arm that received the injection was very sore and achy.  It was difficult to get dressed, and the ache was located from my collar bone to my elbow of the injected arm. This ache lasted 3 days.  My range of motion has returned. On Wednesday (48 hours post injection) I began to develop an itchy rash on the insides of my arms in the soft tissue area.  I took two benadryl last night and applied benadry cream to the rash.  This morning, 1/15, the rash has spread down my arms onto the back of my hand, and onto my torso.  It is itchy.  Taking more benadryl, and I called my doctor.

The fatigue was debilitating in that I had a hard time getting out of bed and needed 10-12 hrs. Day to function at a minimum level such as cooking and going to work. Today is day 12 post vaccine and I am still experiencing this effect. I have contacted my doctor who advised me to go ahead and fill out.

                                                On 1/14/ 2021 @ aprox 6pm, the injection site suddenly began burning sensation and had a raised white ring around a red hot center. It began as the size of Suzanne b Anthony coin.  Over the course of a few hours the white rind turned I to a larger knot/lump the size of a silver dollar. I began feeling feverish and the entire arm ached. The itch was intense so I used topical anti itch cream in an attempt to subdue the sensation. It helped slightly. I also began oral antihistamines and a fever reducer , following protocol as if I had been stung by a bee/wasp and experience a similar reaction.  On 01/15/2021  in the am I decided to report my reaction via the V-safe app that was given in the pamphlet at the time of the drivethru clinic. It allowed me to set up my profile and make an initial report, however after an hour had passed my arm had continued to swell, itch, and become painful to use and I was unable to continue my daily activities. The swelling had a strange bruising appearance aprx 4inch in size  so I tried to report it to the app. At that point the app would not allow me to report and just kept sending sign in codes that would allow anything. Over the course of the next few days the app kept sending codes but would not allow for anymore updated reporting.  I decided to email our health department who had provided the drive thru vaccinations on 1/7/2021 and 1/8/2021. Thats was 1/14/2021. On 1/16/2021 a reply was finally received with only instructions to contact my person primary care physican. I do not have health care. health Department did send a link to this reporting form.  Today 1/20/2021 the redness and swelling have subsided leaving a faint 6inch discoloration under the skin. The shoulder joint and elbow joint ache dully and the bicep muscle spasms at times of use. Physically I feel better at the time of this statement. I did take a couple of pictures at the beginning of the reaction of the affected area/arm.  Others in our area on these same dates gave experienced delayed reactions to different degrees as well.

                                                Fatigue hit within a couple of hours; So tired and this was fall in to bed and be out. I slept for awhile - I rested all day the second day. I was getting dizzy and; muscle pain; a lot of joint pain (normally I&#39;m not in a lot of pain and never this tired). I needed a cane to walk I went to work on Wednesday and I had to leave early (11:30). Wed - horrible diarrhea Started getting a little confused and  still had dizziness and joint pain was bad. Couldn&#39;t take care of patients. Went to work on Thursday and I had to leave earlier yet that day - by 9:00 am - Started having chills  but didn&#39;t have fever and still had other symptoms and was getting confused.   Had an excruciating headaches and nausea (no diarrhea but extreme nausea) and that day started light and sound sensitivity - so bad. Was getting scared driving home - and had very slurred speech. Couldn&#39;t drive for a week after that(. My sister was on the phone with me helping me stay alert and drive safely on the way home from work on that Thursday.) Thursday when I got home. - had Telemed visit - Set up appt for a rapid COVID test - and a flu test so my sister drove me and I slept the whole way there. My sister said my speech was slurred; confused in my speech and I felt like that for three days. Both (Covid and flu) tests came back negative. Times when my sister couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying and I slept more than I was awake (Thursday - Saturday was like this). Took Imodium for diarrhea when I had that. For joint pain - I treated it by tramodal 50 mg and I can take it as needed and I usually don&#39;t need it but took it consistently during this time.  What scared me the most was I could feel my Hip Implant  - ball and socket joint from bone all the way to my femur( I had Right implant on Hip on May 2019) - which is healed completely but I felt it at this time. I still can&#39;t lay on my right side without pain - like a deep bone pain.  I was going to call my surgeon today.  January 4th visit with my Dr - for check-in - He gave me a clearance to go back to work on Wed the 6th. I work two days a week; I&#39;m on disability and so have been able to work since then. Right hip pain is still  a lot and bouts of dizziness and still have joint pain. Have to take a minute and a couple of breaths to stand up. Some days I do have to use may cane. Chills are gone.

                                                Dose 1 vaccination administered at 12.30pm on 1/18/2021 on RIGHT ARM. Felt arm pain and swelling 1 hour after getting vaccinated on day 1 with slight nausea and uneasy feeling till about 5 hours after vaccination. That feeling and nausea stopped, followed by chills and tiredness by late evening on day 1. No medication taken.   On day 2 (1/19/2021) morning felt better with tiredness and chills resolved on its own. However, pain and swelling on right arm increased and persisted till day 3 and then started to reduce drastically from then on.  On day 4, 5, 6 &amp; 7 (1/21/2021- 1/24/2021) felt back to my normal self again. No arm pain. On the night of day 8 (1/25/2021), felt pain on right arm again 2 inches below the injection site. Day 9 (1/26/2021) morning, noticed red colored skin rash about 3 inches wide and 4 inches in length located 2 inches below injection site. Rash was painful and slightly itchy.  Today is day 10 (1/27/2021, and rash still persists.

                                                Just prior to 5P had left arm pain -that traveled to my hand. At 5PM driving and heart rate went 128 - most likely higher (registered on iwatch). This is abnormal for me as my heart rate is typically in high 40&#39;s (marathon runner).  Along with the rapid heart rate felt like throat was closing - like a reaction caused by an allergy.  The rate rate stayed like that for about a minute or two followed by severe chills (chills can be described like when a person comes out of the OR).  I felt like I was coming out of my skin and became dizzy. I became nervous and called 911.  In discussion with the 911 dispatch everything subsided and decided I would continue driving with an intent to going to Hospital.  About 10 minutes later, prior to getting onto I95 the same cycle with increased heart rate followed by chills occurred again for about the same timeframe.  I do not know how far apart the cycle was occurring other than I ended up calling 911 again and Ambulance was dispatched while I was on I95 and I had pulled over.  Approx arrival of ambulance was about 6P Once in the back of the ambulance, I showed no arrhythmia and heart rate was now in the 70&#39;s, however I was still having the chills.  Decided to drive home after waiting about 20 minutes in the back of ambulance with no further issues of the tachycardia. Once I was home I continued with chills and a high fever throughout the night.  The fever did not go away until about 48 hours. The chills went away by the following morning. Thursday and Friday have had chest tightness and the feeling of needing to take large breaths to expand chest.  Continue to have moderate headache.

                                                The vaccine was administered incorrectly.  The IM injection was given too high on the left arm.  The injection immediately caused significant pain in the left shoulder which worsened throughout the day and into the following day.  The significant pain in the left shoulder has persisted and is accompanied by decreased AROM, decreased strength, and sleep disruption.  Treated with Ibuprofen 800mg q8h and ice with minimal benefit.  Saw PCP on 01/29/2021 who recommended continuation of same and ordered a PT referral.  Was unable to work for 3 days due to this complication.

                                                Covid vaccine time line 1st Moderna vaccine on 1 2 21 (Sat) given at PMH at 5:10pm.  Tired x 3 days with some cognitive issues noted (very slight..like forgetting things I never do?was slowly resolving but never completely went away.  I did not even mention this to anyone because I was not sure it was the actual vaccine, or just my brain.) 2nd Moderna vaccine on 1 30 21 (Sat) given at PMH at 2:40pm.  Immediately had more pain in L arm, swelling in upper arm and redness, fatigue. --Sun. 1 31 21:  woke up with a low grade fever, increased fatigue, chills, nausea, diarrhea, headache, body pain, joint pain (it hurt to even shower).  Fever got higher?max 100 (I think, as I was taking Tylenol at this point) and fatigue got worse by nighttime. --Mon. 2 1 21:  Called out of work due to reaction but fever was lower around 99 and less fatigued (ie I could get off of the couch, clean a bit, take care of my son).  Still rested a lot, had diarrhea, nausea, headache off and on t/o day. --Tues. 2 2 21:  Had a planned day off anyway.  Same symptoms as Monday and same energy level.  Felt positive about going back to work on Wed. --Wed. 2 3 21:  Woke up feeling the best of the past days and went to work.  Still fever of 99 and I noticed I was ?off? all day.  Example:  I forgot my schedule book and Id tags at home (I NEVER do that).  Made weird ?forgetting? mistakes.  By 1pm I was EXHAUSTED and having diarrhea, nausea, chills, and headache.  Called the Employee Exposure Line and my manager.  Went and got COVID test at request of EL and contacted immunologist and primary MD.  Immunologist is on vacation x 2 weeks and covering MD deferred to whatever primary said.  Dr. covered for my primary MD, Dr.  She asked me to touch base with her on Thurs after results from COVID test, but she recommended that  I rest ?and let my body adjust to the vaccine?. --Thurs:  2 4 21:  Up at night from 2:30am on and off with nausea, diarrhea, chills, headache, weakness, shaking, brain fog, sweating.  I am also having some anxiety at this point.  COVID test negative.  I did send a message in MyChart to Dr. as requested.  She called me later in the day and instructed me to drinking fluids and rest.  She ordered blood work which I did go and do.  Also contacted Urgent Care though MyChart and spoke with a CRNP about my symptoms.  She felt that they were a reaction to vaccine and my anxiety. --Friday:  2 5 21:  Called out of work again due to all of above symptoms.  Diarrhea has resolved and no longer any fever, however fatigue, lightheadedness and dizziness,  headache, ?brain fog?, and cognitive symptoms remain.  I am off balance and have difficulty concentrating  and reading.  I did communicate with my neurology office and they stated that it is ?just a reaction to the vaccine?. --Sat:  2 6 21:  Called Employee Exposure line to report same symptoms as above.  Same headache (almost migraine?  Having an aura?)  I am not sure why I feel so foggy.  Did have some ?clearing? of my head in the afternoon. --Sunday:  2 7 21:  Woke up feeling worse immediately.  Horrible headache, lightheadedness, off balance, difficulty focusing and concentrating.  No fever.  Called Employee Exposure Line to report symptoms and they recommended that I call the Urgent Care MD again.  Called urgent Care MD through MyChart again and tried to go into see her at Healthcare, however it was snowing hard and I slipped 3 times so I called the Healthcare and made apt for Monday 2 8 21 for 10:30am. --Monday:  2 8 21:  Headache, lightheadedness, fatigue, off balance, difficulty with multitasking as of this AM.  Went to Healthcare and saw CRNP.  She wrote for Augmentin for possible sinus infection and I filled at the pharmacy.  She instructed me to see my neurologist regarding possible neuro symptoms from COVID injection reaction.  I communicated with workers from comp team.  I am allowed to see the neurologist from the Dr. office.  I called their office and office manager tried to refer me back to primary.  I insisted that I see the lady as I was referred from CRNP at Worker?s Comp.  They were agreeable to a telemed appointment as soon as I get my claim number.  I am exhausted, have a headache, and difficulty focusing at this point.  Sore throat started this AM and is way worse tonight.  B swollen glands near carotids.  Started Augmentin. --Tues: 2 9 21:  Cont headache, lightheadedness, fatigue, off balance, difficulty concentrating, difficulty with lights and sounds.  Trouble reading.  Saw neurology this AM at 10am in the office as opposed to telemed visit and had a MRI at 12pm.  She diagnosed a fair amount of things including vaccine reaction possibly causing intractable headache, migraine, dizziness w/o vertigo.  Wants me to start to Propanolol for the headaches.  Need to pick up from the pharmacy.  Out of work until 2 15 21 and then a partial return to work?  Not sure how that works.  Hopefully just feeling better and can go back full time.  I have to contact the neurologist through portal at the end of week to update on progress. Health care called me and wants me to have a visit with a vaccine specialist.  I need to fill out CDC form for vaccine incidents.  Bad headache tonight that started behind R eye and is now whole head.  Need to call ENT tomorrow to discuss MRI results.  Left the neurologist a question on portal about MRI.  --Wed. 2 10 21:  Woke up with light headedness, fatigue, dizziness, off balance, feeling ?off? cognitively.  Pressure around R eye and R sinuses.

                                                Fatigue - I was unable to work that day. I was so tired. Pain - in my arm to the point that when I moved my arm I felt like I was going to pass out - it hurt that bad. I felt nauseous like I would vomit. I didn&#39;t vomit. Had a headache on day two (I have been having headaches since I had COVID in July 2020). I took Tylenol for that severe headache and that helped and it was just that one day that it was severe.  The worst, was my heart - increased heart rate - anything I did just was difficult on my heart. My heart - was having a hard time - standing, brushing my teeth - was exhausting for my body. That type of exhaustion went on for five days. I was able to feel better by day 11. But my heartrate is still poor. Depending upon what I did - 10 to 30 beats over my normal - just normal work. 40 beats over when I&#39;m attempting a more intense exercise. A slight jog puts my heartrate to 180. My heart rate still hasn&#39;t subsided yet - it is still above average above post COVID ( I had COVID in July of 2020). My heart rate was still at an elevated rate post COVID but worse after the vaccine. I have chest pressure now - like someone sitting on my chest - that started day two after the vaccine. Even when I&#39;m resting, I have chest pressure - it comes and goes and there seems to be no pattern as to why. Didn&#39;t have a doctor visit this second time yet. I treated with Tylenol for the pain at the injection site and for that headache and then I just rested my body.

                                                Two weeks after my first covid vaccine, I experienced weak muscles., light headedness, brain fog and general malaise. It was alarming due to being so far after the foretold reaction time. I tested negative for covid twice because the symptoms lasted two weeks right up to my second dose.  My doctor stated that this far of a delayed response was uncommon but hoped it wasn&#39;t unusual and to keep hydrated.  On 2/25, one week after my second dose which was administered 2/17, I experienced acute blurred vision followed by memory loss. Events that I participated in had to be told to me with my having no recollection of them. I was told that I spoke of feeling dizzy &#34;like  being on a boat&#34; and feeling brain fog before falling asleep for hours. I wake up with no memory of any of the events. This has happened three times since.  2/25, 2/26 and 2/28 so far.  It is very alarming and concerning and I wonder if it is normal to have these side effects although they are not mentioned on any website I have visited when researching side effects. I have once again contacted my doctor for further advice.

                                                2.5 hours after injection I started feeling weird, clammy cold sweats, nauseous and it felt like my eyes were bulging or like an intense pressure behind my eyes, blurry eyesight, extreme headache.  I have not ever had any issues with my blood pressure only my diabetes.  It had recently been slightly elevated but controlled mostly. I knew it was high and it suddenly just came on even after not eating at that time. I proceeded to flush with alot of water and some walking to bring it down. I wasn&#39;t exactly sure of how high it got because I don&#39;t normally have to bring my tester to work with me. However as soon as I got home I tested it and even after heavy flushing and exercise my glucose level was down to 500. It has never been that high ever. I continued to flush and monitor and not eating due to nausea and headache I was taken to the hospital. At that time my glucose reading was at 400. I was given 10 units of novolog as well as 1 full bag of fluid thru an IV.  And before I was discharged it had come down to 192.  I have only had to have insulin 1 time since 2008-9. Since then my sugar is refusing to come down below 250. My vision is still not clear and I am now attempting to keep it down with 15 units of a fast acting insulin multiple times a day. I will also be starting metformin again as of tomorrow morning to also help bring it down to a more healthy level due to the possibility of another life altering stroke.

                                                TIA; Right side of her face was drooping; Left arm was paralyzed; Slurred speech; Dizzy; Confused; A spontaneous report  was received from a consumer concerning a 46-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced TIA (transient ischaemic attack), dizzy (dizziness), her left arm was paralyzed (paralysis), right side of her face was drooping (facial paralysis), slurred speech (dysarthria), and she was confused (confusional state).   The patient denied having any allergies, past medical history or concomitant medications.  Therefore, no medical history or concomitant medications were reported.  On 14-Jan-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #: 251L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10-Feb-2021, approximately twenty-four days prior to the onset of events, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #: 16M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06-Mar-2021 the patient had a &#34;TIA&#34; (transient ischemic attack). She was sitting down and when she got up, she got dizzy and her left arm was paralyzed. The right side of her face was drooping, she had slurred speech and she was confused. The patient went to the hospital where she was hospitalized for 2 days. The MD (medical doctor) said she had a &#34;7 mm focal diffusion.&#34;  Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event(s); therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event(s) is not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, TIA, dizzy, her left arm was paralyzed, right side of her face was drooping, slurred speech, and she was confused, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I needed help to get up as I was so dizzy, weak and in so much pain, I was able to get into bathroom and at that time had pain with urination.

                                                I was vaccinated at 9am on 1/25/2021.  I had no noticeable side effects that day.  At approximately 1:00 a.m. on 1/26/2021 I started waking up a lot and couldn&#39;t get comfortable.  I tossed and turned and body aches began and quickly worsened.  My knees, thigh bones, hips, pelvis, lower back, and shoulders all hurt like I had been beaten with a bat.  I took a sick day from work due to the severity of symptoms.  I had no fever, but did have hot flashes periodically throughout the day.  I was dizzy upon standing, had nasal congestion, and sever fatigue, and developed a moderately bad headache later that day.  I went to sleep at 10:30 p.m. on 1/26/2021 and slept through the night.  Upon waking on 1/27/2021, I felt much better.  I still have some lingering fatigue and stiffness but not enough to interfere with my normal routine.  I was vaccinated in my left arm and today, 1/27/2021 I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit that are quite sore.

                                                Monday, January 25, 2021 - swelling at injection site and extremely tender to touch. Unable to lift arm up or down easily. Tuesday, January 26, 2021- swelling and hardening at injection site and still very tender to touch. At approx. 10 am,  I began experiencing extreme nausea and exhaustion. By 1:00pm I was dry heaving and began a temperature of 99.9 (when I usually run 97.7) with a very bad headache. At 2:00pm I started vomiting very violently, my body was on fire and I was very faint.  Diarrhea  started at this time as well. The headache continued as well as the nausea. I continued to vomit on the hour up until about 8pm. (I have black and blues all over my knees from being on the bathroom floor.) The headache persisted as well as extreme nausea. Soaked through the bedsheets three times over the night while trying to sleep. Too exhausted to take temperature, but I am certain that I had one. Wednesday, January 27, 2021- Could not work. Went to doctor to get a Covid-19 test, just in case. Doctor says what I describe could be side effects of vaccine. Rapid test returns negative.  Extreme exhaustion. Woke up with nausea and a headache and no fever. Extreme exhaustion persists. Could not get out of bed, could not eat. I was only able to drink sips of water.  Diarrhea continued throughout the day. Nausea returned strong at about 5pm and dry heaving began again. Headache returned as well as temperature of 99.9. Soaked through the sheets again this evening. Thursday, January 28, 2021- Worked remotely and I do not know how I got through the day. Diarrhea  continues as well as nausea, headache and exhaustion. Still not able to really eat. Drank Pedialite and was able to eat 2 dry crackers. At about 3pm, dry heaving and nausea. Headache returns. Unable to get out of bed.  Friday, January 28, 2021-  Diarrhea stops. Still experiencing nausea and headache comes and goes. Still exhausted. By 4pm, back in bed with 99.9, body feels hot and headache returns. Soak through sheets once again.  Saturday, January 29, 2021- woke up with just enough energy to report these side effects. Headache is quiet... temperature is normal. Very, very tired. Feeling completely wiped out.

                                                Within five minutes after receiving vaccine I felt very anxious and I could feel my heart rate go up. The medical staff came over amd took my vitals and blood pressure went up. My heart rate as in the 150?s amd my blood pressure went up to 154/ I can?t remember the bottom number. My head felt tight in my forehead area and my head felt foggy.  They had me do deep breathing and within 15 minutes I felt normal. So I am not sure if my anxiety took over because was extremely scared prior to getting the vaccine or if it was a combination of anxiety amd a reaction. I am scared to get the second one. They said I will have to sit for an hour after the second one. I left the facility after a half hour and felt fine. The next day I felt chest tightness amd my head felt tight. But again not sure if it is anxiety combined.

I felt a little ?foggy?   I went home and went to bed , I woke up at 3am with a severe headache and nothing helped it. It felt like a jackhammer  was pounding in my head. I felt very fatigued the next day. The headache lasted about 16 hours. I woke up 1/7/21 feeling better.

                                                In the morning of Jan. 29, headache and nausea, sore arm.  By noon, nausea and headache were worse.  At approximately 2 p.m., I felt like I was going to pass out while seated at my desk doing some computer work, my alarm on my Apple Watch went off stating that my heart rate was in excess of 110 bpm while at rest- I checked and my heart rate was 143 bpm.  I felt heart flutters and nausea increased as did the headache.  I went home once I was able to drive after the event and my heart rate came down some.  I had heart palpitations and flutters for the next couple of hours.  I rested in the bed for the rest of the afternoon and evening.  I took Advil and Zofran.  I felt better, but still very fatigued around 9 p.m.  The next day I had none of the symptoms except for some fatigue.

I had trouble saying some words., like my brain and my mouth weren?t communicating effectively.  My heart was racing at times and I was  a little short of breath. All of this subsided a few to a couple hours later. I then just became extremely fatigued,  sometimes light headed, with a slight headache and back ache. My arm hurts a little, but not near as bad as shot one. I ended up taking two days off of work to sleep and recover.

At about 28 minutes, voice changed very raspy, chest tightness worse, I could not stop coughing and a very mottled rash on the arm of injection.

While in the observation area, I started to feel flushed and like something was not right and reported to the lead onsite RN.  My BP was 235/131, pulse 140, Pulse Ox 99%, and was having difficulty swallowing and breathing.  A code was called. I was given EpiPen with some relief but not total.  The emergency team administered Methylprednisone 60mg IV and 911 transported me to the ED where I remained for observation for about 5 hours with no further treatment required.

By 6pm on 2/21, I experienced fatigue and minor arthralgia / myalgia.  By 9pm on 2/21, the arthralgia/myalgia worsened.  The pain in the bones was severe enough for me to not be able to feel comfortable in any position.  I chose not to take any NSAIDs at the time.  By 1am on 2/22, I awoke with chills and a fever of 103.   I was shivering and sweating.  At that point, I did take ibuprofen.  I woke up at 7am on 2/22 in terrible muscle and joint pain.    I had still had a 101 fever.  I worked for 4 hours that morning.  At 1pm, I went back to be with the same symptoms.  Fever went back to 103.  I had brain fog and unable to concentrate.  It was hard to climb stairs.  I experienced shooting pains at times.  Continued fever and pain through the night.   Injection site pain also.  The morning of 2/23 I woke up with the fever still at 7am.  I took my second dose of ibuprofen.  I was able to work that evening.  My fever broke at noon on 2/23.  On the evening of 2/23 I notice a delayed reaction at the injection site.  I developed red blotches that were hot to touch and painful.  The blotches went from my deltoid to my elbow.  My muscle &amp; back pain had resolved at that point however I developed a soreness at the base of my skull from ear to ear.  I was unable to look up at the ceiling with limited range of motion.  I developed a runny nose and a slight cough.    My soft palette also felt swollen at 11pm on 2/23.   I woke up on 2/24 with the neck pain resolved.  The arm was still red and warm to touch.  My  other symptoms resolved I just felt worn out.  On the evening of 2/24, I developed a metallic taste in my mouth.  The metallic taste resolved by the end of day 2/25.  As of today, 2/26 I am feeling 90% better.

                                                Immediately after shot: I felt some pain &amp; burning at injection sight. In general felt a little off, but nothing significant. After observation period, on the drive home, I began to &#34;taste&#34; the shot, as did my husband who received vaccine right after me. Then, my face felt a little funny, and my jaw felt tight, but no visible swelling. Then I felt a rush of burning sensation throughout my chest and abdominal region. After arriving home, 20 minutes later, I felt a little nauseated, but not bad. An hour later, I was unable to eat dinner, as I felt ill. I felt like I had a mild fever and I was shivering with chills. While trying to sleep, the chills continued. I then experienced unusual frequent urination, every 2 to 3 hours. I had no consumed abnormal amounts of liquid, but my urine was nearly clear, which was odd. After returning to bed after the first time urinating, my heart rate became very fast and I felt like I had a hard time finding my pulse in my neck, which is unusual for me.   The day after the vaccination I experience headache, a lot of tenderness around injection sight and arm muscle pain making it very painful to make certain movement, like putting on my top and reaching for objects. That evening I experience some muscle aches.   These symptoms have improved now that it is day three after the vaccination. I still have a mild headache and pain at injection sight.

                                                I developed extreme shoulder pain and weakness in my arm with limited mobility  the evening of my Covid vaccine. I kept trying to move my arm since I thought it was pain from the vaccine dose, but the pain continued to get worse over the week even with ibuprofen. I went to my primary care physician a week after the vaccine and he examined me and said the placement of the injection was much too high and it missed my deltoid muscle. I completed lab work to rule out infection, and I am scheduled to have imaging of my left shoulder to determine the extent of the shoulder injury from the misplaced injection. It has been 2 weeks and the pain is continuing to increase with very limited mobility. I have had to miss work, can&#39;t drive my stick shift car, and my sleep is poor because the pain wakes me up during the night.

                                                2/5 I received the 1st does of Moderna. The next day I had a massive headache. As the days went on my neck started to heart. The days continued and my back started to hurt. I thought my pain was just radiating down my back from my neck. ON 2/12 I have record of going to the pharmacy to get Lidocain patches. I continued on with pain from neck to middle of back. I made appointments with chiropractor and went there complaining that my back and ribs were out. This continued. On 3/5 I got the 2nd dose. I reacted as expected but this went on for 4 days. Went to a convenient care clinic where the dr ordered chest xray and D-DImer for suspected PEs. I got a call immediately to go to ER as my D-Dimer was high at 4.3. I went back to Local ER and had a CT Scan. The CT scan showed MULTIPLE PEs with infarct. I was admitted. SInce then I have been back to the ER and still struggling and have many tests coming up. My pulse is consistantly tachycardia. The ER docs do not want to entertain the thought that is was the vaccine because i was a smoker and on hormone replacement therapy. HOWEVER, I smoked for over 30 years and was on that HRT for almost 3 and never showed any signs of a clotting issue. I can pinpoint with pictures, and bank records of when the pain started and it reflects back to the 1st dose.  Who knows but after the 2nd does and out of the hospital I struggled with covid symptoms including the &#34;foggy&#34; head and that continues as well as other health related PE issues.  They may not want to contribute it to the vaccine but I know when this all started and it does need to be reported incase others. I have a whole story to tell that doesn&#39;t cover in writing!

After 15 min it felt like I was having a mild panick attack, but I?m used to that so I just breathed through it.  Coughed a few times.  After 30 min got up and was whoozy/dizzy, but shrugged it off, got my card and walked slowly to my car, drove 5 min home.  By then my hands were shaking hard.  It was like being shot with a crapload of adrenaline.  I called my sister and when I talked I started sobbing.  I don?t know, I just couldn?t stop.  But I knew it was just the adrenaline and if I could calm down, I?d get thru it.  She was awesome bc she kept her voice soft and low when she spoke, which helps.  After 3 hours it has calmed down and I?m just really cold and exhausted and nauseous and only a little shaky.  Being quiet and calm is helping.  Also sitting on a heating pad bc it?s 74 in my apartment and I?m freezing cold.  I?ll be ok by end of day.  I got the Moderna vacine and I?m still glad I did and thankful I could get it....but to those who are getting it...symptoms are that it feels like being shot full of adrenaline, you get a panic attack, but my O2 actually went up, not down.  Chest pain, panting, high anxiety, shaking, nausea, dizziness.

I had been diagnosed with COVID in June and was very ill with that.  This felt exactly like I did when I had COVID.   Throughout the day I ran a fever around 102.  My ability to think or care for myself was greatly impaired.  I continue to fight fatigue and brain fog.  I then developed several cold sores outside and in my mouth.  I continue to battle fatigue and weakness but am improving and now back to work.  I do not plan to get a second dose as I am afraid of a stronger reaction that would require emergency care.

Upon removing my bandaid it was apparent that the vaccine was injected just below my acromion.  I have a picture of the injection site.  My shoulder continued to ache (there was no aching in the muscles of my arm). I took Advil 600-80 mg tid and Tramadol 50 mg at night.  The pain woke me from sleep.  It was difficult to get dressed and undressed.  After 9 days of pain I finally took Prednisone 30 mg po.  This improved y pain by 30%.  It became clear that this is likely bursitis.

                                                I am an RN and was working a Covid 19 vaccine clinic for first responders. I took my own 1st administration of Moderna at approx 6:20 then went out to vaccinate/data entry. I noticed I was a little bit shaky and more jittery than normal but I attributed that to getting first vaccination clinic off the ground and problems we were having with computers and login. When I was leaving approx 2 hours later and all settled down I went to my car and noticed small area near front of tongue in R side. I also had small feelings of tingling or what felt like small electric current around edges of my tongue. My throat was sore but I had thought that was from talking to so many vaccinated first responders and having to talk over my n95 mask.  Upon getting home approx 12 minutes later I noticed my tongue had swollen. I was not having trouble breathing. Throat was red but no swelling noted. I took my Zyrtec early and then. 50 mg of Benadryl and it was relieved within 40 minutes. I did not need to seek any medical care and over the counter meds remedied the issue.

The patient&#39;s medical history included migraines and a hysterectomy. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included sumatriptan, naratriptan hydrochloride, and galconezumab.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A) in the left deltoid intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   A pharmacist called stating she received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 02 Jan 2021 at 9:45am in her left deltoid. Immediately after receiving the vaccine, she had facial flushing, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion and choking in the throat that lasted 20 minutes. After a few hours, she stated confusion would come and go, and she had no emotions. The next morning, the confusion was gone. On 03 Jan 2021, she reported having body aches and a fever of 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. She reported chills, body aches, and a lot of pain in the left arm. If she tried to move her left arm, the entire muscle in the left arm hurt.  Treatment for the events included acetaminophen and an antihistamine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was withdrawn.   The events, choking, flushing, vision blurred, were considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events, confusional state, emotional disorder, and dizziness, were considered resolved on 03 Jan 2021. The events, body aches, pyrexia, chills, and limb discomfort, were not considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 48 year old female patient with medical history of migraines, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Choking, non-serious unexpected events of Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, Confusional state, Emotional disorder, Pain, and Limb discomfort, and non-serious expected events of Pyrexia and Chills. The events of Choking, Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, and Confusional state occurred immediately after administration of their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A). The event of Emotional disorder occurred on the same day when the patient received mRNA-1273. The events of Pain, Pyrexia, Chills, and Limb discomfort occurred on the next day of mRNA-1273 administration. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Second and Third days:  Large amount or swelling and knot (size of an egg) popped out at injection site and felt hot and bright red and unable to sleep for two nights due to the pain (like a tooth ache) in my arm.  The symptoms improved over the next week, but I began to itch all over and at the injection site (felt like a wasp sting healing) and then the symptoms began to improve, but on day 10, I woke up with a bright red circle, hot to the touch and about the size of a baseball at the injection site and itching. On day 11, the size of the redness increased to the size of a softball and still very hot to touch. I contacted the health dept. where I received the vaccine and they said it was probably my bodies reaction to the vaccine and I should be ok since I wasn&#39;t having trouble breathing and no itching in my throat and to contact my primary doctor which I am doing tomorrow.  I was also told it was fine to get the second dose, however, I&#39;m very nervous about it.

                                                I went to bed Friday night around 10:00PM.  I woke around 12:30AM with a throbbing headache, sore throat, post-nasal drainage, body aches, chills, fever, sweating, weakness and nausea.  I went down to use the bathroom and then back to bed but could not sleep due to the throbbing headache and chills.  I got back up around 2:30AM and soaked in a warm bath.  I went back to bed around 4:30AM.  I was able to go to sleep.  I slept until around 8:30AM.  At that time, I drank some water and went back to sleep.  I slept until approximately 10:30AM and started drinking Powerade Zero.  The Powerade was taken to bed and sipped on when I would stir and change positions.  I slept until approximately 2:30PM, when I got up to use the bathroom.  I urinated, washed my hands and went to walk out of the bathroom when everything went black.  I remember yelling for my husband but then nothing else until I heard him yell my name several times and I was lying on the floor in the doorway of the bathroom.  I passed out.  I was sat up in the recliner and monitored.  Above symptoms continued.  Tylenol and Motrin were alternated every 4 hours for the fever.

No fever.  My concern is today is TEN days after vaccine injection and my injection site has a round redness and hardness at the injection site. About 1 inch in diameter. It&#39;s itchy off and on but no pain. It&#39;s hard, red, round, and the skin of it is raised similar to like a hive. I don&#39;t know if this is normal.  Especially because it&#39;s 10 days out from initial injection. I&#39;m due back for 2nd injection on Feb 9th.

                                                I woke up around 12:30 in the morning on the 21st of January with a headache and I took 600mg Advil.  I went back to bed and was restless and still had the same pain, so I took 975mg Tylenol. I continued to feel poorly and pain was increasing, so I used Maxalt x 2 without any relief.  I became nauseated and diaphoretic with increasing pain in my head.  I woke my husband to take me to the ER for relief.  My pain was 8 and all vital signs normal.  1 liter of Saline, Toradol 30mg IV and Zofran got the headache to a 3. I did follow up with my doctor later that day for further eval.  I have not had a headache that bad in 17 years.

It&#39;s like a cycle,  my arm starts itching inside like crazy,  like bugs are crawling on my bone, then it gets bigger &amp; redder, I get hot &amp; nauseous, diarrhea for 3 days, stomach cramps, headache, fatigue,  achy...when I cool down, the itchiness subsides some for a while, then in a couple of hours it starts itching again.

                                                Upon receiving injection, the RN administering noted that pt appeared anxious.  Following her 15 minute wait, EMT noted that as she stood up she commented to another pt that her throat felt &#34;scratchy&#34; after he made the same comment.  This patient was a volunteer at the vaccination site, and returned to her assignment.  Throughout the assignment, she began rubbing her chest and the injection site.  She returned to the EMTs approximately 2 hrs after receiving the vaccine to report  &#34;feeling different&#34;.  EMTs witnessed redness on her chest area.  They administered Benedryl and Decadron IV, called 911.  All vitals WNL.  This writer called pt the following day, she reported having been transported to Hospital.  Bloodwork was obtained, she noticed while at hospital that the arm below where injected was covered in a &#34;scarlatina type&#34; rash.  This rash continues to persist, no additional symptoms reported. She was discharged from ER with  Rx for Pepcid and Prednisone and told to f/u with primary.  She saw the PA at her MDs office, and was told to f/u with an allergist.  She intends to go to Medical Center Allergy Immunology for f/u and further advice on receiving second dose of vaccine.  She will follow up with this writer regarding the scheduling/canceling of the second dose based on the consultation with the Allergist/Immunologist.

                                                I had a very painful injection site and also area got swollen and red. Like a bruise.  For about 4 days. I took Ibuprofen and Tylenol and it was hard to sleep because it was very painful. New Years eve I started feeling my throat scratchy so I made me some honey tea. As I sipped  the tea, my son entered the room and made a remark regarding the tea smell and then I realized that I could not smell the tea, but could still taste it. Concerned it could be a sign of COVID I sanitized all areas and stayed in my room. Next morning I noticed my smell and taste were compromised.  I communicated with the employee health and was tested on the 4th and my rapid test was negative and I could not believe it.  So I decided to go to the UC and I was tested for flu, strep and Covid I was tested positive around 4PM on the same day (01/04/2021).  On 01/02 I noticed I was nauseated around 6:30PM til 10PM and next morning it was gone. On 01/03 I had headache and chills about the same time, I developed diarrhea on the 4th later in the evening as well. On the 5th, 6th and 7th I had cough and on the 9th I had diarrhea again and after that by the weekend everything had resolved  and I felt better.

                                                Within 3 minutes my arm started to turn red, and I started to break out in hives. By 20 minutes my hives went across to my chest and right arm. My BP was 168/108 and pulse 84, they hooked me up to vitals. They wanted to send me to the ER  for Benadryl but I had more own and took Benadryl (20mg) this was about 25 mins into injection.  About 30 mins my arm started to get really warm, you could feel the heat coming off of it.  They monitored me for an hour and re-did my BP 158/97, pulse dropped to  80, my o2 stats were 99. They made me monitor for another 18 mins. BP was  155/103, pulse still at 80. They had me get up and walk around and wanted me to take more Benadryl but I didn&#39;t have a ride home.   . My hives started to improve but were not gone.  About 1hr 25mins post vaccine  I got on the phone with Employee Health to ask to leave (clinic was closing) , they wanted me to stay and I told them I had a BP machine at home, if it didn&#39;t go down they wanted me to go to the ER. My BP did go down about 4 hours later but my arm was still hurting.  The hives on my chest went away, but hives on my arm was on and off for about a week. My left arm remained red for about 2 weeks and I ended up getting a really bad rash.  When I woke up the next day I had to take a Benadryl and Tylenol. On January 3rd I felt awful like  I got hit by a car.  On that Wednesday (6th) my arm started to hurt really bad in the middle of the night, it felt like day 2 all over again. It was really painful, it was bright red and life a figure eight going down my arm and I immediately called employee health and they  told me to monitor for 24 hours. It got worse and went down my arm to my chest.  I went to Friday night to our immediate care (only place we could go), I was given antibiotics for cellulitis.  It took about 7 days to  go away.  They were telling me I couldn&#39;t get the second dose because of my reaction and I had to fight to get the second dose.

                                                It started with tingling in my tongue (which I ignored), then it became numbness that spread down my throat I also became short of breath. That&#39;s when I notified one of the nurses. They checked my blood pressure. I vaguely remember hearing it was high (189/?). They called 911 and the paramedics came. Shortness of breath became worse and chest pains started. The paramedic gave me Benadryl and then epinephrine since I was increasingly getting worse. I was shaking  and I felt lethargic. I could not control the shaking and I felt cold. I do not remember a lot of details when I got to the Emergency Room. Looking at my record they gave me: LORazepam (ATIVAN), methylPREDNISolone sod suc(PF)(SOLU-MEDROL) and famotidine. I went home that night with the condition that I see my primary care physician. I felt like I have the flu and soreness of arm the next couple days. I went back to work after four days.

                                                I had the first Moderna 12/23/2020 and did fine with only arm pain on the next day after shot.  When I received dose 2 on 1/20/2021, I did well but later in the middle of the night felt foggy, severe arm pain, and kept asking my husband if I was in an earth quake.  That next day I had sever arm pain, extreme fatigue all day and the fatigue got worse as the day went on to the point I felt like I couldn&#39;t walk even though I could walk from the fatigue.  On Day 3, I felt fine just little arm pain. On Day 4, some fatigue only.  On Day 5, my arm became hot to touch, swollen, severe redness and itching.  The rest of that  week some fatigue but bearable until Day 8, I felt extremely fatigue.  Since then I have had 1-2 episodes a week of extreme fatigue that lasts about an hour or two for no reason.  I also have had some wheezing but comes and goes but that is better now.

                                                moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Tachycardia sudden onset 4 minutes after injection (6:09am). Arms and legs cold and weak. Generalized weakness. BP 167/78, o2 sats 100%. Tachycardia lasted about 10-15minutes and resolved to HR 88 and BP 138/78.  Still left with overall weakness, malaise, cold feeling. No other symptoms.  Released from the facility at 6:48am.  Drove 2 blocks to my husband&#39;s workplace (hospital). Had diarrhea x 2, dull diffuse headache, odd feeling and malaise that persisted. Sudden onset of terrible feeling, the need to get to the ER at 8:36am. Had a bathroom visit to urinate. By the time we got to the ER the intense malaise improved. I sat in the ER lobby not wanting to be admitted to the ER (didn&#39;t want to be having a vaccine reaction). I stayed in the ER lobby. Symptoms completely resolved at 9:45am. I stayed there for 30 more minutes to be sure and then drove home with no other symptoms but Left arm soreness. Tachycardia never returned after the first episode. No rash, no itching, no swelling, no dyspnea. Just felt toxic. Then it resolved completely at hour 4.

I felt a lot of pressure behind my nose, but not a stuffy nose. The woozy feeling also brought on some nausea. I felt like I couldn&#39;t focus, like I was in a daze or fog. This lasted throughout the following day. Left arm at sight of injection was sore starting 2 hours after shot, couldn&#39;t raise left arm x2 days. Still sore but manageable. I took a zofran for the nausea.

Arm soreness developed about 8 hours after vaccine, woke next morning with fever 100.9, severe body aches, headache, nausea, weakness and fatigue, decreased appetite. In addition, as the  day went on I experienced a shallow cough, high pulse rate (130), tongue twitching and just felt aweful. Slept on and off all day, sx lasted the entire day. Took Tylenol throughout the day for the the fever. I awoke 3:30 am today, 1/10/21 with fever 101.5, took more Tylenol, still headache and feel tongue twitchiness  however muscle aches, body aches, nausea, decreased appetite and fatigue have subsided. I took 600mg Advil around 9am today and have been gradually feeling much better as of now 1:30pm. As a side note, I did have COVID 19 illness mildly in March 2020. It was dx&#39;d with PCR testing and my sx were loss of taste/smell, nausea, weight loss, bursted eye vessel, slight respiratory sx, I recovered well and had a follow up negative test 2 weeks after. Thank you.

Continued to feel weird rubbing chest and short of breath but no chest pain.  Decided to take her to the ED.  On the way she passed out and was not responsive still had a pulse.  In ED became responsive, reports numbness in both arms and short of breath.   Received Benadryl complete assessment, doesn&#39;t appear to be an acute allergic reaction.  ECG &amp; vitals were okay. Patient observed for 4 hours and seemed to improve so discharged.

Possible racing heart but I am prone to heart palpitations and may have just been anxious about this unexpected side effect.    Significant irritation  lasted for 48 hours, mostly improved after 72 hours, resolving with Benadryl and ice packs to the site.

On January 2, 2021, the redness and swelling dissipated except for the edges, where there remained a red, irregular ring marking the edge of the affected area.  Area continues to be pruritic.

                                                The day after receiving the vaccine I felt severe nausea and dizziness. My body was aching to the point that I was unable to even do the lightest of my daily activities. I had severe muscle aches and pains. I had fevers in the range from 103.7 to 104.5.  The symptoms continued throughout the day. One week later, I still have muscle pains in various areas of my body.

The symptoms were severe enough I could not work and 800 mg of ibuprofen did not take fever down enough to work or help much with the myalgia. Symptoms improved after about 14-16 hours of onset.

She developed redness in the upper chest. Immediately came back and arrived around 16:38. I saw patient around that time and she was breathing well, had a patent airway. Very anxious. Vitals showed tachycardia but were otherwise normal. Patient had IV placed in the right hand and was given 125mg solumedrol and 25mg diphenhydramine, both IV. Patient monitored at bedside during entire time. BP at time of D/C was 140/80 and HR of 91BPM. No swelling in mouth/tongue/lips/throat. Speaking in full sentences and feeling well. Called pharmacy and confirmed that EpiPen was received as an Rx. They have it in stock and patient aware she has to pay $109 for the medication. She will pick up EpiPen after being picked up by friend. She will be monitoring her symptoms and stay with another person for the next few hours.

I am a nurse and had nurses with me, so I did not go back to the facility for care. Numbness of anterior 1/3 of the tongue and felt  &#34;distant&#34; from surroundings within a few minutes of the injection. Symptoms progressed to numbness to the left side of the face and head. This sensation lasted a few minutes, then disappeared altogether. After about 30 more minutes, my entire tongue and head felt numb and I felt &#34;distant&#34; again. It became difficult to swallow as well. This too lasted a few minutes and disappeared altogether. I was left with a severe headache that lasted a few hours.

My vitals were stable the entire time. My neck was sore and I had no energy.  My arm of course sore at injection site. This was on a Friday. Saturday residual soreness, and low energy. Sunday overall ok but neck was very sore. Monday same. By Tuesday afternoon (1/12/21) my joints ached severely (ankles, knees, elbows), I could not keep my eyes open, my neck continued to be sore and I had extreme fatigue and mild occasional nausea and loss of appetite. I had to stay out of work the rest of the week. 11 days later I still feel some fatigue and neck soreness but otherwise okay.

                                                At 2 a.m. on January 10th, I woke up with a high pitched ringing  sound in my head. The sound was constant and disrupts my sleep significantly. It is always present but not as noticeable during the day when there is noise in the surrounding area, however, my job requires a lot of report writing and for that I work in silence. Therefore, the ringing sound is very distracting and makes it hard to focus. I saw my general practitioner, on January 14th at 4:15 p.m.. She cleaned out my right ear and started me on a 6-day steroid. She did not clean out the left ear because it did not appear to have any wax buildup. I began taking the steroid on Saturday January 16th. The ringing is still there but it does seem to be more on my left side than my right now. I went to an ent specialist on January 19th who checked my hearing and said there was no hearing loss. Her recommendations were to call her in a week and if ringing doesn&#39;t go away, she will try another steroid. As of today, the ringing is still present and I have finished the course of steroid.

                                                After the vaccine was administered I waited the 15 minutes with no symptoms. I started at 1:00 in the morning with chills and uncontrollable shaking and the feeling of never being able to get warm. I woke up with a 101 degree fever and a severe headache, muscle aches and the inability to get out of bed. I spent the whole day in bed and unable to eat that day. The next day I still had a fever of 100, muscle aches, severe headache and listlessness, but able to eat a little. I wasn&#39;t able to finally get out of bed that day until around 5:00 p.m. From then on all of the symptoms had pretty much subsided and I was able to get back to daily activities.

                                                Extreme dizziness, darkened vision as happens before losing consciousness, feeling of losing consciousness. All symptoms repeated in 5 waves. First wave hit about 10 min after dose and last about 60 seconds. 2nd wave hit a minute later and lasted approximately 30 seconds. 3rd wave hit 2 minutes later and lasted about 60 seconds with some shaking in core/diaphragm area.  4th wave hit 8-10 minutes after that and lasted 5 minutes. 4th wave was precipitated by shaking starting in diaphragm area and branching out to extremities and jawline. Shaking was uncontrollable and made speaking impossible. Shaking passed after about 6 minutes when wave subsided. 5th wave hit about 10 minutes later and was dizziness/darkening vision with disorientation, no shaking.  EMS responded to first wave by removing me from my car and having me sit in a chair, removing my mask to breath better, took vitals. Vitals were taken several times, oxygen levels varying from 93 - 98.  Oxygen was ready nearby but not used. Blood pressure varied, don?t have the readings. EMT gave water immediately and then pretzels about 30 minutes after the episodes began. I was kept for observation for an hour total after inoculation and then released to go home as symptoms had fully subsided.

About 20 minutes after she received her vaccine, she felt chest pain and claustrophobia.   She refused an epi pen.  She took 50mg of diphenhydramine.  She quickly said that she felt better, but we monitored her blood pressure, pulse, and pulse ox.   We also called a paramedic, they arrived shortly and evaluated her.  She refused to get treatment.   Her vitals were all normal, she was drowsy from the diphenhydramine.  The chest pain and feeling of claustrophobia were gone.  She worked at a school and the school nurse checked on her throughout the rest of the day, and she was feeling fine.  She was very nervous about the vaccine, and her reaction could have been anxiety related (although she felt fine after her vaccine).

                                                I have had extreme fatigue, intermittent low grade fevers, horrible leg aches, and brain fog that persisted up until the week I was vaccinated. A few days before I was vaccinated- for the first time since I was dx with COVID, I felt better. I remember thinking I was ready to start running again. I was vaccinated on Jan 15 and Jan 16 I got really sick - I had 101.5 fever and my body aches like when I had active COVID.  I couldn?t stay awake for 2-3 days. Since then the fatigue, aches, low grade fever, and brain fog- which I attribute to fatigue has persisted- sometimes at night, but this week it starts when I wake up. I?m a full time doctoral student and I have a full time Practicum. I can?t keep up - I?m halfway through my program and I?m ready to quit school. I don?t know what to do. I?m scheduled for a second vaccine and I don?t know if I should get it.

On Wednesday, 2/27/21, increased redness, swelling in my face, lips, neck.  Rashes spreading over body and face.  Took Benedryl and applied caladryl.  Began steroid treatment on evening of 2/27/21.  Symptoms continue to increase.  On the afternoon of Friday, 1/29/21, having a feeling of a lump in my throat.  I sought care at the Emergency Department.  Received epinephrine, benedryl and pepcid.

Symptoms are slowly improving but I continue to be on multiple medications to decrease swelling, itchiness, redness.  I have a follow up appointment with an allergist on 2/2/21

                                                I received my second dose of moderna vaccine on 1/23/2021. I had done well with the first one other than sore arm and fatigue. I felt ok day one, but day 2 arm injection site was painful. I took ibuprofen and went to bed. Woke up in the middle of the night with severe left shoulder pain that seemed to radiate to the clavicle and neck. Fever, chills also. I called off from work and slept until noon the next day, a full 48 hours post injection and felt much better with exception to the left shoulder. I have continued to have intermittent pain in the arm, that also now results in numbness and tingling of my fingers and left hand. I can hardly sleep at night due to the pain. there is not much that will relieve it, other than finding maybe a pillow for support, but that only lasts a short time and then I am awakened with pain again. It seems to be the joint itself that is affected. And instead of getting better it seems to be getting worse.

                                                Symptoms started 3-3.5 hours after vaccination.  Mild headache, mild warmth (not sure if fever), body aches, mild disorientation.  By 8:25pm I was very achy &amp; went to bed.  I awoke @ 12:40am &amp; I could not move- my muscle were so tight all I could do was turn my head.  I did not panic (although it was very scary) because my pharmacist/friend had told me that this happened to her overnite after her first dose.  By morning  my mild headache &amp; warmth went away &amp; I was able to move but was extremely sore with muscle aches throughout my body.  I was unable to do anything all day &amp; night.  I was better the next morning but still somewhat achy &amp; my aches proceeded to continue over the next few days but decreased daily.

                                                Pt was being observed for 15 minutes after covid vaccine administration. Pt was noticed to be &#34;sleepy&#34; and  RN SB went to talk to pt who appeared to be lightheaded. I went and got the available emergency kit for RN   SB to check pt&#39;s pulse ox. Pt&#39;s SaO2 was 99% and Pulse was 89. Pt reports that she had a recent heart cath and high blood pressure. Pt reports not taking her blood pressure medication prior to coming. 5-10 minutes after covid vaccine pt was more alert and stated she was feeling better but had vision changes. Pt&#39;s blood pressure was checked and it was 160/110 which was taken manually, pulse ox 98% and pulse was 87. Pt denies difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Pt able to speak in full sentence. Pt was told that we would like her to stay for further evaluation. Pt was able to ambulate without difficulty to another place in the auditorium for further observation. 30 minutes post covid vaccination pt was alert and respirations were even/unlabored. BP 130/110 on both arms manually, pulse 67 and SpO2 99%. Pt still complaining of blurred vision/double vision. Pt was talking to husband on phone without difficulty and asking him to move to garage area to pick her up. Pt was told to follow up with her cardiologist and PCP. 45 minutes after vaccine admin pt asked if I could help her call her cardiologist office. I told her yes. I called Doctor&#39;s office and was transferred to the nurse line. The nurse told me that she was not Doctor&#39;s nurse but she would send him a note and recommends pt go the emergency department for vision changes. Pt was told the recommendation and called husband to tell him to meet her at ED while we were waiting for a wheel chair to transport pt. Pt works in nutrition and there was a supervisor or manager that knew her and said that he would let them know what was going on. She was supposed to work at 1330 today. Pt walked to wheelchair without difficulty and pt was transported to ED. Pt&#39;s husband was at the ED waiting when we got there. ED triage nurse was updated that pt had received 2nd dose of covid vaccine, had a recent heart Cath and was told by cardiologist office to go to ED for vision changes.

                                                SECOND DOSE.  Side effects stared about 16 hours after the vaccine.  Started with slight soreness in left arm.  This remained a slight discomfort. Body tingling sensation turned into body aches.  Most were in the lower back and shoulders.  Random shooting pains in thigh muscles.  First temperature check at 8:00 am was 101.1 it increased throughout the day, peaking at 102.6.   I took 500 mg of Extra Strength Tylenol at 3:30 pm .  The fever dropped to 100.1 by 6:30 pm.  I took another 500 mg.  At 11:00 pm, the fever was up slightly to 101.6.  By 7:30 the next morning, the fever was down to 99.8.  It was gone a few hours later. Headache associated with fever, but not severe. NO fatigue, so I could not sleep off the fever.  I was wide awake and miserable. Felt fine by 8:00 am, so side bad side effects lasted approximately 24 hours.  By approximately 40 hours after the vaccine, I felt fine.  Very minimal soreness in arm remaining.

                                                After receiving COVID-19 Moderna vaccine dose 1 on 1/28/2021, came down with headache and soreness in left arm the next day. Throughout the night on Saturday, 1/31/2021 began having stiff neck and left side, including arm and leg, became weak with numbness throughout. The numbness was mostly felt in fingers and toes of left side. These symptoms continued and progressively became worse throughout the following week 1/31/2021-2/8/2021. In addition to the left side symptoms worsening, numbness and weakness developed in the right side fingers and toes. On 2/8/2021 numbness and weakness in left side became so bad that left leg was very heavy and dragging when trying to walk.  I was unable to work that day and was told to call Employee Health.  Employee Health directed me to go to the Emergency Room. While at the Emergency Room, I received lab tests, XRay, EKG, CT Scans, and MRI of neck. MRI was evaluated by Neuro/Orthopedic Surgeon who diagnosed me with Cord Compression Myelopathy and told me that I needed immediate urgent surgery. ER Doctor, Neuro/Orthopedic Surgeon and Hospitalist all felt that the COVID-19 vaccine could have caused the inflammatory immune response that led to further cord compression.  I had anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery on 2/11/2021. The hope of the ACDF surgery was to stop further progression of the symptoms of numbness and weakness, but was not guaranteed to restore normal function of the left side. I am currently still experiencing numbness and weakness in left side postoperatively.

                                                Left side stroke-like symptoms. I was walking and 20 minutes in I started having left leg weakness. This then turned into full left side numb/foggy feeling. I was with my son (and I&#39;m a nurse) so I asked him to test for signs of a stroke. I could smile evenly but it didn&#39;t feel like it. I had strength in both hands and could lift my arms. I was able to communicate what to look for to my son without slurred speech. But I was not stable on my left foot and felt as if I was listing to the left side. My left side was foggy. I moved my arm but flet it in slow motion. When I got home, I sat down and stretched. The symptoms went away and I was able to continue the day without episode. The episode lasted 20-30 minutes as I was walking home still. In hind sight, I did have a similar eposide after the first dose (Moderna lot 037K20A on 1/29/20) while exercising at home but sat down and thought it was due to a hard workout. That time it was just a weak left leg that was giving out on me and lasted 5 minutes because I stopped the workout.

                                                Neurological response/trigger  - severe leg pain and weakness in both legs. Extremely difficult to walk and not able to climb stairs.  Disrupted sleep (woke up in pain throughout the night). This lasted for a couple of weeks, the worst (debilitating) being 48 hours from initial onset.  I also had difficulty breathing and nausea about 15m after injection which lasted for about 24 hours, then subsided.   I contacted my neurologist, Dr., early next morning, and notified her of what happened and she advised that I increase the dosage of gabapentin until symptoms resolved. After 48 hours, I began to walk without experiencing so much pain and weakness, and it slowly subsided over the course of a couple of weeks. I still experience flares of pain in both of my legs periodically.

I had nausea, vomiting, fever of 103.2, had trouble breathing, felt like someone was sitting in the middle of my chest, left side of my body was numb, weakness, migraine headaches, and muscle aches in neck and shoulder.  I went to bed after I took Tylenol and nausea medicine. I woke up at 4 am the next morning and told my husband to get the girls (our daughters) up and that i needed to go to the hospital. When I got there they did a chest x-ray, blood work and gave me a breathing treatment. I was admitted to the hospital. While I was there they gave me IV fluids and medicine for headaches and nausea medicine. I was released about 2:30 in the afternoon on Feb 26th. I still have muscle aches  and head aches. I have noticed my memory is real short, I have trouble remembering things from yesterday.

Patient reports feeling fatigued, having cough, and feeling more short of breath for the last day, and has developed central chest pain which is pleuritic in the emergency department.  She reports that the chest pain is 4/10 in severity and does not radiate.  Her caregiver at bedside reports that the patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for the last 3 or so weeks.  Of note, she becomes dyspneic with limited exertion, such as going up a flight of stairs, at baseline.  She had a fever of 101.4 °F at home earlier today, but denies chills or diaphoresis.  He had 1 episode of nonbloody vomiting earlier today.  Denies nausea at this time.  She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday, 4 weeks after the first.   They note that approximately 5 years ago, she had a prolonged admission for which she was transferred to OHSU and was on ECMO for a time before making a nearly full recovery.  She has had the baseline dyspnea on exertion since that time.   Review of Systems  Constitutional: Positive for fever and malaise/fatigue. Negative for chills.  HENT: Negative for sore throat.

CT angiogram pulmonary:  FINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    #Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  -Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  Considerations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (&#34;tea and toast&#34;), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   - Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

I waited 30 min from vaccine time to make sure I was going to be ok. At 5:30 pm on 1/6/21 I noticed I stared itching my right arm around the inside of the elbow. I noticed my vision blurring and I had a sudden onset of a Horrific headache. By 6 pm I was itching very severely. It was as if I was clawing at my skin. I called one of the dr&#39;s I  work with and he called me in a medrol dose pack. I started the dose pack at 8:30 pm on the 6th. The headache continued, I tried motrin, fiorcet, and oxycodone with no relief. I still have the headache but it is not as intense as it was. I was up all night itching and dealing with the headache by the am , my jaw was  visibly swollen and it felt like I had been in a fight. I was not able to go to work on 1/7/21 and could only work 1/2 day on 1/8/21. the itching did not subside much till sat 1/9 but is coming back as I  taper down off the steroids. My last pill was this am. The jaw pain and swelling lasted till sat night and is subsiding daily. I may have to call my pcp and be seen this week.

                                                on 1-13-21 I woke up with pain on my right deltoid muscle.  I was unable to lift my arm or even pick up a coffee cup, it completely resolved on 1-15-21.  Starting on 1-17-21 I developed severe muscle pain on my left pectoral muscle.  On 1-19-21 the pain is an 8 on the pain scale, I am unable to go to work and unable to do any ADL&#39;s.  I have not sustained any injury to these areas, the pain just appeared and pain relievers and muscle relaxers are not helping.

(total of 20lbs). A few days after getting 1st dose the hot flashes have been relentless; Internal hot flashes literally every 5-10m, daily, consistently throughout the day, even as I fill out this report. Not sure if the dose has anything to do with this starting up again, but I wanted to report it just in case some others report it.  I do not take anything for the flashes. I just seek some form of air conditioning such as a fan. However, the flashes are very annoying as I even get them while sleeping and it interrupts my rest. No sweating though.

During the morning she mainly slept however had some Motrin and a banana around 0830 due to feeling feverish. She went back to sleep until about 1030. When she woke up, she still felt feverish and then noticed her pulse started racing a few minutes later. Her husband took her BP but her pulse was reading ?error?.  She then put on her iWatch and had a pulse of 210. She felt very sweaty, hot and ?weird??like she might pass out but I did not have any pain other than my throat felt tight.  She went to the ER. Within about 30-40 minutes of the onset of SVT she was given adenosine and converted with a 6mg dose.

By the afternoon, I was running a 102.2 fever and did not feel well.  I was very tired and slept all afternoon and evening.  Woke up the next morning and felt fine.  No fever just a sore arm.  I did not seek medical attention.

                                                At the time of the injection I felt immediate pain and burning. The next morning when I woke up I was unable to move my shoulder without excruciating pain. I had almost no range of motion. I had absolutely no strength. I started to take ibuprofen and cycle with Tylenol. I treated with heat, ice, icy hot and salon pass patches. My pain is located where my joint or rotator cuff would be located. I had no deltoid pain this time. My shots were both from the same lot. It is now eight days and I have some relief but still some pain, loss of motion and loss of strength. When I reported it to health programs they asked me to fill out this form. I am going to continue on the same regimen and hope it resolves itself. I have been doing a lot of things one-handed and trying to avoid use of my left arm.

                                                Day of injection I was fine, I even felt more energetic than usual, at 2am I woke up feeling Flu like symptoms, fever of 100, and achy all over and my arm hurt terribly.  I Took a Motrin 800, fell asleep and woke only to drink water, take temp, more Motrin, and back to sleep.  I slept about 20 hours only up to move to couch, then back to bed.  I was lethargic, symptoms similar to the flu. That was Sunday, Monday was slightly better but exhausted and barely functional.  I am VERY nervous to get the second shot as I do not want to feel that bad, let alone worse (which I&#39;ve heard is the case) .  I&#39;m scheduled to go this Saturday 2/6/2021 for the second dose.  I know that these are already noted symptoms so I knew I was in the category with others that experienced the same thing, I just want to confirm that I was another individual that had a tough time after the shot and that perhaps there are more people that have the common feeling just are not reporting.  I am pretty tough usually, (having homebirths, dealing with pain that I didn&#39;t think was that bad) this took me down. I was very surprised that I had that tough of a time.

                                                That night I started feeling bad, I woke up with a fever of 103 and I took some tylenol. The next day I had fever, chills, nausea and it just continued. Yesterday morning I had my husband take me to ER and I had lost 15 pounds since Wednesday. I couldn&#39;t keep down fluids. They tested me for Corona and the flu but both were negative. They also gave me fluids. Everything and smells and tastes terrible. They gave me Zofran but it didn&#39;t help. I haven&#39;t been able to take my medicine.

I also started to feel some fatigue and &#39;foggy&#39;.  Within an hour I was very fatigued, the joint pain in my hip progressed and had a headache. I used Tylenol and rest to help the symptoms. I was not able to go to work the next day. By 7pm on Feb 24 I felt fine. I was able to go to work and I no longer need Tylenol. I noticed that on February 25 I had hives on my torso. The hives had persisted for the past two days. They are located only on my torso and I don&#39;t have any other symptoms at this time.

I stayed 1 hour after at facility . The next day disorientation was better. The head pressure was better after 2 weeks. The hearing loss has slightly improved. The ear ringing worsened significantly and is still going on now, 9 weeks later. It has improved some now after seeing an ENT ear specialist. I have been taking medicine to try to help the ear ringing for about 7 weeks. The severity of the ear ringing has gone from an 8 out of 10 in loudness to about a 2. It is not gone and may never go away.

Patient had acute onset left sided numbness at 12:30pm while she was under her 15min observation post-covid19 vaccine injection. The patient reported that the numbness initially started in her left cheek that spread to the left side of her head then down her left side of the body reaching her toes. Patient was evaluated for stroke and according to the treating physician, the neuro exam was normal and patient answered appropriately for feeling touch or degree of touch equally bilaterally. NIHSS was 0 and MRI showed no acute CVA. The blood sugar was in the 50s with EMS. According to the treating physician, the symptoms may be related to the hypoglycemia at the same time as the incident. The physician also reports that the patient was very anxious in general and at times stated she had numbness that was worsening but at other times was witnessed walking around the room and to the bathroom by nursing staff without need for assistance or deficits. The patient was kept for observation and discharged the day after admission. A reaction to the vaccine cannot be completely ruled out considering the onset of symptoms but there may be other causes. The patient was asked to report this to the vaccination site prior to receiving the 2nd dose and be cleared by her PCP for the 2nd dose. This report is being entered in a abundance of caution in the setting of this new vaccine.

                                                Approximately 28 hours after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced intense pain and immobility in my left arm.  I had soreness as one would expect after receiving the injection but this was different.  I took ibuprofen and went to bed. I awoke several times in the night after rolling over in bed with pain.  I awoke in the morning and could not move my arm. My husband had to assist me in dressing.   That day (two days following vaccine), I had myalgia, neck pain, mild headache, fatigue, and a low grade fever.   My arm continued to be very painful although no swelling or redness.  The following morning (three days following vaccine), although I still had pain and decreased mobility, it was improved.  I am filing this report on the evening of 1/8/2021. Although I am not back to baseline, I anticipate that I will be in the next few days.  I thought it was important to report this given the severity of my symptoms.

                                                I received the shot at 8:10 am and felt nothing.  As the morning progressed, I developed a sore arm, similar to a flut shot.  However, it was worse, and I also felt achy in my neck.  I drove home from work around noon, and I couldn&#39;t even use my arm on the steering wheel.  These symptoms continued and I finally took Tylenol in the middle of the afternoon, and evening going to bed.  I slept horribly and woke up feeling like a train wreck.  I took my temperature. It was 102!  I started taking the Tylenol again.  I couldn&#39;t even raise my arm, either. My arm didn&#39;t hurt if it was just still, but it would hurt if it was touched, and I could not raise it for 3 days.  Despite taking the Tylenol, I felt awful all day and really had to stay bedridden.  I was also very thirsty both the day of the vaccine and this second day.  Saturday morning I woke up feeling better, but as the day wore on, the aches and fever came back.  Sunday was the same as Saturday.  Monday was similar, but better overall.  Today is Tuesday.   My arm still feels a little weird and I cannot completely raise it. I did have the COVID-19 back in March and have antibodies, as far as I know as I have donated to Red Cross 4 times.

                                                I was feeling great until day 9 after the injection.  I could not sleep, was very warm and arm was sore.  I woke next morning to find my left arm at the injection site very swollen, hard, red, rashy, and extremely hot to the touch.  I advised with the nurses at work that morning, and I was told it was a common side affect, but I was still uneasy since I had no reaction until day 9.  I was prompted to call my doctor, which was out of the office, was advised to go to prompt care.  I was treated with a prescription of steriods and antibiotics.  Slept better that night, less hot, hard, rashy, and red next morning.  Still used ice packs during the work day.

I woke up a few hours later with chills, headaches and body aches.  I took another Benadryl and slept for the rest of the night.  The next day, I woke up with the same symptoms, but worse.  I was very drowsy and slept all day.  I had no appetite.  That evening, I took some Tylenol and began to feel better a few hours later.  The next day, the symptoms had mostly resolved.  A little bit achy and sore but overall, I felt good.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA About 18hrs after vaccine was received, I experienced diarrhea and loss of appetite. Continued to experience loss of appetite and have bouts of diarrhea about every 3-4 hours throughout that day. 2nd day after the vaccine (1/13/21)  2:15am  pain at the injection site was severe enough to wake me when I rolled over on that arm, then I had nausea and diarrhea and fell back asleep. Upon waking 8:15am, continued to have diarrhea and loss of appetite until evening of 1/13/21. Arm pain went away 1/14/21.

I didn&#39;t say anything I just kept on going to see if it went away. I went home and was in a lot of pain while driving. I went home took my medication and went to sleep. Woke up in the morning and pain went away, the medication worked. I went to my Dr., went I left I started feeling nausea, dizzy and weak. I went to my sister&#39;s house and was in pain and laid down. I was cold and freezing and felt like I have Covid. I asked my sister to get me a trash bag a nd wash the blankets because I thought I had Coivd. I drove home and called my boss and told him I can&#39;t walk, I feel so bad, sweating and I was burning up, cold and hot.  I cant move I cant move. I stayed in my car until I can move. I made it inside my house and laid there and was burning up, cold hot, in pain, dizzy, everything was going on. I felt like a Mac truck hit me hard, like when I had Covid. I took Medicine and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning (Saturday) and my temp. was 101-102, I stayed in bed and later in the evening went away like it never happened. The same thing happened when I had the Covid.  I had Covid July 31, 2020 and lasted for 5 weeks.  It felt like the worst days like when I had Covid, I was going to call out to my job but it went away and I went to work.

After swelling went down I still have the red mark (size bigger than a quarter)  and until yesterday (12 days after shot) the area was still hot.

The next few days I felt flush although I did not register a fever and had some episodes of chills.  On 1/15/21 I began to experience itching at the injection site.   On 1/23/21, I developed a rash/hives on my chest.  The area is red with raised bumps in a small cluster that occasionally itches.  Since the onset of the rash on my chest, I have also experienced itchiness on my arms, legs and torso.  My left upper arm has raised, red areas.  My legs have patchy red areas as do my shoulders and back.  I have also had a disruption in my sleep which started after being diagnosed with the virus and is still occurring.

Headache lasted for over 2 weeks, was treated with Motrin and Tylenol around the clock and eventually subsided on it&#39;s own.  Headache intensity was significant enough and different enough to include awaking the patient at night, that an MRI was undertaken to rule out intracranial pathology.  No other neurological deficits, aura, or symptoms.

                                                About 10-12hrs later, my right shoulder started hurting and  got worse. The night of the 31st it was excruciating, it felt like someone was breaking my bones, it was a 10/10 pain, I wanted to cry the pain was so bad.  I took two Advil and put ice on it and I got to where I couldn&#39;t move my arm. I had difficulty sleeping as well. In the morning it was just as bad and I couldn&#39;t raise my arm it hurt so bad. My husband had noticed the shot given so high in my arm.  The next two days is didn&#39;t get much better, I tired to move it and lift it up but hard. The 5th day after the shot I called to get into the Orthopedic Dr to see that was going on. it was a little better but still a lot of pain.  The Dr. had told me to try to keep moving it, he  did an xray and nothing was broken but told me to follow up with him if it didn&#39;t get better. He did say to ask to have the second dose injection given a little lower in my arm.  It wakes me up once or more at night, I&#39;m not able to do what I use to do. I can move it a little better but my shoulder still hurts, I&#39;m not using it as much. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine.

                                                On the day of the vaccine did have arm soreness 4 hours after the vaccine.  Started to get chills and aches around 8:30.  Then went to sleep and woke up around around midnight with the worse chills, teeth chattering.  Had this feeling all through the night and could not calm down from the aches, temp was 99.  As the next morning progressed, she calmed down and was exhausted.  The fever started to elevate and went up to 101.5 all the next day, really exhausted and was sleeping most of that day.  It took probably about 4 days to recover from that with low energy level.  She felt that she had gone through a shortened COVID.  They had already had COVID at the end of September, and it took 2 1/2 weeks for that to resolve.  The following Thursday 1/7/21 started having diarrhea that lasted 4 days.  Then she finally felt better.  She also spoke with a friend who took the Pfizer vaccine and had the same reaction to her vaccine as well.   Called doctor and he advised her to wait it out.

I took oxycodone (7.5mg), but  it only took the edge off of the pain. It felt like a nasty RA flare up. Since then, I have more bone and joint pain than usual. I am afraid to take the second dose.   Insomnia since receiving the injection. (ongoing) I can&#39;t be sure that this is related to the vaccine, but I work with others who are also experiencing ongoing insomnia since receiving the Moderna vaccine.

                                                About 5 minutes after the vaccine, I felt like the vaccine going through my body, mu fingers kept tingling, heart rate started to race. They game me some orange juice and monitored me for about 15 minutes. I went back to work and I felt shaky for about 3-4 hours. I then had a terrible headaches and back ache. That same night I got some hives and chest tightness with increased in throat production and the headache continued that night.  The next day I still felt tired and achy, felt like a mild flu. I had chest tightness with difficulty breathing.  I continued to feel sick Saturday and Sunday and Monday I had a Covid test done, which was negative.  On Monday I had rashes on my arms and legs and continued to have the hives and on Tuesday I started to feel a bit better with a dry cough.  On Tuesday 01-12-220 I had a chest x-ray which was negative.  On Wednesday, I woke up and felt much worse and that&#39;s when I called the NP and she prescribed three inhalers for my breathing issues. On 01-27-2020, since I was still feeling not better I called off work.  As now, I am slowly getting better, but I still continued with the hives.

I was kept at the facility extra time (around 40 minutes in total) and left with a friend to return about an hour or so later to drive home.   I did not have any difficulty breathing but did have some rashy/redness on my chest but that is not unusual for me when I am having any kind of distress.  The other s/s were not typical for me.

Kept up and got more pronounced throughout week and started feeling burning sensations in both arms through Feb 15th. Self referred to Neurology on Feb. 16th.  Feb 17th, began to feel worse, spreading to both legs feeling weak, burning sensation, fatigue, and began feeling VERY foggy brained.  Have been sleeping a lot, but legs and arms go from burning sensations, weakness, to cold sensations, and achy right leg thigh muscle, to this moment.  Brain fog and fatigue seem worst in morning.

                                                The patient had gone shopping in the store after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and then returned to the pharmacy after about 10 minutes saying she wasn&#39;t feeling well. She reported feeling hot, that her lips were tingling, and stating she just felt weird. I had her sit in the immunization booth so I could tend to her without and audience. I gave her 10 ml of Benadryl because she mentioned her lips were tingling. I broke one of the instant icepacks for her and had her place it on the back of her neck and put her head between her knees. She reported feeling that her face felt hot, so I broke two more icepacks and had her sit up right and place the ice packs on the front of her neck. I stayed with her in the booth and talked to her until she felt better. I set the timer on my phone for 15 minutes. After 10 minutes she said she was feeling better and wanted to move to the waiting area. She was fine after the full 15 minutes and left our store. I estimate she remained in the store for approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

She felt awful within an hour of vaccination and persisted with symptoms for 2.5 days.  She described it as being out of it, headache, fever, chills, profound body aches, weakness and dizziness with palpitations.  She could not get out of bed for a day.  She literally thought she was going to die given the severity of her weakness.  As quickly as the symptoms occurred, they left her on March 7th, 2021.  She went to work on March 8th and noted similar symptoms to prior ITP flares - petechiae on legs, gum bleeding, fatigue, mild headache.  She also noted dark urine but no frank blood.  Since being admitted and receiving steroids, she is feeling improved and petechiae are lessening.  She also noted mild mouth ulceration to lower lip along with oozing.

She was then transferred to Emergency Department. Per their report: The patient presents with a swollen discolored left lower leg.  She does have  discoloration and I am concerned for massive DVT and cerulea dolens.  She does  have really minimal pain to the leg except to the groin, she has intact pulses,  I have low suspicion for acute ischemia/arterial clot.  She does complain of  some mild dyspnea with exertion above baseline so I do have concerns for  possible PE.  She is hemodynamically stable, appears in no distress.  She is on  oral contraceptives, mild obesity, no other significant VTE risk factors.  I am  going to empirically start her on heparin, I have also ordered a CT PE and a CT  abdomen pelvis to check for proximal propagation of the DVT along with a left  lower extremity duplex Doppler ultrasound.    Duplex ultrasound also showed extensive left lower extremity DVT up to the  common femoral, she does have bilateral PEs without evidence of significant clot  burden or heart strain, she is hemodynamically stable with normal pulse  oximetry.  The patient also has clots proximal up to her IVC.  I discussed this  with Dr.  of vascular surgery for possible thrombolysis therapy of the  left lower extremity.  She was discussed with SOUND for admission.

                                                I began experiencing severe tinnitus about 9 days after my first Moderna vaccine dose. Very loud electronic hissing tone throughout my head. This has not subsided since March 22. It is ongoing, 24 hours a day. This produced distress, discomfort, and anxiety. I went to the ER at Hospital on March 22 due to the sudden tinnitus onset and the accompanying anxiety. They gave me referrals for an audiologist, PCP, and psychiatrist. At the hospital, they gave me Ativan.  The tinnitus is very uncomfortable, scary, loud, and disruptive. I&#39;ve had two separate audiologists test my hearing and examine my ears and both are fine. Nothing remarkable. I&#39;ve also had an MRI done with normal results. I&#39;ve been to my PCP, another doctor at the same clinic, and an ENT doctor. I also went to a psychiatric physician&#39;s assistant. No one seems to know the cause or what to do. I&#39;ve been prescribed 20 mg of fluoxetine daily, o.5 mg alprazolam as needed for distress. Also prescribed, 25 mg amitriptyline, and 50mg trazodone to help sleep. The trazodone had no effect so I stopped it. Also prescribed a 6-day course of methylprednisolone, but I had to stop on the third day because it kept me up for almost three days, so I stopped. I&#39;m also taking daily Zyrtec, Benadryl, generic multi-symptom allergy medication, 2000mg Vitamin C, B12, and two Chinese herbs. I&#39;ve also been seeing a chiropractor 3 x a week. I&#39;ve seen a craniosacral therapist once and will start acupuncture this Sat.

                                                At 9:59AM (9 minutes after vaccination) I suddenly felt dizzy and like I was going to pass out.  My body was tingling from head to toe.  My chest felt heavy but I think that may have been slight anxiety because it was a scary feeling and I did not want to be the person who needed EMS assistance.  I rolled down my window, took off my mask and took deep breaths of fresh air.  I slowly started to feel better.  At 30 minutes I felt much better and after an hour I was back to my normal self.

Her right eye then started to swell around 2 pm and she began to have difficulty talking and swallowing. She was not short of breath but felt like her throat was tightening. She arrived to work at 2:50 pm and informed her boss who sent her to the employee health department. She reported having oral Benadryl and  was going to take that. Anesthesiology evaluated her, felt it was a progressive allergic reaction, and recommended evaluation at an urgent care or ED. She later developed hives, her lower lip became swollen.  She was later evaluated at Emergency Department. She will be able to provide you with information on the doctor, treatment. She was prescribed a course of prednisone and will have allergy testing scheduled. MD indicated uncertain if caused by vaccine.   She missed work on 1/6 due to the ongoing reaction which had improved.

Temperature highs ranged from 100.8-101.4, and I felt as badly as when I had COVID-19 in March 2020. I was unable to go to work as scheduled on Friday 1/8 and Saturday 1/9. I am concerned about getting the 2ND DOSE as it has been stated that 2nd dose may create more severe symptoms than the first. PLEASE ADVISE. Also, is there a correlation between having had COVID-19 and having strong &#34;side effects&#34; to the vaccine? Please advise. Thank you!

Certain smells are terrible, some foods very off putting, unable to eat normal amounts of food without feeling like I am going to be sick.  Forgot to eat for 7 hours yesterday (NEVER in my history do I forget to eat).  I feel okay now but my stomach is not feeling normal and my eating habits are not normal yet.  So symptoms have been present from Tuesday to today, being Friday...they are improving but I am nervous about getting a second dose if more people generally have more severe responses with the second dose.  I forgot to list it earlier, I am not able to take calcium supplements. Anything over 50 mg of calcium on a regular basis makes me very sick and blood labs will like thst have been switched with someone else&#39;s.

                                                I had my first dose of the vaccine on Monday morning. I woke up Tuesday morning with a very sore arm, which I expected. I was also very tired with a bit of a headache. I teach school, and throughout the day I had very little energy and went to bed early that night. The next day (Wednesday) I felt the same, really wiped out, but also had some gastrointestinal issues and little appetite. Thursday I felt the same. Today is Friday, and I&#39;m still dragging a bit but my appetite is returning. I feel like I&#39;m getting back to normal.

Pain got less as each day went on and subsided a few days later. Sore throat a few days later in glands area but only lasted a day. Sciatic nerve flared up afterwards...still dealing with that and it&#39;s 2 weeks later but I have had issues with that before: still tired but not as tired, ears bothering me and some nasal congestion but not unusual for this time of year.

                                                this is a report of my personal experience I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine Wednesday January 20th at approximately 4:30pm Cox North. The injection was painful, the person administering the injection inserted the needle VERY slowly, and then pressed the plunger VERY slowly. However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt &#34;funny&#34; mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised &#34;bed rest and hydration&#34;) I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up. I was unable to remain upright, but could sit in a recliner at that time. I was unable to hold a bottle of water on my own until approximately 2pm. I had no headache, no fever, no nausea (after the initial 5am experience) but DID experience extreme muscle weakness until approximately 2pm Thursday January 21, 2021. (too weak to chew food) Friday January 22nd, I felt &#34;fine&#34;, but still mild tiredness. ( I was told by our office manager that I should fill out an RL to report my experience)

                                                Five in a half hours after vaccine ,vaccinated arm became more sore, soreness traveled up arm to fingers and spread to rest of arm and body as time passed.  Body aches progressed and became more intense, went to bed.  Was unable to sleep, had a left ear ache and neck ache that intensified as the night went on.  I was unable to move at all in bed, I was sweating and in SEVERE  pain I was finally was able to crawl out of bed at 5:30 and took some aspirin.  The aspirin only took the edge off for a few hours as I tried to sleep,the ear ache and the headache intensified.  If I would of had a pain killer I would have taken it, as I was in so much body ache pain.  Stayed in bed all day until the evening and continued to take aspirin every 4-6 hours, used a heating pad and pushed water.  Applied CBD ointment which helped quite a bit.  Every hour that passed in the evening the intense pain would subside a bit and by 8:30 pm I started to feel like I was feeling back to normal.  Day two rested and have body aches but am able to control the pain with aspirin.  Ear pain almost gone, left neck pain almost gone, right neck pain started and is controlled.  Sweating  with a low grade fever and fatigued.

                                                The first injection I received was from an empty syringe, the healthcare worker told me she didn?t notice it was empty until after she gave it to me and said she would need to inject me again, which she did immediately after noticing the empty syringe. I immediately felt a burning sensation going down my arm but did not have any immediate pain. Approx. 3 1/2 - 4 hrs later, my muscle where I received the injection began feeling very sore. After several days, I used a lidocaine patch on my arm which eased the pain so it was tolerable. However, today is the 11th day of my pain and I have not been able to sleep through the night for the past 3 nights due to excruciating pain that wakes me up and I am unable to raise my arm. The pain and my range of motion for my arm has progressively gotten worse by the day with today being close to unbearable.

Motrin every 6 hours. I went to bed at 8pm that night and woke up back to normal.  Of note I had Covid 19 in April 2020

                                                It started with a fever of 99.8 (norm is 97.4). I had brain fog. really slow thoughts. I felt like my brain was in slow motion. Big time fatigue. I felt like I was carrying a truck. I also noticed with my MS I am wobbly but I can catch myself but I felt like it was getting much worse. I called my Dr. and she thinks that the vaccine caused a flare-up in my MS. She gave me a prednisone pack. the last dose of prednisone I took, I was still fatigued. I began using a walker because I couldn&#39;t walk safely. I noticed as I tried to get out of my car a few days later I was thrown backwards which caused me to land on my glasses which cut my face and resulted in stitches. I did test but my MS was not in an active flare but they said it could be in a flare because of the COVID vaccine. they couldn&#39;t give me medication because that medication causes heart spasms. I was denied by my insurance to go to rehab. I cant walk and I am currently in the hospital.

                                                As to be expected several hours after vaccine my arm become sore. Then at 12:30am I woke to severe chills, slight headache, sweats as well, body aches all over my body and I took my temperature and it was 103.4.  I don&#39;t think I have ever had a fever that high before.  I took some Tylenol extra strength  and tried to go back to sleep but I couldn&#39;t I was afraid.  This went on for several hours and my temp ranged from 102.3-103.6.  I tried to drink liquids too.  I called off of work.  That day I laid around hot and cold, body aches, my chest hurt a little to take a deep breath, fatigue and weakness were unbearable at sometimes. My fever spikes probably that high 3-4 times yesterday.  I had fluids and soup.  I alternated Motrin and Tylenol all day.  I tried to rest and maybe sleep but just couldn&#39;t close my eyes despite being tired/weak.  By 7-8pm I was still weak but felt better  My temp was around 99-100.  I went to be around 10pm and woke up at 2am with really bad heartburn that I couldn&#39;t lay down I had to sit in my recliner chewing 4 Galvascon tabs. Sipping water and felt my chest hurt and wondered if I was having a heart issue. But i relaxed and finally by 5 am when my alarm went off.. I took my temp it was 100.2.  I called off work again today and I laid down to sleep a few more hours.   Now  I feel better and still weak  My temp has gone down.

                                                On the 3rd - I started noticing my left eye swollen; on the 5th day day it felt weird - and it&#39;s getting bigger. My voice changed like a horse - hoarse throat. And when I swallowed it was like a piece of food in my throat. At work, my left eye is swollen  and my lower lip was swollen too and they took me to patient room at work and examined me. Asked me to go home from work and my husband took me to ED  on January 5th- I had gotten hives - started feeling itchy all over my body. At Emergency room they gave me Prednisone to stop the swelling. My throat was swollen and they gave me blood tests, too. Prednisone helped some - took that for one week. (Still missed work on the sixth because my eyes were still swollen.) Had a previously scheduled doctor appt for something else and my doctor told me the hives will come back after Prednisone so he told me to take Claritin for two weeks. All my symptoms resolved after that.

                                                Moderna covid-19 vaccine eua. About 15 min after injection I felt hot (very unusual for me), then dizzy,  racing heart, weak then very nauseous.  I told the nurse.  He asked me to lay down.  I did not get worse.  After 20 min or so I sat up and did not feel worse.  Just stable nausea and dizzy.  I asked if I could leave.  After verifying I had people at home I was allowed to go.  I felt exhausted and nauseous for the rest of the day.  I was confused the next morning about what day it was and had some hives at injection site.  I felt normal after figuring out what day it was.  I walked 8 miles and aside from the hives at the injection site was normal.  One week later I had headache, exhaustion and had an uncomfortable rash at the site.  The rash is still on my arm.    Should I get the second dose?

Rash went away.  SOB lasted off and on for several days. Heart rate was off when I was working out for a couple of weeks.  I work out  so we wear heart rate monitors.  Heart rate did not recover as quickly as normal during my workouts. Took a couple of weeks for this to get back to normal for me.  Just really felt &#34;off&#34; for awhile and not like myself.  Did not feel comfortable getting second shot because of the above symptoms.

                                                At 8 PM the day of the shot (Thursday), my arm became extremely sore and I was very tired.  I went to bed.  By 9 PM  I had chills and could not get warm. I dozed off and on until roughly 12:20 when I got up and vomited.  I dozed from then until 5 AM continuing to have chills and vomited 3 more times. I  got up and proceeded to work.  By 10 AM (Friday) I was unable to stay at work as I continued to have chills, exhaustion,  muscle aches,  a headache, and was unable to focus on the easiest task. I had also dry heaved 2 more times. Upon arriving at home I got into bed and slept until 8:30-8:50 AM the next morning which was Saturday.  Saturday I was able to eat crackers and soda without issue.  I was just extremely tired. No more chills, mild muscle aches and a slight headache still.  Slept a full 9 hours and was fine on Sunday.

They performed an EKG and blood tests. Everything came out normal. Doctor said it could have been an allergic reaction to the vaccine or its components. Recommended to keep taking my anxiety medication and report it to my primary care physician. The tachycardia lasted for 18 hours. It was a scary situation I don&#39;t want to go thru again. I&#39;m not taking the second shot!

Resident displayed signs of tremors, twitching, confusion, in and out of consciousness, low O2 sats, elevated pulse and fever, fatigue and weakness. Writer called NP.

Tonight resident is not easily aroused, lethargic, continues to have tremors and twitches, almost appearing as convulsions. When asked if she knows where she is or what day it is, resident can properly answer. Resident denies SOB but staff has noted loud squeals while breathing.

                                                Following 1st Covid shot on 12/31; about 2 hours afterward experienced extreme fatigue, nausea, and dull headache.  All mild and expected as possible side effects.  No concerns.  Symptoms continued and by 1/5; all symptoms had move to severe level and are still occurring today 1/8.  Temperature spikes to 102.8; chills, severe headache especially in eye sockets, body aches, and heaviness in chest.  Could not work on 1/7 and only for a bit on 1/8 (working from home).  Became concerned and was flu and covid tested on 1/7;  both negative.  I was retested for Covid on 1/8 and still negative.  I am not sure if maybe I am sick with something else and this is coincidence or if I am just experiencing issues from the vaccine that are a little different from others?

I notified my direct supervisor how I was feeling. I woke up on Tuesday morning with the sickness and I called off work. I got into contact with my Doctor, on Wednesday and had a tele-appointment. He gave me three medications, and currently it has lasted for six days, and I am going to try and get an appointment with the doctor on Monday 01/11/2021.

Usual &amp; expected solicited SEs: fatigue, soreness, feeling &#34;off,&#34; transient headache, chills sx Day 2- strong R arm pain, cannot lift R arm.  Metallic taste in mouth and tingling tongue persists.  Also same usual Sx as day 1 plus mild nausea.   Felt really crummy.   Day 3- Still moderately strong R arm pain, can only partially lift arm over head, cannot straighten over head.   Strong fatigue continues, mild nausea.   By this day I recall having some unusual Noc . calf cramping.   Sx certainly improved after 72 hrs but some did continue up to 7 days.   Cramping returned as did odd R ear/jaw/throat nerve pain.  Scratchy throat.  Fatigue persisted, gradually improved.  I believe the non-standard SEs may represent an allergic reaction.  I deem this mild to moderate, as I was unable to perform daily functions at times.  I would like to be able to talk to a professional as to whether a second dose is recommended in my situation.  I am concerned to know if previous allergic reactions suggest increase likelihood of future and possibly worsened reactions.  Note: I have been unable to access my Vsafe reports today to confirm exact time frame.  The above is to best of my recollection.

                                                No pain with injection.  Left shoulder pain began around 4 pm the same day, unable to raise left upper extremity against gravity without severe shoulder pain.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol immediately after injection and 600 mg of Advil at 9 pm as well as used Ice to decrease swelling and pain.  The pain increased and I was unable to sleep at all secondary to pain.  The shoulder pain has continued and loss of active shoulder range is apparent.  I am stretching and taking NSAIDS as able for the pain.  I have been unable to sleep well since receiving the vaccine secondary to the pain.   Today is day 7 and I am slowly getting back some active range however I continue to increased shoulder and peri scapular pain that limits my ability at home and at work.

                                                within 30 seconds I had a cooling sensation rush across the tip of my tongue, then a sweet taste, then more identifiable as bubble gum flavored.  By 12:45 I noticed I was scratching several areas of my body. Arms, legs, chest, neck, back and scalp and kept clearing my throat.  I looked down at my arm and seen a red welt from my elbow to my wrist in my left arm and a fine red rash beneath skin on right arm.  I looked up at the pharmacist and he said at 12:40 he had already placed a call to have another pharmacist come to look me over.   I then noticed that my heart seemed to be racing and feeling winded.  I figured this was my anxiety and just tried to relax.  The second pharmacist arrived and we walked to the ER.  I was very winded. They took me to a room and checked stats.  after 3 attempts taking my BP and using two different cuffs, she said my BP was 190/90 where it is typically 120/70. I drank lots of water and they monitored me for almost an hour and gave me another Benadryl.  My BP came down to 180/82 , breathing was easier and itching was decreasing so I chose to return to my station and I took one more Benadryl.  The following day: woke up with head ache in rt eye and fuzzy vision all day, mild sore throat, mild body aches, queasy stomach, fatigue and runny nose.  Took a Pepcid for stomach, Tylenol/Advil duo for sore throat, headache/body aches, drank lots of water and rested.  Following day most symptoms resided, still  slight sore throat, rt eye blurred vision, coughing, sneezing and runny nose.  everyday since, symptoms continue to decrease.

About 48 hours after I felt very fatigue, almost too exhausted to get ready for work. The following two days I felt nauseated, very fatigued, achy and interrupted sleep patterns - going to bed earlier than usual, waking up between 2-4am. 4 today after still fatigued aches. The 6th day I felt better with energy, then that evening came the headache and by the following morning (7th day) felt fatigued with chills. The head ache woke me up from sleep at 1 am that night and 3:45am the following night. By the Friday 1/15/21 I still had chills, broke out in a sweat walking throughout house, still tired but not as bad and the headache is gone. I felt so bad onvthe 14th I went and saw a Doctor who suggested I was having a severe reaction to the vaccin. He said my vitals were good, performed a covid test to rule out the possibility (turned out negative) and told me to rest. He also warned the 2nd dose could be worse reaction.

Sunday morning in the middle of my sleep, I woke feeling hot and sweaty, slightly nauseated, and like I had to defecate.  I stood up, felt like low blood pressure but wanted to get to the bathroom.  I walked towards the door, opened the door and fainted, falling backwards.  My spouse  states I was pale,staring at the ceiling and kind of stiff in my arms and legs for about 3 minutes.  He spoke to me, checked my pulse, covered me, poked my feet. As I came back to awareness I tried to speak and was unintelligible but then became more conscious.  He tested me with questions to make sure I was ok.  I defecated after that but did not vomit.  I was tired the rest of the day and napped for several hours.  I don&#39;t seem to have hurt anything in the fall.  I am instructed to be off work Monday by my supervisor.

The following day around 3 pm I began to have chills and felt like I had the raid heart rate again.  By 5 pm I was beginning to feel really bad, I was freezing, chills and my heart rate was now extremely fast, I was having trouble speaking complete sentences, my husband drove me to the emergency department.  I had a very high heart rate and high fever, I was admitted and in the hospital until Sunday afternoon. The diagnosis was pneumonia,  I don&#39;t really believe this, as I felt fine and had  no symptoms prior to the onset of the fever.

Muscle and bone aches through my spine and hips, nausea with some vomiting, chills, severe weakness, no recordable fever but felt feverish, skin hurt. Woke up Tuesday drenched in sweat but the bone pain had subsided. Still very weak, nauseous, continued in bed. Woke up today feeling on fire, eyes burning hot, skin no longer hurt but felt hot.  Injection site hurt through Sunday-no redness, no rash or swelling.  I took Tylenol and Advil throughout.  My previous trunk rash completely disappeared. I began taking the prednisone last night. 50mg BID. I have a 5 day supply.  Took a Covid test on Monday-results pending.  Tried to see my doctor today giving them the above information-there were no appts til Friday and I was referred to the ED.  I will not go to the ED where I could actually catch Covid. I was unable to get past phone triage with the doctors office.

About an hour later while watching TV, a hot flash/flush came over my head and upper torso. I noticed bright red checks and nose which resolved within a couple hours (without any intervention). Temp was elevated per touch, and clammy. Blood pressure was elevated for several days 160-180s/86-100. A small scar on my finger from cyst removal 7 wks prior became inflamed and red w/ burning/tingling for 3 days.   Anticipated SE did included head ache, sore arm, fatigue and sleepiness for 2.5 days. (previous vaccines only resulted in sore arm--all other SE above (esp becoming possessed with fury), were new experiences.

Went to work on Monday was fine. Came home did peloton 45 min and then did more yard work with my husband.  That night I became extremely sore and tired went to bed at 9 pm.  That next day would be Tuesday the 19th I was tired all morning very low energy.  Then by 130pm it hit me like a ton of bricks, extreme fatigue and chills. Drove myself home, almost did not think I could drive the entire way  home ( about a 20 min ride). Made it home went straight to bed, body ache, chills, fever101.6 and smashing headache. Called out of work for Wed Jan 20th. I am an RN at an outpatient orthopedic facility. I have not missed a work day in 9 years. I exercise 6-7 days per week. I am never sick! I continue to run fever until Thursday pm.  No fever on Friday the  22nd. Just continue with extreme fatigue, smashing headache and dizziness. I decide by Sunday January 24th to go get tested for COVID  and did a rapid test and it came back negative.  I was told to report my adverse reaction. Today I feel better, first day I have not woken up with a headache. Have developed a slight headache not as bad.  Continue with the fatigue.  I would like to report this and have someone contact me. I do not know what to do about the second does! This has hit me so hard. Thank you!

                                                I received the injection on 01/17/21 and have not felt well since. That night, I had chills and fatigue. The chills passed quickly, but I still feel tired, run down, and out of it (10 days later). On Thursday the 21st, I had a severe headache. The worst one I have ever experienced. I wasn&#39;t able to work and it took a few days to recover. Today, 01/27/21, I woke up with a rash at the injection site. It is warm to the touch and feels mildly irritated, but as far as I can tell, has not spread. Because I haven&#39;t felt well in 10 days, I am not sure I feel comfortable getting the second injection. I am having difficulty concentrating and sleeping. I don&#39;t feel like my usual self.

                                                Office visit 1/26: The employee is having right-sided back pain radiating down to her knee since 1/19/2021. She relates this pain to a vaccine for Covid which she received on 1/12/2021.  She has a history of right-sided shoulder tendinitis after flu vaccine and so she refuses to get the vaccine in her deltoid muscle and usually gets vaccines in her right gluteal area.  She had the vaccine for Covid on 1/12/2021 in the right hip area a little bit higher than where she normally gets it.  She developed some redness to the injection site which subsided but soon afterwards began having right-sided sacral pain and then right-sided knee pain. The pain is described as a ache and burning.  She does not have numbness and tingling down her leg.  And she does not have any limitation in terms of flexion or extension of her back but she finds that she cannot lie on her back at night because it hurts.  She also has trouble getting out of a chair because of right knee pain. She was seen by the orthopedist,  he has ordered an EMG which came out negative, and ordered to take Naprosyn twice a day. Dx: Lumbosacral radiculopathy at L3. F/U on 1/28: At this time she still having some dull right-sided back pain and pain to her knee but it is tolerable. She has been able to rest over the course of this week as she has not gone to work. She feels at this time that she can manage her pain and is able to start working this weekend on 1/30/2021. We expect that the pain will gradually subside as the effect of the injection subsides as well.

                                                right arm was starting to hurt more at bedtime (10pm). I slept restlessly and at 3pm woke up with severe upper right arm pain and could not raise my arm. tried icing arm, eventually was able to go back to sleep. when I woke up around 8 am, my arm still hurt badly and I could not fully use it. I had to have my husband wash my hair and comb it and help me get dressed (this is not normal). I took some aleve and within a few hours I could move it some and the pain was less but I still could not do normal daily activities with it without pain and still could not raise my arm above shoulder height. I also was quite tired and took a nap mid afternoon (also not normal). My arm was still sore when I went to bed that night but not as bad. When I woke up the next morning, it was sore but I could do all of my normal activities on my own with minimal discomfort. I still feel like I have limited ROM and weakness in my right arm. I had my son help me with dinner because I could not lift a heavy skillet or roll out some dough.  I had normal amounts of fatigue today.

                                                I have sarcoidosis and the vaccine has kicked me into a bad flare-up.  I have a large granuloma growing under the skin on my right arm near the wrist.  I started noticing it last week because my skin is very tight around it.  I did not have this before.  I have, however, had a granuloma removed from that wrist about 10 years ago.  This is above where that was though, not the same spot.  The granuloma is hot to the touch.  I have felt horrible since I got the shot and I am  extremely fatigued.   I  have had to miss work because I slept past the alarms.   My body hurts all over still.  I&#39;m most concerned about the immune response and the thing growing on my arm.

                                                Within 30 minutes I noticed my neck felt funny.  By the time I got home my face was tingly and my tongue was numb.   I did not even think about it being a reaction to the shot.  I took some Benadryl and a beta blocker because my heart was racing.   I laid down and about an hour later it was better.   I checked with my pcp dr.  She recommended that I take Benadryl before the next dose and ordered an epipen.   I have had anaphalxis previously due to a mango allergy.   I took the Benadryl before and was very nervous.  Eskenazi was amazing.  They assigned me a special watch person and kept me for 30 min.  I felt a little funny.... tingly face and my tongue was not normal.  When I got home I took a second Benadryl and a nap and then felt fine.

It felt like my right arm was attacked by hammers because it was so sore.The next day (2/19/21) I had muscle soreness, chills, and felt tired and &#34;out of it&#34;. I took an ibuprofen (400 mg)  at 1:30 pm on 1/19/21 and felt immediately better. My arm where I got the injection was still sore and I noticed when I changed my hosptial scrubs my arm was red and swollen at 3 pm  and had a rash. I took a50 mg  benadryl at 5 pm and woke up and my lips were swollen. I could feel the tip of my tongue feel like my lips &#34;like they were going to sleep&#34; and tingly. I went to the ER.

                                                Within 6 hours of vaccination, intense pain in the right arm - could not lift it overhead without pain.  This continued - and got worse on Friday morning.  The Friday morning event is what I am reporting.  I got up to shower; put shampoo in my hair and then conditioner. My right arm was hurting so badly that I was having trouble rinsing my hair. Then I felt faint and nauseous. Got out of the shower and fell onto the bed in the bedroom. Woke my husband to tell him that I was feeling badly - faint and the whole room was spinning. Then I felt my airway closing. He went down to get my levalbuterol (rescue inhaler); took one puff and that opened my airways.  I was still weak and he had to help me get dressed.  (BTW- I&#39;m a competitive athlete/ swimmer.)  I held onto him going downstairs.  I was not hungry though did eat a bit.  I spent the day on the couch with the chills and the room spinning until early afternoon.  By Saturday I was starting to feel better.  The pain in my arm mostly subsided by Sunday and I went to swim practice.  It wiped me out for the entire day and I spent the rest of Sunday on the couch. It&#39;s now Monday morning. I am feeling a bit off but better.  I am concerned about getting the second shot.

All my muscles were trembling/twitching, this started 7-8 hours after the vaccine and lasted several hours even after taking Tylenol and Advil.  chills that lasted 3 days, no fever, joint pain that lasted 3 days. Shortness of breath after taking showers, this would last a few hours after and require me to use my rescue inhaler. This would be abnormal for me as I don&#39;t normally become short of breath during or after taking a shower.   Arm pain with 2 in x 2 inch swelling just above the injection site.  9 days out and I still have a red , raised  bump at the site of the vaccination. At day 9 post injection, I am still very tired and take several naps everyday. I have not been to work in a week. I normally work 10 hour days with no problems of fatigue. Of note, I did not have any reaction other than mild arm pain at the injection site with the first vaccine that I got on 1/20/2021.

                                                My left shoulder was moderately sore for about 3 days after the injection.  The soreness didn&#39;t interfere with activities but did interfere with  my sleep.  Other than that I had no immediate reaction.  However, early on day 7 (01/11), I developed itching at the injection site and as the day progressed I developed redness, irritation, hotness, and continued itching.  It began as a small area about the circumference of a golf ball and spread, over the course of the day, to about the size of a grapefruit.  The symptoms lasted about 2 days (01/11-12).  By the evening of day 9 (01/13), hives began to appear, mostly on my arms and legs, with minimal bumps also on my torso and neck.  I&#39;m submitting this report on the evening of day 10 and the hives are still present.  The hives itch and are easily irritated.

That night I had severe left arm soreness to the point where I needed a narcotic, I had some at home. The pain woke me up. The next day I was more tired and had a stomach ache and more fatigue, left arm sore took Tylenol, fluids and did not call my doctor. Went to bed with a narcotic. Sunday into Monday 1/9 -1/10 I had severe diarrhea and could not eat, sore throat, muscle aches, decreased left arm soreness.  Full relief by Thursday.

                                                One week following my 1st vaccination, on Monday January 11, I developed small red bumps at the injection site, which turned into one big, itchy welt by the end of that same day. I visited my PCP the next afternoon, on Tuesday, January 12th. He said it was not a systemic reaction but a localized reaction to the vaccine and prescribed a 5-day Medrol pack and Hydroxyzine. I was also experiencing episodes of anxiety beginning 2 days following my injection, on Wednesday, January 6 th. The redness is subsiding at this time - approximately 50% improvement; some itchiness persists if I don&#39;t take the hydroxyzine regularly (I don&#39;t because I have to work and it makes me very sleepy). Anxiety is improved, as well.

I could not ambulate without looking down at the ground. This grew worse over the next few days. I was seen by a Neurologist on January 12, 2021 who based on my neurological exam ordered me an MRI of the brain with gadolinium. Dizziness persisted and I could not work for three days that week . After a two week period,  it became more intermittent in nature.

About 12 hours after the vaccine I spiked a fever and felt like I was hallucinating.  I was unable to check my temperature until 10:30 a.m. the next morning and it was 102.4.  I had a fever, body aches, and headache the entire following day. My fever broke to 99.0 around 6:00 p.m.  I also had severe pain at the injection site that started several hours after my injection and continued to get worse.  The pain was so bad it was too painful to move my arm.  Today is day two post-vaccine, I have no fever but feel very weak and lethargic.

I took my temperature thinking I was running a fever, but temperature was 97.3. I went and soaked in a really hot tub of water trying to get warm. After a little while (20-30 minutes) I started feeling achy all over. I went to bed feeling really horrible with chills and achiness, but I could not go to sleep. Finally, sometime after midnight, I fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning I felt fine. The chills and achiness from the previous night were gone with no lingering effects.

                                                First three days was just muscle soreness and fatigue.  On day 4 I started having tight chest and SOB while snowshoeing, which I did not have the day before on same activity.  That night I woke up with SOB and tightness in my chest and severe pain in area of my heart.  I could not lay on my left side.  It seemed like I was having heart attack symptoms.  Barley slept but upon waking my heart rate was 94 and the pain remained in LT Axilla area.  Took it easy for day and that night again had trouble sleeping, SOB but not as bad.  Woke up with excrutiating pain radiating up the base of my RT skull.  Was concerned about blood clot potential??  Had SOB when walking up stairs.  My throat hurt when bending over, as if my esophagus was crushing.  Friends said my face looked puffy and I felt bloated.  Landed up reporting to ER at the Hospital on Monday, Feb. 1st as directed by my PCP.  Hospital was told I had just had 2nd dose of vaccine, but did not think it was related.  I will mention all tests below, but upon arriving home on Feb. 2nd, I discovered a rash breaking out on underside of my LT upper arm, LT inner thigh and LT lower leg.

I came to work but was dragging the entire day.  Wednesday morning, after a good sleep, soreness was gone, but I was tired early the next afternoon.  I was fine Thursday but continued to have sore lymph nodes in the armpit of the arm that got the shot for several days after.

I was given Benadryl 25mg and salumedrol IV. Before the 30 min mark I had tingling on the tip of my tongue and lips. I was monitored for 2&#43; hours and was sent home. The doctor prescribed 40mg prednisone for 4 days an Epipen, and antihistamines, recommended I see an allergist.  I saw APN 1/18/21 after the tingling and throat tightness persisted, she prescribed a taper of the prednisone.  Went to allergist 1/21/21 where we discussed continued symptoms and longer taper of prednisone and she asked me to call her 1/25/21. We spoke 1/25/21 and she recommended I see an ENT. Saw ENT on 1/29/21 who examined my throat with no concerns there. We discussed the ?burning mouth syndrome? symptoms and he recommended I return for medicated mouth wash if the symptoms continue. I am no longer taking any medication. I still have mild tingling on the lips and tongue, slight peppery feel/taste and occasional tightness at the base of my throat. We

                                                Arm turned red at injection site and hot. There was really no pain and went away within a couple of day but turned red again exactly a week later from injection date. This time it was hard, hot, red, itchy, and bigger. Dr treated it with clindamycin and dose pack of steroids. It got better after a few days. Next, I got a UTI and called my primary care physician. She ordered CIPRO and phenazopyridine. That got better but before CIPRO was finished, I got a crick in my neck that turned into excruciating pain in my neck and was unable to turn head from side to side. At the same time, my left foot became painful, red and swelled. I have been treated for arthritis in that foot 6 years ago with an injection. I have not had any problems with it since the injection.  Dr. treated my neck problem with Robaxin and a steroid dose pack. This seemed to help my foot too temporarily. Neck pain improved but not gone. It was excruciating pain up the back of my scalp at times. I can turn my head some now but it&#39;s not back normal. Can&#39;t turn it all the way.  Dr. did another injection in my foot but did not work this time. I got worse and I can no longer put any weight on that foot. I have not been able to work since January 20. Have had to apply for leave of absence and short-term disability

                                                On Tuesday went to work and at around 1:30 she told her boss that she was not feeling good.  Felt achy in her body, her arm was hurting and was not feeling like herself.  She went home, sat on the sofa and drank something and went to sleep and felt drained, and slept for 4 hours.  She then woke up with runny nose, low grade temp, and felt really weak.  The next day, 1/6/21 her body ached bad.  She slept a lot that day and drank a lot of water, didn&#39;t eat and just felt really sick.  Then on Saturday evening, she looked at her leg and felt cold chills and her leg was hot.  She looked at her leg and had an area that was like a red dot, and she then realized that her leg was about to be inflamed.  She went to bed, woke up and her entire leg was blotchy red, swollen and hot.  She then called her family and around 12:00 on Monday 1/11/21.  She went to the hospital, and they treated her like she had COVID, isolated her and was negative.  Sent her to vascular and did not have a blood clot in her leg, and told her she had an cellulitis flair, and she started being treated with IV antibiotics.  Was in the hospital for 5 days.  She was discharged and went home after infectious disease team told her to go home with a nurse on IV antibiotics.  She came home on 1/15/21, and was off the IV antibiotics on 1/22/21.   She has been home and unable to work.  She is going to therapy for her legs.  They changed her hypertension medications, and put back on her antibiotics last week as they told her that the swelling was not going down.  Her kidney function is low and told today, 2/9/21 that she is concerned about her kidney function.  She is to have more labs drawn on Monday, 2/15/21.

Symptoms were even worse in the morning the next day (18-20 hours after the vaccination). Headache across scalp, pain and swelling at injection site, body aches and stiffness diffusely, significant fatigue, loss of appetite. I had to take the day following the vaccine off work--I stayed in bed most of the day until about 2:30 PM. I did not take any medication/pain medicine and the headache went away around 2 PM (26 hours after the vaccination). Other symptoms improved gradually at that time, too. By 3:00 PM (27 hours after the shot), I felt well enough to file this VAERS report.

                                                Day 1 pain in left arm vaccine site, fatigue. Day 4 pain in left arm grew to more intense pain and spread up left shoulder to neck and left side of face and around eye area. Same exact feeling as Bell&#39;s Palsy.  Day 5 - I took Valtrex I already had 1 gm Day 6-13 doctor prescribed Prednisone 60 mg &#43; Valtrez 1 gm for first day (adjusted to 50 mg Prednisone days 7-12 due to Prednisone side effects, then 20 mg on day 13).   After day 7 facial palsy began to decrease in eye area. Overall Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms after full course of treatment have finally subsided after day  20, for now.  Hoping they will not return.  Very scary and intense experience.  Exercise and PT helpful.

All this for 6 days.  7th day was much better.  8th day same but mild.  9th day woke up with a horrible headache and diarrhea.  Dizziness and breathing wasn&#39;t better until 10th day.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID19 Moderna on 4/2/21 @7:40  through my employer, where I&#39;ve worked over 11 years. By that evening, I had the normal fatigue, headache, and sore arm at my injection site that evening which even became swollen, red, and rashy by that next morning with some joint pain but attributed to normal side effects and dismissed it. But I woke up early Sunday morning, 04:30, very sick, with a fever, chills, diarrhea, cramping and aching abdomen and joints and also developed a rash and hives on my arm, up my neck, into my hair and down my chest left chest with some swelling as well. I took some Benadryl, it went down some but continued but I called the Tele service line to be evaluated as my symptoms were getting worse, not better. I continued experiencing these side effects as they increased intensity, especially the watery diarrhea that occured almost immediately everytime I drank and the rash and hives and ache in joints. I lost all appetite and even got so nauseas it woke me from a 10 minute nap vomitingI had an appointment w/MD 04/06/2021where she prescribed Zofran and told me to take Imodium, which I did not think I could since I was told nothing but Tylenol after the vaccine.She told me to follow -up with my primary or ER if I wasn&#39;t better by Thursday, today, but didn&#39;t think my diarrhea and stomach had anything to do with my vaccine.My fever, chills, rash, hives and itchiness came back and continued throughout yesterday as soon as I tried to stop taking Benadryl and Tylenol for a day as my stomach was so upset, cramping and sore. I went online to request an appointment with my PMD for follow-up and further evaluation as I am still nauseous too, and as I discovered after trying to eat toast and rice again, my taste is off.I received no response to my requests online so I called my doctors office today and they made a special appointment by telephone @08:30pm with Dr. so I do not have to come into the Clinic and get others sick.I&#39;ve had to submit a LOA claim as well from missing now what will be 5 days of work. I hoping to be better soon.

This happened right away, and within a few hours increased in size and then remained very swollen for several days. Pain was tolerable. Sinuses are aggravated which is a usual immune response for my body.  By 2nd day, experience sleep disruption in morning (jerking awake every hour) and then slept most of the afternoon. I also started getting a pain under my armpit, like a swollen lymph node that hurt., I put up with it for two days and then took an NSAID and the pain was faint by the next day until it faded out two days later. No other side effects were experienced.

These all started to improve Sunday evening, 4/18,, and I was able to eat a meal.  Around 9:00 pm on 4/18, I noticed a red area around the injection site on my arm.  It felt warm to the touch.  It didn?t seem too swollen, so I went to bed.  I woke up around 2:00am on 4/19 and my upper arm had a large, hard swollen lump at injection site.  It was still red and hot.  I have been taking ibuprofen which is helping with the swelling.  I still have some swelling, a red ?sunburned? area around the injection, and warm to the touch.  I do not have pain or itching? at least at this point at 11:45pm on 4/19.   I was surprised to have a new symptom almost 2.5 days after my shot.

My speech was Ok, my BP was monitored and was  a little elevated, nurse thought I was a little anxious because of my symptoms, BP was checked again about 10 minutes later and it was normal, they listened to my lungs to-all seemed to be well, except for these changing sensations going up my face, and lip. I stayed for about 20 minutes more, and returned to my office. Throughout the day changing sensations/lip area-that evening, my family said my lower lip was  drooping slightly downward-it seemed a bit swollen as well.  I checked in with the Covid Vaccine Clinic Wed. 01/13/20 in the AM as asked, and let them know i was still having symptoms in my lips, and felt slightly swollen on the one side.   It is 1/13/2020 @ 8:45PM and my bottom lip still feels strange(fluttery/tinglingly-not quite numb in sensation/  my cheeks/chin have intermittent differences in sensation

By the next day  I had a fever, chills, then sweating (back and forth for hours), body aches, very sore arm (sore enough it kept me awake for two nights),  fatigue, and a general feeling of being &#34;sick&#34;. On Sunday,  the fever was gone, but a headache took its place. The other symptoms were still there. When I woke on Monday morning, I felt back to normal (with very mild soreness in my arm). However, on Monday I was walking uphill on the same route I&#39;d taken the previous two days and ran out of breath to the point I had to stop and focus on breathing for several minutes. That&#39;s never happened to me before and I walk that route a lot. Though I was uncomfortable, none of these symptoms was bad enough to visit a Dr. I just wanted to report these side effects so people know that you can get them after the very first shot in the series.

Developed a delayed reaction to the vaccine 12 days after receiving  it.  Developed a rash that is approxiamently 3.5 inches wide by  5 inches in length.  It is dark in color and raised as well as itchy.  I am also experiencing tingling in my tongue and lips as well as feeling that my tongue is slightly swollen as well as my throat.   The rash is warm to the touch and slightly sensitive to touch as well, and is  giving off heat.  It has gotten slightly larger in the past 2 days.  I DO NOT have a fever. Monday evening started taking Allegra.  It helps to keep the reaction I am having in my mouth and the itchiness for about 12 hours

                                                Right shoulder impingement for 4 weeks prior to immunization.  Much improved with RICE and OTC ibuprofen.  So much better that I did not think twice about receiving injection in that same arm.  I  had been pain free for over one week.  Received injection to right deltoid without a problem at time of administration.  About 36 hours later injection site was so painful that it resulted in nausea, waking during the night, unable to perform ADLs, having to seek orthopedic physicians care for evaluation and meloxicam daily.  Pain has persisted beyond 3 weeks post injection.  I received a referral for physical therapy.  I am still struggling with pain that continues to wake me during the night.  I am a 55 year old female who has delivered three children and I would describe this pain at injection site from three weeks ago as the most pain I have ver experienced in my life time.  Pain still remains at injection site and radiates to the shoulder joint and up into the neck.  Currently receiving  physical therapy treatment for the pain and discomfort.  Unsure as to whether or not I will receive the second dose.  Looking for some guidance.

                                                I got my vaccine at 3pm, I felt fine the entire afternoon, somewhere around 6 r 7 pm my arm hurt it was sore. It was not red, it was not swollen, it was just sore. I decided to take a bath, and went to bed. Felt tired and my arm was sore but it was mild, around 8 or 9 o&#39;clock.  I went to bed at 8 or 9 o&#39;clock and woke up around 2 or 3 in the morning and arm was very sore, would call it moderate. I took 500 Tylenol and 200 ibuprofen together.  Throughout the night my head hurt and i tried to go back to sleep. at 5 in the morning my head was excruciating, I would it an 8. My arm was very sore, I would give it an 8. My body hurt really bad so i give that an 8. so I&#39;m thinking ok this is what you get when you get a vaccine so I went back to bed. from 5-8 am  tossed and turned. at 8 o&#39;clock i got up and was very wobbly and weak and had chills. I checked my temp and it was 101.5. I went down stairs but had to take one stairs at a time because I was so weak, I went to kitchen because I was so thirsty. I tried to fix some ice water and lemon but it spilled. Went back upstairs because I had so many chills. I called my job at the Clinic but all they had was a voicemail. My face hurts my jaw hurts and my neck on the side where they gave me the shot, my right side. I was trying to put something in my stomach but I could only eat a few sunflower seeds. My body head and arm hurts so bad, moving is excruciating. I felt great all week and yesterday.

                                                I started with a pain in the left arm similar to the aching I felt the day after my  vaccine.  It felt worse this morning, and I looked in  the mirror since it felt so hot and it is a very large oval- red outline rash.  Not raised,  just mostly red on the border and hot and angry .  Feels more painful inside , like &#34;sharp, and achy&#34; and a worse headache than the day after the shot .   The headache is progressively getting worse.  I have taken my migraine Rx- 1- Fioricet earlier so I could work, but it did not help.  My PCP suggested putting a  topical cortisone cream on the rash, I have not gotten that yet.  Perhaps unrelated, but for the record, this past Tuesday, 1/19/21, I had such bad vertigo that I could not even telework, and that&#39;s a 1st.

                                                Immediately once the shot pulled out of her arm, she was dizzy. Walked slowly to the post vaccine area and spoke with the volunteer MD that was there.  The nursing students stayed with her and gave her apple juice. She has felt dizzy ever since.   Dizziness has eased up as far as severity goes, but she feels like it stays with her longer than it should have. Had to miss work last week a few days because of this.

Second dose-  received 01/26/2021once again headache started within 30 min after receiving the vaccine, by 10:00 that evening I was having chills which continued through the night. 6am the next morning on 01/27/2021 my body was in alot of pain, my husband states that he had a hard time trying to wake me. I was able to get up with help at 11:30 a.m. to use the restroom and straight back to bed. I did not wake up again till 10:00a.m. on the morning of 01/28/2021 I had slept for more than 36 hrs straight. I just could not wake up during this time my eyes were heavy and my body felt wiped out, very tired. I feel better today although I am extremley weak with little strength. It has been a horrible experience. I was afraid that I was not ever going to be able to wake up again.  What would cause my body to shut down like this????????  Wishing I did not get that second dose

                                                Extreme arm and shoulder pain and great difficulty moving arm and shoulder.  Onset of pain and difficulty in use was within hours of vaccine administration and worsened over the next three days.  The pain was significant enough to require use of pain relieving medications throughout the day and night.  The pain woke me up at night.  Unable to lift arm more than a few inches for several days.  Difficulty moving arm, arm felt very heavy, so much so that if I was rolling over in bed I couldn&#39;t move my arm and needed to use the hand of  my other arm to do so.  Unable to lift arm to the back of my head (for example to put an elastic in my hair) for a week.  A high degree of pain for about 5 days, reducing somewhat after that and lasted about 2 weeks.  Still, nearly 4 weeks later, my arm is sore when I move it at the very top into the shoulder.  It&#39;s difficult to hook my bra.  I am not in pain but often have little twinges of pain/discomfort in the upper arm/shoulder, particularly when I lift my arm upward from the side of my body.

I was freezing cold.  I had 4 fleece blankets on plus wool pajamas.  Four nights I had to sleep in a recliner because it felt like there was an elephant on my chest and I could not breathe.  Two mornings I was coming to work, left my driveway and threw up all over myself; had to turn around, take a shower, and come into work, only to only be able to work 2-4 hours per day for 3 weeks.  The Sat. and Sun. following the injection, I slept until Mon. morning.  I had pure exhaustion from the shot.

I drove home and felt fine until I became very tired and went to bed at 7:00 pm. I slept straight through until 7:00 am and woke with a headache, (something that I get around once every year or two). I slept most of the day, (was up around eight hours), and then slept through Saturday night and woke around 9:00 am and felt like my old self. The headache was severe enough to take ibuprofen but only took it the one time in the morning.

I started  xopenex, and atrovent neb solution and tylenol for the headache (which started around time of wheezing) By Saturday afternoon, the ribcage is very tight, hard for me to breath, can only take short breath.  I continue to take prednisone 20 mg daily per doctor.  On Monday, telemedicine visit with the pulmonologist, he increase to 60 mg, Ribcage tightness relieved about 1 hour and 45 minutes, back to tightness again.  Tuesday morning, I went to Emergency room, admitted as observation.  Discharged on Thursday.  I was given iv solumedrol while under observation in the hospital.

                                                Around 2AM I was sitting at work and I looked at my co-worker and told her my head was killing me. I took Advil,  it was like the worst &#34;flu shot&#34; I ever got. Then the muscle pain started. I went home and took some Advil, tried to walk my dogs and couldn&#39;t. I usually walk 3 miles with them and did not walk even 1/2 mile. Went home and took a hot shower with Epson salt and laid down. My arm started aching. I can&#39;t even wash my hair, the injection site itches and is painful and my scalp was itching too. Overall headache, joint/ muscle pain like flu like symptoms. Wednesday morning before I left work my back started hurting really bad, severe back pain. When I arrived home and used the bathroom I was having abd pain, and diarrhea. It was all fluid. I ate some chili the day before and when I wiped my bottom it was red like bloody. My PCP was closed. It happened about 4 times. It is like I have a kidney pain (the back pain)

As the evening progressed, I felt worse and worse, had no appetite, very slight nausea, but no vomiting. During the night, my fever went up.  I only checked it once and it was 100.1, but I was having severe chills, my knee joints were aching, as well as some of my fingers.  The next morning I had a headache, and was dizzy (which may have been from not eating the night before). The symptoms continued throughout the day, but were managed fairly well with Tylenol.  Additionally, my arm was extremely sore.  It hurt to move it in any way.  Even worse arm pain than with a Tetanus shot, which has always caused me a great deal of pain.  Thankfully the symptoms only lasted about 28 hours.

I took my temperature in the morning and it was over 101.  I took tylenol but my fever never went below 99.9 all day.  No energy, stayed in bed all day.  Elevated heart rate, chills, breathing did not feel normal.  Body aches, headache, nausea, severe pain at injection site, today 5 days later, I still have underarm pain.   I had Covid in October and was told it was ok to get the vaccine as long as it had been 90 days since I was sick.  I felt like I had Covid again after having the vaccine.

When I awoke at 5:00 AM my head felt foggy, I had chills, and headache.  I took extra strength Tylenol at 6:00 AM with relief of headache, but returned to bed from 9:00 AM to noon due to fatigue, muscle aches and chills.  I have continued to have fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and chills throughout the day (1/14/21). I also developed a fever of 100.6 at 5:00 PM.  Second dose of tylenol has reduced my temp to 99.5, but I continue to feel fatigued with headache.  The current time is 6:15 PM on 1/14.

                                                Excruciating pain in arm that received the shot, from elbow to shoulder, after 3 hrs. of getting the injection.  Extreme pain inhibited sleep, required constant maximum allowed pain reliever medication for 2 days straight (1/21/21-2/23/21); could not use that arm nor put any pressure on it for 2 days. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest degree of pain) my pain was a 9 for 2 days.

After 7 days the aching is intermittent waves of throbbing. Like a tooth ache. Had to use heat on the arm on day 6 to get comfort during the night.  Discomfort when moving of touching the arm. No local swelling or redness.

                                                That evening my heart was pounding very hard throughout my entire body that&#39;s all I could hear laying down I thought that I was going to either have a heart attack or a stroke. I got up and took one of my blood pressure medications. It&#39;s slowed down but I was unable to sleep due to feeling jittery and my heart pounding hard. The next day I felt exhausted my stomach hurt. I have had a sore throat the worst being on the Thursday following. Today Friday things seem to be subsiding.  However my concern is not to get the second dose if I had such a bad reaction the first time I definitely will have a heart attack the second time.

Uncertain if related to vaccination but concern with relation of ocular sclerosis to immune disorders feel like event should be reported.

                                                &#34;I am reporting a reaction to my second Moderna vaccine given on 02/05/2021 around 10 AM . Initial headache/nausea/tiredness started on 02/06/2021 and lasted for 3 days. Missed work on 02/08/2021 due to nausea/HA /tiredness. Slight Headache alone for another 4 days- through 02/12/2021. On Saturday (02/13/2021) I started feeling a bit ?off?. I was having trouble remembering things and just in general feeling slow and not right. My husband was concerned, and I was frustrated. He was checking me for TIA symptoms. Sunday I had a mild HA ( 3-4 pain scale) but it did not bother me too much. Monday 02/15/2021 I would not have been able to work if I was scheduled- nausea/HA (level 8) with visual migraine aura. I had to go to bed. I slept for 5 hours. Again today 02/16/2021. I am leaving work early because I have nausea/HA (level 8) with pressure and having trouble focusing. Feels a lot like the migraines I had 20 plus years ago. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.&#34;

She was feeling tired, slightly nauseous and very low energy. At about 4:50 PM that day, patient got up to walk to the pantry after eating some peanut butter toast. She suddenly stopped and shut her eyes and froze and then she began having a seizure (and she has never had a seizure before and seizures do not run in her family). After the shaking from the seizure ceased, her body tensed up and she fell flat backwards and she hit her head on the refrigerator. She then was going in and out of consciousness, she had a big laceration on her forehead and was bleeding rapidly. I, her daughter, witnessed this and then at 4:54 PM I called emergency services and paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Later that evening, the family was notified that the patient had bleeding in her brain, a concussion, a forehead laceration that received 15 stitches and a broken neck (C2 fracture). She was taken to the hospital that evening on February 8, 2021. Patuent experienced a second seizure while at the hospital during a CT scan. Patient later was able to come home February 11, 2021 in the afternoon. Patient now has to wear a neck brace for up to 12 weeks, cannot drive, cannot work for up to 12 weeks, and is still recovering cognitively from the concussion.

I told the nurses I didn&#39;t feel right, and I sat down for about 10 minutes and drank 3 glasses of water.  Initially I felt better, but then I felt weak and &#34;not right&#34;,  so I lay down on a cot for approximately 40 minutes.  My B/P was elevated (165/95), which is very high for me.  I did not have any trouble breathing.  I continued to drink water, and eventually my B/P lowered, and I felt better.  I took an antihistamine (10 mg Zyrtec) when I arrived home at 11:00 AM, and felt very tired until about 3:30 PM,  when I felt just about back to normal.  I was assessed by an ER physician at the clinic site.

I had fever, headache, chills, muscle and joint pain, extreme fatigue and slept for hours all day Saturday, Sunday into Monday, which I called off work. I felt as if I had the virus all over again , except this time it felt much worse. I am worried to get the second vaccine as it states it is worse than the first. Would like and appreciate any feedback on this.

                                                First shot of Moderna vaccine.  Had the shot and waited around 35 minutes and I felt fine.  I left and was a few minutes down the street and my lips started going numb. I turned around and went back to the hospital where the shot was administered and they had me see the emergency room doctor.  My throat did not start closing, my lips just were numb.  I have had serious reactions before and they start with the lips usually so I was concerned.  My blood pressure was high as well as my pulse.  The doctor gave me prednisone and benadryl and I was feeling good after 15 minutes.  I was in the ER 45 minutes to an hour and then was released with a script to take prednisone and benadryl for the next 4 days.and to come back if I got worse.  I never got a rash or anything else, just the numb lips and increase in blood pressure.  I did have a bit of a headache as well.  I am at work now (the next day) and feeling fine.  I did speak to my doctor and she did advise me not to get the second shot in the vaccine series. .

                                                I had underlying body inflammation prior to getting vaccine, but otherwise no illnesses or issues.  Two days after vaccine I came down with a UTI.  Another 3 days after that my body went into an acute inflammatory response.  I had extremely pronounced pinkeye (first time ever) followed by acute gout flare-up (first time ever) followed by extreme edema in lower extremities (first time ever).  I&#39;m being treated with steroids, but these issues have yet to resolve.  I have not been able to work since Jan 4.  I can only stand for a few minutes and walk a short distance with the aid of crutches.  In all of my life, I have never had pinkeye or gout or edema, or a UTI for that matter.  I am a healthcare worker and I&#39;m needed back at my job asap.

Increased pain through the night and in morning of 1/6/21 only able to raise arm to 30 degrees with significant pain and had to help with my right arm to raise the left and to dress myself. The pain woke me up at night. I could not go to work for 3 days because of limited active movement to 45 degrees and significant pain and weakness. I am  taking 600-800mg Advil every 6 hours, icing and performing range of motion and massage and kinesiotaping my shoulder. 1/11/21 to present, pain has decreased but soreness still present with internal rotation of my arm and muscle weakness in shoulder muscles and occasionally discomfort with arm positioning at night wakes me up still.

                                                Beginning at midnight the night of my vaccine I began to shiver uncontrollably. I took 2  Tylenol and was able to sleep for a few hours. I awoke around 6 am with severe body aches, shivering, severe fatigue, upset stomach and extremely disoriented. This lasted for the next 30 hours. I continued to take Tylenol as needed for headaches and body aches. Eventually, the body aches subsided, but the head aches and sense of confusion and disorientation lasted for 2 more days. It has been 4 days since the vaccine and I still am experiencing what I would call a brain fog. It?s very scary and concerning to me.

                                                First dose - no side affects at all could not even tell I had a vaccine.  2nd dose - by mid-afternoon my arm was getting sore, headache and scratchy throat.  Arm progressively got worse. Took Tylenol and headache improved.  Went to bed abut 10:30 pm was doing ok except for arm pain.  Woke up at 2:40 AM with the chills (shaking really bad and very cold) got another comforter and went back to sleep woke up about 4:15 am  a little better but just kind of sore all over.  Laid in bed but couldn&#39;t sleep, got up and tried to log on about 8:45am for work.  Felt completely drained and couldn&#39;t concentrate, took PTO.  Took more tylenol and went back to bed, fell asleep about 11:00 am and slept until 2:00 PM.  Felt much better when I got up just still kind of drained.  By 8:00 PM that night (wednesday the 27th) my arm didn&#39;t hurt any more and I was basically back to normally.  Have had a mild sore throat off and on since then but really nothing more than an irritation.

                                                Patient felt unwell and had a fever on Wednesday (1/27) and went home early from work. On Thursday morning (1/28), she threw up once and then laid down to rest. Her son reported seeing her that morning with the episode of emesis prior to her getting on the couch. Son reports that when he came home at 5pm, she was asleep on the couch. Teenage daughter reports patient had been asleep on couch all day. Son tried to wake patient up and she was disoriented and lethargic.  Daughter (reporter) was contacted to come see patient and on arrival to house (5;45pm), noted patient was confused, lethargic, febrile (104), and hypoxic at 83% on room air with portable pulse oximeter. Patient was able to stand and ambulate to car with assistance and was driven to Emergency Department for evaluation.   At emergency department, patient was hypotensive 80/40s but was able to increase blood pressure with 3 L of normal saline to blood pressure of 90/50s. See all tests performed and results below.  Patient received antibiotics, anti-virals and tylenol for fever of 102.7 while in emergency department. She was admitted to ICU that evening at approximately 11pm and had a foley catheter placed overnight due to decreased urine output. patient continued to have low blood pressure through morning of 1/28 and was placed on levophed for blood pressure control at approx 10 am. Her blood pressures continued to improve through afternoon and levophed was titrated down and then discontinued around 4pm.  She continued to received antibiotics for 24 hours after initiation and continued acyclovir during course of hospitalization and is still receiving doses on 2/2. Patient&#39;s initial mental status was confused, lethargic, and unable to communicate. She was intermittently oriented to herself only and would not follow commands. She would localize painful stimuli. Her mental status began to improve on Saturday when she started to become more awake but was still unable to follow commands or communicate clearly. She was moved from ICU to IMCU (step down unit) on Saturday once mental status was improving and blood pressure was stabilized. Her mental status continued to improve from Saturday 1/ 30 to Tuesday 2/2 (current). She began to have diarrhea on Saturday afternoon that continued through Monday and occurred every 1-2 hours. She was unable to stand or move body on her own and had to be assisted by staff to be cleaned. She remained awake and alert and was able to get up and walk on Monday and began to eat. She continued acyclovir treatment pending HSV meningitis panel PCR results (still pending currently 2/2). Mental status not currently at baseline but continuing to improve. She is also still experiencing generalized weakness. Hospitalist team and infectious disease doctors report she should be discharged tomorrow (2/3).  No source for confusion and hypotension has been found at this time. Physician team think HSV is unlikely but awaiting final diagnosis until test is resulted.

                                                I awoke at 2 am and got up to go to the bathroom.  I was extremely, severely weak, rapid heart beat, could hardly stand- had to support myself by leaning over sink and hanging onto walls to get back to bed.   I felt some dizziness and had slight nauseau but did not vomit.  I could not stand.  I had to get back to lay down.  Felt like my pulse and blood pressure was all over the place.  I normally have low blood pressure.  I thought I was going to pass out.  I was very shaky and felt terrible.    Felt completely debilitated.  When I laid back down and rest, things calmed back down.  I did take more ibuprofen. Arm is sore but expected that.   When I got up this morning i was still very weak feeling but somewhat better.   I have just been taking it easy.  Have little dizziness, but not debilitating like it was in the middle of the night.  did take some tylenol this morning for arm soreness.

                                                Injection site became very painful (more than just sore) at about 10pm and is still painful today (2/16/21), that it hurts to elevate my left arm. At approx. 3am on 2/16/21 - 12 hrs after shot, I was sleeping and awoke to chills, the coldest I&#39;ve been, and extremely thirsty.  I got up to put more clothes on and some sips of water and returned to bed.  The chills lasted for approx. 5 hours, and subsided.  I awoke at 11am, feeling dehydrated, weak, and like my body had been through the washing machine! It is now noon on 2/16/21 as I type this report, and I will be returning to bed for the day. I hope my immune system settles down so I can work tomorrow.

Today Feb 25th feel fine, little tired, sore arm.

I had dizziness that caused me to feel light headed and have a &#34;weird&#34; feeling with my vision.  It caused me to sit down and wait about 5 minutes for it to pass.  I have a service dog that is sensitive to medical conditions and he came and sat very close to me for 30 minutes (unusual in my home) while this occurred.   Then it passed.

Body aches all over (most likely the shot caused a flare to my ostearthritis). Stomach ache, vomiting, chills,  runny nose and fever. Symptoms similar to the flu. Started Wednesday evening after shot received and got worse over the next few days.  Went to bed early during the week after work. Was totally exhausted. Was in bed all day Saturday, Sunday and had to take off work on Monday. Seem to be feeling a little better this evening. Fever broke; sweated on and off all day.

I do not know if I was delirious but when I got up for the extra blankets, I could hardly walk. I then got the electronic thermometer, and it read that my body temp was 80  and my surface temp was 101.1.  I took a horse size Tylenol.  Did not sleep much, when I woke up I had this horrible headache and a fever of 100.  Sleep all day on Sunday, Feb28.  Still feverish and very fatigued.   Monday March 1, still, achy and foggy feeling and took a nap mid day.

                                                One week later (on a Wednesday morning after receiving the vaccine the previous Wednesday afternoon) I had the onset of a headache, body aches, chills and extreme fatigue making it impossible to work. Slept most of the day.  Next couple days with less severe symptoms and mostly resolved this morning (Saturday) aside from some fatigue.  ALSO the site of the injection became red, tender, warm, swollen and slightly itchy with the onset of these symptoms after a milder injection reaction had resolved for several days.  This  makes me question if this is a late reaction to the vaccine and hence reportable as I have not read about this possibility

On the next day more dizziness and elevated blood pressure I was unable to finish my shift. Called employee health they documented I told them how high my blood pressure was their advice was see my PCP or go to the nearest emergency room. I called my PCP she had me to increase my amlodipine to 10 mg and fluids followed by rest and to monitor my blood pressure.

I called out sick and had to use a vacation day because still had headache, fogginess, and temp of 98.8.  At 3pm I started to have a lower back ache that went in to my mid back.  I was tired.  Then on Tuesday, 01/12/2021 I started with diarrhea at 11AM.  I called work and explained that it was a side effect of the Covid vaccine.  They still would not let me go to work even though I was covid negative.  I took 2 Imodium tablets. I will email you tomorrow, 1/13/2021 and continue to monitor.  Yes I am a RN.

                                                On 12/31 finished having dinner. Thought sudden slight shortness of breath may be do to appetizer type foods we had. Drank water to help subside it with little effect. Went outside into cold air. Still had some slight shortness of breath. At 8PM continued to my other daughters home( where I&#39;ve been going since pandemic) upon sitting there still felt slight shortness of breath but again manageable. We left at 11:30 as my breathing never really got better or worse. When I arrived home I Took my PROAIR-HFA inhaler that I use PRN. My symptoms resolved and went to bed. On Friday 1/1 I had again slight shortness of breath with no real excertion.  On 1/2 I went to work at Hospital in neurology dept. I was pushing collector up to SICU unit and then to M2 unit. On arrival to M2 I felt very winded and took my inhaler with results.  I then called my manager to make him aware that I was having dilemma do to fact that I didn&#39;t want to call Covid hot line as I felt symptoms were from vaccine not Covid!  I was put out of work by Covid hot line had test on 1/4 and negative results on 1/6. My symptoms seemed to subside on 1/6. I returned to work on 1/9 and am pushing collectors and patients with no symptoms

                                                Unable to make out the Lot number due to illegible.  The pain in my right arm and around the back of my head and neck increased all day on Saturday, latter that night the pain woke me out of my sleep, and as I attempted to go to the restroom, I passed out.  I woke up on the floor where I had passed out face down, with a busted bloody lip and bruises and broken skin on both knees.  Very frightening, Thank God that I woke up because I live alone.   Thank you.

Felt like a ragdoll. Kept staring into space slow to answer the questions. Her phone rang and she started petting the phone. Couldn&#39;t remember the passcode to get in the phone. Wanted to drive home but the ER would not allow it. Had a red patch on the arm and it was hard. Muscles on both arms hurt all the way down to the forearm.

                                                1st dose December 23, 2020.  Arm pain, swelling, raised red 3 inch bump developed within 12 hours.  Subsided, and reoccurred about 10 days post vaccine.  10-14 days post vaccine I developed New onset forefoot weakness (foot drop) Right, new onset trigger finger Right middle finger, new onset bladder spasms with immediacy and incontinence - not bladder volume dependent, resurgence of body aches, new bilateral knee pain requiring two arm support for sit to stand,  Mental status changes including anxiety, paranoia, mania and depression (personality change!), motion induced nausea and dizziness, visual changes (blurry vision), New intensification of nocturnal muscles spasms - bilateral and progressive and intermittent headache up the Right neck to crown, New onset (01/14/21 - present) burning rubber scent when some food being cooked.  The muscle and joint pain were present with February illness, subsided by April, and came back with a vengeance within two weeks of the 1st injection.  I also lost three teeth (fracture vertically while flossing), thinned hair, and had intermittent dizziness during the initial illness in February.   February Initial loss of taste/smell included metallic taste with artificial flavors, rotten garbage - random, and ?iron taste with meats.  I can now taste some fruits but only get bitterness with other fruits and vegetables.  I had one sided facial paralysis after tooth extractions in September - resolved in 1 week.  I required dental implants to replace the fractured teeth.  I am a vaccinator, and have been administering our vaccines and swabbing for Covid testing since we reopened elective procedures.  I strongly encourage our staff to get the vaccines - and I am the one who gets the reaction.  The constellation of symptoms, temporal proximity to the vaccine with no intervening illness or injury, and commonality of some symptoms with my February illness have prompted further testing and evaluation for central nervous system insult.

                                                felt a soreness in my left breast arm pit 1/26/2021 and woke up 1/27/2021 with a soreness and itching sensation in left arm at location of vaccine. Upon inspection I had 2 red nickel sized  areas on my left arm at vaccine site. There was a lump under the skin that was sore.  The redness and lump spread through the day. The lump is shaped approx like an egg after 12 hours (not the thicknesss of an egg). I feel a strange sensation like I do with allergies and had  a slight headache off and on though the day.

I took Ibuprofen and drank lots of water and returned to bed.  I was drenched with sweat when I awoke for the day.  I felt fair the 28th when I went to work and by that afternoon, my temperature raised a degree up to 100.3 with feelings of general malaise.  I continued to take Ibuprofen.  I took Ibuprofen during the night on the 29th and again had broke a fever; the neck of my pajamas were soaked.  My left deltoid is still very painful as of the 29th as I type this.  Swollen, hard with red area in the center.

Later in the day, late evening I could barely lift the arm that had received the injection; I also developed severe headache, fever (T max 101.9), sever body aches and chills/sweats.  I was nearly unable to get out of bed the following day, called out from work due to symptoms.  Nearly 48 hours later, still not feeling well, went to work but left early due to symptoms.  By Friday, 2/5 I was much improved.

I could not think clearly and made simple but yet important mistakes. I also felt moderately dizzy, especially standing up. No appetite. These symptoms lasted until Wednesday, Jan 6th, at 1730. At 1730 I suddenly felt clear headed and coherent. Duration of symptoms was 49 hrs. The sudden clarity and no longer dizzy was interesting and unexpected and noticeable.  The symptoms were fast onset and sudden termination.  Only a mild headache for an additional 24hrs.

As I previously had a reaction to the first H1N1 vaccine years ago, I notified the person administering the vaccine before hand and also the nurse after the vaccine who was making her rounds.  I called her over to left her know I felt a little off/different, and described what I was feeling.  She escorted me to a private area where I was further assessed and given Benadryl 25mg po x 2.  The feeling never left my tongue and reportedly there was notation of questionable welts on the left side of my tongue. .I was able to speak clearly and swallow.  I was monitored and then discharged in the company of two of my colleagues (one an ICU nurse who works with me, and the other an ICU MD/anesthesiologist) who happened to be getting their vaccinations at the same time.  The tongue feeling did not leave me until late the next day and my lips felt a little off that night of the vaccine and the next day.  I continued to take the Tylenol and allegra as well as Benadryl.  By Friday night(1/8) I was feeling better, enough to work the weekend. Tylenol helped greatly for pain at injection site.  Today (1/12) I&#39;m feeling not my best and  tired like yesterday but I had a busy weekend at work (RN in the COVID ICU), some malaise and achy (maybe my fibromyalgia or the weather), minor headache and fatigued, had a minor sore throat this am that has resolved, and Tylenol has resolved the headache.  Not sure if this needed to be included but I thought I&#39;d mention it.

                                                Monday evening - Extreme pain in the arm where the injection was given. Swollen (like a baseball) and very red. I realize it would be sore; however, the pain radiated down the arm to the hand and upwards into my neck. A fever of 100 so I took tylenol.  Headache throughout the night and by morning my whole body hurt to the point I could not get out of bed.  Tuesday - I got up to go to the bathroom with help and lost consciousness. When checked at that time, I had a fever of 102, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms took place all day. I continued taking Tylenol for the pain. Not much sleep due to pain.  Wednesday - Some of the pain in the arm subsided; however, the spine pain was extreme. I struggled walking the pain severe. Throughout the day I was feeling a little better. Thursday - still body pain but tolerable.

I took Tylenol and 2 sudafed thinking it may be allergies. The pain subsided enough for me to go back to sleep. The headache as been on and off since, but not as bad as Thursday night.

After 20 min or longer the symptoms begin to dissipate. 1st event 1/8/21 in the evening. The following week another episode while driving home from work. During work 1/21/21 another episode took place and EKG done with negative result. That same evening during sleep another episode woke me up, although it was not as bad as the other ones and 20 minutes later i was able to go back to sleep.  As of today 1/25/20 no other episodes. I do take Famotidine daily and have been for several years due to acid reflux and heartburn, but never have I experienced chest pain.

It seems that I had a ?flare? or worsening in condition following the injection.  Arm hurt where vaccine given is also but that happens with most all vaccines.  That was not the reason I am writing this up.  Writing it up to the the inflamed state I was in.

                                                After receiving the injection I experienced slight soreness at the injection site, which was expected.  later that evening I experienced swelling in the left axilla lymph nodes. The swelling in that area was extreme on 01/20/2021 throughout the night and has continued until day of reporting on 01/27/2021. The pain and swelling involved the entire underarm and pain could be felt deep in the tissue. On pain scale of 1-10 with 10 as extreme, I would rate pain as a 9 on days 1-5. Pain has gradually diminished in severity on subsequent days and is a 2 today. Measures to reduce the pain included elevation of arm and shoulder during the night, discontinuation of deodorant during period of discomfort and application of warm and cold compresses to decrease pain and swelling.  Initially contemplated seeking emergency room evaluation and treatment for evaluation , but decided against because there is no way to remove the vaccine and treatment would probably include measures already implemented.

I tried to meditate for my 15 minutes. When I got up I felt very stressed, nauseous, foggy. I waited another 10 minutes in the hall. I felt more nauseated and went back to holding area. The nurse had me lay down. My blood pressure was around 145/100 and is usually around 100/68. My pulse was between 44-60 which is typical form me. I felt very very cold and was shivering. My hands and feet were like ice. I typically have good circulation. I rested another 30 minutes or so and went home. It took hours to warm up. The next few days were more of what I had expected: flu like symptoms, chills, tiredness, malaise, fatigue, sore arm.

Later iin evening, I felt something a lot like a hot flash, I felt my face flusing, followed by hives on my chest and abdoman.  The left deltoid muscle started to itch incessantly, and the deltoid muscle began to swell.  A hard nodule at the injection site formed, initially the size of an m&amp;m.   It grew to the size of a golf ball, then to the size of a tennis ball over the next two days.  It resolved on it&#39;s own over the next week.

My heart rate was high (over 100) for 3 hours and then higher than normal into the next day.

I THOUGHT I was having a blood sugar issue, but that was not the case.  I went to sleep for about two hours, then woke up about 9pm feeling a little better.  I had NO pain in my arm or anywhere else and slept the entire night.    Friday (1/22), I developed pain and swelling in my breast, armpit, and injection site.  I literally  felt crappy all weekend.  Weird...????  I was confused this happened about ONE WEEK AFTER the vaccine. The injection site was the size of a golf ball, hard, and  quite warm.  I began to feel better after about 3 days, but the arm was still slightly red, sore, and there&#39;s a slight bump.

Pain was deep in bones(all bones)@ intensity 7-10 for 4 days. Unable to sit or stand d/t pain. For 1st 2 days bone pain accompanied by shooting pulsations. Day 5 is today and most bone aches improved except for sacral bones and iliac crests. This pain is still 4-5 and increase to 7 with wrong movement or sitting. I am a nurse so if this sounds too medical that is why. Have a call to my FNP for possible appointment waiting to hear back.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot, I did get a fine rash and began to itch, but this time was not as bad because I had taken the 50 mg of Benadryl two hours prior to taking the shot, after the shot I began tylenol,  because I was already aching and my arm hurt and was swollen and this time had a big red rash and knot., took Zofran because I was already getting nauseous.  Went home, laid down,  late afternoon, checked blood pressure, 2-21-21 110-74 heart rate 90, I was beginning to feel bad, was very tired, so went to bed woke up around 2:00 a.m. with severe headache, hurting head to toe, rash, head to toe, very nauseous, took tylenol, was unable to get Zofran, so woke my husband up he got the Zofran and also got the Blood pressure machine to check my blood pressure, it was (2 a.m.) 128-103 heart rate 75.  I was unable to go anywhere, was freezing to death, so wrapped up and finally fell back to sleep, woke up the next morning blood pressure was 2-22-21 108-78 hr 64, that night 119-72 hr 86, 2-23-21 108-78 hr 69, that night 135-85 hr 75, 2-24-21 120-73 hr 64 that night 133-80-78, 2-25-21 117-73 hr 72,/  blood pressure and heart rate have settled down, and the rash is gone, I still feel tired and arm is just a little sore, no longer having the shooting pains down my arm and out my fingers.  Have stopped tylenol and zofran, none yesterday nor today.  Feel pretty good today and the cold like symptoms are better.

                                                I received my vaccination on Friday, February 19th.  On Sunday, February 21st, my tongue felt like I had scalded it with a hot drink, and my taste buds were very sensitive.  My tongue also felt thick and there were bumps on the sides of it.  On Tuesday, February 23rd, I noticed I couldn&#39;t whistle, and I couldn&#39;t spit correctly when I brushed my teeth.  On Wednesday, February 24th, I noticed my right eyebrow was lower than my left, and my mouth was drooping on the right side.  I couldn&#39;t put my lips together to put my chapstick on,  and my smile was very crooked.  Additionally I felt my eyelid twitching and the right side of my face felt very strange in general.  So I contacted the nurse who administered the vaccine.  She said that Bell&#39;s Palsey could be symptom from the vaccine, and that I should contact my physician.  So I called Dr. office and they did a virtual appointment with me on Wednesday afternoon.  He immediately told me I have Bell&#39;s Palsey as a result of the vaccine and sent in some prescriptions for me to take.  They are Toradol Oral, Prednisone, and Erythromycin Ointment for my eye because it won&#39;t close all the way, and it doesn&#39;t blink properly.

                                                Injection was initially very painful during dose, seemed a bit lower in arm than last. The injection was given through a band aid (circular) when I later removed band aid fluid was under the band aid (clear). The next day the circumference of my arm was slightly edematous and warm. It hurt but I thought it was just the normal arm pain. It did not go away I kept googling it to see what was going on because it was affecting my sleep and I could not move it above my chest. It is going on a 2.5 weeks and still is causing pain. I saw on the news SIRVA could occur and this seems to be the symptoms I am having. I have not been to a Dr. yet as the report said it may take 2 months to resolve. I did feel like I should report this however.

She ended up with a headache.   She has had several injuries and these areas were accentuated x3 since the vaccine.  She has a history of shingles and it felt like shingles pain.   Due to the pain she did not sleep Saturday or Sunday 2/7 and 2/8 and was in the bed for most of these days.   She has stomach problems, and this was not good either.  She still can feel in the right arm where she received the vaccine and  not unless she presses on it.  Everything quieted down on 2/8/21, and back to her usual self.  She did not take anything for relieve of the pain.   She also had fever of 99.6 with this.

                                                48 hours after receiving dose 2 of the Moderna vaccine, patient developed alterations in mental status - cannot recall the events. She was taken to the ED and was found to have a BP of  &gt;200/130. Patient had a seizure in the ED - was intubated to protect airway. CT showed some decreased areas of attenuation in the bilateral occipital lobes and cerebellum. MRI showed vasogenic and cytotoxic edema in posterior temporal, parietal and BL occipital and BL cerebellar hemisphere which can be seen with PRES. Patient required inpatient treatment for her elevated BP and neurological evaluation. Was started on Norvasc and Keppra due to concern for PRES.  Discharged with follow up in cancer center and with neurology. Hospitalist and neuro teams thought PRES was likely due to her  chemo regimen, patient&#39;s oncology team though PRES may have been triggered by vaccine due to timing and her dose of Avastin.   Pt has extensive oncological history including ovarian cancer w/ metastatic breast cancer in L axilla. Pt recently started on cytoxan, Avastin, pembrolizumab. Also has malignant abdominal ascites.
