I am on day 2 of having to take breathing treatments.  Had fever as high as 102  degrees.  I have been sweating profusely for 3 days.  I had one night of hallucinating dreams and hardly slept at all.  I had all of the general side effects, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills.  I had a rapid heartbeat.

                                                I received the vaccine 30 min. prior to starting my shift as a Nurse in the ED. About 1 hour after receiving the shot while standing I felt off balance and began to have a vertigo like dizziness. I sat down and tried to drink some water but began spitting the water back up and dry heaving after trying to drink. I did not feel nauseous if I was not drinking. I did feel the sensation of a slight lump in my throat. I did not have any shortness of breath, tachycardia,  rash or fever. I did not want to check in as a patient so I called my wife to come and pick me up from work. Before I left I had the pharmacy send me some Pepcid and Benadryl and I took 25mg of Benadryl and 20mg of Pepcid before leaving. I left work around 1400 and now at 1500 I am able to drink fluids. The slight lump in my throat seems to have improved. I still feel a little dizzy and off balance.

There is a charlie horse like feeling in my left cheek, which is now also present in my left jaw. The left side of my tongue is numb with slight pain, and my bottom lip is numb on the left side, and the feeling stops at the middle like there were a line drawn down my face.  My upper left cheek and the side of my left eye have a constant,  moderate burning feeling.  The shot was in my left arm.  The Dr. at urgent care said it was not a stroke, so that&#39;s good.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  It has now been over 13 hours.

Then around 8am I started to have chills which then I checked my temp and it was 101.0 degrees F. Then I started to get a headache and severe body aches. Around 3pm I tried to eat something which I then threw it up. I tried to drink water and flavored water which I also threw up the water. I also went into the bathtub 7 times that day to stop the chills. Which it did but right when I got out they started again which then I felt worse. Around 11pm 1/23/2021 I ended up going into the ER which then they gave me IV fluids and then Benadryl and Toradol by IV. After those were administered I started feeling better which then I was discharged and went home.

By 6:00 AM the chills were intense, weakness, having less coordination and depth perception issue.  Closer to 9:00-10:00 AM felt like he had the flu 10 times worse than he should have.  Had COVID in April/May but these symptoms worse.  Got home at 11:15 AM was so cold, hands were ice cold, and took 2 hours of sleeping and all layers of clothing to feel warm.  Took a few layers off and still shaking, feverish and feeling of worse flu to man. Pain all over the body, temperature at 3:30 is 99.5-100.4, above 98 is fever is fever for him, normal is 96-97.  Sharp shooting muscle pains in extremities, top part of the hands, muscles, tendons, and also his legs and feet, but not fingers or toes.  Pain is quite intense.  All he wants to do is lay down in sleep.   Thought he was going to freeze to death.  Hands were so cold his kids were concerned.  Ice packs on chest, and gloves and 10 layers on hands and arms.  Had tremendous trouble breathing while having the intense chills.    He is a responder for law enforcement.   Symptoms have improved some, but still feeling feverish with shooting pains, depth perception issues, as well as pain.  Headache in back of head, pressure type.  Called off for work for today and tomorrow.

On 2/8, slight GI issues, no body aches, and slight headache persist.

                                                Patient felt to be in distress at the close of his observation time. He was complaining of trouble with focusing his eyes, left sided chest pain, and was diaphoretic.  Pt appeared to be in moderate distress and very anxious. I examined the pt through the car window and listened to his heart and lungs. Pt was not in respiratory distress and heart rate and rhythm were regular. Reassurance was provided to the pt, but he was also told that to be safe I recommended that he be evaluated in the emergency department and that he be transported via ambulance. Pt expressed understanding and agreed to going to the ED but was refusing transport via EMS. Pt was the passenger in the vehicle and he said that the driver could just take him. I expressed that transport via EMS would be the safest but we could not make him go via EMS and that if they wanted to leave via private vehicle then they could but i still recommended that he be evaluated in the ED. He expressed understanding and that he would go directly to the ED via personal car.

Pt agreed to this. Transport to ED via EMS was offered and pt declined as he had a driver. Informed pt that I could not make him go via EMS but I did recommend it. Pt expressed understanding but thought that he would be fine with it being as close as it is and him being the passenger, so he again declined transport via EMS. They were instructed to proceed directly to the ED for further Eval.

                                                It has been 6 weeks since my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. For the first 3-4 days I had the usual moderate flu-like symptoms:  dizziness, headaches, fatigue, chills, soreness at vaccine siteetc.  Days 5-7 I seemed to gradually improve. On day 8 all of the symptoms returned with greater severity: this time I had a fever, the chills were much more intense, the headaches were excruciating, body and joint aches all over the place--I couldn&#39;t sleep or focus on anything cognitively taxing.  Interestingly, my brother, who was vaccinated just after me, also had more severe side effects beginning on day 8 post 2nd dose. He improved after 3-4 days, but my recovery has been much much lengthier. By day 14 I was still feeling very ill, though the fever did subside.  Sometime in the third week the pain in my arm at the vaccination site returned, then became intermittent, and still bothers me from time to time. I also started getting muscle spasms in the same exact locations that sent me to the ER after my probably bout with Covid in the spring of 2020. Thankfully these lasted only a week or so, though I began feeling muscle soreness in different parts of my body, ever changing. By the 4th week I was slightly better and down to 4 main symptoms: chills (by far the worst of the symptoms--to the point at which my skin would feel like it was being frostbitten by dry ice every time I changed sweaty clothes), occasional splitting headaches, and muscle soreness that included both the injection site on my arm and other areas.  I had other symptoms as well, fatigue and brain fog, etc, but these were present before the vaccination, though not as severe.

Second day is a little better with a little more mobility, but trying to undress and undress is torture, especially lifting my arm over my head or past my chest.

The next day I was so exhausted I couldn&#39;t work for 2 days.  I barely got out of bed until about 40 hours after the shot where I was able to get out and do some gardening.   The reason I am filling this out was at right around 72 hours after the vaccine, I was laying down watching a YouTube video feeling quite relaxed.  I then experienced a tachycardia event where my heart rate went up to 120 and stayed there for about an hour.  I remained calm and was not experiencing anxiety, but the heart rate persisted.  I have had this happen before in panic attacks, but it&#39;s quite rare and I am in acute, high level stress.    Almost 2 weeks later to the day, I had another tachycardia, stronger than any I&#39;ve had my entire life that only lasted about 7 seconds, but I would estimate my heart rate jumped to over 250.   I thought I was going to go into cardiac arrest it was so jarring.  I&#39;m not sure if that one was related to the vaccine.

On Monday, March 29 speech was slurred, numbness was worse.  Sent photos to neurologist due to concern for stroke and he said call my PCP and my PCP said to go to the ER.  Diagnosed with Bells Palsy.

                                                Patient recieved the vaccine  in the left arm and was asked to wait in the pharamcy waiting area for observation for 15 minutes (no previous hx of anaphylaxis). Upon returning to the main pharmacy floor a few minutes later one of the technicians alerted me to the patient had retrurned to the counter and was &#34;feeling something&#34;. He was visibly struggling to maintain balance and I asked patient to take a seat to prevent any risk of falls and motioned to a chair. He took a seat on the floor  next to the pharmacy counter and I rushed over to him to tend to him. I asked him if was having any other symptoms and he noted he was feeling lightheaded and having chills all over his body. His body was cold and clammy to the touch and had a difficult time locatiing a pulse on the radial artery. While talking to him his responses were shorter and he seemed like was starting to almost lose conciousness. Management had already called 911 and we offered water to the patient while we waited. Prior to the paramedics arriving I was able to get a pulse using a cuff and it was around 53bpm, the patient also seemed hypotensive.

                                                On 4/8/21 awoke to intense pain in his left foot about 12 hours after receiving his 1st dose Moderna vaccine batch #038B21A. Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

                                                Patient stated prior to vaccination that he had a fear of needles.  Once vaccinated patient seemed anxious so pharmacist continued to directly monitor the patient.  He proceeded to feel nauseous and lightheaded.  At this point, patient was laid on the floor on his side to prevent falls and 911 was called.  Patient lightheadedness continued along w/ perspiration, and cold extremities.  Cold compress was applied to patient&#39;s neck and face area.  We maintained conversation until EMS appeared in which he disclosed he had been fasting.  EMS proceeded to conduct patient well check and released patient --patient disclosed that this always happens when he receives shots or has blood drawn.

The following day this continued along with significant confusion (he did not recognize the turn onto the major street to our home where we have lived for nearly 2 years, he also forgot the a  pizza was still in existence even though there is one down the street for us that we have passed many times and discussed at length in the past 2 years).  The week after his injection he would get home from work and be falling asleep in his chair by 7:30pm with no change to his sleep schedule.  He has remained pale and still struggles with exhaustion.

I am not throwing up anymore but I am still feeling dizzy and I am having trouble functioning and walking everyday. The vertigo came and went for about four weeks. I am still experiencing these side effects. Please help.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

Then I rapidly spiked a 102.7 fever and became so physically weak I felt paralyzed. Oxygen saturation dropped into the low 90s and I began to have labored breathing. I made an attempt to stand up and urinate, then passed out and collapsed. Ems came to the house and checked me out. I declined their offer to go to the hospital because I broke the fever, was breathing better, and had no concussion signs from the fall.

                                                Received injection Tuesday at 10 am.  4 hours after injections started feeling very lethargic.  Fell asleep 5 hours after injection and slept for 3 hours mid-afternoon, which is unusual.  12 hours after injection began feeling achy and took Tylenol, then developed 101 fever around midnight (14 hours after injection.)    Stayed in bed with fever, fatigue, and aches most of the day after the injection.  Fever broke around 4 p.m., about 31 hours after injection.   Woke up Thursday feeling fine.

                                                About 1 hour after injection I started feeling mild tingling in my face and throat. I then lost my voice for approximately 5 minutes. As the next few days started to progress I started noticing mild muscle spasms all over my body, mostly in my legs; waking up in the middle of the night, dry mouth, night sweat (1 occurrence), sudden onset of rapid and irregular heart beat (1 occurrence); kidney pain (right and left), upper abdominal pain (right and left). Prior to vaccine I did not experience any of these events.

                                                Approximately 54 hours after receiving shot I noticed a couple hives on the lower portion of my body.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and went to bed around 10pm.  I woke up around 1am on 3/20 and noticed that my lips were very swollen and I had several hives on the lower half of my body.  Additionally my scrotum was enlarged.  Other than the physical symptoms I felt fine - no fever, body aches, pain, or respiratory issues.  I decided to go back to bed after taking 2 Advil.  I woke up at 7am and was still having a reaction so I decided to go to the ER.  While at the ER the gave me steroid and Benadryl which immediately started working to reduce the reaction.  They took blood work which came back &#34;essentially perfect&#34; according to the Dr.  I was discharged and prescribed an epipen, and a steroid which i took for two days.  I was instructed to follow up with my primary care physician which I did on 3/26.  The ER Dr believed that my reaction was caused by something that i had ate; however, to the best of my knowledge, I am NOT allergic to any foods.  Shortly before the reaction I had eaten a can of ravioli and some bread.  The can from a 12 pack that we bought at the grocery store approximately 6 months ago.  It as the last can in the pack and I did not have a reaction to any of the previous cans.  I met with my family Dr&#39;s PA the following week and she indicated that while there is no way to know with 100% confidence that the reaction was from the shot, she noted that it was highly unlikely that my reaction was from the ravioli can.  The PA informed me that I needed to use extra caution should I decide to get the second shot.  I am scheduled to receive the second shot on 4/14.

I believed I was dying.  Medic indicated I turned &#34;white&#34;.  The symptoms peaked within 1-2 minutes after onset and stayed bad for several minutes.  After a few  minutes  My pulse started to increase and  all symptoms started improving.  Within 10 minutes I was feeling well enough to sit, and within 30 minutes I was able to drive home.

                                                Went to ED 3/30/21  Immediately after receiving the second vaccine 2/25 he developed chest tightness and joint pain. The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

                                                I?ve been vaccinated for 2 months now. My new symptoms just started to really ramp up 3 weeks ago. Of course I had the initial symptoms of being sick for 2 and 1/2 days after my second shot?.but recently it started with leg aches and then it matriculated up into my upper body. My legs have since become less achy per say. Now it?s my upper body and mostly in my shoulders (more in the one I received the shots in), back pain, and general fatigue. Currently still dealing with the upper body ache discomfort, cold hands and feet but I noticed that I have a slight headache always and my vision has became a little blurry in one eye. The headache severity is day to day but what?s interesting now is I?m having ear ringing and sensitivity to sound. Headache seems to emulate from the back of my skull and the crown of my head. The other lingering piece is the fatigue after doing activities. I?m an active guy and recently my body gets really achy after I do anything super strenuous and I get tired. Also feeling a little shaky, some rapid heart rate, and some circulation issues in my legs and arms. Note; never experienced these issues before the Vaccine aside from the normal wear and tear of an active lifestyle.

Then I felt fine for about 12 hours after the shot (1st moderna shot on 1/21/21, 2nd moderna shot on 06/02/21). About 9:00 pm I had soreness in my arm and body aches. By 2 am on 6/3, the body aches were extreme, along with chills, and a low fever 99-100. The headache that followed lasted hours and was terrible. I had not been sick, or felt sick, in more than a year, and experienced only a sore arm with the first shot. The after affects from the second shot were terrible and I am afraid and anxious. I hope I don&#39;t die.

No treatment was needed.    On January 1st I noticed tingling  in both of my legs.   Since then it has gotten worse.  I have tingling in both legs, muscle twitching throughout both legs intermittently, muscle weakness specifically after muscle use, an abnormal skin sensitivity when wearing pants, and a consistent ache throughout my legs.  The symptoms affect me 24 hours a day and create an anxiety that I have not felt before.  It has also adversely affected my sleep.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

Had a glass of water and resolved. Evaluated by doctor and had pulse of 92 (high for patient) and elevated blood pressure 148/92. Rest of vitals normal. Felt anxious. Ate lunch, had about 6 more episodes of mouth drying out, last one about 10 hours after vaccine.  Resolved with water. Took benedryl 50mg. Next felt fatigue and right arm soreness. Felt normal within 48 hours.

His Apple Watch told him he was in afib.  So the patient was taken to the ER by his wife where this was confirmed with an EKG.  He was cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm and he was prescribed Eliquis.  Patient has no prior heart arrhythmias or medical concerns.  Patient is slightly overweight, but has not had any arrhythmia or history of a fib in the past.  Patient was discharged to follow up with his family physician.  All of his blood work was normal.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

BP first reading in left arm was 235/130 with a HR around 130. Second reading was 205/120 with HR in 120&#39;s about 4 min later.  I requested an ambulance due to the feeling of being very unwell and dizzy.  Trouble concentrating.    Ambulance ride was 190/112 ish EKG and BP monitoring at hospital.   No anaphalaxis diagnosed but unknown cause.   ER discharge after benadryl.    BP and HR would continue to cycle up and down for the next  18 hours.   Red spot formed about 2 inches away from where I was injected.      PCP and allergist thin it was an intravascular injection.

                                                I received my first Covid-19 Moderna injection and felt slightly groggy and tired as the day progressed. Just before bed I noticed my arm was quite sore and I still felt tired and slightly light headed. The next day (Feb 4) I had a very sore left arm at the injection site but felt good otherwise. I came home from work and took one 200mg Ibuprofen as my arm was still quite sore. The following day (Feb 5) my arm pain subsided but I still felt light headed during the evening. I am writing this on Feb. 18th and each day I have bouts of being light headed and have difficulty concentrating. There is no real pattern to what time of day I get the symptoms. I do not have the classic headache but definitely feel pressure in my head and behind my eyes. I also find that I wake up after a full nights sleep and feel not well rested. I spoke with my doctor last week and he suggested I give it until this week to see where things are at. I plan on contacting him soon to schedule an appointment to discuss my symptoms more. Before getting the vaccine I did not have any of these symptoms as I describe.

                                                Received the first dose of Moderna vaccine at 11 a.m. March 15. About 8 p.m. March 15 started feeling tired with chills. About midnight March 16 severe chills, restlessness, headache, muscle aches, nauseous and fever of 101.  Took two extra-strength Tylenol. 3 a.m. fever broke with sweats. Headache and body ache remained, as did chills. Took two Advil when I woke up about 7 a.m. on  March 16 for a headache. But I was too tired and achy to get out of bed. The fever came back to 102 degrees. Nauseous, couldn&#39;t eat much. Headache. At 2:30 p.m. on March 16, I felt better...  I was very tired the night of March 16 and still had a minor headache and went to bed about  8 p.m. On March 17, I was back to normal with only a very minor headache and some diahreaha that morning and afternoon.  I did not take any medicine that day. On March 18 I had no symptoms at all. I am a very healthy 42-year-old adult. I would classify my reaction as significant, but not severe. I called in sick to work (and I work from home). So it was enough to take me out of a day.

On way home my lips started to tingle a bit and I felt warmer over my body. I got home and felt exhausted for multiple days but on the first day I could not sleep. By the weekend I was just worn out and slept all day the following Sat and Sunday.  My arm hurt so bad I couldn?t lay on it and I even  today either have phantom arm pain or real arm pain. But I know where the shot was because I feel it. It still feels like a deep tissue bruise.

                                                One week after the shot, I developed a red, slightly swollen area around 2 inches in diameter at the injection site (left shoulder).  My shoulder itched greatly for about a day.  The redness went away in about a day and the itchiness subsided over the next 2-3 days. I continued to feel strange sensations in my shoulder and arm for several days.

Wife stated a HR of 115 and temp of 100.3F after taking 1g of tylenol an hour prior to call. informed her the HR is improving likely from a higher temp prior to medication. Advised this can be managed at home. Informed them of concerning symptoms associated with the tachycardia such as but not limited to SOB, CP, disorientation. both verbalized understanding.

Could not focus or concentrate at all.  Had to call for someone to drive me home as I did not want to drive. Now ( 24 hours later ) I still feel the same. Slight headache but more concerned with lack of being able to  concentrate.  Knowingly making little mistakes  when  trying to function.  Not confused but can not think clear or focus on what I&#39;m doing

When I woke up March 31 my entire right side of my face was dropping and was not responsive to facial motion. Went to the ER to get checked out. They did testing to make sure to rule out a stroke. And found it to be Bell?s Palsy. I was given a prescription of steroids ,  antibiotic, and eye ointment. I was told to go for a follow up with my Family doctor. I have that scheduled for April 5th at 3:15pm with Dr.. I have had to miss two days of work so far due to this adverse side effect.

                                                Nine hours after shot was given (9pm), I began to feel general malaise and a fever beginning. By the time I went to sleep, around 2 hours later (11pm), I had chills and a fever of 103°F. Taking ibuprofen 600mg and some interrupted sleep has helped, but as of 6:30am the next day (today) I am still feeling all these symptoms, but to a lesser degree. It is likely that these symptoms will return as strong as before later today, but time will tell.

                                                On 4/13, I had an appointment for a second dose of vaccine. At night, I felt I was dying, because I had unbelievable fever. It was so much that neither I could sleep nor my wife because she felt that there is a heat on next to her. Also, I had a very bad headache and chili. I sweat all the night so much that all my clothes, pillow, blanket, etc got wet. I was feeling so awful that my wife wanted to call 911. On 4/14, in the afternoon, again my situation got worse.I was not able  to stand even for a short time, because I got dizzy immediately and my headache got worse Since I do not have insurance, I did not know what I should do. Which medication I should take, Where I should go. The only place that came to my mind was the center where I got the vaccine at. figuring out that it is closed by checking the work hour. I contacted the emergency room, and finally the next day on 4/15, I had to go to the urgent care, which I was charged around $400 for 2 IV&#39;s and a blood test, but I still had fever and headache

Spiked heart rate on numerous occasion throughout the following 36&#43; hours with heart rates spiking as great as 136 bpm.  I should of reported it and visited my physician, but there was nothing more they could do besides for me to hydrate, suppress with Tylenol, &amp; ride it out.  Anyone with previous decent COVID cases should be advised against receiving the vaccine.  But entities are still forcing us to have it for our jobs.  I couldn?t endure a third round.  It was a violent illness following the vaccine, which was equivalent to one of my first ?bad? days of actual COVID.

                                                On 4/22/21, approximately 1 hr after the Moderna COVID-19 first vaccination injection, I started to encounter allergic reactions that I used to suffer about 20 years ago. My air intake decreased, and my skin began to become irritated. I formerly had environmental allergies that would reduce my air intake, and the first place I noticed the effects were on my skin and I would become irritable. Physicians told me that when my oxygen levels were low, the body would channel the air to where it was most needed, which is generally not the skin, so my skin would become irritated. When this used to occur, I would respond involuntarily with facial twitches and pulling at my face and hair. Physicians explained that these twitches and pulling actions would draw air to the surface of my skin where I was air depleted. When I took the Moderna injection, this happened again -- I found myself with low air, my face was twitching, and I was pulling on my face to draw air to the area. The result when I was 19 and dealing with allergies is that I would remove small patches of hair from my head or eyebrows or eyelashes, and this would happen almost unconsciously as I tried to stimulate the areas and draw air to the surface of my skin. I did the same thing on 4/22/21, and found later, when looking into a mirror, that I had removed a section of my eyebrow unconsciously. It all comes back to oxygen depletion. A different and more intense event occurred in the night of Friday, 4/23/21, and the early morning of Saturday, 4/24/21. I went to bed at about 11 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. Between that time and approximately 1:30 a.m., I had difficulty sleeping, and I dreamed of pain in my chest. I finally woke up about 1:30 a.m. and found the pain in my chest was real. I was having difficulty breathing deeply. It felt as if  the lower part of my lungs (at least on one side) was solidifying or inaccessible. What I did was begin forcing myself to breathe as deeply as possible. Over a period of 30 minutes or longer, I was able to gradually reclaim the use of the deepest part of my longs. With every forced deep breath, I was able to chip away at the area that felt like it was freezing up. Finally, I felt that I could access the deepest part of my longs and breath normally. The pain and lack of use in my lower lungs were very concerning.

Around 1am I woke  up with SOB which continued thru the night, with off and on sleep. I woke back up at 5:45am, went to work with the SOB which lasted until 12N and resolved on its own.  Around 3-330pm I began to feel feverish and had chills and was told I was disoriented.  My temp was 100.5, HR 122 R 34 BP 170/100 O2-93%. I notified the DON of my feelings who advised me those were possible side effects of the vaccine and made me continue to work until I just couldnt take the feelings anymore and went to the ER.  I was there for about 2 hrs and my body began to calm down.  I took taken 100mg of Tylenol on my own just to help with the fever which did break shortly and I have been fine every since. I was positive for COVID 12/14.

Got home from work and noticed my left side was kind of swollen. chest and back. It felt a bit like a bee sting. I slept on my left side. Woke up with numbness on my whole left side. face was numb. My wife said it was kind of like bells palsy. Face kind of twitched a bit. Hip was numb walking was slow and I was careful as I went to the grocery store . It kind of leveled out but stayed numb all of work. I was still swollen after work.   Woke up on Sunday and my arm was hurting bad. numbness had dissipated.   ate then suddenly felt flush and hot. fetal position on the bed for a half hour then I had to drag myself to work. felt bad the first few hours but as the night went on I felt better.   I could always feel it behind my eyes. early on it felt like I was discharging a bunch of stuff from them. My body was literally numb on the left half. I could feel the middle of myself from my scalp to my toes.

The following two days my arm was sore at the injection site but that went away in a couple days.  3 days post vaccination, my right axilla and median and ulnar nerves were extremely sensitive for 3 days but that subsided.  6 days post vaccine I started to get extreme fatigued, low energy and feel like my nerves were hot.  I got a covid test which was negative because I was not feeling well.  Then 9 days post vaccine I started to feel very fatigued, achey, and I couldn?t sleep well and like my nerves were burning up all over my body.  I had to call out of work due to brain fog, fatigue, nerve heat, difficulty concentrating.  I took my temperature during all this and it was 97.7.  My hands felt very hot and I could wash them under warm water because the water felt way too hot.

Brain fog became concern at 8 pm. Mild Difficulty navigating grocery store.  Extreme soreness has withstood 3 ibuprofen (x2 doses) and today took 1 hydrocodine in cabinet.  Brain fog has continued and not improved. Moderate forgetting.   Definitely not able to work today (Sunday) and doubt I will be able to work tomorrow. I am private practice dr. and will probably loose substantial income tomorrow. Completely NOT worth it and concerning with the brain fog. I strongly regret the second shot.  No symptoms after 1st shot.  The dose should be immediately reduced for 2nd shot. This strong of an immune response is not necessary.

                                                On Wednesday 1/27 the day after my second dose I felt a minor pinch/discomfort  on my lower leg.  I did not think much of that is reason I did not report it right away.  Day by day the discomfort and pain got worse.  Exactly one week after my second dose I was not able to sleep due to the pain.  On Wednesday 2/3 I decided to go urgent care.  From there I was referred for an ultra sound a few hours after.  After the ultra sound I was contacted by my doctor, letting me know that the results showed I had a blood clot on my left leg.  I was put on Eliquis medicine right away.  On 2/5 I was able to physically see my doctor who told me that this was caused by the second dose of the moderne vaccine that I took on 1/26.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

                                                Patient states he had a typical reaction the day of the vaccine (low fever, chills, aches, injection site pain) and when to bed earlier than usual because he was tired.  He didn&#39;t sleep well, and this morning his sleep app indicated his heart rate during the night was between 100-110.  After noticing his heart rate was between 130-140, he called the clinic and was told to go to the ER.  Hospital ER administered several tests and did blood work. The MD&#39;s determined his heart was fine and it is likely vaccine related.  He is home again and is feeling better (no chills, etc.) and his resting heart rate is now in the low-90&#39;s.

I also experienced acute memory loss, I can remember events at 4 PM on day of injection but nothing until the next morning, and I have inflammation and swelling at my left knee, likely pre-patellar bursitis. There is no history of either moderate side effect. There is no obvious explanation (e.g. a fall) that explains the knee bursitis.

                                                woke up at 3:25am with headache - didnt realize i was sweating profusly but was freezing, shortly and cold, had hot shower and sat infront of heater till house came up to 88 degrees then i got cold. went to bed - slept straight away foir 20 mins then woke up thinking it had been hours - lost all track of time - In the next 12 hours I was switching between hot and cold then tired and headache and went to sleep no exageration 20 seperate times) and actually slept - Drove my wife crazy because I was antsy as ever been. Unusually I dont get sick from much pretty much anything and the first shot I had no reaction whatsoever. I contacted my doctor who told me its perfectly normal - itll go in 24 hours max but the same constant hot / cold, tired / headache went on for 60 hours straight, by the end of it I didnt have a clue where I was with sleep because every time I slept it was only for 10 - 30 mins max at a time but I slept a lot. The headache felt like a hangover headache and that continued for another 3 days. My wife had no adverse reaction other than sore arm. Really would have appreciated knowing that it may have me off work for a few days - first time off work sick in 3 years lol - dont want to repeat that feeling again

                                                After 24 hours, I started having body aches, that night couldn&#39;t sleep I took Ibuprofen it helped, over the weekend I kept taking Ibuprofen. Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                I believe I had a mental episode on Tuesday.  I researched this database and saw that there were 3 cases of aggression reported, and that sort of describes my mental state.  My direct supervisor on Monday did have a discussion about a not up to par job performance as of late.  When I got into work on Tuesday, I found myself in a mental state that I have never felt before.  I was stewing in my office, practically seething over what happened.  I convinced myself that I was going to be fired.  I aggressively had a discussion with my supervisor around 8AM.  Over the next 4 hours I started having incredibly irrational thoughts and felt like the walls were caving in around me.  I aggresively and angrily discussed the situation with my HR manager, told her I had to get out and think about what I wanted to do.  I emailed my boss an agressive email and stormed out.  I was subsequently fired around 1PM on Tuesday.  Although there were some obvious other things going on, I truly believe that I was in a mental state of agression, anxiety and irrationality that I have never felt before.  I am typically a laid back person and it takes way more than what happened to make me upset.  I woke up this morning, feeling much clearer headed wondering what I did and how things happened the way they did.  I do believe there is a good chance I had some sort of mental state change due to my second vaccine dose.  I did not seek medical attention for this episode.  After my first vaccine dose I only felt tired.  After my second dose, I felt mildly fluish for about 12 hours the day after taking the shot.  Nothing else happened.

He denied difficulty breathing.  His initial vitals were 160/100, HR 100, O2 saturations 96%.  On examination, his tongue was not swollen and he had faint expiratory wheezing.  He was given 12.5mg of liquid benadryl.  He reported his symptoms slightly improved after five minutes of liquid benadryl.  His vitals were measured again about 20 minutes after his first set of vitals and his vitals were 150/100, HR 105, O2 sats 95%. He was given a second dose of 12.5mg of liquid benadryl.  After another 20 minutes, he reported that his symptoms were much improved.  On examination, his tongue was not swollen and faint expiratory wheezing was heard.  Last set of vitals were 140/95, HR 95, and O2 saturations 96%.  He calm and relaxed and was released.  He was told that he would not get his second dose with the current team due to the location being a non-clinical setting.  He was told to follow up with his PCM and/or allergist regarding if he should get a second dose in a hospital setting.

                                                Two nights in a row, 04/07 and 04/08, woke up with rapid heart rate (fluctuating from 85-110 bpm) and felt dizzy, fatigued, feverish, sweaty, shaky and about to pass out. Could have been hyperventilating in sleep because of rapid heart rate. Required about 2 hours of attention to reading, yoga and relaxation to get to sleep. On morning of 04/08, heart rate was still high (78-95) for resting, which is usually in the 50s or 60s. GI disturbance led to frequent bowel movements and the whole condition resulted in malaise and feeling of impending doom. A feedback from acute anxiety as a result of symptoms could be involved. Also involved is the diphenhydramine I took at 9 pm on 04/07 to treat hay fever and acute insomnia. Night if 04/08 was more manageable. But it interrupted sleep with strong disturbances that felt like spasms in prefrontal cortex coming out of sleep. More likely it was movement in sinus congestion that triggered a startle response while exhausted from work. It was bad timing to have the shot during a very busy work week.

                                                I was feeling fine directly after getting the injection. All of a sudden, after about 5 minutes, I felt a rush go through my body and managed to declare &#34;I&#39;m not feeling well&#34; before I lost coherence and clarity. My wife called for help from the attendants as I started to convulse, get dizzy, start sweating, and feel like I was going to pass out. I then proceeded to throw up a couple of times and had to lie back for 30 minutes before switching to the passenger side of the vehicle for the ride home. I was completely worn out and weak, with flu-like symptoms and nausea for the rest of the day and for several days afterward.

                                                On the evening of Friday 4/2/2021 around 9:30 PM, I was experiencing what felt like heartburn. It got better before I went to bed. At around 9:00 AM on Saturday 4/3/2021, I was awakened by intense pain and pressure that felt like the worst heartburn I&#39;d ever experienced. After OTC heartburn treatments didn&#39;t help, at around 11:00 AM I went to the local ER where I was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack. After being given some baby aspirin and a nitro tablet, I started feeling better and was airlifted immediately to a nearby cardiology unit at another hospital. A heart catheterization and EKGs determined that I had not had a heart attack, but instead had takotsubo cardiomyopathy. I was admitted into the cardiac ICU overnight for observation, transferred to a non-critical room the next day (4/4/2021), and released on Monday 4/5/2021.

                                                Today afternoon/evening I started to get sore and have a headache (which is normal from what I hear.) I could only sleep a couple hours Tuesday night into Wednesday morning because I kept tossing and turning. When I woke up Wednesday morning (4-21-21) around 6:00 am, I couldn&#39;t move as I normally could and when I tried to walk I found it very painful. The whole area between my knees and my shoulders were completely numb yet it felt as if it were on fire. I slept most of the morning and a little in the afternoon as it was very painful to move, talk, laugh, etc... Finally in the late afternoon (3:00-4:00ish) the numbness wore off but the burning sensation persisted. I felt progressively better throughout Thursday (4-22-21) and about the same time in the afternoon (3:00-4:00ish) the burning wore off as well. That evening I felt perfectly normal except for the typical achiness that tends to occur with  vaccines. Today (Friday 4-23-21) I feel rested and back to my normal self.

I also experienced a certain mental restlessness and adrenaline rush while feeling physically tired. It went away after 3-4 days. Following the 2nd shot, I started feeling hazy and mentally restless again with physical fatigue the day after the inoculation. A week later, I had really strong stomach cramps with numbness in the entire right shoulder where I got the 2nd inoculation. Mental restlessness and physical fatigue were also common daily,

After the second shot, things got worse, and I started realize that it was sleep apnea. I went to the doctor and I am currently being evaluated for central sleep apnea. My breathing stops, and then I wake when I need to grasp for air. I am healthy guy that works out and in good shape. This came out of nowhere and I am worried it has to do with taking the Moderna vaccine.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

I think it is getting a little better but right now I?m lying in bed in the dark with a winter coat.

He reported he went to his primary care provider later that afternoon.  He was examined clinically and was told that the shot was administered too high up in his arm in the Gleno Humeral Joint.  He was advised to take over the counter pain medication and to call if he needs something stronger.  He was given a follow up appointment on 2/5/2021 with the provider. He was told to monitor for infection in the next 48 hours and they are hoping it did not go into the joint capsule.  Continued to have severe pain.  Went to orthopedic specialist the next day.  Admitted to hospital for pain control and steroids.  MRI of shoulder inconclusive, but think severe bursitis and being treated as such.  Discharged from hospital and resting at home.  Arm range of motion at 80%-hoping to return to work in 2 weeks (firefighter/EMT).

These symptoms began 3 days after receiving the first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine of the two-part series. The pain is refractory to acetaminophen and three sessions of physical therapy. The pain and numbness make it difficult for the patient to fall asleep. The b/l leg pain was so disturbing that the patient presented to the ED where she was noted to be ?slightly ataxic? and was treated by the ER physician for lumbar radiculopathy with one Norco that did not help.

Then woke up another 4 hrs later with severe headache, chills, weakness, joint and muscle pain and high fever(104.5).

EKG NSR w/ no feeling of the startle while here and no CP or SOB. CXR normal. Full lab eval also normal including neg CRP, Trop, BNP, and D dimer. CBC and CMP also normal. TSH mildly elevated but normal T4 so likely c/w pt&#39;s prior minor thyroid abn but unlikely to be source of current symptoms. Given normal exam and w/u do not feel myocarditis, pericarditis, or clots or other significant process associated w/ current symptoms. Pt retested for COVID since not fully immune prior to symptom onset.

                                                My left deltoid muscle is still aching at 7 weeks after this first injection.  I first noticed after 5-6 days when the expected initial pain of the shot subsided. I thought it would go away soon, but only realized that it would not when my right shoulder was fine 3 days after my 2nd shot. I have received my 2nd COVID vaccine 4 weeks after on Feb 9 in the right deltoid. There is no aching or adverse effects in my right arm at the time of this report.  I have reason to believe that the first shot was given too high in the left shoulder and possible SIRVA is the result in my left deltoid shoulder joint.   I use ibuprofen 800mg 3x daily, and that doesn?t take all the aching away. It is a persistent ache that doesn?t interfere with my ability to work, yet it limits my ability to do upper body exercises.

                                                An hour or so after receiving my first Moderna shot, I was aware of an unusual feeling in my lower right abdomen.  Knowing this to be a potential problem area for Appendicitis I paid attention to it for the next day and there was no change.  Two days after receiving the  vaccine shot this sensation got worse and I was visibly bloated.  I went to an Urgent Care where a doctor referred me to the closest ER due to the area of pain and bloat in my body.   After several blood tests and an MRI at the ER, it was determined that my appendix was inflamed and I was admitted to the hospital for surgery ASAP.   Luckily the appendix was stable, never burst and was successfully removed the following day in the early afternoon.   I am currently at home recovering successfully.

                                                Experienced severe pain in the right shoulder/bicep area, the opposite arm from the injection (injection was given in the left arm). Pain became worse and worse as days went on, and eventually limited what I can use the arm for. I can not raise it up past my rib cage with severe pain. After speaking with a friend who is a doctor, they mentioned Parsonage Turner Syndrome and Brachial neuritis, all the symptoms match the discriptions of those. I immediately started using a Tens unit to help stimulate the shoulder and arm area, began ice treatment and taking tylenol for the pain. The doctor in the office I work at after listening to the issue and symptoms said the same thing and started me on Gabapentin to help with the nerve pain and is going to continue to monitor the symptoms. It has been 46 days since getting the 2nd shot, and I have been at a 8 to a 9 out of 10 pain-wise almost 24/7, it has affected my ability to work and i have had to call in a few days because of the pain and being unable to use my right arm proficiently (I am right handed), it has affected my family and my ability to get things done around the house and engage my children and it has affected my ability to get a good sleep.

Got a shot, several medications and sent home, I told the ER PA that I had my first vaccine 7 days ago but she figured my symptoms were strictly vertigo which I have never had.  After doing some research I&#39;m finding others via the internet with the same symptoms after their shots, with sustained or prolonged side effects.  Currently headaches, imbalance, trouble focusing or brain fog.

                                                Approx 15mins after having the shot administered I sat in my car and felt the medication coming on by it clouding my vision then causing me to faint (and by description from my fiancé) I had what appeared to be a mild seizure. I was out for a minute or two and when I was conscious again my vision was blurry and I felt very drunk for the next 45mins - hour. I also felt like I could taste the chemicals from the vaccine when I became conscious again.  The drunk/vertigo feeling subsided slowly over time but I was given a Benadryl from the pharmacist so I?m not sure when the dizziness stopped but I definitely could not drive home. My fainting was not due to any anxiety due to having a shot or anything, I was perfectly fine for approx 10-15 mins after the vaccine then I felt a cold feeling coming on from my right shoulder then up my neck then I got foggy and dizzy and passed out

                                                had pain in left arm at injection site, but expected that. got sick after second dose (which is strange as I got really sick after the first one), that went away after roughly 36 hrs, however the injection site pain had radiated down the left arm. still, just assumed it&#39;d go away, no worries. woke up the second day after shot, with feeling as if id maybe slept funny, as my shoulder on the left arm had a shooting pain thru to my arm, which was numb and tingly, and my hand felt like it was asleep...total pins and needles. shook it, didnt go away. mind you, I&#39;m not a guy who thinks he&#39;s sick all the time, and is constantly at the doctor. I actually don&#39;t have a doctor, nor insurance, but I just usually ride whatever out..but this was becoming more than an annoyance. now its been three weeks or so, and the symptoms have just gotten worse. I&#39;d say I&#39;ve lost about 90% of the strength in my left hand. I can&#39;t make a fist, hold objects, pull up my pants, pick my nose, play my guitar, etc..my hand is never not buzzing with pins and needles, in a semi-claw shape, and its losing circulation as its noticeably purplish. yesterday, I called the urgent care that I use as a doctor if absolutely necessary, as I felt I had to do something. I asked if I could come down, described my symptoms, and they said all they&#39;d do is tell me to go to the ER as it sounded not good..now numbness is going down my left leg and foot is swelling.

                                                Starting very soon after the Second Moderna COVID 19 shot, I started to find it very hard to concentrate, and I started experiencing severe short term memory loss.  I have noticed cognitive issues when trying to complete sentences and I am forgetting to keep track of things and tasks that I perform on a regular basis and have never had issues with prior.  Most times I am fighting a general fogginess throughout the day.

ON MONDAY, 3 MAY 2021, I VISITED MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH MY SKIN AND HE WONDERED IF I HAD STEPPED IN POISON IVY OR POISON OAK. I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT I HAD NOT BEEN HIKING AND THAT WE DO NOT HAVE POISON IVY OR POISON OAK IN OUR YARD. HE PRESCRIBED A .5 PERCENT CLOBETASOL STEROID CREAM. THE VISIT TOOK TWENTY MINUTES AND I WAS CHARGED $98.95. ON FRIDAY, 14 MAY 2021, AT 3:00 PM, I RECEIVED THE SECOND COVID VACCINATION. BY 9:00 PM, I NOTICED TINGLING AND NERVE PAIN ON MY HANDS...

Went home laid down. I still feel weird on and off.  Went to the bathroom and had black stool. My right arm is still sore.

When EMT&#39;s arrived about 10 minutes, my heart rate went down to 100bpm. I decided not to go to hospital and just continue observation. I still have a feeling of increased nervousness and palpitation in my chest today.

                                                Headache slight chills started around 3:00 am .  I woke up and was not able to go back to sleep.  Later in the day, while at work, I became extremely fatigued and my chills were getting worse.  I left work early, came home and checked my temperature.  It has been between 102.5 and 103.7 the entire time I have been home.  Even after taking Tylenol.  My arm is also a little tender at the injection site.    I had COVID prior to this but they say I recovered.    My symptoms started on November 13 and was hospitalized for 3 days starting around day 9 of symptoms.  My current symptoms are pretty much identical to the symptoms I had when I first contracted COVID.

                                                At 12:30  i was lying in bed and started getting more and more restless.  I could feel something happening with my body on the inside like a storm.  I got up to use the bathroom and had a syncopal episode about halfway to bathroom. Fell and i came to immediately when my name was called.  I got back into bed.  My lips were white.  I still felt lightheaded but could breathe freely and easily.  There was no noticeable swelling impairing my breathing.  Initially i could not get a reading on my pulse oximeter.  After a few minutes it worked and by then i was at 95%. I suspect the oxygen was quite low prior to that.  For the next day i had a fever and farigue.  The day after that I had some lingering fatigue but no fever.  Right now I am not planning to get the second shot in the series.

Pharmacist and another associate helped patient up who was conscious. He asked what happened and if he were standing.  He shared that everything went pitch black.  He was placed on chair; pharmacist asked if he wouldl like to lie down and he declined. He stated he had felt nervous and scared about imz before his appointment. Patient did cut his lip in fall and was given napkins for bleeding and a cold compress for face and neck. Patient waited with us for 2 hours. His BP was 154-74 and pulse of 54 ; patient stated he was a runner with low pulse. Patient arranged for a ride from family member since he lived far and was not sure about driving. I recommend that he place a call in with his provider.

                                                I have had a low grade fever (99.5)  for a week now.  I have had insomnia since the night of the injection.  EVERY night I wake up hot 3 hours after I went to sleep.  I have never gotten the chills, only hot.   I usually need to take a sleep aid to get back to sleep which is NOT normal for me.   Many times I wake up again 3 hours later even after the sleep aid hot.   My lack of sleep has really been hard on my daytime working and living at this point.  When I wake at night hot my temperature is usually 99.5, but has been a bit lower at times too.   I also feel that I have rapid heart rate at this time (when I try to fall back asleep)  and it seems as if my heart is beating harder than normal.  I also feel a buzzing in my head like I drank too much coffee type of feeling.  The first couple of days I felt tired and weak and a bit achy throughout the day.  The next few days after that I felt dizzy and light headed with a headache.  The first few days I also noticed slight muscle spasms throughout my arms and torso particularly when I laid down at night to go to bed and was still and relaxed.  I have been taking over the counter pain/fever pills usually for the headache.  I contacted my doctor and he said to give it a week.  It has been a week yesterday, but Dr is closed for weekends and Fridays.  I went to urgent care on Friday and they were not helpful (virtually).  They said give it 5 more days!!!!!   I am extremely tired of this and worried at how long it has been.  NOBODY I know with the first shot has had this reaction.  My wife is nervous as well and we would really like to hear something that may ease our minds at this point.  Some explanation as to why my body may be reacting this way, or if any others have had this same situation.

                                                After receiving my shot, I waited the half an hour. I felt a pinch in my head and tightness in shoulders and neck. Once I reached the parking lot I was belching ridiculously and started feeling like vomiting. Than my chest hurt.  Went back to the clinic and said I don&#39;t feel right.  They had me stand in line and wait to be re-admitted.  The nurse starting taking blood pressure and offered me water I could not swallow the tiniest amount.  My neck felt like I was being chocked. My fingers on my left arm started tingling and arm was getting slightly red and arm felt heavy. The nurse said my symptoms were happening internally.  The doctor had me remove my mask and looked at the back of my mouth. Than used a stethoscope on my chest and the back.  Asked  if I had asthma , said no. He Than requested epinephrine shot and a steroid. With in a few seconds I started feeling like I could breathe. He prescribed an epinephrine pen incase I had another episode. Two day later I had another visit online with doctor from about redness on left and right arm. Having another allergic reaction and possible site infection. Now I&#39;m taking 10 days antibiotics and allergy medicine.

While he was still oriented to person/place/time, he states having difficulty in trying to find his car (no issues reported during the 15 minute waiting period). Both concerns resolved w/in 5 minutes spontaneously. He had not had a prior similar reaction to a past vaccination. Denied pruritus (other than over injection area), urticaria/hives, flushing, swelling/angioedema, lightheadedness, weakness/difficulty ambulating, syncope/LOC, SOB/dyspnea, tachycardia/palpitations, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, abdominal cramping. He has no allergies that he is aware of and was able to work afterwards. RN reviewed common adverse effects and when to seek care. Advised 30 minutes of supervised post-vaccination wait time. Reinforced to alert staff if he experiences any of the adverse effects we discussed related to concerns for immediate allergic reaction. Patients intention is to return to work today (works with health care professional). He was checked on during/at the end of the observation period and reported no issues.

                                                After first dose I experienced severe L shoulder pain for 2 days. Couldn&#39;t move it well, could not sleep on it. Pain started 4h after injection.  After second dose I started experiencing L shoulder pain after 40 minutes. Pain was so severe I could not put my hand into the packet. In the evening the same day I started running temperature 101F that last 3 days non stop. I started experiencing severe chills, could not stop at times shaking! I was hot and cold every so often. I started experiencing same evening severe body ache which was constant and felt like I was squeezed by some machine. I could not sleep, I felt just terrible,  couldn&#39;t find comfortable position. My heart beat resting was 110 per minute and it stayed like that first night. My normal resting pulse is 60-70 bps. I did not have headaches or nausea. At night everything felt worse. After 3 nights temperature subsided but I was exhausted and my temperature dropped 95.9F my normal temperature is 97.88F. ( 36.6C) . Since April 2nd I have been tired and I want to sleep all the time.

                                                Severe tinnitus began about 0100 on 02/11/2021, waking me out of a sound sleep, and keeping me awake for the rest of the night.  Symptoms persist, and seem to be worse at night, while at home and not at work.  PCP has me taking Lipo-Flavonoid Plus, to help with the symptoms, which help eliminate some of the loud buzzing, but not all of it.

                                                After first vaccine on March 15, I only had arm pain at injection site, but I started having pretty regular ringing in my ears, mainly in my left ear and for a very shorty duration each time it occurred. After second injection, I had pain at injection site shortly after injection that became much more intense and moved to my bicep the next morning. On the first day, I also felt tired and unable to concentrate, which became more severe on the second day before subsiding on the third. On the morning of the second day, I began having random, brief pinching pains in different parts of my body. These have occurred randomly since that day, at most 10 times a day or so, primarily in neck, arms and legs. I had a fever of 100.2 on the evening of the second day. The ringing in my ears is now very quiet and high pitched, but more or less constant and in both ears. Whenever it is quiet, I hear it or if I pay attention when it is not quiet, it is still there. I noticed the constant ringing yesterday morning (April 17) and it has persisted.

The headache and tiredness got worse over the weekend but the arm got better.  On monday (4/5) while dealing with worse tiredness and headache I got a migraine around 3:30 pm/  tuesday(4/6) the symptoms got worse but the migraine started at about 1:00pm.  Wednesday thru Friday the migraines were so bad i could not attend work or get out of bed without a great amount of effort.  During these three days the pain in my back became more pronounced.  The pain went from the to of my skull to the belt area of my back .  The pain followed the spine mostly and spread out along my belt line.   I saw my primary doctor on Friday (4/9)and received a Toradol shot.  Many blood tests and covid tests were performed and nothing abnormal was found.  The symptoms got a little better for the next two days.  My work has a 10 days from symptoms before being allowed to come back to work so i was home until today.(4/18) I start work again tomorrow(4/19) but i still have extreme tiredenss, aches and headache.

He said it just didn&#39;t feel right. When he got his first vaccine, he didn&#39;t even notice it. He noted that this second vaccine was given much further down than his first vaccine was given.  He noted that it was given approximately 7-8 cm below the acromion process. His arm was sore that day but it improved after 1 day. Then 7 days later, he had severe pain to his shoulder and upper arm. He woke up and he could not move his arm. He got up and had his son massage it and then after some time, it loosened up and he could move it.  He still has limited range of motion of his arm due to pain, his strength is decreased, the pain radiates down his arm, and the pain is impacting his work and daily activities. The pain is worse with rest.  He describes it as throbbing.

Saturday morning i am still not feeling myself but still improving.  Sunday i go to work, someone i work with comes in contact with someone else who just testes positive for Covid, and tells us. At this time my crew and i are told to quarantine for 4 days. Now on Feb.4th, i just tested positive for Covid-19, but symptom free.

I was yelling at my wife and children.  This is very out of character for me and woke up this morning and had trouble recalling all the events of the previous night until my wife informed me of them.

                                                Note:  I had a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March, 2020.  Approximately 12 hours after the second vaccine dose, I experienced intense soreness at the vaccination site (significantly greater than the first dose).  In the middle of the night I awoke with flu-like symptoms.  At 9am I took acetominophen  for fever, rigors, muscle aches.  This brought mild relief from approx. 9:45am to 11:15 am.  My condition continued to worsen through the early afternoon with rigors and significant generalized muscle aches.  I experienced tachycardia (90-105 bpm vs normal of ~70bpm),  SOB,  and starting measuring pulse oximetry which read from 89%-94% (my usual does not go below 97%).  This persisted until approximately 8pm with no improvement.  I took 40 mg prednisone, 600 mg ibuprofen and within 3 hours was starting to have symptom resolution. I am a physician and up to date on all my vaccinations.  I have never had anything approaching this type of response.  I don&#39;t know if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection  creates a situation were the very potent mRNA vaccine triggers a large immunologic recall response.  I wanted to get this noted as there may be some reason to alter the vaccine schedule for prior SARS-CoV-2 infections

                                                At 2:00 am the following morning after my 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine I started experiencing a severe headache and body pains.  My left arm was sore and difficult to lift which is the arm I received the shot in.  Throughout the day I have continued to have a headache, body pains and developed a fever up to 101.00.  I have also felt nauseous at times and at one point threw up some of the Gatorade that I had a little while earlier.  So to summarize, all in all, I feel absolutely terrible.

                                                Two or three days after receiving my first shot of the Moderna vaccine, I began having severe tinnitus (ringing in ears). I have had minor tinnitus for the past five years as a result of attending a very loud concert, however, that normally didn&#39;t disrupt me. The tinnitus since my vaccine has been so severe that it sometimes keeps me from falling  asleep or wakens me. After a few weeks, the tinnitus was less severe, but it has not returned to its normal levels. I&#39;ve read of many other people who have the same symptom, so I&#39;m hesitant about getting another vaccine dose. I&#39;ll get guidance from my ENT.

                                                I got my 1st Moderna Covid Vaccine shot on 3/6/21. I started to notice my tinnitus more than usual. I got my 2nd Moderna Vaccine shot on 4/5/21. Then on April 9th around 4AM it&#39;s like someone turned my tinnitus up. It got significantly louder out of the blue. Was harder to sleep. I still hear it now while I am awake which I usually don&#39;t notice it. I also feel slightly dizzy as I walk around the house.

Felt like a flu, but no fever or chills. Slept most the day and work up today (Sat the 10th) feeling close to normal. A few dizzy spells but nothing compared to yesterday.

                                                On evening of initial dose, I had a very sore Arm at the injection site. I feel that it was extremely different from what others describe. I could barely lift the arm without a lot of pain. I wasn&#39;t too worried about it as I knew it could only be sore for so long. It faded throughout the next days. On 04/07/21, I woke from a sleep at 4am and as I rolled over, I had a massive wave of dizziness come over me. I thought it was very strange so I decided to sit up, in bed. As soon as I sat up, the room started spinning. It felt as if I were drunk as a skunk. I managed to steady myself and got out of bed and went to the bathroom, all the while fighting the dizziness/vertigo. The dizziness/vertigo has prevailed since then, but at a diminished rate. It is better if I am up and moving and worse if I am sitting/laying around. I&#39;ve waited almost a week to file this VAER but feel like it needs to be done.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

He went to bed and at 4:00 AM he started throwing up profusely and was intense and periodic until it lasted until 8:00 AM (4 hours).   He has stomach problems, but not to the extent of this.  He has been trying to control his other problems with Alka Seltzer which normally helps with his regular stomach issues, but did take 3 of them during that 4 hour period which seemed to calm his stomach down, but normally one takes 1.   His stomach is feeling better right now other than having loss of appetite, eating small bites and minimal.   Feels he may have fever right now but not feeling well enough to get up, sweaty and clammy on the back of his neck right now.  Feeling weak due to the 4 hours of vomiting.  He has not called his doctor.

                                                I have not been sick all year.  About 12 hours after the shot, I had a fever, extreme pain and moderate swelling in left arm.  Nausea.  24 hours after vomited.  Extreme fatigue, slept 13 hours straight. 48 hours still fever and fatigue but improving. 72 hours, fever and nausea gone, but still fatigued.    96 hours later felt completely fine. .....   But here is where I find it very strange.  At 120 hours after, my 10 year old daughter develops the exact same systems.   She DID NOT receive any vaccination.  She develop a fever and vomitted approimately according to the same time frame I did.   I find this extremely strange considering we have been very viligant about wearing masks outside our home.    We asked around and we do not know of anyone who has had the flu nor come in contact with someone who had the flu.  I find it extremely bizarre that my whole family has not been sick all year and then 12 hours after I get the vaccine, I get sick and throw up and 4 days later my daughter also gets sick and throws up.    From what I understand, this might just be a bad coincidence, but I felt I needed to report it.  Thank you.

                                                EXTREME chills and fever.  Alternated 4 or 5 cycles.  Woke up with having thrown off my blankets and had to get ice packs and open windows to cool down enough to sleep, a few hours later woke up SHIVERING like I never have before.  I thought I was convulsing until I realized I could control it with my breathing. I was shivering so hard that I bit my tongue several times.  I didn&#39;t have much energy so it took several minutes before I could grab blankets and even longer before I could close the window.  I was wrapped in several layers of blankets and was still shivering until I fell asleep.  I woke up again and my blankets were soaked in my sweat.  This cycle got more and more intense until the next day.  *I&#39;ve been hospitalized with pneumonia and this felt 100 times worse. The next day, I had the worst diarrheic that I&#39;ve ever had, sudden urge.. barely made it to toilet and INSTANTLY discharged what felt like a gallon of brown liquid (it was probably less but felt pretty nasty).

Usually I can notice it if I tried but now could not sleep, can hear it over tv and music. Two weeks later still bad and seems to be increasing.  Also noticed little blood spots showing up on skin on chest, legs, arms. very small, raised, and probably around 20-30 on whole body.

No other pain the day of injection. Day after injection (approximately 18 hours later) the entire right arm ached; then the aching moved to the lower back and eventually both legs. Pain resolved at approximately 30 hours after injection; ache never affected left (non-injected) arm.  Minor headache seemed to be forming, but never progressed past the initial indications. Was extremely tired the day following the injection; took two naps (1-2 hours each) and slept 12 hours that night (i.e., injected Friday, tired all day Saturday and slept longer than normal Saturday night). Aside from soreness at injection point, no further signs/symptoms on Sunday (i.e., resolved around 36 hours after injection).

                                                I received my first Moderna COVID vaccine shot on Saturday, around 3pm. No problems immediately and I felt fine. Went to bed late, around 4am. On Sunday, I was awoken at 1:30pm with a throbbing right testicle. The pain went away I thought. Then again it happened. Every 60 seconds my right testicle felt like someone was squeezing it. The testicle was not warm or painful to touch. The pain started soft at first and it would get stronger. The pain would start at a level 1-2, grow to 4-5. The pain would last 5-10 seconds then go away. This happened every 60 seconds. I had a stopwatch and timed it. Pain would come, go away, and then 45-60 seconds later, it would occur all again. This went on for the next 14 hours. I took nighttime Advil to try and sleep and eventually dozed off when the pain subsided around 4am. The next day nothing was wrong until around 8pm. Then the exact same scenario started. Pain, stop, 60 seconds, pain. This day, Monday, again I took nighttime Advil and the pain stopped. Today, Tuesday, as of 8pm, no pain yet. I do not have insurance so I didn&#39;t know whom to contact. After the second day of pain I called the pharmacist and then informed me to notify you.

Around 9:30pm that evening, I began to feel fatigued and had a slight headache. I went to bed around10:15-10:30pm. Shortly after going to bed, my headache  worsened and I began having chills. I was a bit restless that night and just did not feel well. These symptoms lasted until about 8am the following morning, 12/24/2020. I was still fatigued and still had a headache, which had lessened in intensity. I no longer had chills. The fatigue wore off throughout the day, but I still had a slight headache. Later in the evening I again became fatigued and still had a slight headache. The following day, my headache subsided, and I was only tired once evening came around. My symptoms had completely dissipated by 12/26/2020.

About one minute later he felt like he could not get a full breath and he felt the need to run away. We connected a heart monitor, did serial vital signs, listen to lung sounds. He symptoms seem to worsen. He did not have hives, his lungs were clear. His HR was normal but his B/P was elevated. We started and IV and gave him 25 mg mg of IV Benadryl. We contacted Dr. via phone. He talked to the patient and he agreed with our assessment and treatment.  He began feeling better about 10 min after the Benadryl and he symptoms cleared by 30 min after Benadryl. We kept him on the heart monitor for 1 hour.  He reported he felt fine and back to normal when he left to go home. He refused ambulance transport to the hospital. All reports will be filled out by me.

Interferes with sleep, regardless of position (&amp; unable to lie on left side).  Unable to elevate shoulder overhead into flexion or abduction d/t pain (limited to ~45 degrees).  Tenderness over lateral shoulder/SIT tendons.  Positive impingement sign.  Seems to be tendon/shoulder injury d/t faulty injection technique.  I had minimal shoulder soreness after the first injection.

                                                About 3-5 minutes after getting the vaccine began experiencing a light headedness feeling. Took my blood pressure and it was a little high (140/95), I attributed this to anxiety but got home and my BP at home was down to about 120/76 about 1 hr. after. I laid down to sleep it off but could not sleep as about 1 hr. after trying to go to sleep I started to get a headache. After about 2 hours of battling it I decided to take a Extra Strength Tylenol which helped with the headache about 2 hrs later is was almost gone but the feeling of lightheadedness/dizziness was still there a bit worse than at the beginning. I slept it off and the next morning it was about 50 % better and by about noon it seemed to be 99% better. Today is Thursday ( on my 3rd day) and still feel a slight dizziness but I also have seasonal allergies which sometimes give me the same symptoms. I expect to be better soon.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

Concerned, sweating,  Bp was very high at that point. Don&#39;t have the exact number. Called for ambulance, paramedics ruled out WPW and gave me iv drug that brought rate down to 120 fairly quickly, Over the next hours resting rate slowly normalized to around 80 (normal for me is 72).  For 2-3 days afterwards had some high resting pulses up to 118 but never as bad and normalized in a few days.

                                                A few minutes after the shot i started getting dizzy. it increased with intensity so i flagged down an attendant for help. I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

This did not start going down until today.  I am not intending on seeking medical attention.    I ran very high fevers that were not able to be taken down by Tylenol right away.    I was out of my head with a little confusion and delirium for a few hours.  I experienced muscle aches and fatigue. I experienced itchy and crawly feelings on my skin.

                                                On 3/16/21 at approximately 12PM a middle-aged male patient came in to get his first dose of Moderna vaccine. I took in this patient into the IMZ room to give his vaccination and reviewed his form he filled out. On the question related to &#34;have you ever had a reaction to a vaccine (fainting/dizzy)&#34; the patient answered &#34;No&#34;. The patient walked outside to the waiting area and sat down to begin his 15mins, at that point another customer yelled for medical attention for him because he passed out in the chair. I ran out with an EpiPen in case it was anaphylaxis. After I got outside the patient regained consciousness in the matter of seconds but was still dazed/confused and I applied a cold compress to the back of his neck and gave the patient some water to drink while feeling for his pulse in the wrist. He began to lose his color/pallor in his face again for a second time at that point I told my technician to call 911, after we dialed them, the patient came back to fully again this time and all color was restored to his face and he was fully conscious this time and able to speak in complete sentences. He wanted me to cancel the 911 call and since he came back to consciousness again in the matter of seconds so we canceled it. I made the patient wait an extra 30 minutes to observe him and he was fine from there on out, his wife was accompanying him and stated he has done this in the past for vaccines (despite answering no in the assessment form) and said she will be driving him home and checking in with his doctor later.

Sitting upright in a char and driving a car made the pain worse. Difficulty sleeping due to pain and having to sleep on one side. Soothed the pain temporarily with a menthol rub but the pain would not go away  Sunday, March 7: Pain (burning, stinging, aching, quaking) unbearable to the point that I stayed in bed most of the day but could not sleep. Sitting upright continued to make pain worse. Menthol rub did not make pain go away. Pain intensified throughout the day in left shoulder and neck, shoulder blade, arm, and hand.  Monday, March 8: Appointment with Dr, internal medicine specialist who is my mother&#39;s primary care physician. Dr. suspected that I may be suffering from brachial neuritis and recommended that I see a neurologist for further diagnosis. He prescribed Gabapentin (nerve pain medication) and a series of steroid medication (Prednizone) for me to take throughout the week. I asked him how long I would have to take the medication in weeks/months to come. He said as long as I am feeling the pain. That night, when I started taking the medication, the pain flared up deep in my shoulder and down my arm like a fireball!   Tuesday, March 9 - Thursday, March 11: Gabapentin was not effective with reducing extreme pain. Dr. instructed me to increase dosage as needed. A day later, he called in a prescription for -------, a pain medication that he said I could take with Gabapentin to help strengthen relief. Made appointment with Dr, neurologist with Medical Group.   Friday, March 12:  Appointment with Dr. Initial tests suggest to him that my condition could be either brachial neuritis. He ordered MRI and EMG nerve test. I asked if I would be able to drive back to home. He advised against driving at all given my medications and ongoing pain, as well as the need to arrive at a clear diagnosis. I asked him what I should do about getting the second Moderna shot. He told me that I should not get the second shot. I am scheduled to get the second shot on Friday, March 26, at a vaccination site, State University.

RN #1 called local EMS/Fire Rescue and they arrived to assess him. Vital signs were within normal limits. He was transported to Hospital for further evaluation. He was alert and oriented and able to ambulate to EMS/Fire Rescue vehicle.

                                                Client received his first dose of Covid vaccine in the clinic on 4/1/2021 at approximately 10:25 a.m.  Client was walked to the courtroom for observation for 15 minutes post-vaccination.  This is standard procedure.  When his 15 minutes was up, Nurse informed him that his time was up and he was free to go, and signed him out.  As she was speaking with him, she noticed he was disoriented.  She asked if he was all right and fanned his face for a few seconds. 2nd nurse came by at that time, and the women helped pt. back to the clinic and onto a pad on the floor in a nurse?s office. Third person was called. Vitals were taken several successive times (BP ranged from 148/99 to 155/104), Temp was normal and in 97.5 to 98.4 range.  Resp 16-18. Pulse was between 78 and 93.  Client was disoriented, could not state his name and could not name anyone for us to call.  Ammonia salts were employed with no effect.  All emergency meds, oral airways, and AED were gathered in case they were needed. No other meds or equipment were used. By standard called for the clerk, and By standard, to call paramedics.  She called 911 x 2 and when put through to EMS, was given a disconnect notice.  She ran down the hall to the constable?s offices, who placed the call and had paramedics on their way.  Then two constables (male and an unknown female constable) came to the Health Dept.   Third person got the client to answer with whom to call. Third person called the client?s mother-in-law and employer.  Both arrived after the client was transferred via ambulance and left to join him immediately at the hospital.  As all this was happening, Nurse, 2nd Nurse, third person, and Bystander were attempting to ensure pt. airway and breathing were patent.  He never had difficulty breathing and never had wheezing.  There were no other visible signs of anaphylaxis. His color was pale, then improved, but became pallid again at about the time the paramedics arrived.  He was never alert or oriented throughout the event. Paramedics arrived at approximately 11:00 a.m. They did an initial assessment and received report on what had occurred and data gathered.  They then had to lift pt. onto the stretcher.  He was then transported to Hospital.

Once he was attended to, he was evaluated and taken to the local SEARHC ER. He was released a few hours later when his symptoms resolved. This patient had worked over two weeks straight with Herring as a seafood processor with little sleep and exhaustion.

His vitals were stable at BP 133/95, HR 90, Pulse ox 97% on room air. His symptoms persisted so 911 was promptly called. Dr. came and assessed patient and he was found to have clear lungs with no abnormal heart sounds. When EMS arrived, his vitals were very similar and still stable. Patient was taken to Hospital. I spoke with him the following day, 4/7/21, and he reported that his labs were all unremarkable and they treated him for a panic attack and he was feeling well by the time he got home.

I had trouble sleeping through most of the night and got up twice to urinate.  I could not get comfortable enough to fall asleep - was not necessarily feeling pain, just soreness.  During the day Sunday, I tried to rest having lost sleep, and it was mainly my lower back (back strap muscles) which were experiencing soreness.  Sunday evening, I went to bed around 9:30, and I woke up around midnight having a sore neck.  It felt like I was not necessarily sore in the muscles, but I could feel my heart rate increase and my blood pumping through my neck to my brain.  I could not get comfortable at all and lost sleep.  During the day Monday, I tried to rest it off, and there was no position I could rest where I was not in pain in my neck.  It almost felt like I had some form of encephylitis.  I went to bed around 8:30 PM, exhausted.  Woke up around midnight again, and I could not get back to sleep until 4 AM.  I found a position where my head turned and my shoulder extended away was not painful.  I woke up having felt like I had strained that muscle however.

By the fourth day, total incapacitation to move left arm. The pain persists, rigid arm, and I can barely move it. I currently cannot do any activity. The area presents a slight fever.

                                                First injection, no issues.  Second injection led to blood glucose of 368 about an hour post injection.   Beginning the morning of Sunday, 04/18/21, I had a low blood glucose episode early in the morning (meaning blood glucose 30 mg/dL or below). Typical to these I react by sweating profusely, trembling, visual anomalies, anxiety.   Never in my life have I experienced what I did on 04/18/21 concurrent with low blood glucose out of dozens and dozens of such episodes in my lifetime since being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 3. I suffered right side weakness (hand, arm, leg, trouble focusing right eye). My blood glucose at that time was low and I immediately drank some juice and ate something, but even an hour into the episode I was experiencing right side weakness and difficulty keeping my footing and hand action.

                                                after receiving the 1st vaccination shot of maderna, I began to feel sick to my stomach about 1 week after the 1st shot, my stomach will grumble as if I&#39;m starving to death (painful hunger pains) but when I eat, its only 3 or 4 bites of food and then I cannot stomach finishing my meals. I&#39;ll then feel as if I&#39;m going to throw it back up, this is every meal this occurs. At times for the past month I&#39;ve woken up around 1 to 4 am immediately throwing up, even if stomach is empty. Also a very severe case of uric acid buildup and painful GOUT in my entire left ankle joint that&#39;s had me bedridden for the last 3 weeks that started a week after my vaccination. I notice I&#39;ve also been extremely agitated, irritable, restless and not sleeping well.

This was a constant sound in both ears that was present at all times.  Over the next 3 weeks the noise level of the ringing fluctuated while moving downward in noise level.  By 3 weeks after the first dose the ringing was almost gone.  I received the second dose 4/17/21 and later in the day the noise level was higher than it ever was after the first dose.  As I type this 3&#43; weeks later the noise level has not gone down at all.  It is with me at all times.  It makes it hard to fall asleep at times and is there the instant I wake.  In the last 1&#43; week I have noticed a pressure in my ears.

                                                I received my first Moderna shot on March 22 and my second on April 19. I had very bad side effects both times, though the second was worse with chills, dizziness, some light fever, body aches, sweating. This lasted up to two weeks after my second dose. I hardly ever take sick time off, but I had to leave work several times due to vaccine symptoms showing up.  A month later, around May 15th, I started to feel a waxy feeling on the roof of my mouth and I had noticed even before this that I couldn&#39;t whistle like I normally can. By May 23, I went to the ER for facial paralysis on my right side. I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. At this moment it&#39;s just my face, no other body parts.

These symptoms have caused insomnia, nausea, rapid weight-loss, and panic attacks. Treatment has been Flonase daily, anti-inflammatory diet, no caffeine, drinking lots of water, and resting.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

I woke up I believe in the early morning hours a couple of days later in pain.  The pain caused me to wake up.  After that I noticed that my elbow joints, and knee joints were very sore.  I was unable to flex my arms (mainly right arm) or knees (mainly right knee) after that for approximately two weeks without feeling pain.  Extremely sore joints starting in arm/elbow joint followed by extremely sore knee joints.  Overall body aches mainly in joints.  Persists to the time of this writing

At first he said he felt uneasy and he then later described feeling &#34;like he was tripping&#34;.   He later started feeling confused.  He went to bed around 11p.m. and woke up feeling very tired and achy but was also having a lot of trouble concentrating.  Later in the evening he was acting very confused and he didn&#39;t look well at all.  He was having difficulty verbalizing and conveying his thoughts, he couldn&#39;t remember words and at one point he actually called me &#34;mom&#34;.  I am concerned.  He said he would contact the hotline for adverse reactions on 2/26 if he still felt the same, but I felt it was important to report it either way.  He has never behaved this way before and has no medical history of any sort of memory or mental issues.

                                                My arm was sore for 3 days as though I had been punched really hard.  After that  my deltoid became incredibly irritated and I started having stabbing, excruciating pain in my should any time it moved.  This lasted until I went in to get a shot of local anaesthetic from my doctor  on 2/25/21.  I was taking advil, tylenol, a muscle relaxer, lydecane cream and then I got the shot of anaesthetic.  I slowly had a little bit of improvement in mobility.  13 days after my vaccine, I was no longer experiencing shooting pain in my shoulder.  It is now March 1st and I think I have regained about 70% of my  mobility in that arm.  I believe that the shot made my deltoid flex and freak out and this ended up causing bicep tendinitis.  This is also my doctor&#39;s theory.

                                                About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to develop a fever.  I understand that fever, muscle aches and head aches are possible side effects of vaccinations in general and this one in particular.  Since I had tested positive for antibodies for the third time just two weeks prior to receiving this first dose of Moderna I was anticipating some reactions similar to what I have heard people experiencing for their second shot.  What followed the initial onset of fever was the worst flu symptoms I have ever experienced in my 48 years.  Fever continued to increase reaching 103 if not higher at times and staying elevated at level for over 6 hours.  Chills to the point of convulsions.  Nausea and one time vomiting.  Fever dreams (mild hallucinations), profuse sweating, intense head aches.  Muscle aches I could barely tolerate that I felt over every inch of my body.  This continued until 10am the following morning when I took some advil and finally fell asleep to the point of being virtually unwakeable until 2:30pm.  Upon waking I was able to sit up and drink water but the muscle soreness and slight fever continued throughout the day (101 fever).   I was able to eat some toast that evening.  That night the fever returned but not as high as the previous night.  The sweating was still profuse throughout the night and the muscle aches continued  but to a lessor degree.  The following day the fever subsided though muscle soreness continued.  That evening I was able to sleep regularly and now today (three full days after vaccination) I am roughly back to myself.  I understand that reading this seems as if these symptoms fall in line with what is expected and understand to be the side effects of the vaccine.  I am here today to tell you that I thought I was dying.  I have never, ever felt so terrible ever.  It was ten times worse than having covid.  I cannot imagine  anyone who is not healthy and string making through that and I can not believe I am expected to do it again to complete my vaccination.

The symptoms persisted for 30 minutes so the pharmacist called an ambulance to the store.  The paramedics checked my vital signs which were stable but recommended that I go to the nearest hospital for further examination and treatment.

                                                He got the vaccine, started to get the headache within 45 minutes, ran some errands and after a couple of hours he felt like something was burning on his buttock, and noticed a really bad red rash on the left side on the left cheek from the crack outward. It was extremely hot to the touch and very sore, kind of throbbing and swollen and progressively got worse. He was just not feeling well, nauseous and dizzy and went to sleep but when he woke up it had spread to the other cheek. It looks like he got burned or scalded red/purple in color. He has no reaction on the arm itself, but only on the buttock and a blistery, blood red, leathery feeling rash/blotch on his entire buttock to both hips on both sides. It is difficult for him to sit. He also had headache, the muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea.  He did not vomit but had not eaten anything. He has had a high fever up to 103 until this morning 4/8/21 which is about 99-100.  He woke up soaking wet today. He has not been able to turn his neck, and not able to lift his arm above his waist level since the vaccine, and not able to turn his neck to the left at all. He can turn it 5-10 degrees, but right is okay. He took some Benadryl over the last 2 days for the reaction but it has not. He also has taken aspirin/Aleve for the fever. He was so sock and had no energy and could not sleep but could not keep his eyes open either, was not able to open them. He did write his doctor when the rash was only on one side, which they did not give him any advice as he was not feeling any worse at that time. He was at 101 fever throughout the day and then at night went to 102. He was hoping that the rash would be better, but actually worse as described above. He has not had any appetite, trying to drink fluids but made him nauseous, and he normally drinks water all day long. His normal temp is 97.7. He has been taking showers to try and keep his fevers down and the water hitting the rash feels like somebody is pouring scolding water on it. He did call Moderna on 4/6/21 asking if this was a reaction that anybody has reported, and he is waiting for somebody to call him back.

I woke up Thursday morning around 7 AM. I still feel fatigue but in the longer I have the other symptoms. I have missed two days of work. I plan to go back to work on Friday. I took Tylenol to help control my fever. Which was a low-grade fever around 99.2 most of the time

                                                Patient felt faint within 2 minutes of vaccination. His vision went dark. When I walked back into the room he was pale and sweating, but responding to questions from the person he arrived with. His arm twitched a few times and his head rolled to the side for a few seconds. Then he regained consciousness, but momentarily looked confused. The patient has a history of seizures, but has not suffered from one in 10 years. After that, the patient remained alert, but continued to sweat and felt light headed for most of standard wait time post vaccination. After the 15 minute wait period the patient felt more normal and left.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12, 2021 the day after I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I woke with severa muscle and joint pain, headache, pain at injection site unable to lift arm above head.  As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the shot, I began to feel flu-like symptoms beginning with intestinal discomfort and incontinence. Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

                                                Injection administered on 1/4/21 and was given in upper left shoulder joint opposed to the deltoid muscle. I completely removed my shirt to assure proper placement.  Common soreness to shot experienced next two days after administration, however soreness felt in shoulder joint rather than muscle. Pain re-occurred on 1/12/21 and has not been totally relieved despite the usage of anti-inflammatory medication eg. Ibuprofen 400mg,  Tylenol 500mg along with Ibuprofen for soreness. The worst pain I experience is when I go to sleep being prematurely awaken by aching and throbbing to my affected area. Again, not being any discomfort to muscle but rather left shoulder joint pain where sometimes I am discouraged from raising my left arm to my side. It does not bother me so much to raise my left arm towards my front. I have been working through my discomfort while being very careful not to aggravating it further. My concern comes from the fact that it has not completely gone away after the extended time frame and becomes more intense in the evening.

The day after the injection fatigue was debilitating requiring sleeping or resting for most of the day and night. Half way through the second day after the injection fatigue is still present though significantly improved. The Item 21 box for Doctor visit has been checked as I will meet with my primary care provider as soon as possible and have already discussed it with my employer&#39;s health department.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                About 12 hours after vaccination, I started to have severe chills, fever, intense headache, body aches, inability to sleep and sweating.  This last 24 hours and then began to dissipate.  The headache left first.  These symptoms mirrored the symptoms I had with COVID minus the sinus drainage and sore throat I had with COVID.  Yet, the symptoms were more intense.  The reaction to the vaccine was the sickest I recall being in the last 20 years.  It was a long 24 hours. I went to the ER and obtained a liter of fluids via IV and motrin type medicine.  I was advised it should last about 24-36 hours and discharged.

                                                On 12 FEB 2021 I received my first dosage of the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine, Lot 016M20A. On the day of the vaccination, the pain from Psoriatic Arthritis  (primarily bi-lateral feet was low in comparison to the average level of pain over the last 7 days).  There was also discomfort in the hips which for time to time had presented with point pain at the connection of the hip to the Femur. BLUF: Most significant joint/muscoskeletal pain related to exacerbation locations for Psoriatic Arthritis that I have ever endured since receiving the injection.  Prepared for second vaccination, but fearful of PSA not being in control and dramatic escalation in discomfort in feet and hips, affecting ability to walk.  I received my vaccination at some time after 1400 hours, 12 FEB.  No issues noted until approximately 2300 hours, 12 FEB, when significant and debilitating pain was noted in multiple joints or areas affected by recent Psoriatic Arthritis exacerbations.   Initial Pain made it difficult to sleep from the 12th into the 13th due to significant discomfort. Through that first night, the pain immediately flared, bilateral feet, left and right hip and point pain at three locations on veterbrae, (lower, mid and upper back).  Pain was most pronounced in feet and left hip,  the feet (all toes seemed to throb in pain and were sensitive to touch or simple movements).  Pain in feet and left hip was a 10/10.  Left hip pain was slightly different than the point pain and seemed to radiate out from the area where it connects to the femur. 13 FEB: By 0815 on 13 FEB the pain in the right foot and right hip decreased, as well as the pain in the lower, mid and upper back but the pain in the left foot and left hip continued, slightly less strong than the night prior.  Pain level decreased to 8/10 for left foot and hip and was down to a 5/10 for the right foot and hip and a 3/10 for the areas on the back. In the evening of 13 FEB it was noted that the pain in the left hip became more generalize:d vice the specific point pain that I have witnessed off/on since SEP 2020.  Continued to note evening pain that felt like burning/tingling pain on both feet.  At this point the pain in the evenings appeared to be worse than the AM pain.   Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 It should be noted, that left shoulder discomfort from the injection never exceed 2/10 as it appeared 24 hours after the injection.  More pain in shoulder associated with mobility/rotation? I lacked the ability to simply walk through the house due to the pain throughout the past 36 hours.   14 FEB: Less discomfort in AM, but still greatest in left foot. Left Foot: 7/10 Fight foot: 4/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 3/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 4/10 PM:  Significant increase in pain at bed time. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 15 FEB: AM: continued lessening of pain/discomfort in AM, but appeared back throughout the day, worsening at evening.  Pain in left hip was noted to be much more pronounced shooting out in multiple directions, to include causing discomfort from the rear of the hip, and when seated shooting pain in the direction of my inner thigh from the back of my hip.  Pain in feet continues to be like a burning/tingling pain in the evening, most pronounced in 2nd and 3rd toes on my left foot and big toe and little toe on my right foot.  The pain also appears to be much greater at evening than in AM. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: Left Hip 8/10 right hip 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10-not much change-very point specific pain.. I am not witnessing fatigue or any other problems other than joint/musco skeletal pain.  I have also not been getting shooting pain in feet that has appeared from time to time which feels like someone hammering nails into individual toes or shots of violent pain, only a sustained burning/tingling pain. four days later the Psoriatic Arthritis locations continue to rage following the vaccine, most notably bilateral feet and left hip, where the pain in the hip appears to be radiating in multiple directions.

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

In desperation, I have my wife help me into a hot shower where I continued to shake violently for about 25 minutes.  My wife continued to monitor me to make sure I didn&#39;t collapse or pass out and continually ask if we should go to the ER.  However, after about 25 minutes the shaking subsided and I was left exhausted with some minor muscle pain due to shaking.  It was very difficult to breath during the incident, noticed my hands turning blue so I focused on deep breaths and staying calm to eventually stop it.

                                                On Friday, 4/2/21, a client (49 yr old male) arrived to the 30 minute Vaccine Recovery lot after COVID 19 Moderna Lot# 020B21A administration at 11:40am. Patient had reported history of rash after taking both Cipro and Penicillin. At 11:55 am while pt was being assessed by vaccine recovery lot, pt reported sudden onset of involuntary movements and mild shortness of breath. The EMT called for the Vaccine Recovery Lot Medical Lead. Began assessing patient at 11:57 am, noting the pt was having involuntary movements of the upper and lower extremities every few seconds. 12:00 pm BP 152/98, pulse 65. Patient was alert and oriented with normal skin color.  Pt reported feeling anxious and &#34;maybe it is all in my head&#34;. Pt reported the blood pressure on scene was &#34; higher than my normal at 120s/80s. Pt denied any history of recent illness or other vaccines. Pt stated, &#34; I should have known something would happen, I had a premonition about this&#34;. Repeat vital signs at 12:32 pm BP 152/98 and pulse 65. Pt continued to have episodes of the involuntary upper and lower extremities lasting approx 3-5 minutes per episode. NP explained to pt that she could not allow him to drive with these movements and pt agreed to evaluation with EMS and transport to local ER for further evaluation. NP instructed to call for EMS. Call was made at 12:48pm and EMS/Fire arrived onsite shortly after. While awaiting Fire Department and EMS, pt reported to NP, &#34;I have a history of Aspergers Syndrome&#34;. Also NP spoke with pt&#39;s spouse who also agreed pt should be evaluated at local ER. He was transported to the local hospital.

They increased in amount each day with the most the entire 2nd week and started to fade the third week. I 100% believe this is from the vaccine and because of it I am afraid of getting the second shot in fear of full loss of my facial muscles.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Heart valve operation. Concomitant products included WARFARIN SODIUM (COUMADIN) for an unknown indication.   On 12-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (Memory lapse, difficulty with memory recall) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Cerebral Ischemic Attack) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 15-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FEELING ABNORMAL (Brain Fog) and HEADACHE (Headache). The patient was hospitalized from 10-Apr-2021 to 12-Apr-2021 due to CONFUSIONAL STATE, MEMORY IMPAIRMENT, THROMBOSIS and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. At the time of the report, MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (Memory lapse, difficulty with memory recall), FEELING ABNORMAL (Brain Fog) and HEADACHE (Headache) had not resolved and CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused), THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Cerebral Ischemic Attack) had resolved. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 10-Apr-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) revealed blood clots. On 10-Apr-2021, International normalised ratio: low (Low) Low. On 10-Apr-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) revealed blood clots. On 15-Apr-2021, International normalised ratio: low (Low) Low.         It was reported that the patient still has difficulty with memory recall, brain fog, headache, and still having trouble with low INR. The patient did not have any side effects after the first dose. Treatment for the events included Levonox injections and Coumadin (increased dose).  Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, excluding other etiologies causal relationship cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the product known safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, excluding other etiologies causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I did not associate it with the vaccine until reading an article about it today, so I just assumed it was the latest surprise from it aging body and didn&#39;t think to much of it. Also it head felt &#34;hazy&#34; at least once, but that has been happening literally my entire life.

                                                Sunday morning, around 12:10am, I started getting chills/trembling/body shakes and my muscles all over my body ached. I was so miserable all morning I couldn&#39;t hardly sleep and later that morning, I could hardly stand for more than 5 minutes. That lasted all of Sunday and I maintained a mild headache. I drank a lot of water all day and ate very little.  I thought it would pass by the next morning. At 2:30am Monday morning a 2nd wave hit me, I had more trembling/ body shakes, this time it lasted for a little over an hour. I woke up again and again through the night and in the morning I had a terrible headache and nausea and vomited to the point of dry heaving. I slowly drank water with electrolytes.  At around 6pm Monday, I am finally starting feel normal again and made a meal of eggs and bacon with toast and felt fine afterward. I have had no other symptoms since that day.

                                                SEVERE chills approximately 13-14 hours after receiving vaccine. Even after turning heat up in the house and wrapping myself in two comforters, I was still experiencing severe chills. These chills lasted for approximately 5-6 hours. I was unable to sleep due to them. I did not have a fever, as I checked my temperature several times during this episode. At approximately 6:00 am on the same day as experiencing the chills, I experienced abdominal pains, which lasted approximately 1 hour and resolved on their own.

When I sat at my computer and started to work my headache got worse and worse like a very bad migraine.  I went outside and the headache subsided.  When I went back to my desk my headache got worse again. I then tried to go to Urgent care but was refused because of possible Covid symptoms. I had to go to Covid Hot zone in our Emergency Room. They released me from work for 2-3 days.  When I came back to work my headache was much more milder and I could handle the slight pain..

                                                Post shot developed the following within hours:  head congestion, dizziness, nausea, brain fogginess, phlegm in my heart, headache, inability to fully concentrate to typical ability, major soreness in arm receiving shot, soreness developed in arm that didn&#39;t receive the shot with intermittent shooting pain at opposite arm shot sight as if being stabbed with a knife.  Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

Left arm swelled up to the size of a goose egg and I was unable to lift my left arm from my left side.  Low grade fever, body aches, eyes looked sunken in, felt exhausted. I felt like I had the flu. I missed three days of work after the second dose.    I took ibuprofen and iced the left arm and rested.  I never had a reaction to the influenza vaccination in forty years.  The first dose, I did not miss work. And the side effects went away the next day.

                                                Patient had moderna covid vaccine last week. Initially he had normal post vaccine effects - soreness in the upper arm, fatigue. Over the weekend those symptoms were practically gone. Then he developed severe pain in the arm at the site of the injection followed by nausea and sweats. He is soaking thru his clothes. Not eating much. No fever, cough, sob. Just feels bad.

                                                Had vaccine and had a red spot and sore arm which went away after a couple days. Four days after the vaccine a blood vessel in my hand burst (I don&#39;t recall hitting it on anything at all). It puffed up about a centimeter and slowly went away over a few days. Then a little more than a week later the red spot came back and itched very badly and was sore again. It also faded after several days. then yesterday morning I woke up and my arm was sore at the injection site again only I started having the worst headache of my life that lasted 30 hours. I started shaking, sweating massively, I felt hot and cold at the same time, felt as if I had a very high fever but my temperature was 98.4 (totally normal). I was vomiting if I tried to eat or drink. I had severe body aches and EXTREME weakness throughout my body. My heart began to race at 150-160 bpm for several hours and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It has gotten about 50%  better in the past few hours and will hopefully continue that way. I&#39;ve never felt anything like it in my life. I need to know if it is safe for me to get the second shot.

These bouts of increased irritability were intermittent and lasting for several days, including currently still experiencing 2 wk later.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

                                                At 4:30am on Sunday early morning, 3/7/2021, roughly 42 hours after receiving my 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine,  I was awoken out of sound sleep by a light coughing as something was in my throat.  Upon waking, I realized that it was blood that was from a fairly significant bloody nose that I was having.  Even though I used facial tissues to deal with the bleed, it took nearly 25 minutes or so to subside as it was quite severe.  The situation is/was HIGHLY unusual as I haven&#39;t had a bloody nose for at least a decade (or perhaps even 2 decades) and when I earlier did, I was usually able to deal with it and get it to stop within a minute or two.  In this case, the bleed was significant, flowing quite heavily, when standing straight up (with blood dripping out of my nose) and even when lying in a prone position, wouldn&#39;t stop for 25 minutes.  Additionally, in my life, I have never had a bloody nose be the source of being woken out of a sound sleep.

                                                I don&#39;t think that my reaction to the vaccine is super serious but it is perhaps worth noting if others are also experiencing similar symptoms. On the second day, I did have the expected arm soreness around the injection area on my right arm. That soreness faded by Saturday morning. However, on Saturday afternoon, I began experiencing some intermittent pain in my left kidney. I have had a few (3?) kidney stones since I was approximately 35 years old so it is a pain that I recognize almost immediately.  I kept my spider senses awake to see where it was going to go. About an hour later, I had intermittent &#34;flu like&#34; pain in my arms and legs. I had been up on a ladder painting a wall and I became a bit dizzy and decided to halt the painting project. The rest of the evening was kind of crappy. Intermittent headaches, leg pain, arm pain and left kidney pain. I took 1 Alleve tablet around 8pm. It didn&#39;t seem to do much. I took a second one about an hour later (according to the instructions you can take two for you first dose) and that seemed to do the trick! I slept like a rock and so far today, all of the pain is gone including the pain in my left kidney.  I have not taken any more Alleve besides the two that I took last night. Also, as of right now (2:44pm on Sunday 3/21), no kidney stone has passed. I have been urinating into a cup to see if one comes out. I cannot 100% say that any of these symptoms are related to the vaccine. However, being a Type 1 diabetic (since 1978) and the unusual kidney pain made me go, &#34;huh.&#34; That is why I am providing this info in the event that there are others who are experiencing similar symptoms that can be tied to the vaccine and what to expect. I feel completely fine now. Yay. :)

Next morning still experiencing fatigue, muscle aches, joint aches and runny nose. Took more Tylenol, by mid-day felt better but by about 4pm fatigue, aches returned and also slight head ache.

When that pain subsided during the second day after the shot, I started to get some swelling and pain in my left armpit. Discomfort was such that it interfered with my ability to sleep through that night. The following day (Day 3 after injection) the discomfort mostly subsided but still has not completely gone away. Currently on Day 6 after injection. No treatments or medications have been applied to alleviate the issue.

                                                After I got the shot, on the way home, I started feeling tingling on tongue and lips; had a metallic taste. I felt like I had allergies - I was a little congested - but the next morning, 04:00 am -  I was still congested - and was still breathing short and shallow. I get to work and I&#39;m open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn&#39;t palpate and feel it but just couldn&#39;t access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn&#39;t think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn&#39;t work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn&#39;t talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe. I drove by the clinic where I was got my vaccine and decided to go in - I was so dizzy and I realized I shouldn&#39;t be driving. They told me to get up and move and I told them I couldn&#39;t breathe and I&#39;m not one to say that but they called an ambulance that took me ER. (I was a LPN at one time so I wasn&#39;t anxious.)  And they told me it was anxiety - and they kept telling me to breathe. But it wasn&#39;t an anxiety attack at all. My heartrate was normal. I was shallow breathing. They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That&#39;s it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn&#39;t want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm. Second vaccine - felt flu like symptoms for three days after. I still feel a little weird - my bones hurt and I&#39;m achy. Just not feeling right. Note: When I was in the emergency room - my hands were purple. Circulation was weird.They told me my oxygen levels were fine and that I just needed to breathe. It caused carpal tunnel in my wrist - I had nerve damage on that about three weeks - I have about 80 percent nerve damage from previous and so when something irritates it  - it takes a while to recover from it but I have.  I consulted with a doctor about the reaction to first vaccine before getting the second vaccine.

Symptoms lasted until 6PM the next day. fever went back to normal around 4pm next day after shot.   * I NEVER had a fever when I had covid.   I had an Antibody test completed back in January. It was positive for Antibodies.  I had an antibody test back in 2020 BEFORE I had covid. It was negative.  A week late after 1st does of vaccine. My heartrate started to increase and had symptoms of Afib again. same symptoms of the Afib and heartrate and breathing, back after I had covid. Exact same feelings and symptoms.  The Afib/heart symptoms, stopped last week.   I am supposed to get 2nd dose this Thursday, and I am most likely not going to. I don&#39;t want the heart rate to increase again. I am having problems making an appointment to ask my doctor. My PCM changed, so it is all confusing and a pain.   Its best I just don&#39;t it.  I had antibodies as of january. I just had the 1st dose last month. I think I am god to go. Not worth the risk for me. I am sick of having covid symptoms, so why force it upon myself again....

The next morning had an incredible cold chill as soon as air hit him, bone shaking.  Then had cold chills/sweating with soaking of his groin area.  He can go to sleep with extreme chills and then wake up in a puddle of sweat.  He had a headache at first, took Tylenol and it went away.   Numbness in his foot like it&#39;s falling asleep, left hip hurting, left wrist pain.  Today both calves hurt./sore like workout burning pain.  Two days ago his father went to have bypass and was at the hospital with him, and walked painfully in but had difficulty hobbling along and was unable to walk back to his truck and had to borrow his dad&#39;s cane to be able to walk.  Yesterday he was going to cut the grass, knelt down to do something, and when trying to stand up was not able to walk due to the throbbing pain and had to use the cane again.  Also having swollen left ankle with discoloration.  The calf pain is extreme and throbbing, and the pain when he&#39;s not able to walk is in the calf.  The ankle has been swollen since Sunday, 4/18/21.  He spoke with the ICU nurse in the hospital and he told her about it and she grabbed his ankle and asked if he was sure he didn&#39;t have a blood clot.  He has not been able to shake the symptoms.  The issues with walking are intermittent, some days he can walk fine, the other days he has to use the cane.    He still continues with every day hot sweats/cold chills.  It&#39;s 74 where he is right now and has a sweatshirt on as he is cold.  Also the legs hurting, ankle swelling that he ices down at night but the swelling does not go away.  Feels like a hard knot in his ankle.   He has not sought any treatment for this at this point.

                                                Apart from expected side effects I&#39;d read about (fever, chills, insomnia, fatigue-absolutely all of which I experienced after the second shot), what I&#39;m actually reaching out to report is that both my first and second vaccines were followed by a few days of experiencing mild Lymphocytic Colitis symptoms. Typically I&#39;m only triggered by taking NSAIDs or consuming the grains that are associated with Celaic Disease. The symptoms I experienced were diarrhea accompanied by some gastric discomfort and bathroom urgency. The symptoms were not worst I&#39;ve ever had them, but they did last a few days.

                                                First dose on 3/5/2021 received with minor issues of slight pain in injection site later, but also some tingling in injection site. SECOND DOSE on 4/2/2021 was a different story.  About 15 hours later at 3:00 am I woke up with 100.5 fever, SEVERE pain at injection site (like someone had punched me in the arm and bruised my arm), and SEVERE level 9 (out of 10) pain in all joints in my hand and two big toes.  Fibromyalgia muscular pain SEVERE level 9.  Headache, SEVERE fatigue - could not get out of bed very well.  SEVERE brain fog - I could barely think logically.  I tried taking 50mg full spectrum CBD oil to avoid taking an NSAID (I was concerned it would affect proper immune response).  At 6:29 am the fever was lower, but I could no longer take the pain, so I took 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil).  4-6 hours later took another 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil) and stayed in bed and slept several times that day.  For the next two days the severe brain fog and severe fatigue remained.  I continued to take 400mg Advil as needed.  The brain fog was so severe that if I picked up my keys (or any other object), I would immediately ?lose? them and not know where they were because I had placed them somewhere else and could not remember anything.  I stayed home for at least 72 hours due to the fatigue and the fear of driving and possibly getting in an accident.  It seems the high severity of the issues lasted 72 hours, but all of the above reported issues continued for several weeks at a lower severity - with fatigue being the worst - requiring one or two naps per day.  As of today, April 29, there is still slight pain in all hand joints and some fatigue, but there seems to be gum issues (hurting) since about April 26th.  I am brushing my teeth lightly, using ?Smart Mouth? zinc oral rinse, and sucking/chewing on a whole clove every once in a while for pain relief and for the anti-biotic properties.  I did not contact my physician because I read online that people with Fibromyalgia have worse side effects and I figured the effects would subside over time.  I have an upcoming appointment with my doctor on May 26, 2021 at which time I will report these side effects and my strong concern about any future booster shots and the severe side effects I may encounter.

This graduated to constant dizziness and cloudiness and severe shaking while outdoors.   Arrived at ER at about 10am  and &#34;room spinning&#34; vertigo began shortly after and at about 11am there was about 5 episodes of severe vomiting over about a 2 hour period.  Dizziness did not decrease until enough medication was administered to stop the vomiting and allow a dose of Meclizine 25mg PO to be administered and take effect and decrease the dizziness to barely manageable.  Left the hospital in this state at about 6PM.  Today is 4 days later and dizziness continues as manageable only with Meclizine 25mg every 8 hours.

This lasted into the weekend where I developed a severe headache for about 24 hours. After the headache subsided I continued to be fatigued with no appetite and dizziness. I&#39;m unable to be upright for long and am extremely restless at night. I can&#39;t sleep longer than a few hours before I wake up with my body feeling anxious.  This is day 8 and I&#39;m still weak and incredibly dizzy struggling to sleep at night.

                                                Starting on the day of the vaccine (2nd dose), I noticed typical sore arm.  At 7pm, had a fever, nausea, ful body pain, and flu-like symptoms. I did take ibuprofen and Benadryl a few hours later around bedtime.  I woke up with  fatigue, lethargy and Covid fog (decrease mental acuity and lethargic).   I had symptoms for 4 days and symptoms started to improve.  I noticed my heart rate increased at 120 and would only decrease if I lay down.  I went to see a doctor who diagnosed me with POTS (posterial orthostatic tachycardia syndrome).   I was prescribed metroprolol 25mg once a day.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

The first dose was much milder but lasted 6 days.  This second dose seems much worse and am expecting it to last several days more.

The chills lasted about 4 hours. About 36 hours after receiving the vaccine, I noticed swelling of my lymph nodes under my left arm.  (scale of 1-5, 5 being the worst, it was a 4) It is about the size of tennis ball, it is causing discomfort and hard to sleep. It is painful.  The flushing, headache and chills all went away.

I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

I took the 3rd and 4th off but went back to work on 5th although I was sluggish. Felt a lot better on Saturday.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

Around Feb 12, I had some pain in my left nostril and over the course of a week or so it swelled and became very red and painful. I contacted my doctor by phone on Feb 19 and she prescribed Kephlex, Feb 20 I went to Urgent Care and they said I had cellulitis on my nose. They prescribed Augmentin and took a culture. Feb 21, I went to the Emergency because it was not getting any better, they prescribed Bactrim and sent me home. I missed two days of work and felt miserable for over a week. My nose still hurts today.

Patient was breathing but unresponsive, stiff, and unable to blink, talk, or move for around 2-3 minutes.  Once the seizure ended I asked patient if he had a history of seizures, his answer was, &#34;not really&#34;. He drank some of the water and sat with the ice pack for a couple minutes and said he felt better. Color returned. Patient stated he felt nerves contributed more than anything and was feeling 100% better when he left. We had dialed 911 while patient was unresponsive but once he was able to talk again he declined 911 and stated feeling much better.

                                                At about 8:00 pm I started having chills. I felt cold and it kept getting worse. By about midnight I was shaking uncontrollably. I had heated the room to about 80 degrees and was in bed under several blankets but still felt like I was freezing. This lasted until about 3 am when I finally fell asleep. I had to work noon to 8 pm on the 12th. I was exhausted, tired and cold (even though bundled up with sweater and coat) the entire day. About 10 pm I got the shakes again, but they were very mild. I still felt cold and couldn&#39;t sleep well. I felt like I had a hangover the entire day even though I have not had a hangover in 20 years.

I describe it as suffering some sort of trauma and it was accompanied by crushing fatigue.   Symptoms have improved but persist until today 03/29/2021: knee pain, weakness in the knees and fatigue.   Difficulty functioning normally: walking, ascending &amp; descending stairs and simply standing in place.   Symptoms worsen at night, knees become frozen and have to be adjusted with hands.

                                                headache and body aches night of shot. Took one acetaminophen before bed at 10:00pm.  Bad night of sleep.  Woke up next day with headache, body ache and blurry peripheral vision issue with right eye. Took another acetaminophen and slept more.  By the 8pm on Thursday the headache and body aches were gone.  Eye issue continued. Applied saline drops to the eyes over the weekend.  No change. Monday morning placed a call to Ophthalmology.  Dr. saw me that day.  He said the eyes looked healthy.  Thought it could be inflammation in the eye muscles.  Suggest taking Aleve for 2 days and come back on Wednesday (4/7/21). No change in blurred vision. Suggested I get in touch with my primary doctors office.  Saw the NP today.  He is prescribing a steroid.

                                                Diarrhea about 6 hours after vaccination.  Feeling off much of the rest of the day.  Fever started about 15 hours after vaccination with chills and shaking followed by sweating.  Used Ibuprofen to bring fever down and it would break after a couple hours.  Then took Tylenol hours later in the morning to try to ward off the fever.  Fever returned when these wore off.  Had fever again yesterday afternoon and last night - again taking Ibuprofen to break the fever both times and Tylenol in the morning to try to head off the fevers.  Sluggish feeling and lots of body aches.  Not as bad as the actual COVID disease probably but reminiscent of those symptoms except not getting the coughing I had when I had COVID in October (I was sick for 3 weeks when I had it with fever over 2 weeks solid).

                                                I had a stinging sensation after the Moderna shot, like a bee sting.  I woke up two weeks ago and my arm felt like someone punched it really hard, like a Charley horse.  My arm went numb, fingers are tingling, and at the site of injection it still feels like a Charley horse. I couldn?t sleep for three days and family started getting worried. My brother took me to Urgent Care this last Sunday. The doctor at Urgent Care told me it looked like a nerve issue, prescribed me Gabapentin and told me to do a follow up with my doctor. I saw my doctor on Wednesday and he suggested I report my symptoms because he is going through something similar. He prescribed me a stronger dose of Gabapentin and I?m waiting to see a neurologist. I have been missing a lot of work and I wish I never got the shot.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the vaccine, while driving home, my chest area started to feel very warm, then I started to have difficulty breathing.  I was unable to swallow for the first minute or so, then my upper and lower lip got numb. After I was able to swallow   my saliva tasted metallic and a mental fog settled in.  I had difficulty concentrating for the next 2-3 minutes.  All symptoms lasted for  about 5 minutes.  About a week later I developed a skin rash reminiscent to a &#34;zoster.&#34;   It was the size of my palm on my left thigh. Although is almost clear now, the affected skin area lost some sensitivity. Another subcutaneous inflammation persist to present day.

                                                State opened Covid vaccines to 50 and over on Mon, March 22. I immediately scheduled my appointment for a first shot at a Dept of Health site near me for Wed, March 24. I had no immediate negative side effects. When I woke on Fri, March 26 and commenced my day of remote work from home, I noticed my left eye vision was blurry. I proceeded to work that day and continued my normal activities into the weekend assuming my vision would self-correct. By Sunday, March 26, my left eye vision was still noticeably problematic so I scheduled to see an optometrist whom I had seen before. I saw him at 12:15pm on Tues, March 30. After running numerous vision tests, optometrist let me know my vision loss in the left eye seemed to be the result of a stroke that had cut blood flow in the optic nerve and damaged my vision in the lower portions of the left eye. The center and upper portions of my left eye were generally unaffected at that time. He suggested I see my primary care physician to check for vitals, such as blood pressure and do other blood work, and more importantly see a neuro ophthalmologist urgently.   The next morning, Wed, March 31 I saw my PCP, who informed me my blood pressure was normal, requested blood work, and gave me a prescription for an MRI of my brain, with and without contrast. I am 6&#39;2&#34; and I weighed at 239, about where it has been for most of last 15 years. I also complained of pain and stiffness in my front right thigh and lower right back. She said if I didn&#39;t get an appointment to see a neuro ophthalmologist that same afternoon, she recommended I go to an ER. With the help of Optometrist&#39;s office, I was able to get an appointment that day with Dr., neuro ophthalmologist at 2:15pm on Wed, March 31. His office repeated numerous vision tests and confirmed the left eye vision loss (essentially the lower half excluding the center) and diagnosed it as a NAION - non arthritic ischemic optic neuropathy. With this diagnosis, there was no treatment, and I scheduled a follow-up for May 12. He said that my optic nerve into my left eye would slowly reduce its swelling over the next 6 to 8 weeks and in that time, my vision could remain the same, or improve. At that point, I didn&#39;t think it would worsen, but sadly that later happened. In addition to the the first MRI that PCP prescribed, Neuro ophthalmologist prescribed a second MRI of orbits, with and without contrast. He also suggested I begin taking a low dose Aspirin daily, which I did.   The next week, the blood work revealed a very slightly elevated cholesterol reading. I was told by my PCP on April 5 that this would normally not be considered as a problematic level of high cholesterol, but should be improved or lowered. The blood tests taken at Lab on Fri, April 2 revealed a LDL Chol, Calculated as 111, whereby &lt;100 was considered desirable range. Other than that, there was nothing of concern in my blood work. The two MRIs were done on April 9 and April 20, and did not reveal findings which doctors felt would have impacted my optic nerve swelling or had caused the eye stroke. Out of precaution, I scheduled to see a cardiologist on Tues, April 13. She recommended I start taking Crestor for cholesterol, and do a series of tests which I completed on Friday, April 23 - echocardiogram; holter monitor; transesophageal echocardiogram; and ultrasound carotid bilateral. As of today, Mon, April 26 I do not know the results of the cardio work-up, but both neuro ophthalmologists I saw felt that a problem related to my heart would not have caused this stroke in my eye.   Finally, on Fri, April 23 I had a consultation with a second highly recommended neuro ophthalmologist. After a series of vision tests, she agreed with other doctor&#39;s diagnosis of NAION - non arthritic ischemic optic neuropathy. She also said there was nothing I could do to treat except wait for the next 4 or more weeks for the optic nerve swelling to go down. She also confirmed my fear which was that my left eye vision had worsened since March 31 as my vision loss was no longer limited to the lower portion of my left eye, but now included blind spots throughout the upper range of my left eye vision, making my loss of peripheral vision worse and more widespread. She said in some cases with NAION, a patient&#39;s vision could remain the same, could improve or could worsen in the 6 to 8 weeks after the event. Four weeks after the March 26 event, by April 23 my left eye vision had worsened. I still hold out hope that it can improve some in the next four weeks... My right eye vision was not affected in any way, although one risk of NAION is that there is a 20% (?) chance it may recur in the next 5 years, and if it does, it most commonly affects the other, good eye.   None of the doctors I saw directly attributed my vision loss to the Moderna vaccine taken on March 24; however, there has also not been a clear cause determined by my doctors. While most of the doctors I saw seemed to think it coincidental, none also was able to absolutely rule it out either as a cause or a trigger. Dr. suggested I follow through with this idea, which other medical professionals suggested, to submit this vaccine adverse event report. Without a doubt, this was an adverse effect and/or problem that occurred soon after (36 hours approximately) taking the first dose of the Moderna vaccine.

The fever went from under 100 degrees to 103 during the night and the dreams were bizarre. The 103 degree fever persisted until the afternoon of April 24, 2021. It was accompanied by a terrible headache that ended when the fever broke. There has been a lack of memory recall. I attributed this to the fever at first, but it is April 27th, 2021 and I am still having trouble with mental focus. It is not debilitating, but it is impairing  my ability to function normally.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose, I spiked a fever of 101, felt body aches and chills. This lasted for about 1 day. On day 3, I woke with stiff, achy and sore joints in my right hand. On day 4, these symptoms remained in my right hand and moved to my left. Over the next week, stiff joints moved into my toes. EXTREME FATIGUE and mental fogginess also developed as did blood pressure spikes. On week 2, move joints started aching including knees, elbows and shoulder. On week 3, my fingers were so sore and stiff it became difficult to use door knobs. I contacted a virtual doctor to ask for direction. He assumed in was side effects and prescribed me Diclofenance Sodium 75 mg for pain. Two days later, I went to the emergency room as the pain, fatigue and fogginess was becoming very concerning. On week 4, I was finally able to see my family doctor. He assumes it is a overactive immune response to the vaccine and prescribe Prednisone 20 mg to overcome the symptoms. The course of Prednisone has decress the severity of my symptoms but on week 5 I continue to have stiff, painful joints, mental fogginess.

                                                The evening of 1/11/21 - pain at the injection site and feeling of fatigue - went to bed very early.  Arm pain a bit less next day - felt a little tired all day. Back to &#34;normal&#34; on the 13th.   I am not sure if the following symptoms are related to the vaccine but I feel like I should report them if there may be a link.  1/17/21 -Awoke in the morning with severe neck pain - muscles &#34;locked up.&#34;  Called the doctor - he prescribed Tramadol and Cyclobenzaprine - I took these for two days before my neck calmed back down and I could function &#34;normally&#34; again.  1/28/21 - Started feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; and tired late in the day while still at work.  Went home and went to bed early.  1/29/21 - Felt same as last PM upon waking up.  Felt much better by mid-morning.  Started feeling bad again later in the day.  Felt cold - but no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  1/30/21 - Felt bad all day.  Felt cold - no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  AM - felt anxious, worried, confused.  Built a fire in the fireplace and heat made me feel better. Felt hot-cold-hot-cold- all day.  My neck ached all day.  Sensitive to sounds. Took a single cyclobenzaprine late in the day - seemed to help. Went to bed early.  1/31/21 - Woke up with very sore deltoid muscle at the site of COVID-19 injection. Very hard to lift arm above head.  Hips, back, and neck muscles ache.  Calf muscles feel almost like they are about to cramp.  Mental state better than yesterday. Still sound sensitive. Not as cold feeling as in days prior.  Yoga seems to help.

                                                Afew hours after receiving the inoculation, I was extremely sleepy.   I was sleeping at my job, and my boss had me go home early.  I went to work the next day, however I was feeling weird, my sense of smell and taste were off, as the day continued I started having a headache, body aches, and general malaise.  I went home early, again from work.  But when I arrived to my residence I was having severe chills despite my efforts to try to keep myself warm.  The chills lasted for more than 24hrs, preventing me from sleeping, my body aches were getting worse, my eyes were extremely red, and I did not feel like eating.  Near the end of the day, the chills became sweats, and I was trying to balance between being hot and clammy, to chills.  The next day I paid a visit to my primary care doctor.  I was tested for covid - which was negative, I was tested for the flu - which was negative, and my lungs were clear so there was no reason for my doctor to believe I have a pneumonia.

Day 2: Next morning was difficult getting out of bed. Skin was very sensitive to warm/hot shower water. Achy joints all over. Even my left injection site was sore even though I was injected on the right side. Fatigue at work. I was very wide eyed as described by co-worker. I was a little loopy as I was very giggly and things made me laugh way more than usual. I may have been a little delirious but I was able to work. This lasted until I went to bed. Day 3: When I awoke I felt like a fever had broke, Cooling sweat, but my temp was never over 98.5 degrees. My normal morning temp is usually 97.3 every day, but that one degree made a difference. I feel normal today and realize I was not well the day before.

I advised him to go to er/call dr if unable to drink, develops high fever/numbness/tingling/loss of motion, etc.  Followed up today. pt is still very nauseated but has developed a full-on  migraine headache.  He went to the ER last night, and was not found to be dehydrated &amp; labs were not unusual.  he was given injection of nausea medicine, and rxs for zofran and norco, but had not taken any today... using pepto bismol instead.  I advised he take the zofran routinely until the nausea subsides and the norco for the headache  &amp; if not improved in a couple days to go see his dr.

                                                No reaction to first shot. Received the second shot the morning of 18 Feb, noticed some minor joint stiffness, minor pain and tiredness mid morning 19 Feb. Laid down at 16:30 and remained asleep until 0530 the next day. Unusual to sleep 13 hours. Later that weekend I noticed a bruise on my leg. I rarely bruise and had not hit my leg on anything. I ignored the bruise a couple weeks, but as it did not heal, continued to hurt and had swelling I went to my primary doctor on 4 March who thought it was a blood clot and sent me for imaging. They determined it was superficial thrombophlebitis and treated with antibiotics and heat.

I started feeling better around 2:30 AM on March 17.  I went to work that morning at 8:30 and had to leave work at 10 AM due to feeling worse.  I went home and laid down the rest of the day, taking Tylenol and drinking an electrolyte drink.  I had chills, but not nearly as bad the the night before.  I started feeling better around 6PM that evening.  The next day, I felt fine with the exception of an almost total loss of appetite.   I did not feel fully back to normal until Friday morning.  I do not regret getting the shot, but found this reporting tool and thought it would be a good idea to submit my experience.

This was followed by a mixed mood state of high energy/little sleep and dysphoria. This ended on 4/1/2021. Also during this period: episodes of brain fog and attention deficit; an episode of pain in all ligaments/tendons without any proximate cause; episodes of hot flashes in the afternoons.

The by 6pm i was running a fever of 101.2 until 10:30 pm.  Fever finally broke around midnight.  Did not sleep because of the headache and aches and pains which lasted all day Sunday the 11th.  I did sleep better Sunday night and woke up felling better this morning.  Lungs are still not feeling the best.  I did take ibuprofen periodically during the time I was feeling bad.

After going to sleep early in the afternoon I woke up light headed. I spent the weekend having trouble breathing. On Monday I used a sick day because of shallow breathing. Tuesday my light headedness went away but I was having trouble with my bowels.  That may have been due to snacking on cashews though. Tuesday night I ate some watermelon and drank two 32 ounce bottles of gatorade and I feel a lot better today. Breathing is still shallow but nowhere near what it was. It is back to being indicative of my morbid obesity

I seemed fine after, and shrugged it off as I sometimes experience this on a rare occasion. Thought it was my anxiety from all the drama hearing about side effects. They kept me for 40 minutes and asked me a few questions and felt that I looked and acted normal.  My ride home, my vision seemed &#34;off&#34; and again, I shrugged it off to anxiety.  I also had light heart palpitations.  I get these sometime when I&#39;m stressed, overly tired, too much coffee, or have anxiety.  I wasn&#39;t dizzy at all, but my balance felt a tad &#34;off&#34;  I was much better in the morning and back to normal within about 24hrs.   I am worried about geting my 2nd shot as I read people being dizzy and with super high blood pressures......  Hoping these &#34;symptoms&#34; were just from myself getting worked up about..... possible side effects and allergic reactions.

Pulse rate and blood pressure also increased.  On the worst night, April 20, pulse was 105, blood pressure was 150 over 110.  Patient also experienced extreme chills, sweating, and hallucinations.  The following day the entire body was sore and ached.  The following days the symptoms subsided but have yet to completely go away.  The other aspect is that these symptoms were not as bad in the day time as they were overnight.  The symptoms came in waves.

With in 15 minutes he had 2 waves of this reaction. The 3rd wave started about 20 minutes after shot and he said it was worse, tingly in both hands , funny feeling like he was going to faint , cold and felt like his pulse rate was up . He never fainted. He kept talking to me. Since the 3rd wave  was worse and it lasted the longest, we call 911. They came and checked him out, but he declined to go with them to the hospital. He waited in the store for at least 1 hour. Checked on him at home at 3:05p.m. and he said he felt fine.

                                                I had a really bad day after the second dose. Horrible migraine headache that built as the day moved on.  As a rule, I do not get migraines and whenever I have gotten a headache I&#39;ve not had a  sensitivity to light or sound, like I did yesterday.  It was just miserable. Lots of body ache and a generalized feeling of sickness, similar to influenza or food poisoning.  I had no energy.   My arm at the injection site hurt constantly without even being touched all day and I could not sleep on my left side due to arm pain around the injection site. The arm pain from the injection site, occasionally radiated to my elbow joint , depending on how I moved my arm.  It is still sensitive today, two days later, and has a sensitive swelling in the area where the injection occurred. I do not feel bad today, but I do feel like I am 100% yet, either, but I feel a LOT better than I did yesterday.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

Left arm at injection site sore.  Details:  approximately 1 am I woke up with chills, headache, earache and tiredness.    I took Tylenol and this continued waking up again a few hours later the same.   Eventually I felt very hot.   Upon waking again tired/fatigue, headache, earache.   At approximately 11:30 am I got out of bed,  shaky &amp; very tired.   I eventually felt better, just tired.   (With exception of Arm still hurting).    Please note I had Covid in December and had similar symptoms, except these all hit me at the same time and felt much worse then when I had Covid.

Immediately, the injection site was sore, but after 24 hours I experienced body aches, headache, fever, light-headedness, and a lack of balance.  These symptoms persisted for approximately 48 hours.

Very loud ringing in the head.  The ringing has been so loud that kept me up one complete night with no sleep and hard to sleep since then. I have gone to the family doctor end my ENT specialist. I wear hearing aids and have seen the ENT before. Hoping they could tell me why this has suddenly gotten so much worse. This has been going on  over 3 weeks now. I never thought it could be related to the vaccine and may not even be. Just too coincidental that immediate issues shortly after vaccination. I just want officially report in hopes of gathering data and possibly helping others.

                                                Three days after receiving my first dose of Moderna, I noticed this loud noise and sensation from what appeared to be coming from my left ear and head.  Coincidentally,  I received my vaccine shot on my left shoulder, and my left ear is effected. I made an appointment to see my ENT Doctor three days later to be told that my hearing test came back normal, but I had tinnitus. I have never experienced this before, and wanted to report  it because it did not occur  until I had my first vaccine shot. I am now 16-days in after my first shot, and the sound has not eased up, but has gotten worst and is continuous 24/7. I cannot sleep with the constant buzzing and humming in my ear, and I am unable to concentrate.

I still feel very tired and sore and I&#39;m seriously concerned about the second dose. I need the advice to know if I should avoid it? Should I go for an anti-bodies test?

Since April 4th until today April 17th the chest pains continue.  They get much worse when I lay down, so I have to sleep in a chair to lower the pain. Even while sleeping in a chair the pain comes and goes all night long.

                                                TWO lower GI tract infections, each one about two weeks after a vaccine shot. Other worries are confusion and bp oscillation.  DETAILS: 1st dose only minor flu like symptoms then 14 days in, big GI tract infection tennis ball size in lower GI followed by UTI and Colo-rectal infections. Gas and no stool passing.   2nd dose down  24-72 hrs later with serious chills and internal fever in main body cavity. Slept it off and hydrated. Then consistent flu like symptoms but stronger and longer than 1st shot. Increasing confusion and maybe dementia? Some 3-D visual dreams too?  lots of inflamation feel in body wherever old injuries were. Also blood pressure going high and low even though I cross checked with both electronic wrist version, and mechanical armband version of bp monitors. Consistent frontal lobe head pressure, bp oscillation, and flu like feelings (upset stomach, change in urine and stool color, wooziness, chills, etc.). Thank goodness for coffee! It helps clear up my mind a bit.  Then again, 14 days beyond second shot roughly, and the only reason I filed the report, another lower GI tract infection. This time I hit it right away with potassium penicillin 800 mg. This worked the first time too. Just an FYI in case others are showing  GI tract version/issues. I believe this was a secondary form of Covid symptoms in early Chinese data if that can be trusted.   Still not in good shape but it sounds like second shot causes more issues. I will probably schedule general checkup with my doctor if I dont get better in a week or so.

                                                I tested positive for covid on 1/08/21. I had the Moderna vaccine 1st dose 4/12/21 at 8:30am. No significant immediate reaction to the vaccine. Pain worsened at the injection point, but never significant, slight headache, tired, mild flu symptoms grew through the day. At 9:30PM I experienced Fever(101.6 at around midnight after fever had broke was probably higher between 9:30PM and 11:30pm). I experienced chills and violent shaking from approximately 9:30pm to 11:30pm, as bad or worse then the original covid from January. I was unable to sleep and finally took 2 Advil 200mg each at 3:00am. Advil helped and eventually fell asleep around 3:30am. Online information suggests that the 2nd dose generally has more severe reactions. I am concerned how much worse it will be and considering not getting the 2nd dose scheduled for May 10. Tuesday April 13 I experienced slight headache, body aches and exhaustion in the afternoon. Took Nyquil  severe cold and flu Tuesday evening and sleep well. Wednesday experienced lesser symptoms. Thursday had lower back and kidney area soreness. Friday april 15 back to normal.

                                                Approximately 48 hours after my second Moderna Vaccine I started experiencing breathing difficulty and shortness of breath. After 58 hours was admitted to emergency room but CT scan of lungs and heart normal. Breathing difficulty continued 24 hours a day until 8 days later in which the breathing difficulty became worse and increased light-headedness occurred On 4/13. A second trip to emergency room happened on 4/13 another CT scan of lungs and heart normal. Breathing difficuly continued until On April 24th I collapsed and blacked out while out for a walk. Was admitted to emergency room on the 24th and remained hospitalized with brain fog, light-headedness, breathing difficulty and sharp pain in right side of chest. Ecco cardio gram test negative. Breathing difficulty, lightleadedness and chest pain have all been steadily increasing since 48 hours after the 2nd Moderna vaccine shot. To date, still no answer as to why this is happening and getting worse.

He went out side for a little bit, his body temperature was still hot without chills and this lasted for 3 days and night. I talked to the pharmacist and he recommended Ibuprofen and I gave it to him for two days but he kept the fever. He started shaking and by the 5th day I took him to the clinic and both his eyes were red and hands and feet were hot. I was told to take him home because all vital signs were ok, but I took him back to the ER on day 8 because he was not getting better, they said he had multi organ issues and now he&#39;s confused and he doesn&#39;t know who I am or where he is and cannot remember and confused. He is now on dialysis and he was on life support, he was never hospitalized or taken prescription drugs and now he&#39;s in this condition. He is still in ICU and his body looks so weird.  He don&#39;t remember words or when I talk to him.

                                                Patient manifested with flu-like symptoms (myalgias, fatigue, cough, abdominal discomfort, shortness of breath) with high-grade fevers (TMax 103F) approximately 4-6 hours following administration of 2nd Moderna vaccine on 5/4/2021 per patient&#39;s wife. The symptoms progressively worsened to the point that he presented to an outside hospital on 5/12/2021 at which time he was found to be tachycardic and febrile (T 103.1F). Labs at that time were notable for significant thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, elevated lactate, elevated procalcitonin. Chest imaging showed bilateral airspace disease. CT of the abdomen noted hepatosplenomegaly with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function. He was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Labs on 5/13/2021 were notable for a markedly elevated ferritin level, fasting hypertriglyceridemia, elevated CRP, elevated transaminase levels, hyperbilirubinemia, markedly elevated CXCL-9 level, markedly elevated IL-18 level, normal natural killer cell function. Of note, while his blood and urine cultures were negative, he was found to have elevated EBV viral load on peripheral blood draw. He had a bone marrow biopsy which reportedly showed rare evidence of cells with what appeared to be erythrocytes within their cytoplasm, concerning for HLH.  Given strong clinical and serological suspicion for HLH, he was transferred to our hospital for a higher level of care. Upon transfer to our facility on 5/18/2021, his inflammatory markers were persistently elevated. He unfortunately developed worsened renal and respiratory failure, and required both hemodialysis and intubation respectively. He was continued on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, however we additionally initiated high-dose steroids as well as anakinra for treatment of HLH. Given EBV viremia, we also began rituximab therapy. He was successfully extubated, however as of 5/26/2021 remains dialysis-dependent with continued improvement in urinary output. His post-intubation course has been complicated by encephalopathy of unknown etiology. We have consulted infectious disease to proceed with a diagnostic lumbar puncture to ascertain potential CNS pathogens explaining the cause of his altered mental status. MRI of the brain showed no evidence of pathology. CNS involvement by HLH remains on our differential.

                                                The following is an email the patient wrote to us describing his events:  I received Moderna Covid Vaccine on January 4, 2021 and February 1, 2021 at Medical Center in  On the evening of January 12, 2021, I arrived home from working as a Pharmacist following a 13 hour shift at Medical Center with no medical complaints.  Later that night I experienced a severe coughing, sneezing episode where I was gagging on the mucous. I spit out a bunch of stuff and did a nasal rinse. I took some cold medicine like Certrizine and Mucinex-D.  Simultaneously with the coughing episode I developed a tingling sensation on the right side of my body from my neck to my toes. I also noticed that my temperature sensations on my right hand was different from my Left hand. I had gotten a water bottle from my refrigerator that felt room temp to my right hand but was cold when held in the left hand. I was feeling dizzy or drunk and was walking funny. When I tried to walk straight forward I actually drifted to the left as I walked. I was having difficulty swallowing medications, food or liquids.   I wondered if was experiencing the onset of Covid Symptoms. I was well enough versed on stroke symptoms to be worried about one sided tingling and altered gait being from a stroke.  The flu like nasal symptoms and altered right sided pain and temperature sensations persisted through the night, so I went to the ER at Medical Center the morning of January 13th. The ER worked me over with multiple Covid/Strept/Flu tests, evaluation for possible stroke (with multiple scans and stroke score.) The ERP also evaluated the possibility of Bells Palsy or Guillain Barre secondary to Covid vaccine the week before.  The Covid Testing was Negative. The stroke score was low enough NOT to have warranted thrombolytic therapy. The neurological issues did not appear to be Bells palsy or Guillain barre.   After the ER Visit I attempted to see a neurologist. May 25, 2021 was the earliest available appointment that I could obtain. The symptoms were not severe enough to prevent me working as a Pharmacist. The altered pain and temperature sensations remain without much improvement even now 4 months later.  The Neurologist diagnosed me as having had a stroke, specifically left sided Lateral Medullary Infarct, also known as Wallenburg Syndrome.   There have been reports from the other vaccines having caused blood clot issues since my event.

                                                I got my second shot of mederna on april 2  at about 130 pm, I got the shot and felt fine for about 4 hours at which time I got so tired and dizzy I felt like I was going to pass out, so I stopped what I was doing and went to bed. I slept for 4 hours and woke up in a pool of sweat and was so wet it was like I had just gotten out of the shower. I had the chills and felt cold in 84 Deg F, I went down stairs drank power aid and got out and set up a space heater and sat in front of it with it blowing the hot air on me but had hot and cold flashes, a mild head ach and joint stiffness and pain. I was only able to stay up for 4 hours before I was so exhausted I had to back to sleep and woke up the same way, this continued for the entire weekend. By monday morning my urine was so yellow it was almost black in color, I called my PCP office, they called me back and advised I go to the emergency room asap. I called my parents and got a ride to the hospital emergency room. I told intake what happened and sat down to be called in, they called me in 1 time then had me wait for diagnostic testing, I got vary dizzy just sitting their watching the tv. By the time they called me in for testing I told them I felt vary noxious and ended up passing out on the nurse after they took my blood. They transferred me from that chair to a bed in the blue pod, gave me nausea medication and hooked me up too 2 vary large IV bags and ran them at the same time. Then being up for 4 hours then sleeping for 4 hours and waking up wet in a pool of sweat continued for 6 days in total. the hot and cold flashes and sitting in front of a space heater went on for 12 days in total. waking up in a pool of sweat went on for about 28 - 30 days in total decreasing in severity along the course of time. The only side effect I still have is my sleep is all screwed up now. If I stay up untill 4 am I will sleep to 10;30 then wake up tired and stay in bed untill 11;30  am. if I go to bed at 2 am I wake up at 6;30 am have to use the bath room then can not go back to sleep for at least a hour then do not wake up untill 11 30 am. Normally, I used to goto bed at 2 -3 am and wake up at 9 -10 am every day.  on wednesday april 7 th, the doctors office which is part of the same group as the hospital called me to go over the results from the emergency room, but the person calling did not seem to know I had called them on monday morning or they had called me back to tell me to go to the emergency room, so I do not know how much of a help the PCP will be,  but I have proof of that in the phone call records.  MY PCP is no longer with the practice, so I had to choose a new one

Fatigue and muscle  ache for about 2 days post vaccination. Hot flashes since the vaccination and still happening.

Been on synthroid for over 3 years and only happened a few times a year since my thyroid levels have been regulated. Since vaccine they have been happening a few times a day and  also at night when sleeping. Checked my temp during episode and it is normal around 98.6 or below. Explanation of symptoms are  flushed, sweaty, HOT even when it is cold inside almost like there is an inner fire going on inside me

                                                I developed a rash consisting of many itchy red spots and patches on my front torso (upper chest to top of groin area) and some  similar but fewer spots on my back, arms, legs,  and neck.  My scalp is also itchy.  Rash began as one red spot  in the center of my chest near the breast bone and other spots began to appear.  I noticed the first spot on 1-11 or 1-12; I&#39;m not sure of the exact date.    I scheduled an appointment with my primary care provider for 1-22 at 11:00.  He examined  me and recommended I start a course of OTC antihistamines and topical  cream (Triamcinolone Acetonide .1%) for two weeks.  The rash is a bit less itchy since starting treatment two days ago, but it is still visible and present.  The itchiness woke me from my sleep last night and the night before.

The morning of 2/16 he was found to have a fever of 104.8, altered mental status, possible seizure like activity and taken to ED. ID consulted due to high fever, AMS, LP recommended to rule out meningitis. Due to the patient being on warfarin he needed to be reversed first which was done. The following day he was back to his baseline and afebrile. LP was canceled at that time.

                                                I had pain in arm from injection immediately, after injection, which was much different than first dose.  But not unexpected.  But the adverse symptoms started about 5 hours in or so, i developed a cough, and dyspnea, it was tight in my chest, hard to breathe.  the cough was/is (it remains), sometimes hard and raspy, i was a bit wheezy, and I had air hunger, like i could not breathe or get air.  if i exhale to strongly i cough, if i talk to much i cough, if i sing i cough, if i inhale too deeply i cough.  I also have been very dizzy since the shot and vertigo.  I am still coughing and it is 5 days post shot.    I started developing headache and severe body pain, pain in  my spine, low back and joints.  which is expected, but i also had scalp pain and it hurt to be even touched the slightest bit on my scalp and everywhere on my body.  I had very stiff neck and eye socket pain as well.  I also feel &#34;funny&#34; in my head.  LIke dizzy, and vertigo, but also like it is wrapped in a heavy towel and my eyes feel heavy and like i can&#39;t see well.  my vision is as if it has diminshed.    5 hours after shot cough started, and the dyspnea, i started feeling chills and deep squeezing ache in my arm at jab site, and soon had fever of 100.6, over night it went to 100.8 and i felt terrible, headache, body ache, restless.  but next day fever was 102.  it remained all day, i had zero energy slept the whole day.  no appetite, did not eat anything except a scramble egg which made me nausea.  fever remained all day at 101.8. over night.  next day temp was 99.8 (my normal is 97.6) and it was 99.8 all day.  Cough was persistent and really bad with the dyspnea this whole time and i still have cough 5 days out, just giving a timeline here.  by friday, my temp was 98 but i felt extreemly fatigued.  I went and got a covid test which was negative.  i saw the chiropractor and they helped my back and headache a little bit.  went home and rested.  cough has lingered, dizzy lingers, chest tight and sob lingers.  fatigue lingers.   Cough and dyspnea are NOT signs, the sheet i got for V-safe says right on it these are NOT expected.

                                                Aproximately 30 minutes after injection, I felt stimulated as if having drank too many energy drinks, mild diaphoresis, mild trembling, racing heart rate.  Suffered uncharateristic insomnia the same night.  On 2/23/21, I awoke after 6 hours sleep, with mild body aches and general torpor -malaise.  This progressed into the early afternoon to severe body aches 8/10 on pain scale of 10, a moderate headache of 3/10, excessive drowsiness, extreme diaphoresis, chills, and a temperature spike of 1 degree.  I had very mild motor trembling in upper extremeties (hands) that seemed unassociated with fever.  I took no medications and slept under these general conditions for 80% of the next 48 hours.  The headache did reduce after the 10 hours from onset.

                                                after about 30 minutes, I started having a metallic taste in my mouth.  I was also experiencing soreness in left arm area.   After about an hour, the pain in my arm started to feel as though it was spreading to my left chest cavity area.  I then started to get chest pains in the left breast area to the armpit area, but not severe, just concerning.  After probably 70-80 minutes, I started feeling drowsy.  I continued to feel drowsy all evening and did not sleep well.  I woke up and could not return to sleep at 4:45am.  My normal waking time is 6:00am.  I had/have quite a bit of soreness in my arm, but nothing unbearable.  No signs of rash or inflammation around injection sight.  I am taking a sick day from work to relax and recover from loss of sleep.  The metallic taste persist, but only an annoyance and taste seems to be normal when eating or drinking.  A slight achiness in joints, but a cold front was also moving in, which can cause me to have the same effect.

                                                Beginning at 11:30 PM I began to experience chills. I spiked a fever throughout the night and slept very little. Beginning around 2 PM I experienced aching joints comparable to arthritis. About that time I also began to experience sinus congestion and pain Which was similar to having a significant sinus infection. By 8 AM the fever was beginning to break but the aches and sinus congestion remained, and stomach pain arose. Throughout the day, there were episodes of fever. Stomach pain resolved around noon. Congestion and aches and fever were largely resolved by 4pm, at which time two Tylenol were taken, with only occasional low fever episodes. I slept well that night and felt fine the following morning.

This is the sickest I&#39;ve felt in decades, maybe my entire life.  Oh, and my injection site hurt too.  The night of the shot, and the day after, were the worst.  I&#39;m writing this on the morning of day 2.  Today, the fever, body aches, and joint pain are gone.  I still have a headache (but it&#39;s better than yesterday), fatigue, and injection site pain.  After my first Moderna shot, I had a slight headache and fatigue the following day, but this second shot really kicked my ass.

As a person with diabetes, I had to take extra finger sticks that day because I did not trust my normal sensation of low blood sugar. I think this is a common reaction to the vaccine, and I intend to get the 2nd dose, but maybe diabetics should be warned about confusing this common reaction with hypoglycemia and cautioned to be extra vigilant with finger sticks the day after receiving the injection.

Maybe about 2 weeks from vaccine -  I had some congestion (nasal congestion and sneezing) - it was odd (not allergies) and it lasted a solid with heavy heavy drainage and that lasted about two days. I had to use the Mucinex D for it. Then I had the nose bleed - it wouldn&#39;t stop bleeding in right nostril. I went to ER - Sunday, the 28th - started at 10:30 pm and after midnight on the 29th it was after 4 hours of bleeding when  I went to ED in town. The doctor said my nasal passages were really dry because of the weather. I was using a travel CPAP that doesn&#39;t have a humidifier.  They cleared a giant clot in the back of my throat - it was the size of a hamburger - it was huge. They used a nasal vasodilator - it looked like nasal spray and they did it and stopped. Vitals were stable and they sent me home. I might have one bloody nose after  - a week after and they had given me the nasal vasodilator and that stopped it. They also prescribed a nasal saline spray and I only use the CPAP with the humidifier now.

                                                A very strong pain around the shot spot on my arm. It was a lot more than the first shot. I could not sleep comfortably at night because of it. Interestingly, that was the only adverse effect I had and I was expecting more because everybody on line said the second shot side effects were to be more serious than the first one. I am glad sore arm was the only thing I experienced. I took Ibuprofen for it and it helped a little but did not do away with the pain completely. When I woke up the second day after the shot, the pain was almost completely gone.

By lunchtime, I am experiencing extreme fatigue, overall body soreness, loss of appetite, and increased pain at the injection site. By 3 pm I am home and in bed, dealing with chills/sweats as well. Couldn&#39;t find any comfort to sleep thru the night. In the morning of the 29th, I&#39;m still displaying all the issues listed above. I stay home from work and go back to bed. I awake at noon to find all the listed issues greatly reduced, but feel soreness in my jaw and feel swelling in the lymph nodes under the jawbone, more so on the right than the left.

                                                Had pain in my shoulder (and  neck on my left side) as soon as the shot went in. At roughly three hours after the shot, I felt I was slurring my speech (I had to make a very concerted effort to make proper sentences and not slur) and was very dizzy. I also was having a hard time with lights. For example, I was unable to look in the mirror in my bathroom as the lights above the mirror were too bright for me. At three hours after the shot, I had severe pain in my left shoulder. Overall, I felt as I had been sedated or drugged. I tried walking to the nearest convenience store to get some food and I felt I was experiencing vertigo. Several days after the vaccine I had a slight cough and sore throat. I am still experiencing a slight cough on some day sand a slight sore throat.   I had a subtle red patch in the left shoulder area a couple days after the shot. Eight or nine days after the shot, I had covid arm and had a very visible red patch on my left shoulder. I have pictures of this.  I have been feeling very tired and dizzy ever since the first shot. My glands in my neck under my jaw line are also swollen. I do not know if it is either  wise or safe for me to get the second shot, which is scheduled for this Friday as it seems that I still have not recovered from the first shot. Can my immune system really take another round of this?  There are a couple other things that I have noticed. I don&#39;t seem to be thinking very clearly and I have noticed a remarkable number of type-os and poor syntax in emails that I send at work; this is not normal for me.   Finally, after the shot, I noticed that my muscles, when doing a little exertion such as pushups, would build lactic acid quicker and more blood seemed to be delivered to my working muscles. I still have not regained my strength and tire more easierly when playing tennis or hitting against the tennis wall, for example. This is also not normal and not how I felt before the first injection.

When I mentioned my severe reactions, they told me they were filing a report upon my behalf. When done they told me it was the VAERS system and gave me a reference number (Ref-531994). I decided that not enough information would be in that report so wanted to submit myself because of my severe reaction and hospitalization. My PCP was not involved until after hospital for a follow up and I was seen by numerous doctors there, so I have no easy single POC until I dig more.

                                                He got his vaccine, had pain on the side of the injection and from there it grew to feeling aches and pains and then the shivers the next day.  He has had chills/sweating, fever that comes and goes, difficulty breathing as his nostrils block up, and has wheezing and when he gets up he&#39;s light headed and feels like he is going to pass out.  At night the symptoms seem to get worse, and thought that he had the flu.  He has bought everything for the flu and nothing has helped.  He then thought that he may have allergies and bought stuff for that and nothing has helped.  He has lost his sense of taste, he is extremely thirsty and could drink a gallon of water and his stomach hurts from drinking but his mouth is extremely dry and his throat is so dry as well.   He also has a nasty bad headache that is persistent and at night it gets to the point that he cannot seen and had lost his vision and could no see anything out of his right eye.  He called 9-1-1 and refused to go to the ER as he has no insurance and could not afford that kind of bill.  Yesterday his headache was so bad that he could not see out of the left eye, he has a fever of 101.5 right now and his head is killing him.  He has taken all of his medications that he has, medicated and nothing is helping the pain.  His nose is also extremely dry and he has no appetite, and ate last at 5:00 PM yesterday.   He also has vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, sweats/chills.  He watches his diet carefully due to the diabetes, but has not measured it.     He is very concerned about his vision and his fever and headache was so bad that he could not see, and he&#39;s worried about that.   He also has brain fog as well, and cannot remember things, pounding, pulsating water.

On the morning of the 6th day, 1/21/21, I had very intense deep muscle pain in my lower back, left arm, hands and headache. About two hours after this started I started to have the very intense chills, my headache got worse and for the first time a low fever of 99 degrees. I felt like this for 2 days, couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 days because of the pain. On the third day 1/24/21, it was much better and almost all gone by the fourth day, 1/25/21. Thank you

These symptoms would recur approx every 8 hrs for the next 4 days.  Days 3-4 of the symptoms were debilitating and I primarily remained in bed.  Today is the first day or somewhat normal.  Still feel some ache and mild fatigue.  Never lost taste or smell and never had any respiratory issues or GI issues.

Unlike during the disease, my hips strongly ached 24 hours after recieving the injection.  COVID cough returned though not as bad as when I had the disease, as well as fealing weak and out of breath.  All of this lasted for about 36 hours.  Feeling a bit better now, but still winded and weak.   Still plan to get 2nd shot.

                                                Presented to ED for evaluation of generalized lower extremity weakness, falls. The patient states that he carries a diagnosis of MS and typically is fully functioning without assistance of a cane or walker. The patient states that yesterday morning around 0900 he received the second dose of his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was otherwise feeling fine but by last night (12 hours after the vaccine) the patient states he tried to get out of bed and was transferring when he felt his bilateral legs give out, causing him to slide to the ground. His wife then came to help and states that the patient was completely weak in the legs, and was unable to even lift his legs up to get back into bed. They then tried to walk him again a short time later and he again stumbled with weakness in his legs. Since that time, the patient states he has been minimally ambulatory and has been using a cane, but still needs large assistance to get around his home. The patient states he has baseline foot drop but feels this is worse in his legs today. He went to clinic this morning for his symptoms where he was noted to have an elevated temperature and was diffusely weak in his lower extremities. Given this, the patient was referred to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies any weakness in his upper extremities or facial asymmetry. He denies sensation change in his extremities nor any recent illness such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or leg pain. He has no history of stroke. He denies any injuries or head injury, syncope from his falls. He was admitted to the hospital where he will receive further symptomatic treatment as necessary. No treatment provided in emergency department for weakness.

                                                On Friday morning I started having chest pains. The pains were sharp and would go away quickly. (Almost immediately) They were from the center of my chest to the right of my chest at about the same level as my heart, I could tell that the pains were NOT coming from my heart, or at least, that is how it seemed. I also felt some pains to the left of the center of my chest, but the pains from the left were fewer and not as pronounced. These pains resulted in my leaving work early (I was on the way to work when they started) and I stayed home from work today. The pains did not continue for more than 4  hours or so, and seemed to dissipate later that day. I did feel some discomfort in my chest this morning. This discomfort was extremely mild and did not last much more than an hour and a half. I feel fine this afternoon, as I am writing this note. I have been eating, urinating and have had normal bowl movements today, so I think I am okay. You might be mindful of these chest pains the Moderna vaccine is causing. The pains were sharp and noticeable. I did not call my Doctor because it did not seem necessary. Thank you.

He received his FIRST Moderna vaccine on: 2/18/2021 and experienced severe sickness (nausea); fever, headaches, chills, sweating, and painful extremities, but this was reported to (vaccine provider) as was told these were normal side effects.

I should add to the other that my blood pressure has elevated since the vaccine.  As part of going on medication on 3/18, it was a concern the medications would elevate my blood pressure.  I bought a wrist BP check device and it was averaging 134/95 on 3/22/2021.  On 3/23/2021, I was prescribed Losartan.  I took one pill at 7:30PM.  Today when I woke up and for most of the day the BP has been 124/77-82.  The ringing remains persistent

Immeadiately thought &#34;oh Crap&#34; -- Fight or flight kicked in and immediate changes in heart rythym.  The health care person made me stay for a little longer and asked if I was OK.  The feeling subsided after an hour.  Next day significant soreness and weakness in left arm.  Since the I have had 7 significant re-occurances of the original feeling.  Range from 1 to 4 hours in duration and also go from chilled and fever to sweating.  sometime this can happen minutes apart.  Tremendous feeling of anxiety and dread when this occurs and has impeded 7 days of work over last 18 days.  Also considerable brain fog or just not being able to funtion as normal  --- I will not take the second dose.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Allergy (Respiratory allergies).   On 01-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 29-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 29-Mar-2021, the patient experienced INFLUENZA LIKE ILLNESS (felling sick like he had the flu), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (significant pain in arm), PYREXIA (fever) and CHILLS (chills). In April 2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced MENTAL IMPAIRMENT (hard to think, it has been very disturbing because he has to think for work, and it has been very difficult) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (Continued bad and strange dizziness) (seriousness criterion medically significant), VERTIGO (vertigo that lasted about 3 weeks and was very disturbing) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PALPITATIONS (heart was pounding but heart rate was normal) (seriousness criterion medically significant), INSOMNIA (couldn&#39;t sleep) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FEELING ABNORMAL (brain fogs) (seriousness criterion medically significant), MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (hard to think and remember things) (seriousness criterion medically significant), ANXIETY (feeling of anxiety) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DISSOCIATION (There were times when he feels detached from reality) (seriousness criterion medically significant), NAUSEA (strange feeling of dizziness and nausea feeling) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and PRESYNCOPE (At some point felt like he was almost going to lose consciousness).

Patient reports he takes supplements as concomitant medications Patient was prescribed clonazepam for his anxiety and took ibuprofen for his symptoms. Patient went to the ER two weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, he was checked out, ran some tests and everything was within normal limits. Blood work was normal.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Company comment: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Fatigue has lingered, with brain fog - difficulty finding words, difficulty staying awake, difficulty staying focused.  Feeling of slight numbness/fatigue from shoulders up.   Similar feeling to jet lag.   It&#39;s been 4 weeks.    Blood work was done - vitamin b12 deficiency is all - all other measurements were fine.

This continued at that intensity for about a week.  I couldn&#39;t do ANYTHING...was previously running 7 miles/day but in the past month since vaccine I have only had the energy to walk around the block one time.  The cognitive impairment has been debilitating at work where I can not concentrate or process complex topics.  I&#39;m an IT executive so this is part of my daily job and was no problem prior to the vaccine.  By the second week I was starting to make very tiny progress each day.  I would be OK for an hour or 2 after waking up but then the fatigue and malaise would return and I wouldn&#39;t be able to work.  This is often accompanied by headache.  Generally the duration of symptoms has been  getting shorter each day but very slowly. On may 9 my impairment was so great I couldn&#39;t even drive (was like being a bit drunk).  Finally, Monday May 10, the intensity of the symptoms was light enough that I was able to work a full day despite the mild headache and fog.  The same continued on May 11, so I hope I am close to being over this.

                                                I acquired Covid on January 13. I was sick for three days, largely with headaches. I lost my sense of smell. After approximately 7 weeks, I had recovered most of my sense of smell. I received dose 1 of Moderna on March 2. Four days later I noticed that my sense of smell had diminished substantially. I contacted my primary and was assured that it wasn&#39;t a result of the vaccine. I saw an EENT, and he too assured me it wasn&#39;t because of the vaccine. I was put on Flonase and one course of steroids (12 days). After 2 weeks, my sense of smell was returning. I received my second dose on 3/30. Within 12 hours I knew something was wrong. My sense of smell seemed to be obliterated. It felt like there was a &#34;hole&#34; in the center of my nose. Within 36 hours, the turbinates in my nose were hypertrophic. I have never suffered seasonal allergies and had never even heard the word &#34;turbinate&#34; before this. 45 days later, my left nostril is blocked. My right nostril is nearly blocked. I have fluid behind both ears, and my hearing has diminshed.  I feel completely let down by the medical establishment and even the CDC. There is no way that I should have been advised to have the vaccine just 40 days after contracting covid. All of the promises that the vaccine can&#39;t reduce sense of smell because there&#39;s no Covid in the vaccine are misleading. My immune system responded to the vaccine by attacking the site of the original infection, which was my nose. This has been devastating to me. I am depressed, anxious, and hopeless that this will correct itself. I will likely suffer some percentage of hearing loss. I was completely recovered from Covid, and it&#39;s only these vaccines that have ruined my health.

                                                High fever (103.3) on 2/21/2021 that lasted for 6 hours and stopped with ibuprofen.  Left arm soreness persisted for 3 days and stiffness in the left shoulder became more prevalent.  During the last 3 months, range of motion in the left shoulder has decreased, general weakness in the left arm noted and now there is severe pain in the left shoulder when moved in certain positions.  Large decrease in range of motion.  Can no longer reach across my chest with severe pinching on the top of the left shoulder joint.  Can no longer swing a golf club without severe pain and swing limitations due to range of motion decrease.  I saw my primary care physician last week and he has referred me to an orthopedic doctor.

The following day I had chest pain every few hours or so. the waves of chest pain only lasted about 5 minutes a piece.

Next morning quite achy, strong headache, light sensitive. No breathing or cognition issues. Not eating but no g.i. issues. Injection site is sore.  Mostly recovered or anyway not worried about lingering symptoms at 20 hours past shot (if something gets worse I&#39;ll report again). My goal in submitting this report was only to describe  what I consider to be note-worthy side effects. By comparison, I had a first covid  vaccine dose exactly 1 month ago and no real signs. Also, I had covid-19 infection, moderately sick, in March 2020 (tested pos for covid antibodies in May 2020.

                                                I got the shot at 3pm. I started feeling &#34;off&#34; in stomach/chest around 7-8pm. By 3am, my stomach/chest did not feel good at all and I had trouble sleeping. It was definitely not heart related. By 8am I felt chills coming on. By 9am I was fully dressed, with two blankets on, and lying on couch shaking for 20-30 minutes. Later a fever started and it reached about 102.3 before subsiding late afternoon. By 8pm, I felt blah but fever was gone. During that entire time I felt achy overall (similar to what I felt like 2 hours after running a marathon).  I didn&#39;t have headaches (and rarely do), but area around my eyes were heavy and tired. Weirdly, at times, the top 1/2 of both ears hurt.   I experience about every symptom I had as when I had Covid and went to hospital for 26 days except for the breathing issues.

Then I had fatigue and then at about 14 hours after the injection, I started having chills - like I had temperature with hot and cold chills. I got very cold; my blood pressure dropped - I happened to have a doctor appt the day following the vaccine - the bottom level was very low of my blood pressure - it was 45. I couldn&#39;t warm up - my extremities were very cold. I had chest pain and it felt like my heart rate was going in an out of atrial fibulation. I had shortness of breath. I measured my blood oxygen concentration and had dropped down to 90%. I didn&#39;t sleep well because I was so chilled and not feeling well. I felt like I had a bad flu. I rested the next day (10th) the symptoms slowly went away between 10 am and 1:00. At 3:00 pm, I saw my pain doctor and I told him about it but I was feeling much better although blood pressure was low. Fatigue lasted for 3-5 days afterwards but it wasn&#39;t anything last the first 24 hours. I didn&#39;t go to ER because it seemed to resolve itself in the day.

                                                Three days after the vaccination I started having severe nightmares and vivid violent dreams that prevent me from sleeping. They happen 5-6 times a night and each time my body experiences an Adrenaline rush. I jump from my sleep with high pulse and elevated blood pressure. It subsides quickly after I am awake. But then after I fall back to sleep and within one hour, the event repeats. I wake up again and again. The sleep has become very light and filled with violent dreams that I can remember vividly.

Every muscle in my body aches and I had the chills, with slight fever.  No nausea. No headache. Just cold and sore. Today I feel much better, but not 100%.

I had fever, chills, rapid pulse (108 bpm normally runs 70), &amp; chest tightness. Almost called ambulance because of the pulse and chest tightness. Within a couple hours of waking up I also began to have muscle cramps in my feet, toes, and thighs. Worse than I have ever experienced  and I have been diagnosed with PAD for over 10 years. I tried to get some sleep. I couldn&#39;t. My PCP also did not like the way my lungs sounded that morning at the Clinic. I was told after a xray that my lungs were ok. My injection site has been sore until today. It is better. I did have Covid in October 2020.

I experienced joint pain and muscle pain throughout the body.  I experienced a headache for most of the period.  I took Tylenol (acetaminophen) that provided relief for the headache and muscle and joint pain.  Besides that I basically slept for the period from 11pm day of vaccination through 4:30pm day after vaccination.

I had a reaction in the 1980&#39;s to a tetanus vaccine that was just a high fever. The headache was intolerable so I took some Aleve

Nearly one week into the first week of the vaccine, the ringing remains  constant and allows only  2-3 hours of restless sleep.  As the day progresses, the ringing is louder.  Right ear doesnt seem to be affected.

In morning I was overcome with sweats, and was ?sick? with all these symptoms most the rest of the day ? despite taking it easy and taking Tylenol   After an early dinner Friday evening, I went to bed for the next 12 hours,  Though I woke up a few times all sweaty during that stretch, by morning I was feeling pretty normal.  So, I figure my body was under duress for  30-33 hours.  Although I didn?t feel real bad for some 12 hours after injection, I did encounter some indigestion starting a few hours after the shot.

                                                Symptoms were described as brain thoughts were not connecting. &#34;brain fog&#34;.  I could think but the thoughts could not be connected with other thoughts.  I was not slurring or had no weakness or numbness in limbs.  I just could not process thoughts.  It is difficult to describe. I could think thoughts, but my brain had a sense of confusion.  This occurred for 3-4 hours and resolved about 6 hours afterwards and the next day all was fine.  I called my primary care physician and I decided to watch and wait.

From my research, this did not seem like a typical side effect.    I had trouble sleeping, eating and swallowing without pain.  This is now 8 days after my shot and I still have pain.  I have taken motrin and this has helped, but only some.  As of today, my pain is not as bad as it had developed over the past week.  I reported this to my healthcare provider via a call first and all their only recommendation was to take motrin and not come in for a visit / investigation for 2 weeks which I did not agree with at all based on the severity.  These symptoms that I am reporting do not seem common and based on the severity I really question if i plan to take the second dose.  I really felt that this needed to be reported

                                                This case was reported by a consumer via call center representative and described the occurrence of vaccination failure in a 58-year-old male patient who received Herpes zoster (Shingrix) for prophylaxis.   Co-suspect products included Herpes zoster (Shingrix) for prophylaxis, COVID-19 MRNA-1273 VACCINE (COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA) (batch number 040B21A, expiry date unknown) for prophylaxis and COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA (batch number 002B21A, expiry date unknown) for prophylaxis.   Concurrent medical conditions included ulcerative colitis. Concomitant products included azathioprine.   On 11th June 2019, the patient received the 2nd dose of Shingrix. On 9th April 2019, the patient received the 1st dose of Shingrix. On 9th April 2021, the patient received the 2nd dose of COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. On 11th March 2021, the patient received the 1st dose of COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. In May 2021, between 1 and 2 years after receiving Shingrix and more than 2 years after receiving Shingrix, the patient experienced shingles, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg. On an unknown date, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria GSK medically significant), feeling unwell and decreased immune responsiveness. The patient was treated with valaciclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex). On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg were unknown and the outcome of the shingles was not recovered/not resolved and the outcome of the generalized raised red spots limbs and red spotty rash were recovering/resolving.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg to be related to Shingrix and Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: The patient self reported the case. On an unknown date, less than 3 months after the 1st dose and less than 2 months after the 2nd dose the patient experienced shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg. The patient had not felt good for a few weeks and then in the last week before the reporting date he started to get symptoms.  The patient felt crappy and had shooting pain in his back on the left side and the pain shot down his leg and then he had a rash on his left leg later. His torso, back, butt, and upper thighs were stingy, burning, and he was sensitive to the touch on his skin before the rash appeared. He described it as aches and pains and a stingy, needle feeling.  The patient had a history of ulcerative colitis and he took Azathioprine during the past few years so he was unsure if his rash was related to his weak immune system or the COVID vaccine.  The patient had sent pictures of his left leg rash to his physician and they recommended him to see a dermatologist who diagnosed him with shingles after a biopsy and tests. They immediately put him on Valtrex and he claimed that things started to calm down and the rash was started to dry up.  The patient described the rash as starting off as red spots that were raised up that looked like a target with a red circle around it that would get bigger. The raised spot looked like there was fluid inside. The dot in the middle looked dark in color and the red part that had spread looked like a bruise that was resolving with the color of yellow and brown.  The patient had a few clusters of the rash on the inside and outside of his left leg and back on his calf.  It was unknown if the reporter considered the shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg to be related to COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA and COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. The reporter consented to follow up.

                                                A friend texted me today at 1231 on 1-11-21 asking me how I was doing following the COVID vaccination given 10 Jan 21 which we both received.  In subsequent texts he disclosed that he was had difficulty sleeping last night due to fever and 7/10 chest pain. He took motrin 800mg and ½ of a Percocet, but did not relieve chest pain. He denied any SOB and he described his pulse as wnl. He also noted dizziness, sweating and left arm pain. He denied hx of HTN, but did relate a history of dyslipidemia which he felt was controlled. I then contacted him by phone and he verified his text messages. As he is over 50 yo and has symptoms suggestive of an Acute Coronary Syndrome he was advised to take aspirin and call 911...He was seen at Hospital, ER  on 1-11-21. A mediastinal mass was noted on imaging. This mass was initially thought to be the cause of his chest pain and not related to his Covid vaccination. He was later seen by a thoracic surgeon with follow-up imaging showing significant decrease in the size of the mass raising the possibility in may be inflammatory or infectious in nature. He continues to be followed and has not had any surgeries for this condition.  His thoracic surgeon is:   MD thoracic surgery Specialized cancer program   Hospital  Name of a cancer institute Listed Address Listed phone number and fax number

                                                12 hours after began to have a scratch throat.  at 13 hours post dose, had a headache start and an unusual erythematous spot on the posterior palate above Uvula with almost a white scratch appearance inside the erythema.  16 hours post dose began to have fevers and chills.  At 17 hours had severe sweats that soaked the bed with rigorous chills including teeth chattering shaking chills.  Took 800mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep.  Poor sleep with many awakenings.  Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA I have sciatic and have had a rhyzotomy on my right side. On 15 Jan, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I began to get back and leg aches from my sciatica, but on my left side.  I immediately began my routine (exercise) and back brace which usually stop the pain. Over the next two day, the symptoms got worse to the point of extreme pain in my back and all down my left leg.  This resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 17 January.  I have since had an appointment with my pain specialist, and an MRI.  We are awaiting results from the MRI.  The pain has not lessened, and pain medication are only mildly effective. The pain being in my left side make since as the Rhyzotomy had been done on my right side.  I am concerned the vaccine may have cause tissue or nerve swelling. Pain is still intense to the point of immobility and difficulty sleeping.

I asked patient what happened and he stated that suddenly he felt dizzy and that he was anxious about the vaccine from the beginning and excited to get it at the same time, then I measured the blood pressure  it was 125/61 with pulse of 45/min.I offered him and his wife to call 911 but they declined it. I asked him to go back to my consultation area so he could lie down on the floor and raise his legs up so we can bring back the blood pressure up, he did that, and he went with me over there and laid down on the floor and we raised his legs up,later I measured his blood pressure again, and it was 113/71 with pulse 51/minute, I offered again to call 911 but he refused and he said that he was feeling better. I left him about 10 more minutes,then he started to get up and sit by the chair and I re-measured the blood pressure  and it was 121/76 with pulse of 54/minute, he started to drink water. He stated he felt better than he was about 20 minutes ago, then they left once their driver came to pick them up.

The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation and had a pacemaker placed about 8-9 months ago.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event were blood pressure medication, antiarrhythmics.  On 01 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030m20a) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01 Mar 2021, after vaccination, the patient developed red dots on both of his arms. For next two days, the patient had rash on both arms, was dizzy, felt sick, developed fast heart rate; went to hospital twice for heart rate either 07 Mar 2021 or 13 Mar 2021.During first visit to hospital, fast rate was brought under control, while in the second visit, the patient had a procedure in which his heart was cut from top to bottom and was made pacemaker dependent. The atrial fibrillation could not be controlled for 26 hours and had a flutter which was not identified and could not be controlled. Flutter returned after stopping amlodipine and hence patient was restarted on amlodipine. The patient now feels very weak, has a hard time walking, has no energy, cannot do the simplest of tasks, still experiences fast heart rate and flutter every now and then.   No Laboratory investigations were provided. The Treatment information included pacemaker, amlodipine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cardiac pacemaker dependent, atrial fibrillation, red dots on both of his arms, rash on both arms, dizziness, sick, atrial flutter, very weak and no energy, hard time walking, cannot do the simplest of tasks were unknown.

After discussing with patient and patients spouse, agree that patient needs to be seen by either PCP, Dr. or go to ER. At the time pt did not wish to go to ER. Wife proceeded to call Dr.&#39;s office to see about getting him in. Pt then started to feel worse and like he needed to go to ER. offered to call for an ambulance, pt refused as his wife could take him and would probably be quicker. staff offered diphenhydramine and pt declined, stating he would wait until he got to ER for treatment.

I spoke with the nurse that treated the patient. Pt did indeed come to ER and was treated for a reaction. He was given a dose of benadryl and solumedrol. Pt verbalized feeling like he was having a severe anxiety attack and that his adrenaline was really high. Nurse stated that she agreed with him. Pt was later discharged that evening. No epinephrine use reported.

Soon after I developed weakness and numbness in lower legs and feet.  This has continued and not let up.  I have had dizziness, difficulty sitting or standing up for long periods of time.  Had severe pain in legs.  Had to lie in bed most of the time.  Anxiety, shakiness, difficulty sleeping also progressed.  Had extreme fatigue and continued feelings of being ill and light headed.  The numbness and pins and needles in feet continue.  Cannot walk for long periods, very limited in my ability to do anything physical.

                                                i have had Tinnitus for approx. 45 years. I am able to manage it via diet, exercise and masking sounds during sleep. Approximately 2 weeks after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine I noticed an marked change in the intensity and frequency distribution of my Tinnitus. It became gradually worse over the next few days. This disrupted my sleep and resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 07-APR-2021. I was prescribed a sleep aid (Eszopiclone 3 mg, 10-day supply) and OTC Melatonin 10 mg by the attending ER physician. Sent home after a hour or so in ER. On 14-APR-2021 discussed issue with a nurse prac. at my  clinic. She extended the Eszoplicone prescription.

                                                On Monday night I tossed and turned, and I gradually realized I felt quite ill. By Tuesday morning I had what I understand to be typical reactions to the second dose: soreness at the injection site, fatigue, muscle aches, chills, overheating, loss of taste, and a touch of nausea. My head was swimming, and putting my hands to my forehead made my head feel a bit better. By midday Wednesday I was gradually improving. But Wednesday evening, at my desk, I noticed my vision seemed blurry. On Thursday morning, I verified that my reading vision (with glasses) was (and is) markedly worse. Now I cannot easily read from my smart phone or computer screen. I plan to see an optometrist as soon as possible.

About 18 hours after the second shot I started getting a very severe headache. The absolute worst of my life and debilitating. I did not have a high fever, but had some chills and fatigue. No nausea. I expected the ringing to return to my &#34;normal&#34; levels pre-vaccine, which is a level that is not usually noticeable unless I focus on it. Now my ears are ringing loudly and the sound is ever present. I am worried this will be a chronic condition.

He reported that within 24 hours of second dose, he developed abdominal pain, chills, fever, and body ache. Fever, chills and body aches lasted 1 day. Abdominal pain persisted and is mostly is post prandial and associated with GERD. The pain was at first severe, has gradually improved and no longer referred to his back. Pain is not associated with nausea or blood in stools. Breathing makes pain worse. He does not use alcohol. He has reduced food intake for fear of triggering the pain.

By the time  I had arrived at the house my head was pounding.   I was feeling  a dizzying  migraine.  I have not had one of those in a  while.  It was also accompanied with lite nausea.  I had a cup of coffee when I came home and went to bed.  I was feeling so bad I had to get up  and take a Sumatriptan and another cup of coffee.  I laid back down for a few more hours.  I awakened later,  used the restroom  and was feeling much better than before.   Although my arm and shoulder is sore at the injection site,  I?m feeling much better.

                                                A few hours after the shot I began feeling anxious, shortness of breath, tense. This tapered off somewhat later in the night. I went to bed ~11:30 and then woke up about 2:00 AM again tense and short of breath.  I&#39;ve been having a level of this condition since.   The last 3 days I&#39;ve been taking Allegra 24 hr (180mg) thinking it might be allergies but haven&#39;t notice much improvement.

He noticed an increase in stooling after eating, however stools were solid. The muscle cramps and mood changes mostly subsided after 7 days, however on day 8 (5/27/21) he was still experiencing taste changes, gi upset, and was having difficulty sleeping. I guided the patient on some symptom relieve and instructed him to contact the pharmacy or his doctor if the symptoms worsened or did not resolve within another 7 days. He felt he was on his way to the symptoms improving and would report any changes.

Went for doctor visit and told him all my symptoms, He was very concerned I had a reaction to vaccine.   He prescribed prednisone 7 day pack for severe joint pain &amp; inflammation, Nurtec disintegrating tablets, meloxicam, ordered bloodwork and had follow up in 2 weeks, after two weeks symptoms were still the same very severe, he referred me to Neurologist for evaluation, she ordered MRI as a stat to be done right away,  and started me on meds for Severe Migraines and sent me to Ophthalmologist, she had a nurse get me an appointment the next day.   I saw Ophthalmologist the very next day he did workup and diagnostic testing in his office and stated I had severe swelling and inflammation in the optic nerves in both eyes, and referred me and sent records to Dr., Neuro Ophthalmologist and contacted their office to get me in right away.  I had my appointment with Dr. and she has ordered an ultrasound of my eyes by retina specialist which appointment is in June.  I have follow up with her after ultrasound is done.  Due to severe joint pain I am still having my PCP has referred me to a rheumatologist.  My pain is severe.  The vaccine has attacked my immune system.  Doctors and specialists are doing everything possible and I am still off work.  My return to work date has not been determined.

                                                Patient admitted with high grade AV block, sinus pause, and recurrent syncope. 57-year-old white male with PMH only of cigarette use who notes about 2 weeks of generalized malaise, then in the last 24 hours has had 2 syncopal episodes that were accompanied by diaphoresis only without other prodrome.  He got his second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 5/28/21, then on the following day had been working in the barn without any dyspnea chest pain or shortness of breath but felt generally fatigued so went to take a nap.  He got up to check his temperature, then &#34;just hit the floor&#34;.  Not preceded by blackout of vision, lightheadedness, chest pain, dyspnea palpitations, nausea but was accompanied by sweats.  He believes he was out only briefly, and when he awoke was not confused and did not have tongue biting or loss of bladder or bowel continence.  He then got up and went about his day normally, then around 2 AM awoke to let the dogs out and had an identical event, but this time hit his chin on a chain saw on the floor and suffered a laceration. He presented to ED for evaluation where his laceration was sutured. He is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Initial labs and diagnostics are unrevealing and an EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm without acute or chronic ischemic changes.  Noncontrast CT of the head and the face showed no evidence of bony damage, no intracranial bleed or large territory infarct. While in the ED, the patient had a brief bradycardic episode accompanied by diaphoresis although a dedicated strip is not available and it is unclear what his rhythm was.  He did not syncopize.  Hospitalist service was asked to accept for syncope evaluation. When admitting physician saw patient, he reported feeling completely well without any other issues.  He does note he had about 2 weeks of malaise before all of this started and a mild decrease in his ability to work intensely, but had attributed this to cigarette smoking.  Review of systems was essentially negative.  He is a hobby farmer and has had a couple of tick bites this year. While admitting physician was in the room at the end of the visit, the patient had an episode of diaphoresis and went into a high-grade second-degree AV block with disappearance of atrial activity without ventricular escape and lost consciousness for about a second.  No jerking or twitching observed.  The episode a couple of seconds then self terminated and the patient awoke and completely recovered mentation and was in a sinus rhythm.  He was diaphoretic and felt ill afterward this.  He had no chest pain or dyspnea. Immediately after the episode with repeat vitals the patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 70s and a normal sinus rhythm and blood pressure is 136/80.  Oxygen saturations are preserved. Not on any rate limiting agents either here in emergency department or at home. Patient found to have P-P interval prolongation with AV block and subsequent sinus arrest possibly situational in the setting of coming off of a colonoscopy and receiving second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. A pacemaker was placed 6/1/2021 without complication and the patient was discharged in stable condition on 6/2/2021.

                                                I woke up on Saturday morning with whole body soreness, but this passed by that afternoon.  Saturday night through to Sunday, I had chest pains on my entire left side.  This worsened all of Sunday and I developed dyspnea (shortness of breath) if I tried to lay down on my back or side along with the pain.  I could not sleep or rest Sunday to Monday night so I had to prop myself forward over a bundle of pillows in order to rest.  Monday I still had some pain though less, but the dyspnea was more pronounced with any moderate exertion.  I called the medical director where I work to ask for advice.  He told me it was ok to take an antihistamine.  I had taken nothing from the time I received my second dose Thu until then.  I took over the counter Chlorpheniramine (4mg) one time and that seemed to relieve the symptoms.  The next day I was 85% better (Tue), but it took exactly 7 days (Thu) before I was back to normal. For the 3 - 5 day period following my second dose, it was a little bit scary struggling to breathe and thinking I was having a heart attack.  I almost went to the hospital, but I didn&#39;t because I take care of my elderly father and could not leave him by himself.  If this had happened to me out of the blue, I would have gone to the emergency, but I had read of people having reactions to the vaccine after the second dose so I was mentally prepared to ride it out.  I didn&#39;t read about people having my particular side effect, so I thought I was an outlier of sorts. I am filling this out now because there are reports coming out that the Pfizer vaccine may be tied to myocarditis in men, and from the symptoms explained, it seems to line up with what I experienced.  Although I had Moderna, not Pfizer, I thought maybe I should report it in case it is a generic &#34;mrna vaccine&#34; issue.

Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.

Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.

I feel like I was hit by a truck.

Hot flashes and perspiration that I have never experienced.  Felt somewhat better day 2 but its now day 4 and I am still experiencing fatigue and hot flashes.  I cannot go out and do normal yard work without feeling fatigued. I am unable to put a full day of normal work in due to fatigue. I never, ever, got hot to where I would have to take off my shirt just sitting inside. The only good thing about this second shot vs. the first one was my arm did not hurt as much at the injection spot.

By that afternoon he still had the cramping feeling, and started drinking water as his wife is a nurse and felt that he may be dehydrated.  Throughout the week he had a Charlie Horse pain in his left calf, and felt that it was getting worse and not going away.  The whole week he went to work and on the 7th day it started swelling and went to Hospital after he got off of work, and he saw a resident who said that his leg was swollen and told him that she was going to schedule an ultrasound.  He had that on Friday on 4/16/21, and was scheduled for 4:00 but due to the pain went to the ER and gave him IV and checked his blood work.  The ultrasound showed that he did have a blood clot and prescribed Eliquis and gave him a dose while in the ER.  He told him that he would be on 2 a dat for 7 days  and then 1 a day, but did not tell him how long.  He is supposed to see the resident this afternoon for recheck.   He is still having pain and wanting to know where he is going to do from this point.    He does work out every day at his home gym and has not smoked, and now wanting to know how this is going to affect his life from this point into the future.  He also jumps rope 3 times a day and now not able to do this.

Those symptoms lasted approx 3 days.  Two days after the vaccination I also became extremely nauseous.  I was anticipating all of these symptoms.  On the 3rd and 4th days after the vaccine most of the symptoms disappeared but I received some new ones that I was not expecting.  I suddenly felt a large amount of despair and hopelessness.  I had suicidal thoughts.  I had panic attacks and anxiety.  I had paranoia.  I did not feel like I had long to live, or anything to live for.  By 20 Apr all of these emotional and mental side effects were completely gone.

                                                The evening of the vaccine, Wednesday, I was extremely tired.  By the next day, my right hip and right leg were throbbing.  I have not slept well since the vaccine.  By Friday, I was so sore that I visited a Chiropractor.  By Saturday, I could not stand, sit or lie down without extreme pain.  I called Dr. on his cell and he met us (my wife drove) at his clinic.  After treating me, he sent us to Urgent Care.  At the urgent care facility I received a Toradol shot and a prescription for prednisone.  Both Doctors said that this was a likely &#34;inflammatory response&#34; to the vaccine.  (continued below)

                                                Patient came for his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Before giving the vaccine, I asked the patient if they had any problems with the first dose and they stated that they did not. After giving the vaccine I went back inside the pharmacy to throw away the supplies and his son-in-law called me over to take a look at the patient. The patient had his eyes closed and head tilted back and started shaking for a couple of seconds. I had my technician call 911 at this moment. The patient has lost consciousness and I took the patients mask off to assess and confirm that he was breathing which he was. Upon regaining consciousness the patient was disoriented and sweating. Unfortunately it was difficult to find out how the patient was feeling due to a language barrier. I monitored the patient until the paramedics arrived which they took out the EKG and injected him with an IV. His BP was 107/62, HR in the 70s, and not sure if I overheard correctly but bloodsugar of 163. The EKG report stated that the patient was having a STEMI but when they printed it out there was no ST elevation. The paramedics took care of the situation and took him in for further evaluation.

My arm was getting pretty sore by the time I went to bed (I could not sleep on my left side).  When I woke up, started feeling fuzzy and got the chills.  Took three 325 mg Acetaminophen in the morning.  Was running a low grade fever by lunch time (99.9 degrees) and was feeling like I had the flu.  Joints are sore, head still fuzzy, feel a little light headed when I move around too much.  Took three more 325 Acetaminophen after lunch.  No appetite, stomach feels queasy.  Tired but can&#39;t sleep.  Intend to take more acetaminophen this evening before bed.  Hopefully tomorrow my symptoms will start to go away.

The normal chronic pain levels were elevated and unrelenting causing unusually chronic fatigue, depression, headaches and generally a malaise that continued to intensify daily until I received a scheduled cervical epidural steroid injection on May 5th 2021 at 9;00 am by MD at a medical office. Location in a state. After that treatment was completed all my adverse symptoms subsided entirely by the end of that day, May 5th. I am hesitant and nervous about getting my second shot.

I received a 3-way call today (wednesday) from the pt and his wife who was very concerned.  The pt described feeling like he had been drinking and taking drugs without consuming any such product and just feels like hes in a fog or a dream.  He does not remember receiving the shot 2 days ago and has no memory of the 2 days after the shot.  He thinks that it is Tuesday and it is Wednesday.  He also reports having very weird, lucid dreams/nightmares and hallucinations where he is seeing his surroundings as his work office and thinks he&#39;s at work but is actually at home. I referred pt to urgent care and wife is on her way home to take him in.

                                                Same day as 1st vaccine shot I started getting nauseous after dinner. The next morning I woke up with dizziness, nausea, and muffled hearing in my left ear. The 2nd morning after the vaccine shot my left ear was almost completely muffled and the sounds I did hear were frequency distorted to the point I could not understand verbal speech from that ear. During the course of that day my right ear started getting muffled also. The night between the 2nd and 3rd day after the vaccine shot I woke up around 2 am with a severe case of vertigo while laying flat on my back in bed. I immediately felt hot all over and my entire body started sweating. I attempted to do an Epley maneuver with partial success. I eventually got up and took a Zertec-D and tried a second Epley maneuver on the floor in the living room. I was not able to go back to sleep and I made it through the day and the next night by taking another Zertec-D before bedtime.  The 4th day after the vaccine shot I did not take any medications and just stayed in bed or in a recliner all day. The night between the 4th and 5th day after the shot I again woke up around 3am with the worst vertigo ever and by 6am I told my wife I needed to go to the hospital. During the whole time the dizziness and nausea never abated. I was checked into Hospital on the morning of the 5th day after taking the vaccine shot and was transported to  in  for an MRI.

                                                I began to experience lightheadedness, generalized weakness and confusion. My handwriting changed. These faded over the afternoon only to recur at the same time next morning, resolving in the afternoon once again. I was afraid i was having a heart attack and called 911 and was taken to Hospital where I ruled out for an MI. In the ambulance i received four baby aspirin. I was discharged that night. The next morning, i  developed poor balance and fell twice while walking. Weakness also recurred with confusion. I could not stand myself up. I went to another Hospital and spent the night in Observation. The next morning no symptoms occurred but I refrained from walking as much as possible that day. At hospital I received IV fluid and my usual medications. Neurology consultation revealed possibly abnormal reflexes and poor balance. I received a cane from physical therapy. Since then symptoms have mostly not resolved but weakness and falls have recurred. Evaluation for fall and poor balance continues to date. I received the second dose of the Moderna immunization as scheduled without incident.

                                                The day of the shot, we noticed significant swelling in my neck on the right of center.  The swelling has maintained its size for now six weeks and one day.  I have a dull numbness in my 2-3 smaller toes of my left foot.  Sometimes I feel this numbness in my right foot, but not always.  My left arm and two smallest fingers also feel funny.  There is a dull pain in my left arm and dull numbness in my left smaller fingers.  The outside of my left leg also at times shares this numb feeling.  On the day I got the shot I immediately felt like I had a dose of caffeine, though that feeling passed after a couple of hours.  It did not feel significant enough to keep me from driving or leaving the facility, but it was noticeable. I experienced diarrhea for about a week and a half. For the first week after the shot I alternated nights of not being able to stay still sleeping, keeping me awake almost the entire night, 3 of the first 6 nights.  I visited my family doctor within one week of the first shot.  He advised me not to get the second shot and made note of the swelling in my neck. I visited him at five weeks because the swelling in my neck and numb feeling has not changed.  He scheduled a CT Scan which has been scheduled.

                                                Approximately 2-3 hours after getting shot I started to feel flush my temperature was slightly higher than my normal at 98.9 (my normal is about 97.7). I also felt a little tired, I work 2nd shift so I went to work as normal. About 4 or 5pm the fatigue started to worsen and it was difficult to do my job I also felt nauseous, I struggled to finish my shift because of the fatigue. When I came home at 11pm I went straight to bed. When I awoke in the morning the fatigue was worse and it was difficult to stay awake but the nausea had passed. I was extremely tired all day until about 8pm or so when the fatigue started to lessen. By the next morning I was still a little tired but I could resume my normal schedule although I felt like I didn&#39;t get a good nights sleep. By Saturday morning (20th) I was not feeling any adverse effects.  I have sleep apnea which I forgot to list on medical conditions and I can&#39;t go backwards on the form so I am including it here.

I still feel like I have a temp.  Also headache and I felt a little nauseous this time.

                                                In a nutshell, patient was fine, got the first shot of the Moderna Vaccine on 3/24/21, then began to exhibit many covid-like symptoms starting around 4 hours later but 3 times nasal swap tested negative for COVID19 including before and after vaccination. Suffered with various attempts at treatments and tests for approximately a month and then was admitted to the ER at hospital on 4/28/21.  Wife (former smoker who lives in same house and has lung problems) who took the vaccine at the same time from the same lot suffered minor arm pain, aches and pains and fatigue but was fine the next day.  Patient (59) had normal blood pressure and clear lungs in good health, non-smoker, good weight, exercises regularly and strenuously, good diet, rarely gets ill. He works as a ship?s captain and engineer and has worked in boatyards for years doing physical work. Has tintinnitis and in one eye, glaucoma drops but is on no other prescription medicines. Details: March: had nasal congestion, cough and suspected bronchitis, aches and pains, no fever, PCR tested negative for COVID19, and was treated with antibiotics (azithromycin and then a run of amoxycillin), proair, advair discuss a couple of days, various vitamins/minerals, over the counter cold/flu medicines. Seemed to work with most symptoms going away prior to Marcch 24, 2021. March 24, 2021 morning: Got first shot of the Moderna Vaccine at pharmacy. Lot 045A21A at same time as spouse. That morning had no cough and felt ok. Approximately 4 hours later, patient started to cough, felt congested, felt like flu/pneumonia, trouble breathing, aches and pains especially in joints, extreme fatigue, headache, (but suffered no loss of taste or smell throughout 3/24-present) took Theraflu and went to bed early, slept well. Following days, struggled with intensifying symptoms. Felt like the vaccine gave him covid symptoms without the loss of smell/taste.  Spouse experienced minor pain at point of injection, some fatigue, aches and pains which went away by end of next day 3/25/21. Spouse had some lingering cough left over from earlier bronchitis before getting the vaccine which cough/congested breathing continued with no noticeable change. [Spouse was also not adversely impacted by the second shot of Moderna vaccine a month later.) Apr Wk1 &amp; Wk2: Increasing difficulty sleeping due to lung congestion or suddenly waking up wide awake for no reason. At end of Wk2, had some minor tremors in muscles for a couple of days. Suffered from extreme fatigue, congestion, trouble breathing, nightmares, aches and pains. Took azithromycin run then a run of amoxicillin, proair, prednisone, albuterol nebulizer, occasional Theraflu or over-the-counter cold/flu medicines, vitamins/minerals (including heavier doses of Vitamin D, Zinc, C, etc.), probiotic acidophilus, tonic water with quinine or Perrier, melatonin 10mg and magnesium 500mg at night, occasionally a Unisom sleeping pill. Started to lose appetite where rarely hungry. Would force himself to eat anyway, but occasionally vomited it up. Apr Wk3 4/13/21: Patient got another PCR covid test which was negative, chest xray, blood work done at Urgent Care. Showed some elevated liver/kidney enzymes and low red blood cell count/anemia, vague thickening of the plura, swollen lymphnode in the chest xray, no sign of cardiovascular issue. (Some yellow flags but nothing flashing red.) Dr. recommended followup tests and bloodwork and that he get GI/Cardio/pulmonary workups w/specialists. Patient continued to take antibiotics, pregnizone, albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals, and occasional cold/flu/cough medicines, etc. Added SuperB Complex. One day he had hot/cold chills for a few hours. Apr Wk4: While lungs felt clearer, still coughing and now occasionally vomiting productively or dry heaves, insomnia grew into bigger issue with hallucinations not just with nightmares but occasionally during the day where it was difficult to separate reality from dream, trouble remembering, started to feel paranoid/irrational sometimes, trouble sleeping was not due to lung congestion but more due to panic-attack like heavy breathing or sudden central chest/sternum pain (maybe from coughs), aches in joints, but biggest problem was extreme fatigue and tiring when walking up a flight of stairs, etc. Took some Tramadol occasionally for pain relief (but never with aspirin, Tylenol or cold medicine). Could be sitting comfortably watching a mellow tv program but suddenly need to breathe really heavy, hyperventilating and felt need to standup and walk around until it eased. Extreme trouble sleeping. Most comfortable position was kneeling with body bent over a pillow on the bed. [He&#39;d never had panic-attacks/heavy breathing issues before the Moderna shot and doesn&#39;t abuse substances.] Wk5: 4/24/21 feet swelled up and turned purple on the soles. Went for a walk around the block and raised feet. No longer on antibiotics or pregnizone, only taking the albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals/probiotics, melatonin and a OTC cough/flu medicine before bed. Knelt for hours while trying to sleep. 4/25/21, feet more swollen with fluid and more discolored. When searched online, they looked like &#34;covid toes&#34;. Took no medicines except nebulizer and took only a couple of vitamins/calcium-vitaminD and before bed a beer, melatonin, magnesium &amp; nyquil. 4/26/21, feet less swollen and no longer purple except a small line on the side of one foot. Patient indicated he had not knelt when trying to sleep prone during night. But only got a couple of hours of sleep, nighttime hallucinations and panic-breathing attacks. Daytime inability to focus, extreme fatigue, aches and pains, quick to tire on any exertion, vomiting food or dry heaves 2 or 3 times that day, panic-like-attacks with need to heavy breathe/hyperventilate. Wheezing with occasional rattle at end. Coughs sometimes productive, sometimes not but lungs didn?t feel very congested and oxygenation/blood pressure was good. 4/27/21, went to work in morning and was able to perform but very tired. In early afternoon, came home, ate, took nyquil and nebulizer and tried to sleep. 4/28/21, felt much worse, feet and knees swollen, extreme exhaustion, felt miserable. Went to work anyway. Came home around 2pm, ate. Felt much worse so we went to the ER at Hospital. Spouse provided MMC with his medical conditions, medicines, the info on COVID IGG serology test and informed them of the chest xrays and bloodwork that had been done at the Urgent Care center 2 weeks prior. ER indicated he needed to stay overnight and they performed additional bloodwork, xrays, scans and MRIs. The ER doctor called in specialists in Nephrology and Cardiology to provide consultations.

After about 9 hours from getting the shot I got a headache that turned in to the worst migraine I&#39;ve ever had in my life that lasted over 30 hours. I had a fever that ranged from 101F to 103F that has lasted for more than 30 hours, I also developed severe muscle and joint pain so much so that I could only get out of bed to go to the bathroom and that was with great pain. I also have had nausea that has lasted over 36 hours. I took Tylenol (1000mg) every few hours, 4 times with out relief. I also took a Tramadol which helped a little with the pain but then my fever spiked for a few hours. I&#39;m now on day 2 of bed rest and waiting for the symptoms to subside so I can get back to my regular life.
