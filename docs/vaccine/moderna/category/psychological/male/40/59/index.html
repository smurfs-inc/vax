I am on day 2 of having to take breathing treatments.  Had fever as high as 102  degrees.  I have been sweating profusely for 3 days.  I had one night of hallucinating dreams and hardly slept at all.  I had all of the general side effects, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills.  I had a rapid heartbeat.

                                                I received the vaccine 30 min. prior to starting my shift as a Nurse in the ED. About 1 hour after receiving the shot while standing I felt off balance and began to have a vertigo like dizziness. I sat down and tried to drink some water but began spitting the water back up and dry heaving after trying to drink. I did not feel nauseous if I was not drinking. I did feel the sensation of a slight lump in my throat. I did not have any shortness of breath, tachycardia,  rash or fever. I did not want to check in as a patient so I called my wife to come and pick me up from work. Before I left I had the pharmacy send me some Pepcid and Benadryl and I took 25mg of Benadryl and 20mg of Pepcid before leaving. I left work around 1400 and now at 1500 I am able to drink fluids. The slight lump in my throat seems to have improved. I still feel a little dizzy and off balance.

There is a charlie horse like feeling in my left cheek, which is now also present in my left jaw. The left side of my tongue is numb with slight pain, and my bottom lip is numb on the left side, and the feeling stops at the middle like there were a line drawn down my face.  My upper left cheek and the side of my left eye have a constant,  moderate burning feeling.  The shot was in my left arm.  The Dr. at urgent care said it was not a stroke, so that&#39;s good.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  It has now been over 13 hours.

Then around 8am I started to have chills which then I checked my temp and it was 101.0 degrees F. Then I started to get a headache and severe body aches. Around 3pm I tried to eat something which I then threw it up. I tried to drink water and flavored water which I also threw up the water. I also went into the bathtub 7 times that day to stop the chills. Which it did but right when I got out they started again which then I felt worse. Around 11pm 1/23/2021 I ended up going into the ER which then they gave me IV fluids and then Benadryl and Toradol by IV. After those were administered I started feeling better which then I was discharged and went home.

By 6:00 AM the chills were intense, weakness, having less coordination and depth perception issue.  Closer to 9:00-10:00 AM felt like he had the flu 10 times worse than he should have.  Had COVID in April/May but these symptoms worse.  Got home at 11:15 AM was so cold, hands were ice cold, and took 2 hours of sleeping and all layers of clothing to feel warm.  Took a few layers off and still shaking, feverish and feeling of worse flu to man. Pain all over the body, temperature at 3:30 is 99.5-100.4, above 98 is fever is fever for him, normal is 96-97.  Sharp shooting muscle pains in extremities, top part of the hands, muscles, tendons, and also his legs and feet, but not fingers or toes.  Pain is quite intense.  All he wants to do is lay down in sleep.   Thought he was going to freeze to death.  Hands were so cold his kids were concerned.  Ice packs on chest, and gloves and 10 layers on hands and arms.  Had tremendous trouble breathing while having the intense chills.    He is a responder for law enforcement.   Symptoms have improved some, but still feeling feverish with shooting pains, depth perception issues, as well as pain.  Headache in back of head, pressure type.  Called off for work for today and tomorrow.

I didn&#39;t think much of it but it stayed slightly irritated. About 1am, as I prepared for bed, it had become red and was quite irritated. I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night and my eye was quite irritated and it was filled with tears. The next two days it remained irritated in this way, red and painful. As of now (over 48 hours later), it is still red and irritated.

Pt agreed to this. Transport to ED via EMS was offered and pt declined as he had a driver. Informed pt that I could not make him go via EMS but I did recommend it. Pt expressed understanding but thought that he would be fine with it being as close as it is and him being the passenger, so he again declined transport via EMS. They were instructed to proceed directly to the ED for further Eval.

I examined the pt through the car window and listened to his heart and lungs. Pt was not in respiratory distress and heart rate and rhythm were regular. Reassurance was provided to the pt, but he was also told that to be safe I recommended that he be evaluated in the emergency department and that he be transported via ambulance. Pt expressed understanding and agreed to going to the ED but was refusing transport via EMS. Pt was the passenger in the vehicle and he said that the driver could just take him. I expressed that transport via EMS would be the safest but we could not make him go via EMS and that if they wanted to leave via private vehicle then they could but i still recommended that he be evaluated in the ED. He expressed understanding and that he would go directly to the ED via personal car.

                                                It has been 6 weeks since my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. For the first 3-4 days I had the usual moderate flu-like symptoms:  dizziness, headaches, fatigue, chills, soreness at vaccine siteetc.  Days 5-7 I seemed to gradually improve. On day 8 all of the symptoms returned with greater severity: this time I had a fever, the chills were much more intense, the headaches were excruciating, body and joint aches all over the place--I couldn&#39;t sleep or focus on anything cognitively taxing.  Interestingly, my brother, who was vaccinated just after me, also had more severe side effects beginning on day 8 post 2nd dose. He improved after 3-4 days, but my recovery has been much much lengthier. By day 14 I was still feeling very ill, though the fever did subside.  Sometime in the third week the pain in my arm at the vaccination site returned, then became intermittent, and still bothers me from time to time. I also started getting muscle spasms in the same exact locations that sent me to the ER after my probably bout with Covid in the spring of 2020. Thankfully these lasted only a week or so, though I began feeling muscle soreness in different parts of my body, ever changing. By the 4th week I was slightly better and down to 4 main symptoms: chills (by far the worst of the symptoms--to the point at which my skin would feel like it was being frostbitten by dry ice every time I changed sweaty clothes), occasional splitting headaches, and muscle soreness that included both the injection site on my arm and other areas.  I had other symptoms as well, fatigue and brain fog, etc, but these were present before the vaccination, though not as severe.

Second day is a little better with a little more mobility, but trying to undress and undress is torture, especially lifting my arm over my head or past my chest.

The next day I was so exhausted I couldn&#39;t work for 2 days.  I barely got out of bed until about 40 hours after the shot where I was able to get out and do some gardening.   The reason I am filling this out was at right around 72 hours after the vaccine, I was laying down watching a YouTube video feeling quite relaxed.  I then experienced a tachycardia event where my heart rate went up to 120 and stayed there for about an hour.  I remained calm and was not experiencing anxiety, but the heart rate persisted.  I have had this happen before in panic attacks, but it&#39;s quite rare and I am in acute, high level stress.    Almost 2 weeks later to the day, I had another tachycardia, stronger than any I&#39;ve had my entire life that only lasted about 7 seconds, but I would estimate my heart rate jumped to over 250.   I thought I was going to go into cardiac arrest it was so jarring.  I&#39;m not sure if that one was related to the vaccine.

                                                On 4/8/21 awoke to intense pain in his left foot about 12 hours after receiving his 1st dose Moderna vaccine batch #038B21A. Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

I couldnt get out of bed: 1) Extreme heart palpitations, my heart rate monitor was reading an extremely high stress activity for 2 days post shot. 2) Very Hot and Very Cold body chill and temp swings 3) Sweating profusely, I soaked through my pajamas on 3 different occasions when I woke up from napping. 4) My pee was orange and hurt to pee. 5) My entire body hurt the worst I&#39;ve ever felt 6) All my joints were super painful, it hurt to walk and I couldn&#39;t sleep due to the pain. 7) I had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

Then I rapidly spiked a 102.7 fever and became so physically weak I felt paralyzed. Oxygen saturation dropped into the low 90s and I began to have labored breathing. I made an attempt to stand up and urinate, then passed out and collapsed. Ems came to the house and checked me out. I declined their offer to go to the hospital because I broke the fever, was breathing better, and had no concussion signs from the fall.

The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

No treatment was needed.    On January 1st I noticed tingling  in both of my legs.   Since then it has gotten worse.  I have tingling in both legs, muscle twitching throughout both legs intermittently, muscle weakness specifically after muscle use, an abnormal skin sensitivity when wearing pants, and a consistent ache throughout my legs.  The symptoms affect me 24 hours a day and create an anxiety that I have not felt before.  It has also adversely affected my sleep.

                                                Sudden fast heart/pounding  rate about 30 min after vaccination. Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

Had a glass of water and resolved. Evaluated by doctor and had pulse of 92 (high for patient) and elevated blood pressure 148/92. Rest of vitals normal. Felt anxious.

His Apple Watch told him he was in afib.  So the patient was taken to the ER by his wife where this was confirmed with an EKG.  He was cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm and he was prescribed Eliquis.  Patient has no prior heart arrhythmias or medical concerns.  Patient is slightly overweight, but has not had any arrhythmia or history of a fib in the past.  Patient was discharged to follow up with his family physician.  All of his blood work was normal.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

BP first reading in left arm was 235/130 with a HR around 130. Second reading was 205/120 with HR in 120&#39;s about 4 min later.  I requested an ambulance due to the feeling of being very unwell and dizzy.  Trouble concentrating.    Ambulance ride was 190/112 ish EKG and BP monitoring at hospital.   No anaphalaxis diagnosed but unknown cause.   ER discharge after benadryl.    BP and HR would continue to cycle up and down for the next  18 hours.   Red spot formed about 2 inches away from where I was injected.      PCP and allergist thin it was an intravascular injection.

                                                I received my first Covid-19 Moderna injection and felt slightly groggy and tired as the day progressed. Just before bed I noticed my arm was quite sore and I still felt tired and slightly light headed. The next day (Feb 4) I had a very sore left arm at the injection site but felt good otherwise. I came home from work and took one 200mg Ibuprofen as my arm was still quite sore. The following day (Feb 5) my arm pain subsided but I still felt light headed during the evening. I am writing this on Feb. 18th and each day I have bouts of being light headed and have difficulty concentrating. There is no real pattern to what time of day I get the symptoms. I do not have the classic headache but definitely feel pressure in my head and behind my eyes. I also find that I wake up after a full nights sleep and feel not well rested. I spoke with my doctor last week and he suggested I give it until this week to see where things are at. I plan on contacting him soon to schedule an appointment to discuss my symptoms more. Before getting the vaccine I did not have any of these symptoms as I describe.

About midnight March 16 severe chills, restlessness, headache, muscle aches, nauseous and fever of 101.  Took two extra-strength Tylenol. 3 a.m. fever broke with sweats. Headache and body ache remained, as did chills. Took two Advil when I woke up about 7 a.m. on  March 16 for a headache. But I was too tired and achy to get out of bed. The fever came back to 102 degrees. Nauseous, couldn&#39;t eat much. Headache. At 2:30 p.m. on March 16, I felt better...  I was very tired the night of March 16 and still had a minor headache and went to bed about  8 p.m. On March 17, I was back to normal with only a very minor headache and some diahreaha that morning and afternoon.  I did not take any medicine that day. On March 18 I had no symptoms at all. I am a very healthy 42-year-old adult. I would classify my reaction as significant, but not severe. I called in sick to work (and I work from home). So it was enough to take me out of a day.

                                                Arm hurt after shot, I waited the 15 minutes and nothing else happened so I went home. On way home my lips started to tingle a bit and I felt warmer over my body. I got home and felt exhausted for multiple days but on the first day I could not sleep. By the weekend I was just worn out and slept all day the following Sat and Sunday.  My arm hurt so bad I couldn?t lay on it and I even  today either have phantom arm pain or real arm pain. But I know where the shot was because I feel it. It still feels like a deep tissue bruise.

                                                One week after the shot, I developed a red, slightly swollen area around 2 inches in diameter at the injection site (left shoulder).  My shoulder itched greatly for about a day.  The redness went away in about a day and the itchiness subsided over the next 2-3 days. I continued to feel strange sensations in my shoulder and arm for several days.

                                                On 12/24, at 8:30a I began to get nauseated  which lasted about 2hrs. Around 1am I woke  up with SOB which continued thru the night, with off and on sleep. I woke back up at 5:45am, went to work with the SOB which lasted until 12N and resolved on its own.  Around 3-330pm I began to feel feverish and had chills and was told I was disoriented.  My temp was 100.5, HR 122 R 34 BP 170/100 O2-93%. I notified the DON of my feelings who advised me those were possible side effects of the vaccine and made me continue to work until I just couldnt take the feelings anymore and went to the ER.  I was there for about 2 hrs and my body began to calm down.  I took taken 100mg of Tylenol on my own just to help with the fever which did break shortly and I have been fine every since. I was positive for COVID 12/14.

I could feel the middle of myself from my scalp to my toes.

The following two days my arm was sore at the injection site but that went away in a couple days.  3 days post vaccination, my right axilla and median and ulnar nerves were extremely sensitive for 3 days but that subsided.  6 days post vaccine I started to get extreme fatigued, low energy and feel like my nerves were hot.  I got a covid test which was negative because I was not feeling well.  Then 9 days post vaccine I started to feel very fatigued, achey, and I couldn?t sleep well and like my nerves were burning up all over my body.  I had to call out of work due to brain fog, fatigue, nerve heat, difficulty concentrating.  I took my temperature during all this and it was 97.7.  My hands felt very hot and I could wash them under warm water because the water felt way too hot.

Brain fog became concern at 8 pm. Mild Difficulty navigating grocery store.  Extreme soreness has withstood 3 ibuprofen (x2 doses) and today took 1 hydrocodine in cabinet.  Brain fog has continued and not improved. Moderate forgetting.   Definitely not able to work today (Sunday) and doubt I will be able to work tomorrow. I am private practice dr. and will probably loose substantial income tomorrow. Completely NOT worth it and concerning with the brain fog. I strongly regret the second shot.  No symptoms after 1st shot.  The dose should be immediately reduced for 2nd shot. This strong of an immune response is not necessary.

                                                On Wednesday 1/27 the day after my second dose I felt a minor pinch/discomfort  on my lower leg.  I did not think much of that is reason I did not report it right away.  Day by day the discomfort and pain got worse.  Exactly one week after my second dose I was not able to sleep due to the pain.  On Wednesday 2/3 I decided to go urgent care.  From there I was referred for an ultra sound a few hours after.  After the ultra sound I was contacted by my doctor, letting me know that the results showed I had a blood clot on my left leg.  I was put on Eliquis medicine right away.  On 2/5 I was able to physically see my doctor who told me that this was caused by the second dose of the moderne vaccine that I took on 1/26.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

He didn&#39;t sleep well, and this morning his sleep app indicated his heart rate during the night was between 100-110.  After noticing his heart rate was between 130-140, he called the clinic and was told to go to the ER.  Hospital ER administered several tests and did blood work. The MD&#39;s determined his heart was fine and it is likely vaccine related.  He is home again and is feeling better (no chills, etc.) and his resting heart rate is now in the low-90&#39;s.

There is no history of either moderate side effect. There is no obvious explanation (e.g. a fall) that explains the knee bursitis.

                                                After 24 hours, I started having body aches, that night couldn&#39;t sleep I took Ibuprofen it helped, over the weekend I kept taking Ibuprofen. Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

Unusually I dont get sick from much pretty much anything and the first shot I had no reaction whatsoever. I contacted my doctor who told me its perfectly normal - itll go in 24 hours max but the same constant hot / cold, tired / headache went on for 60 hours straight, by the end of it I didnt have a clue where I was with sleep because every time I slept it was only for 10 - 30 mins max at a time but I slept a lot. The headache felt like a hangover headache and that continued for another 3 days. My wife had no adverse reaction other than sore arm. Really would have appreciated knowing that it may have me off work for a few days - first time off work sick in 3 years lol - dont want to repeat that feeling again

                                                I believe I had a mental episode on Tuesday.  I researched this database and saw that there were 3 cases of aggression reported, and that sort of describes my mental state.  My direct supervisor on Monday did have a discussion about a not up to par job performance as of late.  When I got into work on Tuesday, I found myself in a mental state that I have never felt before.  I was stewing in my office, practically seething over what happened.  I convinced myself that I was going to be fired.  I aggressively had a discussion with my supervisor around 8AM.  Over the next 4 hours I started having incredibly irrational thoughts and felt like the walls were caving in around me.  I aggresively and angrily discussed the situation with my HR manager, told her I had to get out and think about what I wanted to do.  I emailed my boss an agressive email and stormed out.  I was subsequently fired around 1PM on Tuesday.  Although there were some obvious other things going on, I truly believe that I was in a mental state of agression, anxiety and irrationality that I have never felt before.  I am typically a laid back person and it takes way more than what happened to make me upset.  I woke up this morning, feeling much clearer headed wondering what I did and how things happened the way they did.  I do believe there is a good chance I had some sort of mental state change due to my second vaccine dose.  I did not seek medical attention for this episode.  After my first vaccine dose I only felt tired.  After my second dose, I felt mildly fluish for about 12 hours the day after taking the shot.  Nothing else happened.

At around 9:00 AM on Saturday 4/3/2021, I was awakened by intense pain and pressure that felt like the worst heartburn I&#39;d ever experienced. After OTC heartburn treatments didn&#39;t help, at around 11:00 AM I went to the local ER where I was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack. After being given some baby aspirin and a nitro tablet, I started feeling better and was airlifted immediately to a nearby cardiology unit at another hospital. A heart catheterization and EKGs determined that I had not had a heart attack, but instead had takotsubo cardiomyopathy. I was admitted into the cardiac ICU overnight for observation, transferred to a non-critical room the next day (4/4/2021), and released on Monday 4/5/2021.

                                                Fever after second dose; thought about taking his life; went through an intense depression and started to cry; headaches were intense and extreme; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of SUICIDAL IDEATION (thought about taking his life) in a 43-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 020B21A and 001A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.   On 07-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 02-Apr-2021, the patient experienced HEADACHE (headaches were intense and extreme). On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SUICIDAL IDEATION (thought about taking his life) (seriousness criterion life threatening) and DEPRESSION (went through an intense depression and started to cry). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PYREXIA (Fever after second dose). On 10-Apr-2021, SUICIDAL IDEATION (thought about taking his life) and DEPRESSION (went through an intense depression and started to cry) had resolved. At the time of the report, HEADACHE (headaches were intense and extreme) had resolved and PYREXIA (Fever after second dose) outcome was unknown.            No adverse event as Medical History was reported. Treatment included acetaminophen.  Concomitant medication was not reported.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

He reported he went to his primary care provider later that afternoon.  He was examined clinically and was told that the shot was administered too high up in his arm in the Gleno Humeral Joint.  He was advised to take over the counter pain medication and to call if he needs something stronger.  He was given a follow up appointment on 2/5/2021 with the provider. He was told to monitor for infection in the next 48 hours and they are hoping it did not go into the joint capsule.  Continued to have severe pain.  Went to orthopedic specialist the next day.  Admitted to hospital for pain control and steroids.  MRI of shoulder inconclusive, but think severe bursitis and being treated as such.  Discharged from hospital and resting at home.  Arm range of motion at 80%-hoping to return to work in 2 weeks (firefighter/EMT).

                                                My left deltoid muscle is still aching at 7 weeks after this first injection.  I first noticed after 5-6 days when the expected initial pain of the shot subsided. I thought it would go away soon, but only realized that it would not when my right shoulder was fine 3 days after my 2nd shot. I have received my 2nd COVID vaccine 4 weeks after on Feb 9 in the right deltoid. There is no aching or adverse effects in my right arm at the time of this report.  I have reason to believe that the first shot was given too high in the left shoulder and possible SIRVA is the result in my left deltoid shoulder joint.   I use ibuprofen 800mg 3x daily, and that doesn?t take all the aching away. It is a persistent ache that doesn?t interfere with my ability to work, yet it limits my ability to do upper body exercises.

                                                An hour or so after receiving my first Moderna shot, I was aware of an unusual feeling in my lower right abdomen.  Knowing this to be a potential problem area for Appendicitis I paid attention to it for the next day and there was no change.  Two days after receiving the  vaccine shot this sensation got worse and I was visibly bloated.  I went to an Urgent Care where a doctor referred me to the closest ER due to the area of pain and bloat in my body.   After several blood tests and an MRI at the ER, it was determined that my appendix was inflamed and I was admitted to the hospital for surgery ASAP.   Luckily the appendix was stable, never burst and was successfully removed the following day in the early afternoon.   I am currently at home recovering successfully.

                                                Experienced severe pain in the right shoulder/bicep area, the opposite arm from the injection (injection was given in the left arm). Pain became worse and worse as days went on, and eventually limited what I can use the arm for. I can not raise it up past my rib cage with severe pain. After speaking with a friend who is a doctor, they mentioned Parsonage Turner Syndrome and Brachial neuritis, all the symptoms match the discriptions of those. I immediately started using a Tens unit to help stimulate the shoulder and arm area, began ice treatment and taking tylenol for the pain. The doctor in the office I work at after listening to the issue and symptoms said the same thing and started me on Gabapentin to help with the nerve pain and is going to continue to monitor the symptoms. It has been 46 days since getting the 2nd shot, and I have been at a 8 to a 9 out of 10 pain-wise almost 24/7, it has affected my ability to work and i have had to call in a few days because of the pain and being unable to use my right arm proficiently (I am right handed), it has affected my family and my ability to get things done around the house and engage my children and it has affected my ability to get a good sleep.

Fell asleep and woke up soaking wet. Next day I still had a fever. Had chills and my body got warm. This went off and on throughout the day. I was exhausted. At night I had a bloody nose. Went to bed and woke up wet again but not as bad as the first night. Morning time I felt fine. Went to the gym and the sauna. Started to exercise and felt lighted headed and cloudy. Went home laid down. I still feel weird on and off.  Went to the bathroom and had black stool. My right arm is still sore.

                                                At 12:30  i was lying in bed and started getting more and more restless.  I could feel something happening with my body on the inside like a storm.  I got up to use the bathroom and had a syncopal episode about halfway to bathroom. Fell and i came to immediately when my name was called.  I got back into bed.  My lips were white.  I still felt lightheaded but could breathe freely and easily.  There was no noticeable swelling impairing my breathing.  Initially i could not get a reading on my pulse oximeter.  After a few minutes it worked and by then i was at 95%. I suspect the oxygen was quite low prior to that.  For the next day i had a fever and farigue.  The day after that I had some lingering fatigue but no fever.  Right now I am not planning to get the second shot in the series.

Pharmacist and another associate helped patient up who was conscious. He asked what happened and if he were standing.  He shared that everything went pitch black.  He was placed on chair; pharmacist asked if he wouldl like to lie down and he declined. He stated he had felt nervous and scared about imz before his appointment. Patient did cut his lip in fall and was given napkins for bleeding and a cold compress for face and neck. Patient waited with us for 2 hours. His BP was 154-74 and pulse of 54 ; patient stated he was a runner with low pulse. Patient arranged for a ride from family member since he lived far and was not sure about driving. I recommend that he place a call in with his provider.

                                                I have had a low grade fever (99.5)  for a week now.  I have had insomnia since the night of the injection.  EVERY night I wake up hot 3 hours after I went to sleep.  I have never gotten the chills, only hot.   I usually need to take a sleep aid to get back to sleep which is NOT normal for me.   Many times I wake up again 3 hours later even after the sleep aid hot.   My lack of sleep has really been hard on my daytime working and living at this point.  When I wake at night hot my temperature is usually 99.5, but has been a bit lower at times too.   I also feel that I have rapid heart rate at this time (when I try to fall back asleep)  and it seems as if my heart is beating harder than normal.  I also feel a buzzing in my head like I drank too much coffee type of feeling.  The first couple of days I felt tired and weak and a bit achy throughout the day.  The next few days after that I felt dizzy and light headed with a headache.  The first few days I also noticed slight muscle spasms throughout my arms and torso particularly when I laid down at night to go to bed and was still and relaxed.  I have been taking over the counter pain/fever pills usually for the headache.  I contacted my doctor and he said to give it a week.  It has been a week yesterday, but Dr is closed for weekends and Fridays.  I went to urgent care on Friday and they were not helpful (virtually).  They said give it 5 more days!!!!!   I am extremely tired of this and worried at how long it has been.  NOBODY I know with the first shot has had this reaction.  My wife is nervous as well and we would really like to hear something that may ease our minds at this point.  Some explanation as to why my body may be reacting this way, or if any others have had this same situation.

                                                After receiving my shot, I waited the half an hour. I felt a pinch in my head and tightness in shoulders and neck. Once I reached the parking lot I was belching ridiculously and started feeling like vomiting. Than my chest hurt.  Went back to the clinic and said I don&#39;t feel right.  They had me stand in line and wait to be re-admitted.  The nurse starting taking blood pressure and offered me water I could not swallow the tiniest amount.  My neck felt like I was being chocked. My fingers on my left arm started tingling and arm was getting slightly red and arm felt heavy. The nurse said my symptoms were happening internally.  The doctor had me remove my mask and looked at the back of my mouth. Than used a stethoscope on my chest and the back.  Asked  if I had asthma , said no. He Than requested epinephrine shot and a steroid. With in a few seconds I started feeling like I could breathe. He prescribed an epinephrine pen incase I had another episode. Two day later I had another visit online with doctor from about redness on left and right arm. Having another allergic reaction and possible site infection. Now I&#39;m taking 10 days antibiotics and allergy medicine.

                                                I woke up at 11:30 and was hallucinating and very angry and violent.  I was  extremely red in my face could of had a temperature.  I was yelling at my wife and children.  This is very out of character for me and woke up this morning and had trouble recalling all the events of the previous night until my wife informed me of them.

                                                Note:  I had a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March, 2020.  Approximately 12 hours after the second vaccine dose, I experienced intense soreness at the vaccination site (significantly greater than the first dose).  In the middle of the night I awoke with flu-like symptoms.  At 9am I took acetominophen  for fever, rigors, muscle aches.  This brought mild relief from approx. 9:45am to 11:15 am.  My condition continued to worsen through the early afternoon with rigors and significant generalized muscle aches.  I experienced tachycardia (90-105 bpm vs normal of ~70bpm),  SOB,  and starting measuring pulse oximetry which read from 89%-94% (my usual does not go below 97%).  This persisted until approximately 8pm with no improvement.  I took 40 mg prednisone, 600 mg ibuprofen and within 3 hours was starting to have symptom resolution. I am a physician and up to date on all my vaccinations.  I have never had anything approaching this type of response.  I don&#39;t know if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection  creates a situation were the very potent mRNA vaccine triggers a large immunologic recall response.  I wanted to get this noted as there may be some reason to alter the vaccine schedule for prior SARS-CoV-2 infections

                                                At 2:00 am the following morning after my 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine I started experiencing a severe headache and body pains.  My left arm was sore and difficult to lift which is the arm I received the shot in.  Throughout the day I have continued to have a headache, body pains and developed a fever up to 101.00.  I have also felt nauseous at times and at one point threw up some of the Gatorade that I had a little while earlier.  So to summarize, all in all, I feel absolutely terrible.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

                                                EXTREME chills and fever.  Alternated 4 or 5 cycles.  Woke up with having thrown off my blankets and had to get ice packs and open windows to cool down enough to sleep, a few hours later woke up SHIVERING like I never have before.  I thought I was convulsing until I realized I could control it with my breathing. I was shivering so hard that I bit my tongue several times.  I didn&#39;t have much energy so it took several minutes before I could grab blankets and even longer before I could close the window.  I was wrapped in several layers of blankets and was still shivering until I fell asleep.  I woke up again and my blankets were soaked in my sweat.  This cycle got more and more intense until the next day.  *I&#39;ve been hospitalized with pneumonia and this felt 100 times worse. The next day, I had the worst diarrheic that I&#39;ve ever had, sudden urge.. barely made it to toilet and INSTANTLY discharged what felt like a gallon of brown liquid (it was probably less but felt pretty nasty).

No other pain the day of injection. Day after injection (approximately 18 hours later) the entire right arm ached; then the aching moved to the lower back and eventually both legs. Pain resolved at approximately 30 hours after injection; ache never affected left (non-injected) arm.  Minor headache seemed to be forming, but never progressed past the initial indications. Was extremely tired the day following the injection; took two naps (1-2 hours each) and slept 12 hours that night (i.e., injected Friday, tired all day Saturday and slept longer than normal Saturday night). Aside from soreness at injection point, no further signs/symptoms on Sunday (i.e., resolved around 36 hours after injection).

Around 9:30pm that evening, I began to feel fatigued and had a slight headache. I went to bed around10:15-10:30pm. Shortly after going to bed, my headache  worsened and I began having chills. I was a bit restless that night and just did not feel well. These symptoms lasted until about 8am the following morning, 12/24/2020. I was still fatigued and still had a headache, which had lessened in intensity. I no longer had chills. The fatigue wore off throughout the day, but I still had a slight headache. Later in the evening I again became fatigued and still had a slight headache. The following day, my headache subsided, and I was only tired once evening came around. My symptoms had completely dissipated by 12/26/2020.

                                                2-3 min after vaccination he started feeling tingling in the right side of his face. About one minute later he felt like he could not get a full breath and he felt the need to run away. We connected a heart monitor, did serial vital signs, listen to lung sounds. He symptoms seem to worsen. He did not have hives, his lungs were clear. His HR was normal but his B/P was elevated. We started and IV and gave him 25 mg mg of IV Benadryl. We contacted Dr. via phone. He talked to the patient and he agreed with our assessment and treatment.  He began feeling better about 10 min after the Benadryl and he symptoms cleared by 30 min after Benadryl. We kept him on the heart monitor for 1 hour.  He reported he felt fine and back to normal when he left to go home. He refused ambulance transport to the hospital. All reports will be filled out by me.

Interferes with sleep, regardless of position (&amp; unable to lie on left side).  Unable to elevate shoulder overhead into flexion or abduction d/t pain (limited to ~45 degrees).  Tenderness over lateral shoulder/SIT tendons.  Positive impingement sign.  Seems to be tendon/shoulder injury d/t faulty injection technique.  I had minimal shoulder soreness after the first injection.

                                                About 3-5 minutes after getting the vaccine began experiencing a light headedness feeling. Took my blood pressure and it was a little high (140/95), I attributed this to anxiety but got home and my BP at home was down to about 120/76 about 1 hr. after. I laid down to sleep it off but could not sleep as about 1 hr. after trying to go to sleep I started to get a headache. After about 2 hours of battling it I decided to take a Extra Strength Tylenol which helped with the headache about 2 hrs later is was almost gone but the feeling of lightheadedness/dizziness was still there a bit worse than at the beginning. I slept it off and the next morning it was about 50 % better and by about noon it seemed to be 99% better. Today is Thursday ( on my 3rd day) and still feel a slight dizziness but I also have seasonal allergies which sometimes give me the same symptoms. I expect to be better soon.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

Concerned, sweating,  Bp was very high at that point. Don&#39;t have the exact number. Called for ambulance, paramedics ruled out WPW and gave me iv drug that brought rate down to 120 fairly quickly, Over the next hours resting rate slowly normalized to around 80 (normal for me is 72).  For 2-3 days afterwards had some high resting pulses up to 118 but never as bad and normalized in a few days.

                                                A few minutes after the shot i started getting dizzy. it increased with intensity so i flagged down an attendant for help. I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

This did not start going down until today.  I am not intending on seeking medical attention.    I ran very high fevers that were not able to be taken down by Tylenol right away.    I was out of my head with a little confusion and delirium for a few hours.  I experienced muscle aches and fatigue. I experienced itchy and crawly feelings on my skin.

Sitting upright in a char and driving a car made the pain worse. Difficulty sleeping due to pain and having to sleep on one side. Soothed the pain temporarily with a menthol rub but the pain would not go away  Sunday, March 7: Pain (burning, stinging, aching, quaking) unbearable to the point that I stayed in bed most of the day but could not sleep. Sitting upright continued to make pain worse. Menthol rub did not make pain go away. Pain intensified throughout the day in left shoulder and neck, shoulder blade, arm, and hand.  Monday, March 8: Appointment with Dr, internal medicine specialist who is my mother&#39;s primary care physician. Dr. suspected that I may be suffering from brachial neuritis and recommended that I see a neurologist for further diagnosis. He prescribed Gabapentin (nerve pain medication) and a series of steroid medication (Prednizone) for me to take throughout the week. I asked him how long I would have to take the medication in weeks/months to come. He said as long as I am feeling the pain. That night, when I started taking the medication, the pain flared up deep in my shoulder and down my arm like a fireball!   Tuesday, March 9 - Thursday, March 11: Gabapentin was not effective with reducing extreme pain. Dr. instructed me to increase dosage as needed. A day later, he called in a prescription for -------, a pain medication that he said I could take with Gabapentin to help strengthen relief. Made appointment with Dr, neurologist with Medical Group.   Friday, March 12:  Appointment with Dr. Initial tests suggest to him that my condition could be either brachial neuritis. He ordered MRI and EMG nerve test. I asked if I would be able to drive back to home. He advised against driving at all given my medications and ongoing pain, as well as the need to arrive at a clear diagnosis. I asked him what I should do about getting the second Moderna shot. He told me that I should not get the second shot. I am scheduled to get the second shot on Friday, March 26, at a vaccination site, State University.

                                                On 3/16/21 at approximately 12PM a middle-aged male patient came in to get his first dose of Moderna vaccine. I took in this patient into the IMZ room to give his vaccination and reviewed his form he filled out. On the question related to &#34;have you ever had a reaction to a vaccine (fainting/dizzy)&#34; the patient answered &#34;No&#34;. The patient walked outside to the waiting area and sat down to begin his 15mins, at that point another customer yelled for medical attention for him because he passed out in the chair. I ran out with an EpiPen in case it was anaphylaxis. After I got outside the patient regained consciousness in the matter of seconds but was still dazed/confused and I applied a cold compress to the back of his neck and gave the patient some water to drink while feeling for his pulse in the wrist. He began to lose his color/pallor in his face again for a second time at that point I told my technician to call 911, after we dialed them, the patient came back to fully again this time and all color was restored to his face and he was fully conscious this time and able to speak in complete sentences. He wanted me to cancel the 911 call and since he came back to consciousness again in the matter of seconds so we canceled it. I made the patient wait an extra 30 minutes to observe him and he was fine from there on out, his wife was accompanying him and stated he has done this in the past for vaccines (despite answering no in the assessment form) and said she will be driving him home and checking in with his doctor later.

Heart rate was 80 and respirations were 20. He reported he last ate at 8pm the night before and was too nervous to eat breakfast. RN #2 provided him with fruit juice and sliced apples. He reported feeling better and then two minutes later complained of feeling hot and cold and foggy headed and not right with some anxiety. RN #1 called local EMS/Fire Rescue and they arrived to assess him. Vital signs were within normal limits. He was transported to Hospital for further evaluation.

Could not control them.  Several blankets applied.  Then at 2:30 am 1/27/21 chills stopped.  At 3 am spiked a temperature of 101.8 until around noon 1/27/21.  After that temperature broke and just felt very run down.  1/28/21 - while sleeping felt better but soaked 6 tee shirts while sleeping.  Finally stopped wearing tee shirts and sweating appeared to stop.

At 22 h after the vaccine I could not abduct my arm due to the local pain, became prostrated (had to lay down all day), lost appetite (only ate 2 cookies all day) and became very fatigued (went to sleep at night at 7 pm instead of my 10 pm regular sleeping time). I measured my temperature twice and it was 37.5 C. I didn&#39;t take antiinflammatory nor analgesic medicine.  At 48 h after the vaccine, I was already 80% better, and at 72 h  has back to normal. I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence.

Every joint and muscle hurt.  Now. 24 hours later from receiving the shot I&#39;m  beginning to feel a little better but muscle pain still present. No fever throughout.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

I woke up I believe in the early morning hours a couple of days later in pain.  The pain caused me to wake up.  After that I noticed that my elbow joints, and knee joints were very sore.  I was unable to flex my arms (mainly right arm) or knees (mainly right knee) after that for approximately two weeks without feeling pain.  Extremely sore joints starting in arm/elbow joint followed by extremely sore knee joints.  Overall body aches mainly in joints.  Persists to the time of this writing

At first he said he felt uneasy and he then later described feeling &#34;like he was tripping&#34;.   He later started feeling confused.  He went to bed around 11p.m. and woke up feeling very tired and achy but was also having a lot of trouble concentrating.  Later in the evening he was acting very confused and he didn&#39;t look well at all.  He was having difficulty verbalizing and conveying his thoughts, he couldn&#39;t remember words and at one point he actually called me &#34;mom&#34;.  I am concerned.  He said he would contact the hotline for adverse reactions on 2/26 if he still felt the same, but I felt it was important to report it either way.  He has never behaved this way before and has no medical history of any sort of memory or mental issues.

                                                My arm was sore for 3 days as though I had been punched really hard.  After that  my deltoid became incredibly irritated and I started having stabbing, excruciating pain in my should any time it moved.  This lasted until I went in to get a shot of local anaesthetic from my doctor  on 2/25/21.  I was taking advil, tylenol, a muscle relaxer, lydecane cream and then I got the shot of anaesthetic.  I slowly had a little bit of improvement in mobility.  13 days after my vaccine, I was no longer experiencing shooting pain in my shoulder.  It is now March 1st and I think I have regained about 70% of my  mobility in that arm.  I believe that the shot made my deltoid flex and freak out and this ended up causing bicep tendinitis.  This is also my doctor&#39;s theory.

                                                Pt received Moderna vaccine on 12/30/20 at 10:08 am. At 10:17 am monitor flagged down nurse to check on pt. Pt was upright sitting in drivers seat of his truck with his eyes open and head/neck tilted back. Pt. was not responsive to shaking, sternal rub and/or calling his name to see if he could hear nurse for approximately 20-30 seconds. At that point pt. became alert and responsive. Pt was disorientated for a couple of seconds then realized what had happened. Pt stated that he felt light headed and was diaphoretic. Pt did not eat breakfast so was given a granola bar and water.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12, 2021 the day after I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I woke with severa muscle and joint pain, headache, pain at injection site unable to lift arm above head.  As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the shot, I began to feel flu-like symptoms beginning with intestinal discomfort and incontinence. Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

I completely removed my shirt to assure proper placement.  Common soreness to shot experienced next two days after administration, however soreness felt in shoulder joint rather than muscle. Pain re-occurred on 1/12/21 and has not been totally relieved despite the usage of anti-inflammatory medication eg. Ibuprofen 400mg,  Tylenol 500mg along with Ibuprofen for soreness. The worst pain I experience is when I go to sleep being prematurely awaken by aching and throbbing to my affected area. Again, not being any discomfort to muscle but rather left shoulder joint pain where sometimes I am discouraged from raising my left arm to my side. It does not bother me so much to raise my left arm towards my front. I have been working through my discomfort while being very careful not to aggravating it further. My concern comes from the fact that it has not completely gone away after the extended time frame and becomes more intense in the evening.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                Sore area around injection site, irregular temperature, severe fatigue - fatigue lasted the equivalent of two days with the next full day after injection being the worst.  The day after the injection fatigue was debilitating requiring sleeping or resting for most of the day and night. Half way through the second day after the injection fatigue is still present though significantly improved. The Item 21 box for Doctor visit has been checked as I will meet with my primary care provider as soon as possible and have already discussed it with my employer&#39;s health department.

                                                About 12 hours after vaccination, I started to have severe chills, fever, intense headache, body aches, inability to sleep and sweating.  This last 24 hours and then began to dissipate.  The headache left first.  These symptoms mirrored the symptoms I had with COVID minus the sinus drainage and sore throat I had with COVID.  Yet, the symptoms were more intense.  The reaction to the vaccine was the sickest I recall being in the last 20 years.  It was a long 24 hours. I went to the ER and obtained a liter of fluids via IV and motrin type medicine.  I was advised it should last about 24-36 hours and discharged.

                                                On 12 FEB 2021 I received my first dosage of the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine, Lot 016M20A. On the day of the vaccination, the pain from Psoriatic Arthritis  (primarily bi-lateral feet was low in comparison to the average level of pain over the last 7 days).  There was also discomfort in the hips which for time to time had presented with point pain at the connection of the hip to the Femur. BLUF: Most significant joint/muscoskeletal pain related to exacerbation locations for Psoriatic Arthritis that I have ever endured since receiving the injection.  Prepared for second vaccination, but fearful of PSA not being in control and dramatic escalation in discomfort in feet and hips, affecting ability to walk.  I received my vaccination at some time after 1400 hours, 12 FEB.  No issues noted until approximately 2300 hours, 12 FEB, when significant and debilitating pain was noted in multiple joints or areas affected by recent Psoriatic Arthritis exacerbations.   Initial Pain made it difficult to sleep from the 12th into the 13th due to significant discomfort. Through that first night, the pain immediately flared, bilateral feet, left and right hip and point pain at three locations on veterbrae, (lower, mid and upper back).  Pain was most pronounced in feet and left hip,  the feet (all toes seemed to throb in pain and were sensitive to touch or simple movements).  Pain in feet and left hip was a 10/10.  Left hip pain was slightly different than the point pain and seemed to radiate out from the area where it connects to the femur. 13 FEB: By 0815 on 13 FEB the pain in the right foot and right hip decreased, as well as the pain in the lower, mid and upper back but the pain in the left foot and left hip continued, slightly less strong than the night prior.  Pain level decreased to 8/10 for left foot and hip and was down to a 5/10 for the right foot and hip and a 3/10 for the areas on the back. In the evening of 13 FEB it was noted that the pain in the left hip became more generalize:d vice the specific point pain that I have witnessed off/on since SEP 2020.  Continued to note evening pain that felt like burning/tingling pain on both feet.  At this point the pain in the evenings appeared to be worse than the AM pain.   Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 It should be noted, that left shoulder discomfort from the injection never exceed 2/10 as it appeared 24 hours after the injection.  More pain in shoulder associated with mobility/rotation? I lacked the ability to simply walk through the house due to the pain throughout the past 36 hours.   14 FEB: Less discomfort in AM, but still greatest in left foot. Left Foot: 7/10 Fight foot: 4/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 3/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 4/10 PM:  Significant increase in pain at bed time. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 15 FEB: AM: continued lessening of pain/discomfort in AM, but appeared back throughout the day, worsening at evening.  Pain in left hip was noted to be much more pronounced shooting out in multiple directions, to include causing discomfort from the rear of the hip, and when seated shooting pain in the direction of my inner thigh from the back of my hip.  Pain in feet continues to be like a burning/tingling pain in the evening, most pronounced in 2nd and 3rd toes on my left foot and big toe and little toe on my right foot.  The pain also appears to be much greater at evening than in AM. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: Left Hip 8/10 right hip 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10-not much change-very point specific pain.. I am not witnessing fatigue or any other problems other than joint/musco skeletal pain.  I have also not been getting shooting pain in feet that has appeared from time to time which feels like someone hammering nails into individual toes or shots of violent pain, only a sustained burning/tingling pain. four days later the Psoriatic Arthritis locations continue to rage following the vaccine, most notably bilateral feet and left hip, where the pain in the hip appears to be radiating in multiple directions.

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

In desperation, I have my wife help me into a hot shower where I continued to shake violently for about 25 minutes.  My wife continued to monitor me to make sure I didn&#39;t collapse or pass out and continually ask if we should go to the ER.  However, after about 25 minutes the shaking subsided and I was left exhausted with some minor muscle pain due to shaking.  It was very difficult to breath during the incident, noticed my hands turning blue so I focused on deep breaths and staying calm to eventually stop it.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Heart valve operation. Concomitant products included WARFARIN SODIUM (COUMADIN) for an unknown indication.   On 12-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (Memory lapse, difficulty with memory recall) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Cerebral Ischemic Attack) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 15-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FEELING ABNORMAL (Brain Fog) and HEADACHE (Headache). The patient was hospitalized from 10-Apr-2021 to 12-Apr-2021 due to CONFUSIONAL STATE, MEMORY IMPAIRMENT, THROMBOSIS and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. At the time of the report, MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (Memory lapse, difficulty with memory recall), FEELING ABNORMAL (Brain Fog) and HEADACHE (Headache) had not resolved and CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused), THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Cerebral Ischemic Attack) had resolved. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 10-Apr-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) revealed blood clots. On 10-Apr-2021, International normalised ratio: low (Low) Low. On 10-Apr-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) revealed blood clots. On 15-Apr-2021, International normalised ratio: low (Low) Low.         It was reported that the patient still has difficulty with memory recall, brain fog, headache, and still having trouble with low INR. The patient did not have any side effects after the first dose. Treatment for the events included Levonox injections and Coumadin (increased dose).  Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, excluding other etiologies causal relationship cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the product known safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, excluding other etiologies causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Approximately 2 weeks after vaccination, noticed that goiter had returned and developed difficulty sleeping and constipation.  Goiter lasted for approximately 8 days and then began to improve on its own.  Consulted with my endocrinologist, who felt that it might be a transient thyroiditis due to having had the immunization

When I sat at my computer and started to work my headache got worse and worse like a very bad migraine.  I went outside and the headache subsided.  When I went back to my desk my headache got worse again. I then tried to go to Urgent care but was refused because of possible Covid symptoms. I had to go to Covid Hot zone in our Emergency Room. They released me from work for 2-3 days.  When I came back to work my headache was much more milder and I could handle the slight pain..

Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

I missed three days of work after the second dose.    I took ibuprofen and iced the left arm and rested.  I never had a reaction to the influenza vaccination in forty years.  The first dose, I did not miss work. And the side effects went away the next day.

                                                Had vaccine and had a red spot and sore arm which went away after a couple days. Four days after the vaccine a blood vessel in my hand burst (I don&#39;t recall hitting it on anything at all). It puffed up about a centimeter and slowly went away over a few days. Then a little more than a week later the red spot came back and itched very badly and was sore again. It also faded after several days. then yesterday morning I woke up and my arm was sore at the injection site again only I started having the worst headache of my life that lasted 30 hours. I started shaking, sweating massively, I felt hot and cold at the same time, felt as if I had a very high fever but my temperature was 98.4 (totally normal). I was vomiting if I tried to eat or drink. I had severe body aches and EXTREME weakness throughout my body. My heart began to race at 150-160 bpm for several hours and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It has gotten about 50%  better in the past few hours and will hopefully continue that way. I&#39;ve never felt anything like it in my life. I need to know if it is safe for me to get the second shot.

These bouts of increased irritability were intermittent and lasting for several days, including currently still experiencing 2 wk later.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

Upon waking, I realized that it was blood that was from a fairly significant bloody nose that I was having.  Even though I used facial tissues to deal with the bleed, it took nearly 25 minutes or so to subside as it was quite severe.  The situation is/was HIGHLY unusual as I haven&#39;t had a bloody nose for at least a decade (or perhaps even 2 decades) and when I earlier did, I was usually able to deal with it and get it to stop within a minute or two.  In this case, the bleed was significant, flowing quite heavily, when standing straight up (with blood dripping out of my nose) and even when lying in a prone position, wouldn&#39;t stop for 25 minutes.  Additionally, in my life, I have never had a bloody nose be the source of being woken out of a sound sleep.

                                                I don&#39;t think that my reaction to the vaccine is super serious but it is perhaps worth noting if others are also experiencing similar symptoms. On the second day, I did have the expected arm soreness around the injection area on my right arm. That soreness faded by Saturday morning. However, on Saturday afternoon, I began experiencing some intermittent pain in my left kidney. I have had a few (3?) kidney stones since I was approximately 35 years old so it is a pain that I recognize almost immediately.  I kept my spider senses awake to see where it was going to go. About an hour later, I had intermittent &#34;flu like&#34; pain in my arms and legs. I had been up on a ladder painting a wall and I became a bit dizzy and decided to halt the painting project. The rest of the evening was kind of crappy. Intermittent headaches, leg pain, arm pain and left kidney pain. I took 1 Alleve tablet around 8pm. It didn&#39;t seem to do much. I took a second one about an hour later (according to the instructions you can take two for you first dose) and that seemed to do the trick! I slept like a rock and so far today, all of the pain is gone including the pain in my left kidney.  I have not taken any more Alleve besides the two that I took last night. Also, as of right now (2:44pm on Sunday 3/21), no kidney stone has passed. I have been urinating into a cup to see if one comes out. I cannot 100% say that any of these symptoms are related to the vaccine. However, being a Type 1 diabetic (since 1978) and the unusual kidney pain made me go, &#34;huh.&#34; That is why I am providing this info in the event that there are others who are experiencing similar symptoms that can be tied to the vaccine and what to expect. I feel completely fine now. Yay. :)

Next morning still experiencing fatigue, muscle aches, joint aches and runny nose. Took more Tylenol, by mid-day felt better but by about 4pm fatigue, aches returned and also slight head ache.

                                                During the first and second day, my upper left arm was slightly tender from the shot. When that pain subsided during the second day after the shot, I started to get some swelling and pain in my left armpit. Discomfort was such that it interfered with my ability to sleep through that night. The following day (Day 3 after injection) the discomfort mostly subsided but still has not completely gone away. Currently on Day 6 after injection. No treatments or medications have been applied to alleviate the issue.

                                                After I got the shot, on the way home, I started feeling tingling on tongue and lips; had a metallic taste. I felt like I had allergies - I was a little congested - but the next morning, 04:00 am -  I was still congested - and was still breathing short and shallow. I get to work and I&#39;m open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn&#39;t palpate and feel it but just couldn&#39;t access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn&#39;t think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn&#39;t work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn&#39;t talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe. I drove by the clinic where I was got my vaccine and decided to go in - I was so dizzy and I realized I shouldn&#39;t be driving. They told me to get up and move and I told them I couldn&#39;t breathe and I&#39;m not one to say that but they called an ambulance that took me ER. (I was a LPN at one time so I wasn&#39;t anxious.)  And they told me it was anxiety - and they kept telling me to breathe. But it wasn&#39;t an anxiety attack at all. My heartrate was normal. I was shallow breathing. They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That&#39;s it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn&#39;t want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm. Second vaccine - felt flu like symptoms for three days after. I still feel a little weird - my bones hurt and I&#39;m achy. Just not feeling right. Note: When I was in the emergency room - my hands were purple. Circulation was weird.They told me my oxygen levels were fine and that I just needed to breathe. It caused carpal tunnel in my wrist - I had nerve damage on that about three weeks - I have about 80 percent nerve damage from previous and so when something irritates it  - it takes a while to recover from it but I have.  I consulted with a doctor about the reaction to first vaccine before getting the second vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Joint pain mainly in the knees. It has been ongoing since the onset about 3 weeks after my first dose. I&#39;m unable to run due to the pain and walking is mildly uncomfortable with walking up and down stairs being particularly painful. I have never experienced joint pain of any note prior to this onset and have never had issues that prevented me from being active.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

The first dose was much milder but lasted 6 days.  This second dose seems much worse and am expecting it to last several days more.

The chills lasted about 4 hours. About 36 hours after receiving the vaccine, I noticed swelling of my lymph nodes under my left arm.  (scale of 1-5, 5 being the worst, it was a 4) It is about the size of tennis ball, it is causing discomfort and hard to sleep. It is painful.  The flushing, headache and chills all went away.

I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

I was down and couldn&#39;t function. I took Ibuprofen and tylenol - and it helped with aches and pains a little but not with tiredness and overall feeling bad. I took the 3rd and 4th off but went back to work on 5th although I was sluggish. Felt a lot better on Saturday.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

Around Feb 12, I had some pain in my left nostril and over the course of a week or so it swelled and became very red and painful. I contacted my doctor by phone on Feb 19 and she prescribed Kephlex, Feb 20 I went to Urgent Care and they said I had cellulitis on my nose. They prescribed Augmentin and took a culture. Feb 21, I went to the Emergency because it was not getting any better, they prescribed Bactrim and sent me home. I missed two days of work and felt miserable for over a week. My nose still hurts today.

Patient was breathing but unresponsive, stiff, and unable to blink, talk, or move for around 2-3 minutes.  Once the seizure ended I asked patient if he had a history of seizures, his answer was, &#34;not really&#34;. He drank some of the water and sat with the ice pack for a couple minutes and said he felt better. Color returned. Patient stated he felt nerves contributed more than anything and was feeling 100% better when he left. We had dialed 911 while patient was unresponsive but once he was able to talk again he declined 911 and stated feeling much better.

                                                The evening of 1/11/21 - pain at the injection site and feeling of fatigue - went to bed very early.  Arm pain a bit less next day - felt a little tired all day. Back to &#34;normal&#34; on the 13th.   I am not sure if the following symptoms are related to the vaccine but I feel like I should report them if there may be a link.  1/17/21 -Awoke in the morning with severe neck pain - muscles &#34;locked up.&#34;  Called the doctor - he prescribed Tramadol and Cyclobenzaprine - I took these for two days before my neck calmed back down and I could function &#34;normally&#34; again.  1/28/21 - Started feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; and tired late in the day while still at work.  Went home and went to bed early.  1/29/21 - Felt same as last PM upon waking up.  Felt much better by mid-morning.  Started feeling bad again later in the day.  Felt cold - but no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  1/30/21 - Felt bad all day.  Felt cold - no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  AM - felt anxious, worried, confused.  Built a fire in the fireplace and heat made me feel better. Felt hot-cold-hot-cold- all day.  My neck ached all day.  Sensitive to sounds. Took a single cyclobenzaprine late in the day - seemed to help. Went to bed early.  1/31/21 - Woke up with very sore deltoid muscle at the site of COVID-19 injection. Very hard to lift arm above head.  Hips, back, and neck muscles ache.  Calf muscles feel almost like they are about to cramp.  Mental state better than yesterday. Still sound sensitive. Not as cold feeling as in days prior.  Yoga seems to help.

                                                Afew hours after receiving the inoculation, I was extremely sleepy.   I was sleeping at my job, and my boss had me go home early.  I went to work the next day, however I was feeling weird, my sense of smell and taste were off, as the day continued I started having a headache, body aches, and general malaise.  I went home early, again from work.  But when I arrived to my residence I was having severe chills despite my efforts to try to keep myself warm.  The chills lasted for more than 24hrs, preventing me from sleeping, my body aches were getting worse, my eyes were extremely red, and I did not feel like eating.  Near the end of the day, the chills became sweats, and I was trying to balance between being hot and clammy, to chills.  The next day I paid a visit to my primary care doctor.  I was tested for covid - which was negative, I was tested for the flu - which was negative, and my lungs were clear so there was no reason for my doctor to believe I have a pneumonia.

                                                Day 1: Immediately (1015am) after injection a low grade headache. Soreness in injection site. During the evening some aches in joints. Day 2: Next morning was difficult getting out of bed. Skin was very sensitive to warm/hot shower water. Achy joints all over. Even my left injection site was sore even though I was injected on the right side. Fatigue at work. I was very wide eyed as described by co-worker. I was a little loopy as I was very giggly and things made me laugh way more than usual. I may have been a little delirious but I was able to work. This lasted until I went to bed. Day 3: When I awoke I felt like a fever had broke, Cooling sweat, but my temp was never over 98.5 degrees. My normal morning temp is usually 97.3 every day, but that one degree made a difference. I feel normal today and realize I was not well the day before.

He has not had any sickness with in the last year., including the common cold. The antibiotics have not helped the ringing ears at all after 4 days. We are hoping this goes away but so far there is no improvement. He has been unable to work while this is going on.

Received the second shot the morning of 18 Feb, noticed some minor joint stiffness, minor pain and tiredness mid morning 19 Feb. Laid down at 16:30 and remained asleep until 0530 the next day. Unusual to sleep 13 hours. Later that weekend I noticed a bruise on my leg. I rarely bruise and had not hit my leg on anything. I ignored the bruise a couple weeks, but as it did not heal, continued to hurt and had swelling I went to my primary doctor on 4 March who thought it was a blood clot and sent me for imaging. They determined it was superficial thrombophlebitis and treated with antibiotics and heat.

I advised him to go to er/call dr if unable to drink, develops high fever/numbness/tingling/loss of motion, etc.  Followed up today. pt is still very nauseated but has developed a full-on  migraine headache.  He went to the ER last night, and was not found to be dehydrated &amp; labs were not unusual.  he was given injection of nausea medicine, and rxs for zofran and norco, but had not taken any today... using pepto bismol instead.  I advised he take the zofran routinely until the nausea subsides and the norco for the headache  &amp; if not improved in a couple days to go see his dr.

I started feeling better around 2:30 AM on March 17.  I went to work that morning at 8:30 and had to leave work at 10 AM due to feeling worse.  I went home and laid down the rest of the day, taking Tylenol and drinking an electrolyte drink.  I had chills, but not nearly as bad the the night before.  I started feeling better around 6PM that evening.  The next day, I felt fine with the exception of an almost total loss of appetite.   I did not feel fully back to normal until Friday morning.  I do not regret getting the shot, but found this reporting tool and thought it would be a good idea to submit my experience.

                                                I had a really bad day after the second dose. Horrible migraine headache that built as the day moved on.  As a rule, I do not get migraines and whenever I have gotten a headache I&#39;ve not had a  sensitivity to light or sound, like I did yesterday.  It was just miserable. Lots of body ache and a generalized feeling of sickness, similar to influenza or food poisoning.  I had no energy.   My arm at the injection site hurt constantly without even being touched all day and I could not sleep on my left side due to arm pain around the injection site. The arm pain from the injection site, occasionally radiated to my elbow joint , depending on how I moved my arm.  It is still sensitive today, two days later, and has a sensitive swelling in the area where the injection occurred. I do not feel bad today, but I do feel like I am 100% yet, either, but I feel a LOT better than I did yesterday.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

Left arm at injection site sore.  Details:  approximately 1 am I woke up with chills, headache, earache and tiredness.    I took Tylenol and this continued waking up again a few hours later the same.   Eventually I felt very hot.   Upon waking again tired/fatigue, headache, earache.   At approximately 11:30 am I got out of bed,  shaky &amp; very tired.   I eventually felt better, just tired.   (With exception of Arm still hurting).    Please note I had Covid in December and had similar symptoms, except these all hit me at the same time and felt much worse then when I had Covid.

                                                I developed a rash consisting of many itchy red spots and patches on my front torso (upper chest to top of groin area) and some  similar but fewer spots on my back, arms, legs,  and neck.  My scalp is also itchy.  Rash began as one red spot  in the center of my chest near the breast bone and other spots began to appear.  I noticed the first spot on 1-11 or 1-12; I&#39;m not sure of the exact date.    I scheduled an appointment with my primary care provider for 1-22 at 11:00.  He examined  me and recommended I start a course of OTC antihistamines and topical  cream (Triamcinolone Acetonide .1%) for two weeks.  The rash is a bit less itchy since starting treatment two days ago, but it is still visible and present.  The itchiness woke me from my sleep last night and the night before.

                                                after about 30 minutes, I started having a metallic taste in my mouth.  I was also experiencing soreness in left arm area.   After about an hour, the pain in my arm started to feel as though it was spreading to my left chest cavity area.  I then started to get chest pains in the left breast area to the armpit area, but not severe, just concerning.  After probably 70-80 minutes, I started feeling drowsy.  I continued to feel drowsy all evening and did not sleep well.  I woke up and could not return to sleep at 4:45am.  My normal waking time is 6:00am.  I had/have quite a bit of soreness in my arm, but nothing unbearable.  No signs of rash or inflammation around injection sight.  I am taking a sick day from work to relax and recover from loss of sleep.  The metallic taste persist, but only an annoyance and taste seems to be normal when eating or drinking.  A slight achiness in joints, but a cold front was also moving in, which can cause me to have the same effect.

                                                I felt like I had  a cold for the first 3 days after shot. I was fine for 3 days. On the morning of the 6th day, 1/21/21, I had very intense deep muscle pain in my lower back, left arm, hands and headache. About two hours after this started I started to have the very intense chills, my headache got worse and for the first time a low fever of 99 degrees. I felt like this for 2 days, couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 days because of the pain. On the third day 1/24/21, it was much better and almost all gone by the fourth day, 1/25/21. Thank you

At 16 days post injections, frontal and temporal headache began, lasting approx 12 hrs and then waves of severe body aches began (random location - back, neck, right lateral midfoot, knees, right radiocarpal joint), along with mild chills and mild fever (never &gt;100.0).  These symptoms would recur approx every 8 hrs for the next 4 days.  Days 3-4 of the symptoms were debilitating and I primarily remained in bed.  Today is the first day or somewhat normal.  Still feel some ache and mild fatigue.  Never lost taste or smell and never had any respiratory issues or GI issues.

Unlike during the disease, my hips strongly ached 24 hours after recieving the injection.  COVID cough returned though not as bad as when I had the disease, as well as fealing weak and out of breath.  All of this lasted for about 36 hours.  Feeling a bit better now, but still winded and weak.   Still plan to get 2nd shot.

                                                Presented to ED for evaluation of generalized lower extremity weakness, falls. The patient states that he carries a diagnosis of MS and typically is fully functioning without assistance of a cane or walker. The patient states that yesterday morning around 0900 he received the second dose of his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was otherwise feeling fine but by last night (12 hours after the vaccine) the patient states he tried to get out of bed and was transferring when he felt his bilateral legs give out, causing him to slide to the ground. His wife then came to help and states that the patient was completely weak in the legs, and was unable to even lift his legs up to get back into bed. They then tried to walk him again a short time later and he again stumbled with weakness in his legs. Since that time, the patient states he has been minimally ambulatory and has been using a cane, but still needs large assistance to get around his home. The patient states he has baseline foot drop but feels this is worse in his legs today. He went to clinic this morning for his symptoms where he was noted to have an elevated temperature and was diffusely weak in his lower extremities. Given this, the patient was referred to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies any weakness in his upper extremities or facial asymmetry. He denies sensation change in his extremities nor any recent illness such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or leg pain. He has no history of stroke. He denies any injuries or head injury, syncope from his falls. He was admitted to the hospital where he will receive further symptomatic treatment as necessary. No treatment provided in emergency department for weakness.

                                                On Friday morning I started having chest pains. The pains were sharp and would go away quickly. (Almost immediately) They were from the center of my chest to the right of my chest at about the same level as my heart, I could tell that the pains were NOT coming from my heart, or at least, that is how it seemed. I also felt some pains to the left of the center of my chest, but the pains from the left were fewer and not as pronounced. These pains resulted in my leaving work early (I was on the way to work when they started) and I stayed home from work today. The pains did not continue for more than 4  hours or so, and seemed to dissipate later that day. I did feel some discomfort in my chest this morning. This discomfort was extremely mild and did not last much more than an hour and a half. I feel fine this afternoon, as I am writing this note. I have been eating, urinating and have had normal bowl movements today, so I think I am okay. You might be mindful of these chest pains the Moderna vaccine is causing. The pains were sharp and noticeable. I did not call my Doctor because it did not seem necessary. Thank you.

                                                I woke up the morning of 3/23/2021 approximately 5am with a ringing in my left ear.  It has been constant since that time.  I should add to the other that my blood pressure has elevated since the vaccine.  As part of going on medication on 3/18, it was a concern the medications would elevate my blood pressure.  I bought a wrist BP check device and it was averaging 134/95 on 3/22/2021.  On 3/23/2021, I was prescribed Losartan.  I took one pill at 7:30PM.  Today when I woke up and for most of the day the BP has been 124/77-82.  The ringing remains persistent

My temp read 102.9. Called a nurse and she was concerned because of my heart condition. come in to the hospital if the chest pain lasts longer than 5 minutes. I didn&#39;t go in because I figured I could use a nitroglycerin pill if it got too bad.  The following day I had chest pain every few hours or so. the waves of chest pain only lasted about 5 minutes a piece.

Next morning quite achy, strong headache, light sensitive. No breathing or cognition issues. Not eating but no g.i. issues. Injection site is sore.  Mostly recovered or anyway not worried about lingering symptoms at 20 hours past shot (if something gets worse I&#39;ll report again). My goal in submitting this report was only to describe  what I consider to be note-worthy side effects. By comparison, I had a first covid  vaccine dose exactly 1 month ago and no real signs. Also, I had covid-19 infection, moderately sick, in March 2020 (tested pos for covid antibodies in May 2020.

                                                I got the shot at 3pm. I started feeling &#34;off&#34; in stomach/chest around 7-8pm. By 3am, my stomach/chest did not feel good at all and I had trouble sleeping. It was definitely not heart related. By 8am I felt chills coming on. By 9am I was fully dressed, with two blankets on, and lying on couch shaking for 20-30 minutes. Later a fever started and it reached about 102.3 before subsiding late afternoon. By 8pm, I felt blah but fever was gone. During that entire time I felt achy overall (similar to what I felt like 2 hours after running a marathon).  I didn&#39;t have headaches (and rarely do), but area around my eyes were heavy and tired. Weirdly, at times, the top 1/2 of both ears hurt.   I experience about every symptom I had as when I had Covid and went to hospital for 26 days except for the breathing issues.

Then I had fatigue and then at about 14 hours after the injection, I started having chills - like I had temperature with hot and cold chills. I got very cold; my blood pressure dropped - I happened to have a doctor appt the day following the vaccine - the bottom level was very low of my blood pressure - it was 45. I couldn&#39;t warm up - my extremities were very cold. I had chest pain and it felt like my heart rate was going in an out of atrial fibulation. I had shortness of breath. I measured my blood oxygen concentration and had dropped down to 90%. I didn&#39;t sleep well because I was so chilled and not feeling well. I felt like I had a bad flu. I rested the next day (10th) the symptoms slowly went away between 10 am and 1:00. At 3:00 pm, I saw my pain doctor and I told him about it but I was feeling much better although blood pressure was low. Fatigue lasted for 3-5 days afterwards but it wasn&#39;t anything last the first 24 hours. I didn&#39;t go to ER because it seemed to resolve itself in the day.

                                                Three days after the vaccination I started having severe nightmares and vivid violent dreams that prevent me from sleeping. They happen 5-6 times a night and each time my body experiences an Adrenaline rush. I jump from my sleep with high pulse and elevated blood pressure. It subsides quickly after I am awake. But then after I fall back to sleep and within one hour, the event repeats. I wake up again and again. The sleep has become very light and filled with violent dreams that I can remember vividly.

I had fever, chills, rapid pulse (108 bpm normally runs 70), &amp; chest tightness. Almost called ambulance because of the pulse and chest tightness. Within a couple hours of waking up I also began to have muscle cramps in my feet, toes, and thighs. Worse than I have ever experienced  and I have been diagnosed with PAD for over 10 years. I tried to get some sleep. I couldn&#39;t. My PCP also did not like the way my lungs sounded that morning at the Clinic. I was told after a xray that my lungs were ok. My injection site has been sore until today. It is better. I did have Covid in October 2020.

I experienced joint pain and muscle pain throughout the body.  I experienced a headache for most of the period.  I took Tylenol (acetaminophen) that provided relief for the headache and muscle and joint pain.  Besides that I basically slept for the period from 11pm day of vaccination through 4:30pm day after vaccination.

I almost went to the ER it was so bad. I have had burns, kidney stones, migraines and all kinds of pain in my life but this may have been the worst. Still feeling ill today but somewhat better. I had a reaction in the 1980&#39;s to a tetanus vaccine that was just a high fever. The headache was intolerable so I took some Aleve

Guardian pharmacist noted the change in facial color and alerted RN who was monitoring s/p vaccination of her observations.  He was red with facial edema upon my arrival.  Benadryl 25mg PO while he was still able to swallow by RN.   EMS called while he took the Benadryl.  After Benadryl, checked vitals ?

After epi, became pale, increasing diaphoresis with change in level of consciousness.  BP was lower, still hypertensive.  Placed on floor by staff.  While on the floor, consciousness improved.  EMS arrived and assumed care.

                                                12 hours after began to have a scratch throat.  at 13 hours post dose, had a headache start and an unusual erythematous spot on the posterior palate above Uvula with almost a white scratch appearance inside the erythema.  16 hours post dose began to have fevers and chills.  At 17 hours had severe sweats that soaked the bed with rigorous chills including teeth chattering shaking chills.  Took 800mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep.  Poor sleep with many awakenings.  Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA I have sciatic and have had a rhyzotomy on my right side. On 15 Jan, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I began to get back and leg aches from my sciatica, but on my left side.  I immediately began my routine (exercise) and back brace which usually stop the pain. Over the next two day, the symptoms got worse to the point of extreme pain in my back and all down my left leg.  This resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 17 January.  I have since had an appointment with my pain specialist, and an MRI.  We are awaiting results from the MRI.  The pain has not lessened, and pain medication are only mildly effective. The pain being in my left side make since as the Rhyzotomy had been done on my right side.  I am concerned the vaccine may have cause tissue or nerve swelling. Pain is still intense to the point of immobility and difficulty sleeping.

I asked patient what happened and he stated that suddenly he felt dizzy and that he was anxious about the vaccine from the beginning and excited to get it at the same time, then I measured the blood pressure  it was 125/61 with pulse of 45/min.I offered him and his wife to call 911 but they declined it. I asked him to go back to my consultation area so he could lie down on the floor and raise his legs up so we can bring back the blood pressure up, he did that, and he went with me over there and laid down on the floor and we raised his legs up,later I measured his blood pressure again, and it was 113/71 with pulse 51/minute, I offered again to call 911 but he refused and he said that he was feeling better. I left him about 10 more minutes,then he started to get up and sit by the chair and I re-measured the blood pressure  and it was 121/76 with pulse of 54/minute, he started to drink water. He stated he felt better than he was about 20 minutes ago, then they left once their driver came to pick them up.

Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

                                                I woke up in the middle of the first night after receiving 2nd dose of Moderna.  I had a fever, chills and muscle aches, and extreme fatigue.  Those symptoms lasted approx 3 days.  Two days after the vaccination I also became extremely nauseous.  I was anticipating all of these symptoms.  On the 3rd and 4th days after the vaccine most of the symptoms disappeared but I received some new ones that I was not expecting.  I suddenly felt a large amount of despair and hopelessness.  I had suicidal thoughts.  I had panic attacks and anxiety.  I had paranoia.  I did not feel like I had long to live, or anything to live for.  By 20 Apr all of these emotional and mental side effects were completely gone.

The normal chronic pain levels were elevated and unrelenting causing unusually chronic fatigue, depression, headaches and generally a malaise that continued to intensify daily until I received a scheduled cervical epidural steroid injection on May 5th 2021 at 9;00 am by MD at a medical office. Location in a state. After that treatment was completed all my adverse symptoms subsided entirely by the end of that day, May 5th. I am hesitant and nervous about getting my second shot.

Stomach upset if I eat or if I do not eat. I am only able to eat very bland food since anything else upsets my stomach. I can not drink carbonated beverages since they upset my stomach. As of yesterday I started getting little red sores on my back. This morning it moved to my chest in addition to my back.

                                                I began to experience lightheadedness, generalized weakness and confusion. My handwriting changed. These faded over the afternoon only to recur at the same time next morning, resolving in the afternoon once again. I was afraid i was having a heart attack and called 911 and was taken to Hospital where I ruled out for an MI. In the ambulance i received four baby aspirin. I was discharged that night. The next morning, i  developed poor balance and fell twice while walking. Weakness also recurred with confusion. I could not stand myself up. I went to another Hospital and spent the night in Observation. The next morning no symptoms occurred but I refrained from walking as much as possible that day. At hospital I received IV fluid and my usual medications. Neurology consultation revealed possibly abnormal reflexes and poor balance. I received a cane from physical therapy. Since then symptoms have mostly not resolved but weakness and falls have recurred. Evaluation for fall and poor balance continues to date. I received the second dose of the Moderna immunization as scheduled without incident.

I finally fell asleep at 6:00 am after a hot shower and woke up  at 10:00 am with reduced pain.  It appeared to affect areas of  past and present injuries.

                                                The day of the shot, we noticed significant swelling in my neck on the right of center.  The swelling has maintained its size for now six weeks and one day.  I have a dull numbness in my 2-3 smaller toes of my left foot.  Sometimes I feel this numbness in my right foot, but not always.  My left arm and two smallest fingers also feel funny.  There is a dull pain in my left arm and dull numbness in my left smaller fingers.  The outside of my left leg also at times shares this numb feeling.  On the day I got the shot I immediately felt like I had a dose of caffeine, though that feeling passed after a couple of hours.  It did not feel significant enough to keep me from driving or leaving the facility, but it was noticeable. I experienced diarrhea for about a week and a half. For the first week after the shot I alternated nights of not being able to stay still sleeping, keeping me awake almost the entire night, 3 of the first 6 nights.  I visited my family doctor within one week of the first shot.  He advised me not to get the second shot and made note of the swelling in my neck. I visited him at five weeks because the swelling in my neck and numb feeling has not changed.  He scheduled a CT Scan which has been scheduled.

                                                Approximately 2-3 hours after getting shot I started to feel flush my temperature was slightly higher than my normal at 98.9 (my normal is about 97.7). I also felt a little tired, I work 2nd shift so I went to work as normal. About 4 or 5pm the fatigue started to worsen and it was difficult to do my job I also felt nauseous, I struggled to finish my shift because of the fatigue. When I came home at 11pm I went straight to bed. When I awoke in the morning the fatigue was worse and it was difficult to stay awake but the nausea had passed. I was extremely tired all day until about 8pm or so when the fatigue started to lessen. By the next morning I was still a little tired but I could resume my normal schedule although I felt like I didn&#39;t get a good nights sleep. By Saturday morning (20th) I was not feeling any adverse effects.  I have sleep apnea which I forgot to list on medical conditions and I can&#39;t go backwards on the form so I am including it here.
