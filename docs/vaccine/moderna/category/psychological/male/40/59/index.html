                                                I received the vaccine 30 min. prior to starting my shift as a Nurse in the ED. About 1 hour after receiving the shot while standing I felt off balance and began to have a vertigo like dizziness. I sat down and tried to drink some water but began spitting the water back up and dry heaving after trying to drink. I did not feel nauseous if I was not drinking. I did feel the sensation of a slight lump in my throat. I did not have any shortness of breath, tachycardia,  rash or fever. I did not want to check in as a patient so I called my wife to come and pick me up from work. Before I left I had the pharmacy send me some Pepcid and Benadryl and I took 25mg of Benadryl and 20mg of Pepcid before leaving. I left work around 1400 and now at 1500 I am able to drink fluids. The slight lump in my throat seems to have improved. I still feel a little dizzy and off balance.

                                                Around 12hrs of first injection, I began to feel very cold.  Left arm was very painful to move. Hands and feet felt like ice. I was shivering. Fever of 102. Could not sleep. I was up at 3am feeling like I was going to vomit and I couldn?t get warm. Whole body aches. Couldn?t go in to work the next morning. I had a terrible headache. Slept all day. Went to bed in the evening and woke again at 3am shivering uncontrollably. Hands have continued to stay cold. No appetite as well.

                                                Starting this morning, the left side of my face has gone numb.  There is a charlie horse like feeling in my left cheek, which is now also present in my left jaw. The left side of my tongue is numb with slight pain, and my bottom lip is numb on the left side, and the feeling stops at the middle like there were a line drawn down my face.  My upper left cheek and the side of my left eye have a constant,  moderate burning feeling.  The shot was in my left arm.  The Dr. at urgent care said it was not a stroke, so that&#39;s good.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  It has now been over 13 hours.

                                                Severe dizziness started around 10:00pm then got a little better around 6 am the next day. Hardly got any sleep that night. Then around 8am I started to have chills which then I checked my temp and it was 101.0 degrees F. Then I started to get a headache and severe body aches. Around 3pm I tried to eat something which I then threw it up. I tried to drink water and flavored water which I also threw up the water. I also went into the bathtub 7 times that day to stop the chills. Which it did but right when I got out they started again which then I felt worse. Around 11pm 1/23/2021 I ended up going into the ER which then they gave me IV fluids and then Benadryl and Toradol by IV. After those were administered I started feeling better which then I was discharged and went home.

Had COVID in April/May but these symptoms worse.  Got home at 11:15 AM was so cold, hands were ice cold, and took 2 hours of sleeping and all layers of clothing to feel warm.  Took a few layers off and still shaking, feverish and feeling of worse flu to man. Pain all over the body, temperature at 3:30 is 99.5-100.4, above 98 is fever is fever for him, normal is 96-97.  Sharp shooting muscle pains in extremities, top part of the hands, muscles, tendons, and also his legs and feet, but not fingers or toes.  Pain is quite intense.  All he wants to do is lay down in sleep.   Thought he was going to freeze to death.  Hands were so cold his kids were concerned.  Ice packs on chest, and gloves and 10 layers on hands and arms.  Had tremendous trouble breathing while having the intense chills.    He is a responder for law enforcement.   Symptoms have improved some, but still feeling feverish with shooting pains, depth perception issues, as well as pain.  Headache in back of head, pressure type.  Called off for work for today and tomorrow.

I didn&#39;t think much of it but it stayed slightly irritated. About 1am, as I prepared for bed, it had become red and was quite irritated. I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night and my eye was quite irritated and it was filled with tears. The next two days it remained irritated in this way, red and painful. As of now (over 48 hours later), it is still red and irritated.

                                                On 4/8/21 awoke to intense pain in his left foot about 12 hours after receiving his 1st dose Moderna vaccine batch #038B21A. Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

Then I rapidly spiked a 102.7 fever and became so physically weak I felt paralyzed. Oxygen saturation dropped into the low 90s and I began to have labored breathing. I made an attempt to stand up and urinate, then passed out and collapsed. Ems came to the house and checked me out. I declined their offer to go to the hospital because I broke the fever, was breathing better, and had no concussion signs from the fall.

                                                Went to ED 3/30/21  Immediately after receiving the second vaccine 2/25 he developed chest tightness and joint pain. The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

No treatment was needed.    On January 1st I noticed tingling  in both of my legs.   Since then it has gotten worse.  I have tingling in both legs, muscle twitching throughout both legs intermittently, muscle weakness specifically after muscle use, an abnormal skin sensitivity when wearing pants, and a consistent ache throughout my legs.  The symptoms affect me 24 hours a day and create an anxiety that I have not felt before.  It has also adversely affected my sleep.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

Had a glass of water and resolved. Evaluated by doctor and had pulse of 92 (high for patient) and elevated blood pressure 148/92. Rest of vitals normal. Felt anxious. Ate lunch, had about 6 more episodes of mouth drying out, last one about 10 hours after vaccine.  Resolved with water. Took benedryl 50mg. Next felt fatigue and right arm soreness. Felt normal within 48 hours.

His Apple Watch told him he was in afib.  So the patient was taken to the ER by his wife where this was confirmed with an EKG.  He was cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm and he was prescribed Eliquis.  Patient has no prior heart arrhythmias or medical concerns.  Patient is slightly overweight, but has not had any arrhythmia or history of a fib in the past.  Patient was discharged to follow up with his family physician.  All of his blood work was normal.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

Around 1am I woke  up with SOB which continued thru the night, with off and on sleep. I woke back up at 5:45am, went to work with the SOB which lasted until 12N and resolved on its own.  Around 3-330pm I began to feel feverish and had chills and was told I was disoriented.  My temp was 100.5, HR 122 R 34 BP 170/100 O2-93%. I notified the DON of my feelings who advised me those were possible side effects of the vaccine and made me continue to work until I just couldnt take the feelings anymore and went to the ER.  I was there for about 2 hrs and my body began to calm down.  I took taken 100mg of Tylenol on my own just to help with the fever which did break shortly and I have been fine every since. I was positive for COVID 12/14.

My wife said it was kind of like bells palsy. Face kind of twitched a bit. Hip was numb walking was slow and I was careful as I went to the grocery store . It kind of leveled out but stayed numb all of work. I was still swollen after work.   Woke up on Sunday and my arm was hurting bad. numbness had dissipated.   ate then suddenly felt flush and hot. fetal position on the bed for a half hour then I had to drag myself to work. felt bad the first few hours but as the night went on I felt better.   I could always feel it behind my eyes. early on it felt like I was discharging a bunch of stuff from them. My body was literally numb on the left half. I could feel the middle of myself from my scalp to my toes.

The following two days my arm was sore at the injection site but that went away in a couple days.  3 days post vaccination, my right axilla and median and ulnar nerves were extremely sensitive for 3 days but that subsided.  6 days post vaccine I started to get extreme fatigued, low energy and feel like my nerves were hot.  I got a covid test which was negative because I was not feeling well.  Then 9 days post vaccine I started to feel very fatigued, achey, and I couldn?t sleep well and like my nerves were burning up all over my body.  I had to call out of work due to brain fog, fatigue, nerve heat, difficulty concentrating.  I took my temperature during all this and it was 97.7.  My hands felt very hot and I could wash them under warm water because the water felt way too hot.

                                                On Wednesday 1/27 the day after my second dose I felt a minor pinch/discomfort  on my lower leg.  I did not think much of that is reason I did not report it right away.  Day by day the discomfort and pain got worse.  Exactly one week after my second dose I was not able to sleep due to the pain.  On Wednesday 2/3 I decided to go urgent care.  From there I was referred for an ultra sound a few hours after.  After the ultra sound I was contacted by my doctor, letting me know that the results showed I had a blood clot on my left leg.  I was put on Eliquis medicine right away.  On 2/5 I was able to physically see my doctor who told me that this was caused by the second dose of the moderne vaccine that I took on 1/26.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

He didn&#39;t sleep well, and this morning his sleep app indicated his heart rate during the night was between 100-110.  After noticing his heart rate was between 130-140, he called the clinic and was told to go to the ER.  Hospital ER administered several tests and did blood work. The MD&#39;s determined his heart was fine and it is likely vaccine related.  He is home again and is feeling better (no chills, etc.) and his resting heart rate is now in the low-90&#39;s.

                                                After 24 hours, I started having body aches, that night couldn&#39;t sleep I took Ibuprofen it helped, over the weekend I kept taking Ibuprofen. Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                On the evening of Friday 4/2/2021 around 9:30 PM, I was experiencing what felt like heartburn. It got better before I went to bed. At around 9:00 AM on Saturday 4/3/2021, I was awakened by intense pain and pressure that felt like the worst heartburn I&#39;d ever experienced. After OTC heartburn treatments didn&#39;t help, at around 11:00 AM I went to the local ER where I was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack. After being given some baby aspirin and a nitro tablet, I started feeling better and was airlifted immediately to a nearby cardiology unit at another hospital. A heart catheterization and EKGs determined that I had not had a heart attack, but instead had takotsubo cardiomyopathy. I was admitted into the cardiac ICU overnight for observation, transferred to a non-critical room the next day (4/4/2021), and released on Monday 4/5/2021.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

He reported he went to his primary care provider later that afternoon.  He was examined clinically and was told that the shot was administered too high up in his arm in the Gleno Humeral Joint.  He was advised to take over the counter pain medication and to call if he needs something stronger.  He was given a follow up appointment on 2/5/2021 with the provider. He was told to monitor for infection in the next 48 hours and they are hoping it did not go into the joint capsule.  Continued to have severe pain.  Went to orthopedic specialist the next day.  Admitted to hospital for pain control and steroids.  MRI of shoulder inconclusive, but think severe bursitis and being treated as such.  Discharged from hospital and resting at home.  Arm range of motion at 80%-hoping to return to work in 2 weeks (firefighter/EMT).

                                                My left deltoid muscle is still aching at 7 weeks after this first injection.  I first noticed after 5-6 days when the expected initial pain of the shot subsided. I thought it would go away soon, but only realized that it would not when my right shoulder was fine 3 days after my 2nd shot. I have received my 2nd COVID vaccine 4 weeks after on Feb 9 in the right deltoid. There is no aching or adverse effects in my right arm at the time of this report.  I have reason to believe that the first shot was given too high in the left shoulder and possible SIRVA is the result in my left deltoid shoulder joint.   I use ibuprofen 800mg 3x daily, and that doesn?t take all the aching away. It is a persistent ache that doesn?t interfere with my ability to work, yet it limits my ability to do upper body exercises.

                                                An hour or so after receiving my first Moderna shot, I was aware of an unusual feeling in my lower right abdomen.  Knowing this to be a potential problem area for Appendicitis I paid attention to it for the next day and there was no change.  Two days after receiving the  vaccine shot this sensation got worse and I was visibly bloated.  I went to an Urgent Care where a doctor referred me to the closest ER due to the area of pain and bloat in my body.   After several blood tests and an MRI at the ER, it was determined that my appendix was inflamed and I was admitted to the hospital for surgery ASAP.   Luckily the appendix was stable, never burst and was successfully removed the following day in the early afternoon.   I am currently at home recovering successfully.

This caused severe pain and loss of the range of motion of my entire R arm.  I was admitted to the Emergency Room within 5 hours of receiving the injections and then admitted to the hospital overnight.  I was unable to work for 4 weeks due to the loss of range of motion disability of the R arm..

Went home laid down. I still feel weird on and off.  Went to the bathroom and had black stool. My right arm is still sore.

Later in the day, while at work, I became extremely fatigued and my chills were getting worse.  I left work early, came home and checked my temperature.  It has been between 102.5 and 103.7 the entire time I have been home.  Even after taking Tylenol.  My arm is also a little tender at the injection site.    I had COVID prior to this but they say I recovered.    My symptoms started on November 13 and was hospitalized for 3 days starting around day 9 of symptoms.  My current symptoms are pretty much identical to the symptoms I had when I first contracted COVID.

I got up to use the bathroom and had a syncopal episode about halfway to bathroom. Fell and i came to immediately when my name was called.  I got back into bed.  My lips were white.  I still felt lightheaded but could breathe freely and easily.  There was no noticeable swelling impairing my breathing.  Initially i could not get a reading on my pulse oximeter.  After a few minutes it worked and by then i was at 95%. I suspect the oxygen was quite low prior to that.  For the next day i had a fever and farigue.  The day after that I had some lingering fatigue but no fever.  Right now I am not planning to get the second shot in the series.

                                                Note:  I had a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March, 2020.  Approximately 12 hours after the second vaccine dose, I experienced intense soreness at the vaccination site (significantly greater than the first dose).  In the middle of the night I awoke with flu-like symptoms.  At 9am I took acetominophen  for fever, rigors, muscle aches.  This brought mild relief from approx. 9:45am to 11:15 am.  My condition continued to worsen through the early afternoon with rigors and significant generalized muscle aches.  I experienced tachycardia (90-105 bpm vs normal of ~70bpm),  SOB,  and starting measuring pulse oximetry which read from 89%-94% (my usual does not go below 97%).  This persisted until approximately 8pm with no improvement.  I took 40 mg prednisone, 600 mg ibuprofen and within 3 hours was starting to have symptom resolution. I am a physician and up to date on all my vaccinations.  I have never had anything approaching this type of response.  I don&#39;t know if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection  creates a situation were the very potent mRNA vaccine triggers a large immunologic recall response.  I wanted to get this noted as there may be some reason to alter the vaccine schedule for prior SARS-CoV-2 infections

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

Around 9:30pm that evening, I began to feel fatigued and had a slight headache. I went to bed around10:15-10:30pm. Shortly after going to bed, my headache  worsened and I began having chills. I was a bit restless that night and just did not feel well. These symptoms lasted until about 8am the following morning, 12/24/2020. I was still fatigued and still had a headache, which had lessened in intensity. I no longer had chills. The fatigue wore off throughout the day, but I still had a slight headache. Later in the evening I again became fatigued and still had a slight headache. The following day, my headache subsided, and I was only tired once evening came around. My symptoms had completely dissipated by 12/26/2020.

About one minute later he felt like he could not get a full breath and he felt the need to run away. We connected a heart monitor, did serial vital signs, listen to lung sounds. He symptoms seem to worsen. He did not have hives, his lungs were clear. His HR was normal but his B/P was elevated. We started and IV and gave him 25 mg mg of IV Benadryl. We contacted Dr. via phone. He talked to the patient and he agreed with our assessment and treatment.  He began feeling better about 10 min after the Benadryl and he symptoms cleared by 30 min after Benadryl. We kept him on the heart monitor for 1 hour.  He reported he felt fine and back to normal when he left to go home. He refused ambulance transport to the hospital. All reports will be filled out by me.

                                                About 3-5 minutes after getting the vaccine began experiencing a light headedness feeling. Took my blood pressure and it was a little high (140/95), I attributed this to anxiety but got home and my BP at home was down to about 120/76 about 1 hr. after. I laid down to sleep it off but could not sleep as about 1 hr. after trying to go to sleep I started to get a headache. After about 2 hours of battling it I decided to take a Extra Strength Tylenol which helped with the headache about 2 hrs later is was almost gone but the feeling of lightheadedness/dizziness was still there a bit worse than at the beginning. I slept it off and the next morning it was about 50 % better and by about noon it seemed to be 99% better. Today is Thursday ( on my 3rd day) and still feel a slight dizziness but I also have seasonal allergies which sometimes give me the same symptoms. I expect to be better soon.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

Concerned, sweating,  Bp was very high at that point. Don&#39;t have the exact number. Called for ambulance, paramedics ruled out WPW and gave me iv drug that brought rate down to 120 fairly quickly, Over the next hours resting rate slowly normalized to around 80 (normal for me is 72).  For 2-3 days afterwards had some high resting pulses up to 118 but never as bad and normalized in a few days.

I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

At 22 h after the vaccine I could not abduct my arm due to the local pain, became prostrated (had to lay down all day), lost appetite (only ate 2 cookies all day) and became very fatigued (went to sleep at night at 7 pm instead of my 10 pm regular sleeping time). I measured my temperature twice and it was 37.5 C. I didn&#39;t take antiinflammatory nor analgesic medicine.  At 48 h after the vaccine, I was already 80% better, and at 72 h  has back to normal. I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence. I am fully vaccinated and this was by far my most severe vaccinal reaction.

Every joint and muscle hurt.  Now. 24 hours later from receiving the shot I&#39;m  beginning to feel a little better but muscle pain still present. No fever throughout.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

I woke up I believe in the early morning hours a couple of days later in pain.  The pain caused me to wake up.  After that I noticed that my elbow joints, and knee joints were very sore.  I was unable to flex my arms (mainly right arm) or knees (mainly right knee) after that for approximately two weeks without feeling pain.  Extremely sore joints starting in arm/elbow joint followed by extremely sore knee joints.  Overall body aches mainly in joints.  Persists to the time of this writing

At first he said he felt uneasy and he then later described feeling &#34;like he was tripping&#34;.   He later started feeling confused.  He went to bed around 11p.m. and woke up feeling very tired and achy but was also having a lot of trouble concentrating.  Later in the evening he was acting very confused and he didn&#39;t look well at all.  He was having difficulty verbalizing and conveying his thoughts, he couldn&#39;t remember words and at one point he actually called me &#34;mom&#34;.  I am concerned.  He said he would contact the hotline for adverse reactions on 2/26 if he still felt the same, but I felt it was important to report it either way.  He has never behaved this way before and has no medical history of any sort of memory or mental issues.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12, 2021 the day after I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I woke with severa muscle and joint pain, headache, pain at injection site unable to lift arm above head.  As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

                                                Injection administered on 1/4/21 and was given in upper left shoulder joint opposed to the deltoid muscle. I completely removed my shirt to assure proper placement.  Common soreness to shot experienced next two days after administration, however soreness felt in shoulder joint rather than muscle. Pain re-occurred on 1/12/21 and has not been totally relieved despite the usage of anti-inflammatory medication eg. Ibuprofen 400mg,  Tylenol 500mg along with Ibuprofen for soreness. The worst pain I experience is when I go to sleep being prematurely awaken by aching and throbbing to my affected area. Again, not being any discomfort to muscle but rather left shoulder joint pain where sometimes I am discouraged from raising my left arm to my side. It does not bother me so much to raise my left arm towards my front. I have been working through my discomfort while being very careful not to aggravating it further. My concern comes from the fact that it has not completely gone away after the extended time frame and becomes more intense in the evening.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                Sore area around injection site, irregular temperature, severe fatigue - fatigue lasted the equivalent of two days with the next full day after injection being the worst.  The day after the injection fatigue was debilitating requiring sleeping or resting for most of the day and night. Half way through the second day after the injection fatigue is still present though significantly improved. The Item 21 box for Doctor visit has been checked as I will meet with my primary care provider as soon as possible and have already discussed it with my employer&#39;s health department.

                                                About 12 hours after vaccination, I started to have severe chills, fever, intense headache, body aches, inability to sleep and sweating.  This last 24 hours and then began to dissipate.  The headache left first.  These symptoms mirrored the symptoms I had with COVID minus the sinus drainage and sore throat I had with COVID.  Yet, the symptoms were more intense.  The reaction to the vaccine was the sickest I recall being in the last 20 years.  It was a long 24 hours. I went to the ER and obtained a liter of fluids via IV and motrin type medicine.  I was advised it should last about 24-36 hours and discharged.

                                                On 12 FEB 2021 I received my first dosage of the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine, Lot 016M20A. On the day of the vaccination, the pain from Psoriatic Arthritis  (primarily bi-lateral feet was low in comparison to the average level of pain over the last 7 days).  There was also discomfort in the hips which for time to time had presented with point pain at the connection of the hip to the Femur. BLUF: Most significant joint/muscoskeletal pain related to exacerbation locations for Psoriatic Arthritis that I have ever endured since receiving the injection.  Prepared for second vaccination, but fearful of PSA not being in control and dramatic escalation in discomfort in feet and hips, affecting ability to walk.  I received my vaccination at some time after 1400 hours, 12 FEB.  No issues noted until approximately 2300 hours, 12 FEB, when significant and debilitating pain was noted in multiple joints or areas affected by recent Psoriatic Arthritis exacerbations.   Initial Pain made it difficult to sleep from the 12th into the 13th due to significant discomfort. Through that first night, the pain immediately flared, bilateral feet, left and right hip and point pain at three locations on veterbrae, (lower, mid and upper back).  Pain was most pronounced in feet and left hip,  the feet (all toes seemed to throb in pain and were sensitive to touch or simple movements).  Pain in feet and left hip was a 10/10.  Left hip pain was slightly different than the point pain and seemed to radiate out from the area where it connects to the femur. 13 FEB: By 0815 on 13 FEB the pain in the right foot and right hip decreased, as well as the pain in the lower, mid and upper back but the pain in the left foot and left hip continued, slightly less strong than the night prior.  Pain level decreased to 8/10 for left foot and hip and was down to a 5/10 for the right foot and hip and a 3/10 for the areas on the back. In the evening of 13 FEB it was noted that the pain in the left hip became more generalize:d vice the specific point pain that I have witnessed off/on since SEP 2020.  Continued to note evening pain that felt like burning/tingling pain on both feet.  At this point the pain in the evenings appeared to be worse than the AM pain.   Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 It should be noted, that left shoulder discomfort from the injection never exceed 2/10 as it appeared 24 hours after the injection.  More pain in shoulder associated with mobility/rotation? I lacked the ability to simply walk through the house due to the pain throughout the past 36 hours.   14 FEB: Less discomfort in AM, but still greatest in left foot. Left Foot: 7/10 Fight foot: 4/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 3/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 4/10 PM:  Significant increase in pain at bed time. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 15 FEB: AM: continued lessening of pain/discomfort in AM, but appeared back throughout the day, worsening at evening.  Pain in left hip was noted to be much more pronounced shooting out in multiple directions, to include causing discomfort from the rear of the hip, and when seated shooting pain in the direction of my inner thigh from the back of my hip.  Pain in feet continues to be like a burning/tingling pain in the evening, most pronounced in 2nd and 3rd toes on my left foot and big toe and little toe on my right foot.  The pain also appears to be much greater at evening than in AM. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: Left Hip 8/10 right hip 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10-not much change-very point specific pain.. I am not witnessing fatigue or any other problems other than joint/musco skeletal pain.  I have also not been getting shooting pain in feet that has appeared from time to time which feels like someone hammering nails into individual toes or shots of violent pain, only a sustained burning/tingling pain. four days later the Psoriatic Arthritis locations continue to rage following the vaccine, most notably bilateral feet and left hip, where the pain in the hip appears to be radiating in multiple directions.

                                                Had a continuous headache the entire weekend which would not go away (12/24-12/28) When I came back to work on 12/29 My headache got a little worse (fluorescent lights). When I sat at my computer and started to work my headache got worse and worse like a very bad migraine.  I went outside and the headache subsided.  When I went back to my desk my headache got worse again. I then tried to go to Urgent care but was refused because of possible Covid symptoms. I had to go to Covid Hot zone in our Emergency Room. They released me from work for 2-3 days.  When I came back to work my headache was much more milder and I could handle the slight pain..

                                                Post shot developed the following within hours:  head congestion, dizziness, nausea, brain fogginess, phlegm in my heart, headache, inability to fully concentrate to typical ability, major soreness in arm receiving shot, soreness developed in arm that didn&#39;t receive the shot with intermittent shooting pain at opposite arm shot sight as if being stabbed with a knife.  Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

The first dose was much milder but lasted 6 days.  This second dose seems much worse and am expecting it to last several days more.

I was down and couldn&#39;t function. I took Ibuprofen and tylenol - and it helped with aches and pains a little but not with tiredness and overall feeling bad. I took the 3rd and 4th off but went back to work on 5th although I was sluggish. Felt a lot better on Saturday.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

                                                The evening of 1/11/21 - pain at the injection site and feeling of fatigue - went to bed very early.  Arm pain a bit less next day - felt a little tired all day. Back to &#34;normal&#34; on the 13th.   I am not sure if the following symptoms are related to the vaccine but I feel like I should report them if there may be a link.  1/17/21 -Awoke in the morning with severe neck pain - muscles &#34;locked up.&#34;  Called the doctor - he prescribed Tramadol and Cyclobenzaprine - I took these for two days before my neck calmed back down and I could function &#34;normally&#34; again.  1/28/21 - Started feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; and tired late in the day while still at work.  Went home and went to bed early.  1/29/21 - Felt same as last PM upon waking up.  Felt much better by mid-morning.  Started feeling bad again later in the day.  Felt cold - but no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  1/30/21 - Felt bad all day.  Felt cold - no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  AM - felt anxious, worried, confused.  Built a fire in the fireplace and heat made me feel better. Felt hot-cold-hot-cold- all day.  My neck ached all day.  Sensitive to sounds. Took a single cyclobenzaprine late in the day - seemed to help. Went to bed early.  1/31/21 - Woke up with very sore deltoid muscle at the site of COVID-19 injection. Very hard to lift arm above head.  Hips, back, and neck muscles ache.  Calf muscles feel almost like they are about to cramp.  Mental state better than yesterday. Still sound sensitive. Not as cold feeling as in days prior.  Yoga seems to help.

                                                Afew hours after receiving the inoculation, I was extremely sleepy.   I was sleeping at my job, and my boss had me go home early.  I went to work the next day, however I was feeling weird, my sense of smell and taste were off, as the day continued I started having a headache, body aches, and general malaise.  I went home early, again from work.  But when I arrived to my residence I was having severe chills despite my efforts to try to keep myself warm.  The chills lasted for more than 24hrs, preventing me from sleeping, my body aches were getting worse, my eyes were extremely red, and I did not feel like eating.  Near the end of the day, the chills became sweats, and I was trying to balance between being hot and clammy, to chills.  The next day I paid a visit to my primary care doctor.  I was tested for covid - which was negative, I was tested for the flu - which was negative, and my lungs were clear so there was no reason for my doctor to believe I have a pneumonia.

Day 2: Next morning was difficult getting out of bed. Skin was very sensitive to warm/hot shower water. Achy joints all over. Even my left injection site was sore even though I was injected on the right side. Fatigue at work. I was very wide eyed as described by co-worker. I was a little loopy as I was very giggly and things made me laugh way more than usual. I may have been a little delirious but I was able to work. This lasted until I went to bed. Day 3: When I awoke I felt like a fever had broke, Cooling sweat, but my temp was never over 98.5 degrees. My normal morning temp is usually 97.3 every day, but that one degree made a difference. I feel normal today and realize I was not well the day before.

                                                I developed a rash consisting of many itchy red spots and patches on my front torso (upper chest to top of groin area) and some  similar but fewer spots on my back, arms, legs,  and neck.  My scalp is also itchy.  Rash began as one red spot  in the center of my chest near the breast bone and other spots began to appear.  I noticed the first spot on 1-11 or 1-12; I&#39;m not sure of the exact date.    I scheduled an appointment with my primary care provider for 1-22 at 11:00.  He examined  me and recommended I start a course of OTC antihistamines and topical  cream (Triamcinolone Acetonide .1%) for two weeks.  The rash is a bit less itchy since starting treatment two days ago, but it is still visible and present.  The itchiness woke me from my sleep last night and the night before.

                                                I felt like I had  a cold for the first 3 days after shot. I was fine for 3 days. On the morning of the 6th day, 1/21/21, I had very intense deep muscle pain in my lower back, left arm, hands and headache. About two hours after this started I started to have the very intense chills, my headache got worse and for the first time a low fever of 99 degrees. I felt like this for 2 days, couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 days because of the pain. On the third day 1/24/21, it was much better and almost all gone by the fourth day, 1/25/21. Thank you

Unlike during the disease, my hips strongly ached 24 hours after recieving the injection.  COVID cough returned though not as bad as when I had the disease, as well as fealing weak and out of breath.  All of this lasted for about 36 hours.  Feeling a bit better now, but still winded and weak.   Still plan to get 2nd shot.

                                                Presented to ED for evaluation of generalized lower extremity weakness, falls. The patient states that he carries a diagnosis of MS and typically is fully functioning without assistance of a cane or walker. The patient states that yesterday morning around 0900 he received the second dose of his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was otherwise feeling fine but by last night (12 hours after the vaccine) the patient states he tried to get out of bed and was transferring when he felt his bilateral legs give out, causing him to slide to the ground. His wife then came to help and states that the patient was completely weak in the legs, and was unable to even lift his legs up to get back into bed. They then tried to walk him again a short time later and he again stumbled with weakness in his legs. Since that time, the patient states he has been minimally ambulatory and has been using a cane, but still needs large assistance to get around his home. The patient states he has baseline foot drop but feels this is worse in his legs today. He went to clinic this morning for his symptoms where he was noted to have an elevated temperature and was diffusely weak in his lower extremities. Given this, the patient was referred to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies any weakness in his upper extremities or facial asymmetry. He denies sensation change in his extremities nor any recent illness such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or leg pain. He has no history of stroke. He denies any injuries or head injury, syncope from his falls. He was admitted to the hospital where he will receive further symptomatic treatment as necessary. No treatment provided in emergency department for weakness.

I should add to the other that my blood pressure has elevated since the vaccine.  As part of going on medication on 3/18, it was a concern the medications would elevate my blood pressure.  I bought a wrist BP check device and it was averaging 134/95 on 3/22/2021.  On 3/23/2021, I was prescribed Losartan.  I took one pill at 7:30PM.  Today when I woke up and for most of the day the BP has been 124/77-82.  The ringing remains persistent

Continued to monitor pt and BP trended down (last was 150/82 P56 R16 O2 sat 95-96%).  Pt&#39;s facial tingling, dizziness resolved, headache improved.  Pt stated he almost felt like it was a migraine coming on immediately after getting the shot.  Pt refused transport or further evaluation.  Pt phoned on 1/14 and he stated his s/s had completely resolved and no further complications.

                                                12 hours after began to have a scratch throat.  at 13 hours post dose, had a headache start and an unusual erythematous spot on the posterior palate above Uvula with almost a white scratch appearance inside the erythema.  16 hours post dose began to have fevers and chills.  At 17 hours had severe sweats that soaked the bed with rigorous chills including teeth chattering shaking chills.  Took 800mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep.  Poor sleep with many awakenings.  Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA I have sciatic and have had a rhyzotomy on my right side. On 15 Jan, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I began to get back and leg aches from my sciatica, but on my left side.  I immediately began my routine (exercise) and back brace which usually stop the pain. Over the next two day, the symptoms got worse to the point of extreme pain in my back and all down my left leg.  This resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 17 January.  I have since had an appointment with my pain specialist, and an MRI.  We are awaiting results from the MRI.  The pain has not lessened, and pain medication are only mildly effective. The pain being in my left side make since as the Rhyzotomy had been done on my right side.  I am concerned the vaccine may have cause tissue or nerve swelling. Pain is still intense to the point of immobility and difficulty sleeping.

Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.

Those symptoms lasted approx 3 days.  Two days after the vaccination I also became extremely nauseous.  I was anticipating all of these symptoms.  On the 3rd and 4th days after the vaccine most of the symptoms disappeared but I received some new ones that I was not expecting.  I suddenly felt a large amount of despair and hopelessness.  I had suicidal thoughts.  I had panic attacks and anxiety.  I had paranoia.  I did not feel like I had long to live, or anything to live for.  By 20 Apr all of these emotional and mental side effects were completely gone.

                                                I began to experience lightheadedness, generalized weakness and confusion. My handwriting changed. These faded over the afternoon only to recur at the same time next morning, resolving in the afternoon once again. I was afraid i was having a heart attack and called 911 and was taken to Hospital where I ruled out for an MI. In the ambulance i received four baby aspirin. I was discharged that night. The next morning, i  developed poor balance and fell twice while walking. Weakness also recurred with confusion. I could not stand myself up. I went to another Hospital and spent the night in Observation. The next morning no symptoms occurred but I refrained from walking as much as possible that day. At hospital I received IV fluid and my usual medications. Neurology consultation revealed possibly abnormal reflexes and poor balance. I received a cane from physical therapy. Since then symptoms have mostly not resolved but weakness and falls have recurred. Evaluation for fall and poor balance continues to date. I received the second dose of the Moderna immunization as scheduled without incident.
