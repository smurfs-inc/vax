                                                Patient received Moderna covid vaccine which is not yet approved for patients under 18.   Pharmacist did not realize only the Pfizer vaccine is approved for under 18 at this time.  Confusion arose from state&#39;s phased rollout of vaccine populations, where now all patients 16&#43; are able to be vaccinated but the limitations on which vaccine were not made abundantly clear.  No adverse events/effects reported.  Patient is in good health with no issues.

                                                At approximately 2 PM on Wednesday the 10th, I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and feverish. Color drained from my face and I also began to lose track of the conversation I was having. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace of the conversation and eventually realized I couldn&#39;t remember what we were talking about. Looking back on the event now, I could only remember what was happening for around. 2 minute span before I forgot it. After losing my ability to form new memories, I began to lose old ones. I would look through pictures and not recognize faces, listen to songs and not remember the artists, and lose entire gaps of my past. My parents described my memory loss as that of a concussion but, to be frank, I don&#39;t remember much of any of it. All of my past memories have returned, but I still have yet to regain my memory from 2 PM to 10 PM of that day.

He landed on his buttocks and did not appear to hit his head.  He immediately appeared conscious but disoriented.  He had a steady pulse and no itching or rash or trouble breathing, but he seemed pale.  EMT was called and upon evaluation determined that he did not need further treatment.  The patient went home with his mother.

                                                This patient had some dizziness after the shot and was apprehensive in receiving it. He claimed he felt dizzy and in seconds had slumped off of his chair. He was unresponsive for a few seconds only about 5-10 seconds and we gave him an IM Benadryl as a precaution. He awoke complaining of a funny feeling in the mouth and tongue but had no rash or redness or swelling to indicate an allergic reaction. We decide to monitor closely for an escalation of symptoms but to have a EpiPen handy, and call an EMT unit. His blood pressure was low at first at around 107/68  then quickly come up in about 10 minutes to 130/80. With no other issues we believe he had a vasovagal syncope but wanted the ER to make sure we were correct. I called and checked on him after he was at the ER. and the nurse stated that he was doing very well and that they had seen this happen with the vaccine at other site locations.

                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.

We got to him quickly and held him up while it appeared he was fainting.  We lowered him to the ground and called 911 and his father that was in store .  He complained of being very hot and dizzy.  He began to recover fairly quickly,  he drank some water and stayed on floor.  His dad arrived and the 911 call was cancelled due to his improving awareness.  He stayed in the lobby  for 20-30 minutes.  He felt much better and left with his dad in good physical condition.

He then sat up and indicated he did not remember slouching.  I explained to him that his blood pressure probably just went too low and asked him to continue breathing and try to put his head between his legs. He seemed fairly alert but a few seconds later, experienced some body jerking and I asked his father to call EMS, which he did.  Customer then seemed to be in a semi alert state and started sweating profusely.  I continued talking to him and watched for a fall until the EMS arrived.  EMS triaged him and took him from the store.  EMS reported systolic blood pressure unmeasurable upon arrival and around 70 at time of taking him from location (approximate numbers)

                                                Within hours of getting the shot, patients left eye started turning red. He visited a medical facility and they diagnosed him pink eye and gave him antibiotic drops. The drops did not seem to be working and by that Monday he went to see the eye doctor. Eye doctor said it was viral pink eye and thought it was strange that this came about right after the vaccine and in the eye on the same side he was vaccinated. Over the next days and weeks, the viral infection moved to the other eye. Both eyes stayed swollen, red and tearing constantly. He has lost some of his vision and says that things far away are very fuzzy looking. The doctor said it was the worst case of viral pink eye he has ever seen and that he would have it for the long haul of 4 to 6 weeks. He had to do a medical withdrawal from college due to missing too much of the nursing program he is enrolled in. The pinkeye is still ongoing and we don&#39;t know when it will be over.

                                                Patient had parked in the COVID vaccine waiting area, and was observed to fall forward onto his steering wheel within a few minutes of parking by 2 other participants waiting in the car next to him. One of them immediately notified one of the parking lot volunteers who came and got me within 1 minute of this observation. 2 students and I came quickly to the open drivers side door and began talking to assess the situation. Mr. Bannister appeared pale, mildly diaphoretic (sweating) and slightly confused as to the passage of time, but was able to state and spell his name and talk coherently about his circumstances. He stated that he was not allergic to anything that he knew about, and that he had no prior history of similar reactions to vaccines or medicines although he had not taken any shots in several years. He noted that he had not eaten anything since breakfast (now mid-afternoon). He described himself as initially feeling weak, faint, and nauseated with his vaccinated arm feeling heavy and numb. He also reported that he had a sensation of blurriness before passing out, but denied any spinning sensation, visual loss or ringing in the ears. There were no obviously visible abrasions or bleeding on his face or forehead. The nursing students brought a chair, and we elevated his legs and gave him some water to drink during the time we were monitoring his vital signs. He refused a cupcake because of the nausea, but as time progressed he gained facial color and was more comfortable in conversing. His hands had equal muscle grip and strength, visible fingernail beds were pink and his capillary refill was less than 3 seconds. Towards the end of our monitoring, he did accept some nuts and M &amp; Ms to eat. A University Safety Medical Report was completed by the appropriate safety personnel. He was fully AAO x 3 at the end of our monitoring, and stated that if he felt better he would drive to his apartment (less than 5 minutes away) but would wait for his girlfriend to get out of class if he did not feel fully capable of driving. We encouraged him to eat something light when he got home, to use cool water/warm water soaks at his shot site, exercise his arm, and to take an NSAID for pain relief the next day. We recommended that he eat something light before his second shot (which had already been scheduled), that he bring someone with him the next time, and as a precaution to wait 30 minutes following the second shot. He left at 3: 15 pm driving his car without any apparent difficulties. An online report was completed for the incident 04/20/2021.

I asked him if he was ok and he said that we was dizzy and wanted water. I had him sit down. I had my coworker 911 and I got him a bottle of water. He was sweating but felt better after drinking water. He reported to the Firemen that he had not eaten or drank that day yet. I asked him if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. The paramedics arrived and they checked his blood pressure. They said he looked good and was ok to leave.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the Moderna vaccine, this writer was called to the patient room by other staff.  The patient was extremely confused and not speaking to anyone.  He was gazing to the left and not making eye contact with this writer, who was loudly talking to the patient.  Multiple attempts were made to get the patient&#39;s attention with no success.  The patient then began to involuntarily raise his bent left arm in front of his face and then back down to his side.  In this writer&#39;s opinion, the patient was having a silent seizure.  This writer sat with the patient, who became aware approximately 15 seconds later.  He was able to answer questions and was quickly reoriented.  At this point this writer had the staff call 911 for further evaluation.  After answering basic questions appropriately., this writer gathered vital signs on the patient .  The first set of vitals were:   bp 88/48, pulse 60, respirations 14/min, oxygen saturation 93% on room air, temp 98.5.  After small conversation with the patient, another set of vitals were taken:   bp 94/70, pulse 68, respirations 15/min, oxygen saturation 95% on room air, temp 98.8.  We then had the patient drink some water, then had him lie down in the patient room until EMS arrived.  By the time they arrived, the patient was completed reoriented and laughing with office staff.  EMS evaluated the patient and deemed him safe to go home with his friend driving.  This writer walked the patient to the car to assess balance and coordination.  This writer informed the patient and his friend to call 911 if symptoms returned.  The patient agreed.

                                                patient lost consciousness about 30 seconds after receiving the vaccine. Initially I treated it as a syncopal episode and was just trying to wake him up but he began to shake (seizure-like) after about 15 seconds. I could not rule out anaphylaxis so I administered a dose of epinephrine via epipen. Patient regained consciousness approximately 5 to 10 seconds after epipen. EMS arrived approximately 10 minutes later and took patient to the hospital for further observation. Patient vomited on ambulance ride but did not lose consciousness again.  Patient reportedly fine after being administered fluids but reports no memory of ambulance ride or even being vaccinated.

                                                Awoke with incapacitating headache the day after the second dose. Headache has still persisted at the time of this report but has gone down in severity and is accompanied by a feeling of pressure in the head. Severe brain fog also started the day after second dose. Brain fog still continues but is intermittent and gets worse when other symptoms do. Profound fatigue started the day after the second dose and still continues and leaves me mostly housebound. Multiple episodes of post-exertional malaise have occurred in which symptoms are severely exacerbated after mental or physical exertion. I am now unable to exercise.

He was breathing ok, but was in a state of panic. He requested we call 911, which we did immediately, and gave him an ice pack. EMTs arrived and he refused transport. He called his mother, who came and got him. EMTs waited with him until she arrived.

He went to work and began to feel worse.  His co-workers noticed that he was not completing his paperwork correctly and he struggled doing his daily tasks.  He stated he felt like he was going to pass out and was out of breath.  His supervisor sent him home.  He attempted to drive home and swerved off the road.  He parked his car and got a ride home.  He slept for several hours.  He stated he is feeling better this evening.  Now he has a headache, but does not have dizziness, unsteady gait, or feeling like he will pass out.  I advised him that headache is a possible side effect of the vaccine, but the other symptoms are uncommon.  I asked him to seek medical attention if the symptoms come back.  He voiced understanding.

                                                He had the vaccine on 05/12/2021. It started at 1 am, he had a pretty normal night, he went to bed and woke up vomiting, that continued through the night, the vomiting continued, he had a head ache, he called me and told me that his stomach really hurt, I told him to check his blood sugar, he also had  hot flashes, chills, and body aches, but mainly he had vomiting, then the next day 5/14/2021 he was getting more sleepy and less responsive, his friends tried to give him water and different things, his blood sugar went up, his friends took him that afternoon to the ER because he started not responding to me, his friends would tell me he was sleeping, so they took him to the ER, they found that he was very dehydrated, they were giving him fluids and did blood work, he was very unresponsive when he arrived, he could not answer his questions, he had a friend that was there that told them he had the vaccine, the blood work said he had a very high white blood cell count they were worried he had sepsis, they found his kidneys were not working ok, because his levels were very crazy and chest pain and severe stomach pain, and he had pancreatitis, they ruled out a heart attack, he then was admitted because he was in DKA, diabetic keto acidosis, like a result of his type 1 diabetes that got flared up because of all his reactions. They admitted him to the ICU and he was there until 05/16/2021 and basically they were just giving him fluids, potassium and other things to help his body calm down and stabilize his blood sugar. He was released and he still continues that his heart hurts but doctors say that these things resolve after a while.

Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

                                                I obtained my booster shot on my left deltoid at 2:30 PM 2/4/2021. I had slight soreness in my arm til 8:00 which the soreness disappeared. Around 2:00 AM, I was awakened by a pounding headache, fever of 102, and my upper left chest (unilateral between the midline of my left chest and the axillary region) started to hurt. I took Tylenol 1000 mg at 3 and took a hot bath (recommended by  friend who also displayed a fever and headache). After a while, my fever began to lower but my headache and chest pain did not disappear and I could not sleep until 7 AM. I woke up today (2/5/2021) at 10 AM with a fever of 101.4, another pounding headache, and still unilateral chest pain. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol around 10:30 AM and it only helped with the fever. I went back to sleep and slept until 4 PM. I understand that the fever and headache are normal symptoms but my chest pain does not seem like muscle soreness. It doesn&#39;t hurt when I touch it, it comes and goes every few seconds, I have 4 or 5/ 10 on the pain scale for most of the pain but it turns into 6 or 7/10 occasionally (10 being the worst pain). What does help with my pain when it is 6 or 7/10 is when I clench my chest really hard like I am flexing it. It is a sharp pain that stays for a few seconds before it disappears and it feels like a deep pain. I didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol again because I am about to max out (can only take 2 more capsules until 2:00 AM because it states not to take more than 6 capsules in 24 hours, and each capsule is 500 mg) (Also, the Tylenol does not help with the pain so I am only taking it for my fever.) I was wondering if anyone else reported this and if this is an adverse side effect.  This has not cause any issues regarding my breathing but just pain.

                                                I almost fainted the night after my shot. I had vaped cannabis prior at around 1:00am, and probably re-dosed at around 3:00AM, before falling asleep at around 4:30AM. I had a harder than normal time falling asleep that night, and I didn&#39;t sleep very well. At around 6:00AM I woke up and walked to the bathroom, feeling pain in my anal region. As I started to sweat profusely, I recognized that I was likely about to faint, so I pre-emptively lied down on the floor of the bathroom until I felt well enough to stand up. I don&#39;t remember exactly how long I was on the floor but most likely a few minutes. I then had a bowel movement, still feeling pain in my anal region but to a lesser degree, and then drank some water and went back to sleep at around 6:30AM.

A ER note was  generated in a T-Con on a patient who got their 2nd Covid Vaccine and began experiencing chest pain approx. 12 hours post vaccine. Patient did not report to the ER until 28Feb21. It was discussed that he has myocarditis v pericarditis, elevated D-Dimer of 770, swollen lymph nodes, and elevated Troponin. Patient was transferred to Research Medical Center due to no available beds. Patient was referred to a Case Manager and Cardiology. The patient completed a follow up appointment with 509 MDG on 9Mar21 and reported Dull pain that has been affecting sleep. Cardiology reports shows Troponin was elevated to 9.1 decreased to 4.2 and back up again to 13.4. Cardiac revealed late gadolinium enhancement, possibly representing myocarditis and then at discharge possibly myocarditis.

He uses an IPAD for communication, he understands most direction given if it is something he has learned. Since receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccination our Son has shown bouts of rage, a rash between his shoulder blades and on his left hip area, both rashes come and go and both rashes are the same type and size. He is typically active; however, the energy level is through the roof, what we mean by through the roof, it is so very extreme that he cannot settle down for anything, he normally sits on our couch and watches a movie but he cannot sit for even 2 minutes without trying to throw himself off the couch.  It is typical for him to sleep through the night, but now he cannot sleep more then 3 or 4 hours and he does not go back to sleep, he cries which is not typical.

                                                My left arm was sore starting a few minutes after the vaccine. This soreness last through that night. When I woke up the next day, my arm was extremely sore and I was very dizzy. Additionally, my pulse felt fast but my heartbeat seemed to have less strength. My breathing felt more shallow like I wasn&#39;t getting as much oxygen from the air that I breathed in as I should. For the first two weeks, the dizziness was very strong. Now, at the three-week mark, it is more manageable and life is somewhat returning to normal. I visited an ENT doctor and their diagnosis was that my dizziness was not being caused by a preexisting medical condition.  Their prediction was that I would be fine, though looking back, I downplayed the severity of my vertigo. At its worst, I felt that, when I went for a walk outside, the surface was the Earth was violently spinning through space, with me stuck to the surface. It felt paralyzing. My body felt almost stuck in shock. I was afraid I would be stuck with this dizziness for the rest of my life since it was so long-lasting. Now, I am taking ginger pills and am watching my sodium intake. I feel better but am extra vigilant about taking ginger and not stressing myself too much. I do not plan on getting a second shot since some of my symptoms mirror those of anaphylaxis.

                                                Pt Fainted shortly after receiving vaccination. Pt came for a moderna covid vaccine with his friend, both first doses. Pt said he &#34;fainted recently&#34; from a shot where he fainted &#34;for a couple minutes&#34; according to his nurse, and he was sure it was psychologically induced by anxiety. He said he was more mentally prepared this time. After I gave the dose to him and his friend, he got lightheaded and slowly started losing consciousness in his seat after a few minutes.   Pt was alert and responded to our questions. I quickly stepped out to give the pt a bottle of water, and upon coming back to the IMZ room, his friend said he urinated himself. He was less responsive, but still alert. I notified the technician. He started to turn pale and felt more cold. He pulse was weak. I encouraged the pt&#39;s friend to keep him alert while we call EMS. I reminded the pt to keep breathing.   The technician called EMS, and I stayed with the patient to kept him calm, but alert until EMS arrived. Pt slowly felt better after a few minutes (color return, and temperature normalized). Pt said he was okay, and he was able to walk. EMS arrived and tested blood sugar; he was within normal range. Pt did not need EMS service, and went home with friend.

                                                At the pre-counsel stage, the patient said that he was a little nervous about getting this immunization, but wanted to go ahead and do it.  I counseled him on the immunization and sent him into the booth to get the shot.  Technician administered the vaccine and then told Technician that he felt a little nauseous.  Technician told him to stay seated.  A few seconds later the patient passed out and started slipping down the chair.  Technician grabbed him from behind and called me over to assist.  I yelled for Staff to call 9-1-1 and a code white.  I held him from the front and Technician held him from the back and we slowly lowered the patient to the floor.  Technician sat behind the patient to hold him up while I assessed the patient and tried see if he was responsive.  The patient was breathing and had a pulse, so I patted him on the face and chest to see if he would become responsive.  After about 15 seconds, the patient became responsive and confused.  He asked what happened and if he got the shot yet or not.  After talking to the patient for a moment he said he was fine, but needed to vomit.  I gave him a trash can and he vomited.  We gave the patient some water and sat with him on the ground for a few minutes until the paramedics arrived.  The paramedics took the patient&#39;s vitals and the patient said he felt fine and declined going to the hospital.  We had the patient sit in the observation area for another 30 minutes.  He said he felt totally fine and was ready to go home.

                                                Vaccine was administered at approximately 6:15PM and patient was instructed to sit in waiting room for 10 to 15 minutes to make sure he was OK. He looked fine and sat looking at his phone for approximately 5 minutes. He then  stood and walked to pick up window and asked if it was normal to have stomach pains. I said no and asked if he felt dizzy. He said &#34;no&#34; then turned to go back to his chair. As soon as he turned he said &#34;now I feel dizzy&#34;. I told him to return to his chair and he suddenly crumbled to the floor. I had my technician call 911. After 1 to 2 seconds of being unresponsive he suddenly came to. I had him continue laying on floor for a couple minutes and then he got up on his own and went to the chair. We gave him a cool towel for his neck and had him lean his head forward and down onto a chair placed in front on him.  The paramedics came within minutes and found him to be OK.  After they left he continued sitting in the chair for approximately 10 more minutes while talking on the phone (to his parents, I think). He then left stating that he was now OK and that it probably happened because he was nervous

Approx, 10 minutes later I heard a noise and looked over at his and noticed he was started to fall out of his chair. He then became as stiff as a board and I held him in place until he came to. He was seemingly scared and not aware of his surroundings. He said that he was feeling better but was still light headed. He was given an icepack and water and took his mask off. He looked pale. He started to feel better and left approx 10 minutes after this happened. He told me that he was feeling dizzy before he passed out.

                                                I woke up at 9 am with a splitting headache, tried to stand up and I was dizzy and more sore than I had ever been across my whole body. It was incredibly hard to walk also, but I would contribute alot of that to the adductor exercise I had done the previous day. I was also drained of enegery and just wanted to sleep though no position was comfortable. I had an appetite and was able to eat and take some acetaminophen. This along with rest, alot of water and patience seemed to work. The side effects from the vaccine were gone by the next morning.

                                                About an hour after getting the shot, the skin on my right arm was flushing before going numb. Then my shoulder went partially numb and it&#39;s still numb/frozen as of 2:20 am 26/June/2021. Over the course of nine hours from when I got the shot, starting at around 1 hour after, I started to get symptoms, which as of right now are still here. After my skin started acting up, my blood pressure dropped and my heart was pounding extremely hard in my chest and felt tight. My muscles have been going between losing muscle tone and being locked up extremely hard. I&#39;ve been dizzy since about 3:00 pm 25/June/21, and it has progressively gotten worse to where I feel like I am going to pass out if I stand up. I have chills that make my chest tighten up and cause angina. I have been feeling  very faint since around 9:00pm. I&#39;ve had a mild headache since around 2:30pm, and have been feeling like I am falling since about 1am. Breathing takes manual effort. I have been feeling dissociated and nauseous since about 6pm and cannot remember much from after 6pm. I am not sure whether it is a medical emergency or not but I can&#39;t afford to go to the er.

Paramedics observed and released him . Patient said he always gets nervous when he gets any type of shot or blood drawn and this type of situation has happened in the past. This was unknown to us when administering the vaccine.

                                                I got the Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday April 1st and then 2 days later on Thursday April 3rd I started developing headaches and they got worse and I would say they fluctuated to migraines. Every day I would have a degree of a migraine (which I do NOT have history of) and most days the head pain limited my activity significantly. I had 2 evenings where it got really bad. Once on Saturday April 3rd and then again on Wednesday April 7th. I have had headaches continueally since then. Some days better than others and some days worse.

I had nerve damage to my tongue from oral surgery so I dont know if its related. I started to develop vertigo today the 15th around 1pm. Vertigo has come and gone on waves. Have had a mild headache all day as well. In addition Ive had alot of trouble concentrating.

                                                Patient fainted shortly after receiving second dose of Moderna Covid vaccine. When I approached the patient he was laying on the ground and very pale but still breathing. I rolled him onto his back and elevated his feet and asked him to keep breathing and try to stay calm. I asked someone to grab him some water and someone else to run to the pharmacy and grab the pharmacy manager while I monitored the patient. I asked if I could help him sit up to drink some water and he accepted. After sitting up I asked if he had eaten and if I could get him something to eat. He stated he hadn&#39;t eaten all day and that he had a panic disorder and felt like he was having a panic attack. I asked if he had medicine he needed to take to help him feel better, he stated no, he needed to just wait it out. Then he told me he felt like he was going to throw up and I got him a waste basket that he threw up in right away. I asked the patient if he hit his head or if he wanted us to call an ambulance; he stated no to both questions. The pharmacy manager arrived and sat with the patient for the next half hour or more until he felt better. He stated that his dad was going to take him home now that he felt better. Some store staff had us fill out an incident report and the pharmacy manager walked the customer out to his car where he said he would call and find his dad.

                                                Around 3 pm on 4/14/21, I started to feel very tired and I started to get a headache. Around 6 pm, I started to experience lower back pain and my legs began to throb and my whole body became very sensitive to touch. I took tylenol or ibuprofen every 4 hours for the rest of the night. This went on until Thursday 4/15/21, when the dizziness and throbbing headache started. Every time I would stand up I would become off balanced and need to hold on to something. I was still experiencing the lower back pain, leg throbbing and skin sensitivity but the dizziness and headache became much more intense. Around 9:30  pm on Thursday, I felt like I was hallucinating and was experiencing euphoria along with a fever. I did not sleep the night of 4/15 into 4/16. I was sweating profusely with a throbbing headache that would cause spinning when I would stand up. Around 3 am on 4/16, I fell asleep until around 4:30 am when I woke up in a pool of my own sweat. The body aches, leg pain and skin sensitivity went away along with my fever. Throughout Friday 4/16, I had a throbbing headache and was dizzy with no relief. This continued into Sunday 4/18 when I started to feel some relief. My headache was pretty much gone but the dizziness is still very much there. I have also an experienced elevated heart rate and respirations throughout the last 5 days.

For the rest of the next day I still felt bad but condition slowly improved. Took Tylenol a few times which helped a bit

I was alerted and I helped him into the vaccination room to lay down on the floor with his feet propped up. His girlfriend was there to help calm him down. I offered to call 911, he refused. I grabbed a fan for him, and turned it off when he requested. He then began shivering rather uncontrollably and said his left arm (injection site) was hurting and tingling, and at one point, said his right arm was beginning to tingle as well.  We had him breath and relax, he began to return to normal and he and girlfriend discussed how he must be partly having an anxiety/panic attack. He trialed standing up a few times until he felt good enough to leave the room, all in all about 20 minutes. He sat close by for additional 15 minutes of observation, at which point he left stating he felt more like himself.

Did not appear to hit his head or significantly injure himself in any way but reported headache and some confusion on regaining consciousness.  Slowly moved to sitting position and allowed to recover.

                                                It started off with me becoming really irritable over the smallest things.  I started getting cold chills even though it was 70F.  I had a nightmare that felt like an eternity. My dreams get warped when I&#39;m sick.  I woke up and I had a headache that was centered around several spots in my head. I couldn&#39;t get comfortable no matter what I did.  It&#39;s impossible to lay down on the side you get the shot on. It hurt like... 7x more than the first one when they&#39;re administering it.  The scariest symptoms though, for me, was that I couldn&#39;t catch my breath. You know when you take a hot shower and you can&#39;t really breathe 100% because of the steam? That&#39;s how I felt all day after the 2nd dose. Also, I couldn&#39;t tell if I was full or not when I ate. The only way I could tell was stomach pains.   That&#39;s all that&#39;s happening/has happened to me. I do feel better alot better though two days after having the 2nd dose.

When the patient came to he said he must have gone to sleep.  The patient stated he passed out the week before and thought it was due to not eating.  EMS checked vitals, and all vitals were good.  Pt refused to go to the hospital, he left with his wife and she drove.  I told the patient I would follow up with him via a phone call to see how he was feeling.  I called pt at 5 pm on 5-28, he stated he was fine

                                                Symptoms much like a concussion however not suffuring any head injuries. Strong persistent headaches after long periods of complex thoughts of new content. Causes need to pause for long periods of times before continuing any learning. Being upright for long periods of time may also cause this effect from observations at school. Difficult or near impossible to retain any and all new information. Recall or use of previous experiences or knowledge shows without a severe headache. Sitting down for long periods of time and working from there mitigate a fair bit of the strain. Anatomy teacher had thoughts it may be an increase in cranium pressure due to the throbing in the back of head.  Changed just about anything in my daily schedule to try to isolate the variable by changing one thing a day, eventually got through my day to day with no potential variables isolated.  (On going)  Notable less headaches with work i am familiar with or have a deep grasp of already. Tried picking up other hobbies during the pandemic with no luck in retention.

Maybe a little nervous thinking I COULD possibley be unlucky few and have a bad adverse effect. However on the drive back home,  calmly singing along to my music, I all of a sudden felt an increase of heart rate. I could still drive fine, but my head had a radiating feeling and it&#39;s almost like I got a random adrenaline rush. My heart rate must&#39;ve been 150&#43; bpm. It lasted for 20ish seconds and started to go away as I slowed my breathing. Not sure if it was a direct effect of the vaccine or my mind...as I had never gotten such effect on me.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

                                                Woke up with a headache and fatigue, as well as soreness near area of injection. Energy was very low and felt very tired. Tried to sleep at around 12:00 PM but had a thumping in my head that would not let me fall asleep. Around 3:00 PM tried to sleep again but being shivering/shaking a lot despite being under a blanket and comforter. Eventually needed to take a hot bath for around 45 minutes to an hour. Took my temperature while in the bath which read 96°F (although that thermometer may not be the most accurate.) After the bath I went directly to bed with a comforter, blanket and weighted blanket and was able to fall asleep for about 90 minutes. Was no longer shivering when I awoke and felt much better. Went to sleep at around 9:00 PM and felt fine when I woke up the next morning.

The next day I had the worst headache of my life and my body kept switching between feeling hot and cold. That night, I was able to sleep, but I woke up drenched in sweat.

Temperature gradually rose. ~99.7 at 6pm, 100.1 at 7pm, 100.7 at 8pm, 101.7 at 9:30pm. I took some Tylenol around 7pm, and then some theraflu at 10pm.   Fell asleep at 11pm. Periodically waking up every 30min from 1am onwards. Muscle discomfort, sweating, and nausea continued until 3:45 AM, at which point I was feeling better and was able to sleep continuously.   Feeling much better in the morning on March 4th. Temperature was 99.9, then rose to 100.0 at 11am. Now, at 3pm, feeling fatigue, exhaustion. No headache. Normal sense of taste and smell. No couch.  Taking another day off from work. Temperature is currently 100.0. Taking more theraflu now, have not taken Tylenol today.

Later at around 6:30 PM I took an Advil tablet for the pain. At around 7:30 PM I took a second one since the pain was still strong after the first one. I took a third Advil tablet at around 11:30 PM. At around 12:30 AM on March 6, while going to sleep, fever-like symptoms started such as high body temperature, chills, congestion and aches. Fever symptoms continued as I intermittently woke up around 6-8:00 AM, and as I woke up again around 9:50 AM the feverish side effects had mostly subsided. Arm soreness has also decreased dramatically but is still present.

                                                A couple of hours after my fist dose Moderna vaccine, my left arm began to hurt, I also developed headaches, body aches and left arm swelling. At 1am-2am, I could not move my left arm and my fever was 103.3F. I contacted urgent care who told me to take Ibuprofen as pain medication.  My symptoms did decrease although I still have today difficulty sleeping and sweat at night which I did not have before the vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

At 1948, EMT noticed that the client?s face was becoming pale and diaphoretic. EMT alerted PHN and both responded to the patient at 1948 and transitioned the client into the zero gravity chair. Client was reluctant to sit in the zero gravity chair and stated, ?I?m feeling anxious and this is not helping especially with my aunt.? Client?s aunt was very concerned and was anxious about what was happening and was standing over the client. PHN asked the aunt to sit in her seat and allow us to assess the client. PHN also explained to the client that this was a precaution and not meant to create more anxiety. PHN offered the client a juice which he accepted and drank. At 1952 client stated, ?I?m feeling fine now, I?m not sweating anymore.? Vital signs were taken at 1952 (Blood pressure 130/70, heartrate 87, Oxygen 98%). At 1952, client?s color had returned to his face and his skin was no longer diaphoretic. PHN  asked the client if he has history of fainting from needles, and the client stated, ?no, but I have anxiety.? Vital signs were taken at 2002 (blood pressure 112/70, heart rate 68, oxygen 97%). Client stated that he ate two hours before receiving the vaccine. Vital signs taken at 2010 (blood pressure 114/74, heart rate 78, oxygen 97%). Vital signs taken at 2018 (112/74, heart rate 66, oxygen 97%). Client does not have any medical conditions or allergies and is not taking any medications. PHN  provided education to the client on when to seek emergency medical services and to follow up with his primary care provider before receiving his second dose. At 2019 client stated, ?I?m feeling fine,? and left the facility unassisted with a steady gait.

I then felt nauseous and threw up, and my body began to ache. 12 hours post vaccination I began to develop a fever of 99.8 with the use of acetaminophen and had severe chills / muscle aches.  The fever progresses to 101.1 about 36hours post vaccine and declined to 100.8 48 hours post vaccine. By 72 hours the fever was gone as well as all symptoms excluding fatigue and a slight headache.

Around 5 PM is when I started feeling a tingling feeling in my hands, feet, and around the outside of my mouth. I still have a loss of feeling in my feet after returning to work today, 1/25/2021, and I was promptly sent home after informing my management. I still have some loss of feeling around the corners of my mouth, and most of the feeling has recovered in my hands.

He was able to take Tylenol but then the staff noted his eyes rolled back in his head.   911 was called but he was not transported since his temperature was now normal and he seemed  to be at baseline.   He did not eat or drink much liquids later that night and in the morning of 2/25/21 around 9 AM, staff could not get him up from bed.   He was incontinent and had temperature of 97.7.  He was staring off and not talking or responsive.   911 was called and he was transferred to the ER and later admitted.   All labs and Xrays were normal and later on 2/26/21 he was awake and alert.    Of note, Patient also received news on the afternoon he got his second vaccine that a favorite staff person had been killed in a MVA.   Patient  was upset at this news at the time.

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

                                                I kept a log of the events that occurred. Notes: 25mg amitriptyline taken nightly for the last month, 200mg motrin I?ve never taken pain killers before this, time is in military.   Mar 18  1430 (1 hour 30 mins after my shot) i have a compressing headache toward the back of my head so i take 1 motrin.  1700 i head home, take 1 amitriptyline and head straight to sleep. ( i have no apatite so no dinner ) Mar 19 0100 The pain starts, it?s unbearable. I am sweating heavily and im also shivering cold. i have a high fever I have body aches which turns my shivering into shaking which keeps my wife up all night. In my dreams i feel pain. I talked to my deceased mother, i hold my deceased cat and i relive some of my most regrettable moments.  0700 I wake up, the bed is soaking wet. I take a motrin and get dressed. it takes me an hour longer to get ready for work because, the pain has sapped my energy. My supervisor sends me home seeing how horrible I look. 0900 I take an amitriptyline and lay down. I ask me wife to close to the storm shutters to darken the room. They are normally pretty quiet to close but, this time they are deafeningly loud. I struggled to get 1 hour of sleep.  1500 I wake up due to shaking so bad that i hit my head on the wall. I then take 2 motrin and about 30 mins later i notice theres a tightness in my chest. i take 1 tums. I know that my body is exhausted from the pain and my mind is clouded but i really wanted to do all of the tasks that i was planning on doing this weekend. All of the tasks end up failing. 2100 i try the tasks again and end up failing again.   20 Mar 0100. I eat a pear and 2 cheetos. i do not take a amitriptyline and i lay down. i have no pain or fever. (Dream start) The dream i had is of me watching myself get thrown around by a ghost. The ghost possesses my body for a short time. I grab some kittens (cats are a comfort to me so im guessing that my subconscious trying to reel me back in) I then wake my sleeping wife and tell her theres a ghost and we need to leave. We walk outside and im in an old neighborhood that i grew up in, everything darkens and im in pitch black feeling my way around a room. I open my eyes and im in a hotel. The front desk staff will not let me take the kittens up to my room so i leave them. When i walk into the room, it?s full of kittens (dream end) and i wake up  21 Mar 0900 I wake up and I have a sore throat and tightness in my chest. The soreness prevents me from going back to sleep and the tightness in my chest causing some anxiety. Once I calm myself down and convince myself that im not having a heart attack I take 2 motrin and some tums and the pain goes away from the day. These could be some withdrawals from not taking amitriptyline since 19 mar in the morning. This is still happening as I write this report. (23 March 2021)

                                                Patient warned me prior to administering the shot that he had a phobia to needles.  He did very well during the shot, but while waiting in the observation area he was speaking to another customer about needles and after she described a bad experience with an iv he went pale and slumped in his seat.  The other customer brought this to my attention and I checked on patient, who had dropped all this things on the floor by the chair and he said he was having a panic attack.  He said he felt very hot so we got him a bottle of water and fanned him until he started feeling better.  After about 15 minutes he said he was feeling much better and said he thought he might have blacked out for a moment because he didn&#39;t remember dropping his things.  He said he had rushed here after work and was hot and tired and that may have contributed to the panic attack.  His mother came and drove him home.

I have seemed medical care multiple times. Been given 2 different steroid creams, 3 different antibiotics. The most recent visit (2 days ago) I was given Pepcid and Zyrtec. At this point I cannot sleep due to the heat and pain coming from the sites of the rash and need something to resolve it

He had fallen onto the floor beside his chair. I immediately went out to pt. His eyes were fluttering. I shook pt and asked if he was okay. Pt opened his eyes and sat up seemed disoriented and said that he felt nauseated. I told pt to lay down on his back and elevate his feet on the chair, and told my technician to grab a bucket, an ice pack, and to call code white. We applied the ice pack to pts head. A member of management and an EMT who happened to be in the store reported over very shortly. Pt said he did think that he hit his head and his head did hurt. We asked the pt if he wanted us to call an ambulance. Pt said no, he was feeling a little better and he just wanted to wait a little bit and then finish his shopping. Pt was feeling better and was able to get back into the chair and sit. Pt appeared pale and we got him a drink of water. Pt sat and rested for sometime and after about an hour he said he was okay and was going to finish his shopping.

Patient was already sweating through his shirt and pants.  After the shot patient fainted.  It was likely due to the extreme nervousness and not an adverse reaction to the vaccination.

He said he felt normal shortly after, I monitored for another 10 minutes, then tried sitting upright in a chair again for 10&#43; minutes, felt fine before heading out.

Fever of 99.5, strong chills and shaking, and mild nausea started at 10PM as I prepared for bed, persisted through the night, but chills and nausea gone in morning, and fever mildly subsided. Took NyQuil before going to bed to treat fever.  Chills returned next night, but much milder than before and for shorter.  Took ibuprofen, 2 tablets twice a day for next two days. Dizziness and mental fog persisted until 3 days after injection.

They were going to the car and he got in first as he was going to drive, and mother got in the car, and he acted like his head was spinning, had a blank stare and started making weird sounds like he could not breath, started foaming at the mouth and then he passed out.  She called 9-1-1 and when they got there he was coming out of it.  They checked his VS and said that everything was OK, and felt that he did not need to go to the hospital but it was their call.  He didn&#39;t want to go either.  She drove him home and he slept OK, he had a bad headache and felt extremely tired and lied down.  He seemed to be OK the next day other than his arm being sore, but no other issues and he&#39;s been fine since.  The pharmacy did not have them wait before leaving to make sure they were OK, the pharmacist told her they were fine and they could go, but the incident occurred within 5 minutes of the vaccine.

Never suffered from tinnitus in my life, musician very careful about hearing protection. Haven&#39;t seen doctor yet but I will if it doesn&#39;t go away. Reading a lot of other people have dealt with this for weeks and months after vaccination.

The patient was confused upon waking up. He became oriented approximately a minute after waking up. He was given water and sat in the chair for about another 10 minutes. His girlfriend came and picked him up and took him home. Patient stated he was feeling fine and has a history of fainting when receiving vaccines.

                                                Initially I had experienced the standard adverse effects of drowsiness, a little difficulty sleeping, minor chills. The next day following my Dose 1 of the Moderna Vaccine, I started noticed chest pains on both sides of the chest. It wasn&#39;t from breathing and not very consistent or something I could re-create on command. It seemed to happen every hour for a few seconds and was a sudden, sharp pain. That was a concern for me so I did some basic internet searches and found that Chest pains are a symptom of the vaccine. I didn&#39;t think too much of it after that but It was a concern I kept in my head. My timeline gets a little foggy here but either that same day or the following day, the chest pains were still happening and I wasn&#39;t feeling 100%. One evening I went to take a bath. As I was laying in the water, my heart rate felt off, almost as if it was skipping a beat or not in the right rhythm. I remember laying in the bathtub, trying to count my pulse or seeing if I could &#34;catch&#34; the incorrect beat.  Rather than one normal heartbeat it felt like there was 2 beats very closely timed with each other. My heart rate felt faster than normal considering I was only laying down in water and didn&#39;t do any exercises the past few days. Unfortunately I never was able to find a good way to track the pulse and timing, but I was sure that something was wrong. I had difficulty sleeping that night because I kept feeling something wrong with my heart rhythm.  I got worried that I would need to go to the emergency room, but I told myself to sleep it off and if the chest pains and awkward heart beat continues for 5 days, I would go see a doctor. As for an outcome, thankfully I stopped noticing it around day 4 and haven&#39;t had chest pains since.  I am extremely worried as to how my body will react to Dose #2.

They gave me a coke to drink and I went back to the Sheriff&#39;s office and about an hour later my blood sugar was around 90. I took the rest of the day off and come home. I took Extra Strength Tylenol and rested. I did have a headache a few hours later. I feel fine now but I have a mild headache.&#34;

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

                                                During the first night after receiving vaccine I started to have SEVERE shaking / full body muscle spasms-hypertonicity that  lasted 60-90 minutes. Required 30 minutes hot shower to calm down shaking symptoms. Initially thought episodes were caused/triggered by cold temperature (still possibility) but now thinking its triggered by anxiety. Heart rate almost spikes to 120-130 BPM. No fever and normal blood pressure is noted when episodes happen.  Occurrences is not routine and seem to be random.  Very concerning considering symptoms lasted for 2 &#43; weeks now. I do not have health care or ability to see PCP/GP without paying out of pocket.   Now please understanding the severity of these episodes, to the point where it resembles severe Parkinson&#39;s symptoms.   Along with those I still have the normal side effects, fatigue  (extreme)  , mood changes, joint aches, intolerance to cold off and on,  and elevated HR.

Laid in bed all day, fell asleep around 10PM. 3:30AM woke up panicking with fever, tremors, chills, myalgia and very lethargic. Got out of bed to get tylenol and was shaking.  Tuesday morning - woke up feeling the same as I did at 330 AM, plus no appetite on top of headache, chills, myalgia, lethargic and slept pretty much all day, felt fatigued. Wednesday was doing better, thought it was the end. Then suddenly about 7-8pm started having chills and shivering.  I would say Thursday night is when I actually felt better and by Friday morning I was good with just residual ?brain fog/feeling dazed?

                                                The day following my first COVID vaccination, I had pain in my upper arm for 36 hours and could not lift it above my shoulder. I also experienced 6 hours of constant chills throughout my body, which came on suddenly around 1PM (24 hours after my vaccination) and was sent home early from work. During the 6 hours at home I believe I experienced body chills, I experienced what I believe to be brain fog. My coworkers described my motor skills (walking down a hallway) as slow and lethargic, and my thoughts being delayed. I do not consciously remember the 6 hour timeframe when I experienced these symptoms. Around 7PM that evening, I remember having a &#34;coming to&#34; moment where I remember the chills subsiding, and being able to think again.  The following day I felt back to normal other than pain at the injection site.

It was normal range, but low for the patient, he reported. We waited about 15 minutes and he said he was feeling okay and did not want EMS. We had the manager of the store take him home.

The patient has a history of anaphylaxis with sulfa drugs. Patient did not inform of adverse event to his PCP nor the staff of the pharmacy. He was very nervous. He was advised to consult with his PCP the risk vs benefit of receiving his second dose and to inform us of the final decision for documentation. Second dose of vaccine was not administered until further communication between patient and PCP.

                                                First night after receiving 2nd dose of the Moderna Vaccine,  I experienced a high fever and chills, sweating and a disturbing Ringing in my head. The second day after was roughly the same as the first night. I expected some of these symptoms and was willing to power through them.   It is now past 2 weeks since I have had the Vaccine. I still have a maddening Ringing in my head. Different than a Ringing in my ears. It does not feel the same. I feel pressure in my head, resulting in constant headaches that never subside. I have felt nauseous at random times, stomach pain from not being able to eat, and I am for the first time in my life experiencing anxiety and depression. I feel like my pain will never go away and I am scared. This pressure/pain in my head accompanied with the constant ringing is driving me insane. I have lost time at work, lost time with friends and family trying to sleep off my pain and symptoms but it never helps. I have taken headache medication which helps a small amount for the head pain, but leaves me with an upset stomach. I can not take these pain pills any more.  My Doctor, had me do a blood test and we are awaiting results as of today 5/25/21. I do not think they will find anything that will be able to help me with what I feel this Vaccine has done to me. I do not know what to do besides try not to cry myself to sleep anymore. I hate this and I do not want to feel this way anymore.

After 3-5 min, he reports all symptoms have subsided and thought maybe he was too anxious due to anticipation of severe reactions after the second shot.  Patient continues to deny trouble of breathing nor rashes throughout the 20 minutes resting in the wait area.  Benadryl &amp; Epi-Pen were not needed nor given.
