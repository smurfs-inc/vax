Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

Around 2:00 AM, I was awakened by a pounding headache, fever of 102, and my upper left chest (unilateral between the midline of my left chest and the axillary region) started to hurt. I took Tylenol 1000 mg at 3 and took a hot bath (recommended by  friend who also displayed a fever and headache). After a while, my fever began to lower but my headache and chest pain did not disappear and I could not sleep until 7 AM. I woke up today (2/5/2021) at 10 AM with a fever of 101.4, another pounding headache, and still unilateral chest pain. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol around 10:30 AM and it only helped with the fever. I went back to sleep and slept until 4 PM. I understand that the fever and headache are normal symptoms but my chest pain does not seem like muscle soreness. It doesn&#39;t hurt when I touch it, it comes and goes every few seconds, I have 4 or 5/ 10 on the pain scale for most of the pain but it turns into 6 or 7/10 occasionally (10 being the worst pain). What does help with my pain when it is 6 or 7/10 is when I clench my chest really hard like I am flexing it. It is a sharp pain that stays for a few seconds before it disappears and it feels like a deep pain. I didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol again because I am about to max out (can only take 2 more capsules until 2:00 AM because it states not to take more than 6 capsules in 24 hours, and each capsule is 500 mg) (Also, the Tylenol does not help with the pain so I am only taking it for my fever.) I was wondering if anyone else reported this and if this is an adverse side effect.  This has not cause any issues regarding my breathing but just pain.

A ER note was  generated in a T-Con on a patient who got their 2nd Covid Vaccine and began experiencing chest pain approx. 12 hours post vaccine. Patient did not report to the ER until 28Feb21. It was discussed that he has myocarditis v pericarditis, elevated D-Dimer of 770, swollen lymph nodes, and elevated Troponin. Patient was transferred to Research Medical Center due to no available beds. Patient was referred to a Case Manager and Cardiology. The patient completed a follow up appointment with 509 MDG on 9Mar21 and reported Dull pain that has been affecting sleep. Cardiology reports shows Troponin was elevated to 9.1 decreased to 4.2 and back up again to 13.4. Cardiac revealed late gadolinium enhancement, possibly representing myocarditis and then at discharge possibly myocarditis.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

                                                Woke up with a headache and fatigue, as well as soreness near area of injection. Energy was very low and felt very tired. Tried to sleep at around 12:00 PM but had a thumping in my head that would not let me fall asleep. Around 3:00 PM tried to sleep again but being shivering/shaking a lot despite being under a blanket and comforter. Eventually needed to take a hot bath for around 45 minutes to an hour. Took my temperature while in the bath which read 96°F (although that thermometer may not be the most accurate.) After the bath I went directly to bed with a comforter, blanket and weighted blanket and was able to fall asleep for about 90 minutes. Was no longer shivering when I awoke and felt much better. Went to sleep at around 9:00 PM and felt fine when I woke up the next morning.

Periodically waking up every 30min from 1am onwards. Muscle discomfort, sweating, and nausea continued until 3:45 AM, at which point I was feeling better and was able to sleep continuously.   Feeling much better in the morning on March 4th. Temperature was 99.9, then rose to 100.0 at 11am. Now, at 3pm, feeling fatigue, exhaustion. No headache. Normal sense of taste and smell. No couch.  Taking another day off from work. Temperature is currently 100.0. Taking more theraflu now, have not taken Tylenol today.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I then felt nauseous and threw up, and my body began to ache. 12 hours post vaccination I began to develop a fever of 99.8 with the use of acetaminophen and had severe chills / muscle aches.  The fever progresses to 101.1 about 36hours post vaccine and declined to 100.8 48 hours post vaccine. By 72 hours the fever was gone as well as all symptoms excluding fatigue and a slight headache.

I was working at the time and went to my local EMS station to get checked out. They checked my blood pressure and blood sugar. Blood pressure was normal but my blood sugar was low, around 68. They gave me a coke to drink and I went back to the Sheriff&#39;s office and about an hour later my blood sugar was around 90. I took the rest of the day off and come home. I took Extra Strength Tylenol and rested. I did have a headache a few hours later. I feel fine now but I have a mild headache.&#34;

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

                                                During the first night after receiving vaccine I started to have SEVERE shaking / full body muscle spasms-hypertonicity that  lasted 60-90 minutes. Required 30 minutes hot shower to calm down shaking symptoms. Initially thought episodes were caused/triggered by cold temperature (still possibility) but now thinking its triggered by anxiety. Heart rate almost spikes to 120-130 BPM. No fever and normal blood pressure is noted when episodes happen.  Occurrences is not routine and seem to be random.  Very concerning considering symptoms lasted for 2 &#43; weeks now. I do not have health care or ability to see PCP/GP without paying out of pocket.   Now please understanding the severity of these episodes, to the point where it resembles severe Parkinson&#39;s symptoms.   Along with those I still have the normal side effects, fatigue  (extreme)  , mood changes, joint aches, intolerance to cold off and on,  and elevated HR.

Laid in bed all day, fell asleep around 10PM. 3:30AM woke up panicking with fever, tremors, chills, myalgia and very lethargic. Got out of bed to get tylenol and was shaking.  Tuesday morning - woke up feeling the same as I did at 330 AM, plus no appetite on top of headache, chills, myalgia, lethargic and slept pretty much all day, felt fatigued. Wednesday was doing better, thought it was the end. Then suddenly about 7-8pm started having chills and shivering.  I would say Thursday night is when I actually felt better and by Friday morning I was good with just residual ?brain fog/feeling dazed?

                                                The day following my first COVID vaccination, I had pain in my upper arm for 36 hours and could not lift it above my shoulder. I also experienced 6 hours of constant chills throughout my body, which came on suddenly around 1PM (24 hours after my vaccination) and was sent home early from work. During the 6 hours at home I believe I experienced body chills, I experienced what I believe to be brain fog. My coworkers described my motor skills (walking down a hallway) as slow and lethargic, and my thoughts being delayed. I do not consciously remember the 6 hour timeframe when I experienced these symptoms. Around 7PM that evening, I remember having a &#34;coming to&#34; moment where I remember the chills subsiding, and being able to think again.  The following day I felt back to normal other than pain at the injection site.

It was bad enough to halt daily activities (I canceled a phd interview because of how bad I felt).  This occurred from late 2/4 through morning of 2/6. Taking tylenol seemed to help and I felt immensely better the two or three times my fever broke.
