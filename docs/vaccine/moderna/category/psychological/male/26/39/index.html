                                                Initially, around 1500hrs on Monday, January 4th, roughly 40 minutes after the injection, I developed a scratchy throat, a headache, and nausea.  I got home from work, and having no appetite due to nausea, I fell asleep on the couch around 1800hrs. Severe fatigue had set in. I did not wake up until 0500hrs the next morning to go to work on January 5th. I felt like I had not slept at all, however the scratchy throat had gone away. I worked all day with the nausea and headache. Throughout the day I developed chills, cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, and I felt like my mind was foggy (I had felt feverish since Monday night, but Tuesday was the first time I took my temperature that showed I had a fever.) I went home that night and slept all evening and well into the next morning. On the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, my symptoms had again gotten worse, so I called my primary care physician. He fit me in and tested me for the flu and for COVID. He prescribed me Ibuprofen for the headache/fever, and Ondansetron for the nausea/vomiting. My flu test came back negative on Thursday, January 7th, and my COVID test came back negative on Friday, January 8th. The fever finally broke on Friday evening and Saturday, January 9th  was the first day I woke up without a fever.  I still have the headache as of today, January 11th, and a low grade fever has returned. I am still very fatigued as well.

                                                So later that evening around 9:30pm I started with Chills, and a low grade fever lots of body ache and head ache, to the point I did not get much sleep the night of. It lasted the whole next day. But later in the evening of the next day I think to me the most concerning side effect was I started getting some chest pain as if I pulled a muscle around my chest or what not. And it has continued into the next day as well which is now 2 days after second dose of vaccine.

                                                When I woke up the morning after getting the second dose, I felt fairly lethargic and it took me a while to get going, more so than usual even though I&#39;m not a morning person. I had a light headache, which I&#39;d put at about a 3 on a 1-10 scale, but after being at work for a few hours it increased to about a 5. I left early, around 1pm, and slept again from about 3pm to 8pm. The headache eased up after this nap, but was still there in the background. The next morning (this morning, 1/29), the headache was nearly entirely gone.

                                                Received the first dose 12:30pm Thursday(2/11). Around 6pm that same night I notice the first symptom. I had a super strong headache that lasted the next 24 hours or so. Still lingering now but not as bad. Around 3am Friday (2/12) I woke up with chills and the inject spot was extremely tender. All day Friday I had signs of a fever. Chills and felt cold but body was hot to the touch. This lasted all day and it kept Me in bed the whole day.  Around 6pm Friday night, my injection spot was extremely sore , and there was a red circle, about the size of a gold ball around the spot. That?s also when I  noticed I had shortness of breath and was having a little difficulty breathing. Around 8pm I noticed I had really high anxiety that was abnormal. It went away in about 30 mins or so. I thought it was strange as I normally don?t have anxiety that bad. I went to sleep around 10pm and woke up at 5am itchy with a red rash/hives on the upper half of my body, mostly the neck and chest area. Also the red circle around the injection site grew to the size of a baseball. The headache is still there but not as bad . Maybe 2/10 Severeness. I feel better in terms of the fever and breathing today (2/13).  However the rash/hives has gotten worse and seems to be spreading slowly. I plan on taking Benadryl when I grab it from the store in 30 mins or so

                                                I received my first Moderna shot on March 24th. Just had a sore arm the next day.   April 2nd: Around 1pm at work I was starting to feel a headache coming on. By about 2-3pm it was worse and felt tired/drowsy. I ate supper then went to take a nap at 7:30pm. I woke up at about 10:30pm, checked the time and just felt out of it so I went right back to sleep.  April 3rd: I slept until my dog woke me at about 5:50am and felt pretty good, still minor headache and some chills. During the night I did feel some soreness in my arm that got the covid shot. After I showered I checked my arm and it was swelled up with a rash like redness maybe an inch in diameter. I was fine for most of the day enjoying the nice weather outside. Then about 6pm I started to feel the headache again and some chills. Went to bed at about 10:30pm, headache was bad, had the chills, started coughing some, and just didn?t feel normal, took some Tylenol to help through the night.  April 4th: Slept through the night fine, woke up with a mild headache and a sore throat. Had some dry coughs occasionally throughout the day, but was fine most of the day.  I did check my temperature throughout these past few days and all check were normal.  April 5th: Almost back to normal, still have a sore throat and cough. My arm rash near the shot area has gone away, just a little swollen.  April 6th: Back to normal health.

They immediately put me into a wheel chair but I wasn?t getting better until they laid me down in the stretcher. My lips turned blue and I think I was having an allergic reaction to the shot. It was hard for me to breathe before laying down on the stretcher my heart rate dropped and my blood pressure. It took me 30-40 min to come back to stand up and slowly walk out. My arm was super sore afterwards and I would have little shocking pain flashes in my chest. I felt tired and run down/ sensitive the rest of the night. The next day my arm was still super sore and I still feel very tired and run down.  The doctor on site took care of me and they put the stickers on me just in case they needed to revive me. I was sinking quickly but luckily when I laid down I got better.

                                                When the individual returned to the pharmacy on 5/19/21 he reported that he had a numb arm from the elbow bend to the shoulder starting the morning after the injection. He went to work and was unable to move his arm and had to leave work early and took the next day off as well. He said this continued for three days after the vaccine. He reported that he did contact his physician who told him to give it some time and if it  got worse to make an appointment to be seen, stating that all they would do is give him an anti-inflammatory to reduce swelling. The patient told the physician that he already had some for another condition and would just use that and did not go in to see her. He said that it was still not 100% on 5/19/21 but wanted to proceed with the shot in the same arm.  He was able to make circles with his arms over his head after the immunization was given a little lower that where the first one was administered.  He said he had looked up the symptoms that it might be a frozen shoulder/nerve issue.

He started feeling scratchiness in his throat after about 10-15 minutes. He did not feel like his throat was closing off. Nor was any worse since it first started. He has had anaphylaxis with shellfish in the past and carries an EpiPen. He said it does not feel like that now. Feels like he needs some Benadryl. Patient told the pharmacy tech that he thought this might be moreso anxiety (after reading the paperwork). Did not feel like other reactions he has had in the past.

I did not sleep at all for about 7 days. After day 3 of no sleep, I sought treatment for the issue. I was prescribed Ambien to try to help me sleep. It did not help at all. Day 4 of no sleep I went to the ER where they ran blood tests and performed an EKG. All tests were normal. Day 7 of no sleep I was admitted to a behavioral health inpatient facility to help me sleep. I finally was able to sleep with the help of an antipsychotic drug. I was there for 4 days and then discharged. I left with a script for Remeron to help me sleep. Some days I have slept well and others not so much.

But then yesterday started to have similar symptoms, as well as chest pressure, hurts to breathe all the way in, feels a twinge feeling on the inside. Also noticed a muscular pain as well in the same area, hurts to move down the middle of his chest. Also having pain on the right side. Symptoms are persistent, will wax and wane slightly but doesn&#39;t go away completely. Feels better when he is standing if feels better, has not noticed food triggers, no difficulty eating or swallowing. A few weeks ago also started a higher fat intake diet. No fevers or chills, no diarrhea, no rash, no sore throat, no runny nose. No known muscular injury that he can think of.&#34; May 20, 2021-- &#34;Today is feeling some decrease in symptoms, but still feels like he needs to take deep breaths. Feels like &#34;something is erratic&#34; once in a while. Not feeling increased improvement. Laying down does seem to make it worse. One time he was leaning forward and then sitting up made it worse.&#34; May 26, 2021 -- &#34;he reports that he is still feeling some chest pain, but overall is feeling better, symptoms are up and down. Feels like a &#34;tiredness&#34; in the chest wall area. The most pain is from twisting. Not worsening with acidic or greasy foods. Feels like pain is mostly in the muscle now. No SOB at all with increased exertion.&#34;

We rushed to him and called out for him.  He opened his eyes and slowly told us that he thinks he fainted.  I helped him elevated both legs on the chair and talked to him if he&#39;s hurt or any other weird feeling.  He told me he&#39;s feeling fine again.   I have him lay down with his legs elevated for another 5 minutes and helped him sit up.  He was able to get up by himself and sat back on the chair.  A couple minutes later, I took his blood pressure and it was 129/85 and pulse was 61.

                                                Appendicitis - Started not feeling good a little before dinner time. Stomach pains I thought were IBS related. I fell asleep and kept waking up with stomach pains worsening. Around 12:45 AM on 04/29/2021 I drove myself to the Hospital and by around 3:30 AM I was told that I needed to have my appendix out. I did not have any symptoms prior to having the vaccine.  I was transferred to another Hospital to have surgery around 10 AM on 04/29/2021 to remove the appendix. The surgery was successful. I was sent home the morning of 04/30/2021.

                                                Ever since receiving the vaccine, two months ago now, my left arm has had chronic pain usually radiating out from the injection site but sometimes spreading across my entire shoulder and down to my elbow. I also have quite a bit of pain depending on the motion I try to take and a fairly regular (and worsening) throbbing sensation around where the injection was. - I also regularly feel like I have no strength in my left arm/grip and it?s gotten to the point where it?s now affecting daily life.  Some days, the area around the site swells up and I feel a burning sensation instead of a painful pulsing or throbbing  Painkillers (ibuprofen) don?t seem to help very much though and sometimes I?ll wake up in the middle of the night from rolling onto my left arm and causing the pain to intensify.  I?m not sure if the pain is truly a side effect of the vaccine or if the volunteer performing the vaccine did something wrong when administering it.

                                                I had previously had above average soreness in the inject site, weakness in the arm with some swelling and redness, warm to the touch, but I awoke suddenly in the night around 2am in excruciating pain. The inject site felt as though someone had hit me with a sledgehammer and was significantly swollen, hot to the touch, and felt hard/stiff. I have broken bones before that hurt less than this event for comparison, this was solidly 9/10 on the pain scale. Ice was applied along with aspirin and acetaminophen. within 4-6hours the pain had slowly returned to a manageable level.

                                                Had no symptoms prior to injection. After injection, quickly developed moderate pain at injection site that eventually became severe. Over the rest of the day, developed a severe headache, severe muscle aches (not just at injection site), severe fatigue, fever of 100.6F, moderate joint aches (not just in arm, but all over body - neck is worst), and general weakness (I almost fell walking to the bathroom and I&#39;m in decently good shape). Toward the evening, I started struggling with thermal homeostasis - I was simultaneously sweating and shivering. The combination of these was severe enough that I had extreme difficulty sleeping last night and woke up at least once an hour, getting &lt;6 hours of sleep after lying in bed for almost 12 hours. Right now (23h post vaccination), the pain at the injection site has gotten significantly less bad, but I still have a splitting headache, fever of 100.3F,  moderate fatigue/weakness, and mild muscle/joint pains across my whole body. I&#39;m unsure how much the headache this morning is from sleep deprivation.   At no point did I lose sense of smell or taste, have a sore throat, cough, runny nose/nasal congestion, or shortness of breath.

                                                Approximately two hours after injection, slight discomfort and soreness about 2 inches in radius below the the injection site, but not at the point of contact. Movement of the upper arm produced some levels of pain, but nothing noteworthy. It was uncomfortable to sleep on, though, so that was avoided. Lower arm unaffected.  The following morning,  the pain was immediately noticeable and made using the arm a severely difficult task. It was painful to move the forearm above stomach level, and essentially impossible to do any sort of heavy lifting with it. Pain relieving medication such as aspirin and ibuprofen helped in a minimal capacity, and was ultimately irrelevant in the healing process. These symptoms lasted the entirety of the day after the injection and most of the following day as well, subsiding mostly in the evening. Today (Thursday, third full day after), all pain and soreness/dullness are entirely gone. The second full day was easily the most intense in terms of pain.

                                                On  the morning of 3/3/2021 i felt a slight amount of discomfort in right armpit. The following night, 3/4/2021, muscle pain in upper back started to develop. The morning of 3/5/2021 the muscle pain had spread from upper back to neck and shoulders. The pain was severe enough to impede the ability to get dressed or drive.  I took Ibuprofen and noticed little relief, then took 1g of acetaminophen and experienced some relief. Pain persisted at same degree until the evening of  3/7/2021  where pain had started to noticeably subside. On morning of 3/8/2021,  armpit discomfort had ceased and muscle pain and been reduced to that of very slight soreness.  as on 3/10/2021 all pain had disappeared.

The condition has not improved, and it is now 39 hours after injection. Regular, everyday tasks are very difficult. Pain is about a 7.5/10.  Also, 24 hrs after injection I experienced a fever. The fever lasted for 12 hours without coming below 103 degrees, and went up to 105.2 degrees at its highest. This was accompanied by extreme chills. I have also have body aches, which are likely a result of the fever, and the fact that I haven&#39;t slept in 2 nights because of these side effects.

                                                Patient had no reaction at time of vaccination, got up out of chair and walked approx. 20 feet to sit down in a chair with arms in the vaccine observation area at 1715. At 1722 patient fell out of chair and onto floor. PharmD started emergency chain including 911 call and call to patient&#39;s emergency contact. PharmD ran to patient and observed him lying facedown with head facing left. Eyes open but unresponsive, his name was called with no response. Right as he was observed to be breathing normally with a steady pulse, patient had mild seizure with jerking movements. He was turned to his side during seizure event lasting no longer that 2 minutes. Patient then regained consciousness and was kept on his side. Was alert and oriented. He knew where he was, who he was, what day it was. He was able to answer all 911 dispatcher questions relayed to him. Dispatcher advised he could sit up on floor, which he did. PharmD stayed right behind him until paramedics arrived. He was kept talking to stay alert. It was unknown if he hit his head on the initial fall. Paramedics arrived and checked BP/Pulse/EKG. Pt then had a gasp/shake attack that paramedic notated as a panic induced episode. He calmed and was transferred to ER

I had chills, a headache, fatigue, and nausea. The chills were severe. I couldn&#39;t get much sleep. In the morning and throughout the next day, I maintained a fever between 99 and 100 and felt fatigued and loss of appetite. I took 2 iBruprofen at 200mg each ever 4-6 hours. The fever never broke. I took NyQuil at 8PM on 4/8/21 to subdue the fever. I had night sweats and slept through the night. Today on 4/9/21 I have no fever. Although,  my arm is swollen at the injection site, red, and in pain. I am icing it and moving it around to subdue the swelling.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine  About 8 hours after receiving the second dose of Moderna, almost all of the side effects came in full force including headache, dizziness, fatigue, full body aches, injection site pain, chills, and elevated temperature. The peak severity lasted about 4-5 hours. It wasn&#39;t possible to sleep at all the night after the shot. After that 5 hour period, lingering side effects included headache, fatigue, and aches. About 22 hours after the shot, I decided to take some Tylenol to help get rid of the residual side effects. At 24 hours after the shot, it appears most effects have subsided but there is residual dizziness and some fatigue and weakness.

I asked if he wanted me to call the ambulance and he said yes. I gave patient a bottle of water and Orange Juice (confirmed non diabetic). It seemed like he was having an anxiety or panic attack. EMT came in and took him to the hospital, at that time he said he started feeling better.

                                                Patient has history of passing out when getting blood drawn. As patient was standing to get vaccination card filled out, he told associate to call RPH that he wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ran out to give my attention and patient was sweating and looked dizzy. His eyes started to shut while he was standing and as I was holding his arm and back to support him he started to fall to the ground. Patient gently went to the ground, I pushed him over to one side and he was out for about 3 seconds and woke back up. Patient was very hot and sweaty. He wanted to move to a more private area so I made an area with a privacy panel available to him. Patient stated to me that he has no history of seizure, but suffers from mild anxiety. Myself or one of the associates was with him for approximately 45 minutes just to make sure he was ok. His blood pressure was taken (twice) and water was given. His BP readings were normal. Patient was on his way. Moderna series completed.

                                                Right ear started ringing suddenly Friday may 14 2021 as I was sitting down at my computer after work. It has been growing in intensity over time since then, and on may 25th 2021 I went to urgent care, advised them I thought I may have a wax or ear infection problem and was prescribed  &#34;ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution commonly known as: FLOXIN&#34; and have been taking the daily drops. The ringing is getting worse and the only thing I can think of that changed in my life recently was the vaccine. I no longer suspect ear infection as I have experienced those before and never taken this long to recover, much less getting worse while taking medication. My day to day life otherwise has been the same. The ringing is so deafening now I cannot sleep and I wanted to make record of this before seeking additional medical help in the morning.

I woke up Saturday morning 6/12 with less of a headache and just muscle soreness, by noon on 6/12 most of the side effects had subsided.

                                                Patient is a 27 year old male with history of allergic rhinitis.  He moved to the area in April 2021 and had some initial problems with pollen allergies, but had improved and doing well with Singulair.  He had COVID19 in November 2020, recovered fairly quickly and did not have much in the way of breathing difficulties.  Last month he received both doses of Moderna COVID19 vaccination, second dose administered on 5/25/2021.  After his second dose, he has become progressively more ill.  He did have a fever up to 105F for 24 hours afterwards, but this resolved. He has gone to several urgent cares due to progressively worsening SOB, cough, and malaise.  Coworkers have commented to him that he is just not himself and is slow to get around.  He has gotten to the point he cannot take the trash out without having to stop to catch his breath.  He has been treated with a variety of regimens, including amoxicillin, doxycycline, inhalers, prednisone, and IM steroid shots.  He does get brief mild relief with albuterol inhaler.

                                                4 days later after the vaccine my left eye turned really red with crust and mucus coming out. I went to walk in clinic and was being treated for pink eye. I was started on an antibiotic eye drop. A day later my right eye started to have the same problem. I scheduled an appt with a eye specialist where he examined both eyes and said I had a major infection. I was started on steroid eye drops which I am still taking but seems my eyes are not getting better. I have a follow up with another specialist next week for further testing. I have been out of work due to this matter.

Treatment: Took the day after the shot off of work and slept a LOT (approx 18 hours on and off), stayed hydrated and fed. Did not take painkillers due to hearing it would interfere with vaccine uptake. Most symptoms except for headache had gone away by 30-hour mark. Only some lingering fatigue and achiness left over past 36-hour mark.

Overnight, he did not sleep and began to become restless and 0400 his prior normal 97s-98s temp had increased to 99.8. At 0500 he vomited a large amount and temp was 102.1, at which point he was given PRN acetaminophen for fever. SpO2 fell to 90%, and he was started on O2 at 4 L it was also noted his abdomen was distended, and he had erythema on his left arm extending from the base of his neck to his wrist. Dr. was called, and Benadryl was given for suspected allergic reaction to the vaccine. Over the next hour the erythema resolved, though other effects continued throughout the day( vomiting, fever, etc)

                                                I started to develop the following symptoms fever,  joint pain, shortness of breathe, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain by 7:00 AM on Saturday 6th, and subsequently they increased until the only thing I could to was only lay in bed, during the night the shivering awfull, there was a point when my whole body was stiff and I wasn&#39;t able to move (or at least that was my perception at that point) the fever, joint pain, shortness of breathe, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain increased and by 3 AM I was vomiting. I took medication for the pain but the symptoms were lessened not for much, I remained in bed until 2:30 PM on Sunday 7th. I am still weakened, fatigued and with a slight shortness of breath, I am assuming by tomorrow I will be feeling better. No regrets whatsoever.

Since then I have been feeling nauseated after I eat. I cannot eat like I normally do and it has been almost five days. If this persists through the weekend I will visit my doctor next week.

By 5 pm the day after I had stomach/abdominal pain aches, nausea and fatigue. The fever started at 100. That night I woke up at least once an hour from the pain. I had to throw up. The next day I woke up drenched in sweat and with the chills and a fever of 101.5, I think. And then the joint pain started. Especially in my knees. I applied icee hot and drank some pepto. And only ate a few crackers to have something in my body, tried to drink a lot of electrolytes. By Sunday night I woke up every hour from joint pain, especially my knees and lower back. I woke up in the middle of the night shivering and unable to get warm. I took a warm shower, and had to sit on the ground and just let the warm water run. My knees were in so much pain I couldn?t stand. Monday morning I woke up with a fever of 100 but tolerable joint and stomach pain. By Monday afternoon my fever had gone down, but still has abdominal pain, headache and mild joint pain.  I Was able to eat dinner chicken soup. Then Tuesday woke up fatigued and mild to low abdominal and now muscle pain.

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine  at 2:55pm on 4/7.  An hour or two later, I started to get a sore throat.  The sore throat was very painful by the early morning of 4/8.  On 4/8 I went into a doctor to see if I had strep throat because of the level of pain and since I didn&#39;t think I could get a sore throat from the vaccine, but he said it was not strep and that it was likely just a side effect of the vaccine.  On 4/8 I also had a fever topping 101.4, fatigue (I slept a lot that day), mental fog, pain at injection site, and all-around body pain.  The sore throat lessened greatly by 4/9, so it clearly wasn&#39;t a strep infection and seems it was indeed a side effect of the vaccine.  From 4/9 through 4/11 I had general &#34;cold&#34; symptoms: runny nose, phlegmy, watery eyes, redness and pain at injection site, muscle aches, elevated temperature (not fever), and general fatigue. By 4/12, these symptoms are nearly completely gone.  Some of these symptoms seemed quite strange as side effects from the vaccine, but they started and perfectly paralleled the expected vaccine side-effects, which makes me think they were caused by the vaccine.  I have no reason to think I had another illness at the same time as when I was experiencing these side-effects.  I had had Covid-19 previously (in December 2020; I tested positive and had mild symptoms).  Perhaps having had Covid-19 already provoked these strange side-effects.

According to wife he did shake for less than 15 seconds in his arm and a bit in his head.  They were in the car, so she tilted the seat back for him and came in to get us.  Within the 30 seconds that she was gone he was awake and sweating profusely.  We gave him an ice pack, 25mg of liquid benadryl, and kept him laying back in the seat.  At 5 and 15 minutes mark the patient was checked on and he was completely fine.  After 20 minutes the patient had stopped sweating and reported to be feeling 98% better.

                                                I developed tinnitus about three weeks after the first injection of the Moderna vaccine into my left arm. I received the second dose in my right arm on April 15. The ringing in my ears has persisted since then. The four days leading up to the sudden onset of the tinnitus were the most stressful of my life, for non-vaccine related reasons. I wonder if the extreme anxiety may have played a role in the onset of tinnitus. The volume of the ringing can vary. It sometimes appears to be mainly in the left ear, but sometimes it&#39;s in both.

I waited until he was ready, and explained that I could perform a countdown to immunization (3-2-1 and on 1 I would inject).  He agreed.  I also mentioned that he should not look while the immunization was occuring.  He also agreed and looked away.  Once the immunization was complete, he said he felt great and requested that I give him his second shot when it was time.  I advised him that it is recommended to wait for 15 minutes after vaccine administration for monitoring of side effects, and he declined stating that he felt fine and ready to leave.  Shortly after leaving, he crashed his motor vehicle and totaled his car.  The patient was left with no injuries.

                                                The second dose of vaccine was taken on 05/21 Friday at 8:30am. By that evening, I felt the usual symptoms of fever, body ache and chills, which continued for the next 48 hours. By Sunday, 05/23, I was feeling back to normal and in good health. The next morning, Monday, 05/24, I woke up with chest pain, a crushing pain by my heart and I went to the ER. An EKG was taken, and the cardiologist mentioned that it was abnormal and that a catheter angiogram needed to be done to check the arteries. That was followed by and ECG and a MRI and a stay at the hospital overnight. Next morning, the cardiologist told me that I have myocarditis caused by the vaccine and the inflammation is at the tip of the heart. I am currently on medication over the course of the next month, till my follow up visit with the cardiologist.

                                                Just after midnight, I was watching TV with my brother after smoking a medical pre-roll (I&#39;m a medical marijuana patient). Shortly after, I began feeling dizzy. I finished my glass of water and the dizziness subsided for roughly ten minutes, before returning even worse than before.  I went to get more water and after filling my glass and closing the refrigerator, I was barely able to walk the few steps from my kitchen to the living room to lie down on the couch.  At this time, my chest started feeling tight, and I had a light tingling sensation in my feet and lower body.  When I closed my eyes, the dizziness got worse, and laying in certain positions made the tightness in my upper chest become painful. I continued to drink water and ate a little, but the episode lasted between 30-60 minutes of mild discomfort ranging to a decent amount of pain. There was a moment when I had considered going to the hospital, but after eating, drinking, and doing some controlled breathing, the pain lessened I ended up falling asleep on the couch.  I woke up feeling considerably better, but decided to call out of work so I wouldn&#39;t do any strenuous activity. On occassion I still feel like there&#39;s a little bit of pressure or tightness in my upper chest,  but nothing painful or debilitating like the night of the incident

                                                Started the day great and went and got the 2nd dose of Moderna on 6/12/21 at 940am. I felt fine throughout the day and I started getting a little dizzy and disoriented around 5pm  and as it was explained to me it would be expected to get side effects. Later in the evening around 8pm I started to get extremely dizzy, tired, and having a low grade fever of 100.5F. I Later developed a headache and I had to go lie down for the rest of the night. As I was sleeping throughout the night and waking up multiple times shivering and being extremely cold, I was taking my temperature throughout the night and It would be climbing up from 100.5F and it reached 103.7F. At that point I wanted to get up and take some fever reducer medicines but I was unable to get out of the bed as I was very dizzy and disoriented and I was having extreme muscle and joint pains that I wasnt unable to move at all. I needed to go to the restroom and get a drink and I was unable to do that.  I had considered going to the ER but I waited it out and wouldnt go unless my temperature kept rising. I eventually tried going to the bathroom but at that point I had passed out and woke up in the morning between my bedroom and bathroom. On sunday 6/13 I was continuing to have symptoms and felt extremely ill throughout the day.  I woke up and the fever had gone away but I still had the symptoms mentioned above and also had ringing in my ears. Throughout the day I was trying to do stuff around the house but I was unable to do that and go to work. I would randomly pass out at times either on my desk or just sitting on the couch. That was throughout sunday then on monday I was feeling a lot better almost all symptoms had gone away but I was still a bit dizzy and had body aches and was unable to go to work and do basic stuff around the house. Tuesday I was mostly feeling fine but still felt a bit dizzy and disoriented and extremely fatigued but I was able to go to work. Wednesday I am feeling almost 100% normal but I do get dizzy at times and I am still extremely fatigued.

                                                Injection arm became very sore at around 1 PM, around four hours after the injection of dose two. Around 6 PM, began noticing overall body soreness and fatigue. A headache began soon after, and remained throughout the night. I barely slept because my arm and shoulder hurt so bad, and I also was sweating and shivering. I woke up many times.   At 8am on 06/24 I woke up with a severe headache and nausea. My injection arm and shoulder was very sore. My body overall ached, joints and muscles. I almost called into work but decided to go.   I took 500mg of acetaminophen at 10:25am.  At 10:30am at work, I was still very sore and noticed I was mildly disoriented. My coworkers commented on my look of fatigue.  Around 1pm, my disorientation and fatigue began to alleviate somewhat, and my headache had resolved by that time.  Currently it is 8:51pm. I worked the whole day at work, though it was difficult with the body aches and exhaustion. I have a mild headache, general fatigue and soreness, and my  injection arm is still very sore.

                                                Vaccination was administered to the patient, the patient was a little nervous at time of administration. After 5 to 10 minutes of waiting in the pharmacy the patient was lightheaded and dizziness. The patient passed out and fell over, hitting his head on the wall of the pharmacy. The patient was briefly shaking/convulsing per the mother for a few seconds until the patient woke up. The pharmacy staff rushed out to the patient&#39;s aid. The patient was confused when he woke up . We had him lay on the floor for a few minutes then helped him up to a chair to sit when he felt better.  The patient explained how this has happened to him before when receiving vaccinations, he gets lightheaded and dizzy when receiving vaccinations. The patient explained how he did not take any medications or has any health conditions. The patient refused medical attention and said he felt ok as we waited with him for 5 minutes. We recommended the patient to see a doctor if he as any symptoms. The patient waited for an extra 30 minutes and said he felt fine. The patient&#39;s mother and the patient left with the mother driving him home.

                                                At 3 AM, 12 hours following the vaccine administration, I awoke with severe fever/chills, body aches and severe headache, which progressed to nausea and vomiting x 3 episodes and was very sick for one day, home bound and could not work.  This reaction was due to I believe the fact I had positive antibodies from a positive infection 8 months prior.  I had laboratory evidence of a positive serum antibody titer following the infection.  Was this vaccine studied in regards to patients who received the vaccine? because I believe it needs further study before it is given to patients who have already developed immunity from acquiring the actual COVID disease.

Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

                                                Moderna vaccine dose #1 received in right shoulder on 12/31/20 at 2:15PM. Injection was uneventful other than sensation of pressure. I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA. As of now, I still have limited range of motion and shoulder pain on the right which has improved slightly but is far from resolved. I still have difficulty with certain ADLs including putting clothes on and off, lifting items, and tasks that require raising my right arm above my head. I am concerned with the possibility of long term and/or permanent damage after reviewing the literature. I am also concerned about how many other healthcare workers the person who gave me my vaccine may be injuring and/or causing permanent harm to.

                                                Sore arm started 2 hours afterwards and continued for 2 days. 13 hours post vaccination I woke up shaking, thinking it was due to cold I added extra covers, shaking continued for approximately two hours. The next morning fever and severe nausea caused me to miss work.

His whole body was in pain as well. His blood pressure was 150/90. On Wednesday, February 22 he slept at his group home apartment and complained on chills, body pain and headache. He cancelled that day his counseling session and work. He called me on Thursday still complaining of body aches and weakness. He stayed in bed till Friday February 5, 2021.  He has been taking pain killers all this time.

                                                During the first day after taking vaccine, started having a fever, headache, and sore throat. By the evening, fever was severe and 102&#43;, with severe headache and sore throat. After sleeping on that nigh (had disruption of sleep from 2 - 4 in the morning), it was looking normal., just had usual fatigue after a fever. But on Thursday (Took vaccine on Tuesday morning, March 02, 2021), I suddenly started having a seizure, my whole body was shaking, legs were cramping. I thought it was going to go away, but after 10 minutes it was getting worse and I had to call the emergency services. The fire service members first came, they measured my blood oxygen level, it was 98%, but my blood pressure was high (140). I was still shaking and having the seizure. They tried to calm me down by talking, after some time, my blood pressure came to normal and I started getting normal (no seizure at that point). I declined the ambulance service as it is expensive and I was getting normal. I had a 101 fever just after that and went to visit the health care facilities .

I was able to calm myself down and used Benadryl several hours later.  It seemed to help with the swallowing issue and I went to bed. I woke up this morning (03/06/21) feeling much better. I still infrequently have trouble swallowing liquids. I?ve continued to take Benadryl. The feeling of tightness in my throat is located in my superior throat. My breathing - to my knowledge - has remained unobstructed the entire time. If I don?t return to normal by Monday, I will be visiting the center on campus.

He can lift it up to almost horizontal position forward but difficulty moving it backwards. He took 2 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen as directed and still sore. Advised he can take 4 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen (800 mg) every 8 hours for a day and see if that relieves pain and motion. He can also put a cold compress to affected area for slight swelling. If not better in a day or so advised him to contact a doctor, because might need something stronger to treat reaction to vaccine.

                                                After receiving the COVID vaccine, the patient was instructed to have a sit in the clinic for 15 minutes in order to be monitored for any adverse reactions. Within that time period, the other patients in the waiting area reported to the staff that the patient has fainted. The patient woke up shortly after fainting. He was visibly pale but he confirmed that he is okay and not in distress (no difficulty breathing, etc). He reported that he&#39;s fainted before after a vaccination due to nerves. We gave him some water to drink and had him stay for another 30 minutes so we can monitor him closely. After 30 minutes, we determined that he&#39;s well enough to leave the store and no other further care was needed at the time.

Checked temp but had no fever. Went back to bed. Waking several hours later, was fatigued with a slight headache, but still no fever.

Symptoms were completely gone by 10pm.

The vaccine was administered in my left arm. I cannot go back to sleep until I straighten my arm out and support it with my body by laying on my right side. During the day there is slight tenderness to the elbow joint, but otherwise no pain or symptoms. As of 4/12 it now feels like I have partially torn my Achilles&#39; tendon where it connects to the bottom of my heel in my left foot after trying to lightly stretch it while standing talking to someone in my office. I am fairly active outdoors and consider myself in otherwise good health so these two events post-vaccine seem very odd to me.

                                                Noticed hives about an hour after getting the shot forming all around my body.  Thought it was normal as the covid rash.  Quickly started feeling ill. Had a small amount of trouble breathing and a fever with swelling  and the hives became larger as my skin was flushed. Googled it and it said that this was a normal reaction and common side effects.  So I did not do anything and fell asleep because I felt badly. The next day I woke up to see the bumps all over my body including my digits and pelvic region. Called and talked to my wife she told me to go to the hospital. I started feeling a bit better though and decided against it and took rest that day. The following day the rash had become raised and tender across my body.

Third day was completely fine (4/20), Morning of fourth day (4/21) wave of dizziness and fatigue began accompanied with feeling of pressure in ears with occasional ringing. Also headache at the back of the head and where the cervical spine meets the skull. Occasional congestion. Hard to concentrate and occasional lightheaded feeling. Going on one week since injection and 3rd day of dizzy spells. (4/24)  Treatment: Drinking mostly water. Diet consisting mostly of vegetables and grains (no changes have been made to my diet) Ibuprofen 200mg seems to alleviate earache which in turn relieves some dizziness but feeling of being off balance remains.  No previous history of any sort of vertigo or ear infections.

                                                I had brain fog starting on coming Monday after the shot (4 days) that got worse as my week progressed. I had extreme trouble focusing, felt an extreme amount of lethargy and felt weird in general. I felt confusion and disoriented in general and had trouble making decisions or doing anything. The symptoms gradually went away 2-3 weeks later but I am not quite sure if I have recovered to the previous cognitive state because I still get zoned out.

He looked clammy and pale, but regained consciousness in a few seconds. He still felt very faint and shaky, and asked for some gatorade. We had him lie on his back and elevate his feet until he felt better. EMS arrived and checked on him and he felt good enough to walk out on his own accord.

Fever was noticed the morning after receiving the vaccination and led to a much earlier wake-up than usual. Fever was roughly 100 degrees F. Patient took 1g acetaminophen to address headache, which is typical as patient takes NSAIDs regularly to address headache. Fever went down to 98.5 within a few hours, returned to 99.5 by afternoon. Patient took another 1g of acetaminophen and fever was down to 97.5 by evening. Side effects led to patient functional ability being significantly reduced for the day.

                                                Around 12:45p patient got his second dose of Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine. About 5 minutes into waiting outside the pharmacy sitting in a chair I heard a loud thud outside the clinical services room. I was alerted by pharmacy technician that the patient had fainted. We called 9-1-1 immediately. Patient was face down and unconscious for about 7-10 minutes. Patient also had some convulsions during this period. Patient regained consciousness but was very disoriented and did not know where he was. He then went in and out of consciousness for about another 7-10 minutes until EMTs arrived and began caring for patient.

Since then I&#39;ve been having recurring panic attacks at unusual times early afternoon which is very uncharacteristic and abnormal. Along with this I&#39;ve had an unusual uptick in heart palpitations they&#39;re very random and have happened in the past but have become more frequent and more intense. Ive been told in the past I do have a left  ventricle branch block that has shown up on multiple ekgs however they have become abnormally frequent since the vaccine. I&#39;m often discredited due to my panic disorder on medical conditions without any sort of investigation however all of the above things are very unusual and I do not have medical insurance to have them investigated and have been trying to shrug them off but they&#39;re increasing in frequency and intensity and this is not just in my head.

I?ve also had lingering chest pain that comes and goes and radiates into my arm and back. Enough to take me to the emergency room.  I am otherwise a completely healthy person and have not had issues like this until after the vaccine.

                                                The first day after I received the vaccine I experienced symptoms in guidance with all available resources. I was fatigued, my arm was sore at the sight of injection. I remember sleeping at least 12 hours.  A few days later I began to experience severe intermittent chest pain. The area under my arm was extremely tender, as were the area behind my left knee. The adverse event as stated in the report was a sudden jolt of searing pain on my left side. It lasted only a few moments and felt like it traveled from my left shoulder down to my left thigh and behind my knee. It nearly knocked me off my feet. I remained with a lingering pain in my leg and upper left back until today.  I reached out the pharmacist  who administered the vaccine about the side effects and she advised me to immediately contact my doctor&#39;s office. I visited my doctor&#39;s office yesterday (6/3/21) and he assured me I didn&#39;t have any blood clots. He advised me to use a heating pad for the pain in my leg. He also said that sometimes the lingering side effects from the vaccine may last weeks in rare cases. Those discomforts are finally starting to subside. I had no treatment outside of elevated levels of hydration, taking Tylenol and resting.

                                                Acute localized lower back pain along with localized lower abdominal pain. Difficult to explain sensations, almost like a catch in lower-mid spine, along with abdominal pain in relatively the same area.   Feels like someone kicked me square in the middle of the spine. Possibly kidney pain? Tends to come in intense waves of pain, with a lingering dull ache seperating the more intense spasms.   The abdominal pain reminds me of a bowel obstruction I had a while back, almost like someone has taken a section of my intestines with both hands and is violently stretching it apart. No diahrrea, or constipation - as far as I can tell.  Lying down or propping and supporting the back does nothing to help with the back pain. Neither does any OTC pain relievers such as Acetaminophen or Naproxen, and as a result sleep is very difficult.

                                                Late March 2021: chest pain emerged a few days after 2nd Moderna vaccine; lasted ~ 1 week. I think mostly or entirely on non-heart side. Mid-May 2021: came back on heart side (when laid down to sleep, couldn?t sleep on heart side without grimacing in pain). Besides that, most of the time was mild to moderate. Chest pain would switch between left and right sides.  5/18/21: Saw Dr. (primary care). You forgot to mention you first felt the pain after your second COVID dose. Dr. thought it was muscular (EKG came back normal) and said to pause weightlifting to be safe. During this, probably had a cold for 2 full weeks (bad congestion, sore throat for part of it, body and head aches). You were advised to try Ibuprofen ? tried it for a day or so and it didn?t help, so you stopped. 5/20/21: Messaged Dr. about vaccine timing (right when reports started to come out that there could be link between Pfizer/Moderna and rare heart inflammation in men under 30), who suggested seeing a cardiologist to be safe

He was disoriented but still breathing and conscious. He was moved into a seated position in a chair, where he proceeded to collapse out of the chair again. An ambulance was called, the EMT staff noted all of his vitals were normal and he stated he felt fine again after they had checked him out.

I got a urine dipstick test which showed positive for proteins. I came in the blood test the next day-which came back normal. The blood test for lipase came back elevated possible pancreatic. I am waiting CT scan results. I was prescribed a non fat diet and low carb diet to avoid inflaming the pancreas.

                                                I got the 2nd dose on 06/06/2021 and then for a couple days after my heart was pounding and I was just tired. I felt tightening in my chest, intermittent pain in upper back. Periodically this would come in waves. My hands felt like pins and needles kind of flushed over my body. It was mainly hands and feet but I would feel it in my face and sometimes arms and legs. I did go to the ER about a week after 2nd dose (around 06/13/2021). They told me it could&#39;ve been anxiety and stress. They did an EKG, blood work, and x-ray and didn&#39;t find anything abnormal. I did f/u with PCP and I just went last week and explained symptoms there as well and they&#39;re looking into my issues. They told me today I had a high white blood cell count and that my liver has elevated enzymes. They want me to come in the middle of July to do more fasting blood work. No fever, no malaise, but I did feel tired and fatigued and nauseous. I had bad brain fog and my body felt like it wasn&#39;t mine. It was like someone took my brain and put inside someone else&#39;s body. 1 week after 2nd dose I had bad sinus pressure behind eyes like my eyes were going to burst out of skull.

I went to bed at 9:30pm and woke up at 2:00am unable to move my left arm due to severe pain, a pounding headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and minor nasal congestion. I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep the remainder of the night due to the pain. All symptoms persisted the morning and afternoon of the 21st as well. The severe arm pain subsided but I still struggled to lift my arm past 90 degrees without intense pain. I went to bed on the 21st unable to rest on my left shoulder due to the pain and woke up the 22nd with most symptoms gone except for a minor headache and moderate soreness in the left arm.

                                                Around 9:00 that night, I had body aches and tossing and turning then with sleep because of body aches. Next day I was in bed all day the next day because of the severe body aches. Cough got worse for the next few days or so after that.  I had some shortness of breath because of the coughing. Migraines started - strong headaches. The first one was the morning after the vaccine. During the next day (third day after vaccine) I had another migraine.  Symptoms were acute for three days.

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

He was dazed and said he just felt off. When he stood up, he fell down and felt very dizzy.  We were doing a vaccine clinic at his place of employment that day so I was still on site and he came back into the room I was stationed around 1:30pm. He said he felt ok, was talking, breathing fine, just felt a little &#34;off.&#34; He had white spots all over his left arm and some on his right.   None were raised, red, or itchy. His left hand was red/purple in color. I gave 50mg of diphenhydramine and he stated about 10 minutes later he felt better.  I observed him for approximately another hour. He was walking around, talking fine and stated he felt normal when he left. He still had some slight discoloration on his left arm.

                                                During the 15 minute observation period after injection, patient returned to the check-in desk complaining of dizziness. He was brought immediately to exam room where he became pale, diaphoretic, and stated he &#34;felt like he was in a dream.&#34; Seated BP was 74/palp. He was placed in supine position on exam table, cool compresses placed on forehead and back of neck. He complained of some nausea, which quickly improved. He never lost consciousness. His color and alertness improved steadily over the next 10 minutes. Repeat BP (lying) was 100/50. After a few minutes he sat up on exam table, dangling legs. BP remained stable at 110/60, HR 84. He continued to improve and stated that he felt better, drank some water and ate some goldfish crackers. Reported that he just remembered he had not eaten since lunch. After another 5-10 minutes he was alert, oriented, able to walk unassisted. Final BP 114/70, HR 80. His wife remained with him and confirmed she could drive him home. Discussed that although I feel confident this was a vasovagal near-syncope, if symptoms recur or worsen, he should go to ER for evaluation. Understanding verbalized.

After removing the needle the patient straightened his posture and I could tell that the injection was too high and more in the shoulder area. Patient said that he felt okay and no pain but then returned 3 hours later complaining of shoulder pain and limited range of motion. I instructed him to ice the area 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off and to take Ibuprofen. Area was not swollen. Upon follow up later that evening he said he was having a hard time laying on that side and was more comfortable sleeping in a recliner. He said he was still having pain the following morning and was going to go to an urgent care for further testing.

                                                Because of my celiac condition, I avoid eating products with wheat and gluten in them. However, occasionally it is unavoidable, such as with traveling. Typical reactions include fatigue, headache, mild brain fog, irritability, and watery bowel movements for up to 3 days following ingestion. However, since receiving the Moderna vaccine I have encountered wheat products 3 times; in all three cases the reaction was much more severe and included whole-body ache for 5-7 days, insomnia for 2-3 days, dry heaving for 24 hours, extreme sensitivity to motion/motion sickness for up to 3 days, intense gastrointestinal discomfort for up to 7 days, constipation and diarrhea, severe congestion, shortness of breath, elevated heart rate, confusion or disorientation, and an overall elevated level of symptoms lasting from 4-7 days depending on the amount ingested.

I laid down and these feelings seemed to pass after 30 min.   Later that day I started to feel a strange feeling in my head that is hard to describe. It is a combination of light headedness, slight dizziness, and general head fog. These symptoms have persisted for 7 days now. They were mild to start and have gotten increasingly worse the last 2 days. The symptoms make it hard or impossible to focus on work depending on the severity at the time. I feel these symptoms whether I am sitting down or moving around, although it seems to be most pronounced when I am moving.   Today was the first day I that I had to call in sick to work. I have not yet sought medical treatment, but as symptoms are worsening, this will be my next course of action.   I have found

Patient started to sweat (sweat was vissible on his forehead &amp; his shirt). I escorted patient to immunization booth and assited him to lie down on his back (supine) as recommended per immunization adverse event response protocol. I applied cold compresses to his forhead and arms, monitored his breathing, LOC and BP until emergency response team arrived. By the time emergency response arrived, the patient stated he felt better. He declined ambulance and decided to drive himself home. Both the emergency response team and the patient left the pharmacy.

On the way back He was leaning over. Our tech and I helped him. He then said his throat was closing and then he started struggling to breathe and his arms looked red and rashed. Gave dose of Epipen in left thigh and had tech call 911. His breathing got easier (just fast) Then said he felt like he was going to throw up (he did not) EMTs arrived about 1:07pm and checked him out and said everything 100%. His wife got him some food and he sat in waiting area for a bit and then was able to walk away. Did not go to hospital. EMTsaid probably not an allergic reaction just fright of having vaccine.

He walked over to the blood pressure machine and took his blood pressure. He then said He was starting to feel funny. Pharmacist took his blood pressure. Initially it was156/94 pulse 114. She gave him a water. She checked on him again a few minutes later and it was 166/76 pulse 103. I check on him. He said he felt tingly and his throat was still scratchy. But he was not having any problem breathing. He said he thought he was having a panic attack. I recommended Benadryl. I gave him 50mg Benadryl orally at 10:15. He was still feeling funny after and we called a manager to get paramedics ( he wanted paramedics called). He was a little shaky and still felt bad. Paramedics arrived a little after 10:30. They ran some tests and also said they thought it was a panic attack. They did not administer any meds to him that I saw, but did take his BG, BP, and check his heart. They went ahead and wheeled him to the ER. Patient apologized, I think he felt embarrassed.

Weird vivid dreams (after trying to go back to sleep) along with shooting pain through my legs. When I got up at 8 am, I felt it was like a cold without any of the nasal issues. Symptoms persisted until I took ibuprofen at 10 am. The symptoms continued throughout the day but were faintly noticeable even up until I went to sleep. The second day I woke up at 10 am with symptoms of few leg cramps and a small headache. Not nearly as bad as the first day.

                                                The patient was nervous about receiving the vaccine, but he was fine after it was administered and sighed with relief. Then he went to our waiting area and about two minutes later he slumped forward into his girlfriend. I ran out there and helped him out of the chair and onto his back on the ground and he immediately felt better.

                                                Patient was seated in waiting area after vaccination. Patient seemed to be in obvious distress while being in and out of consciousness. The pharmacist was able to get patient safely to the ground, elevate his feet, and apply a cold compress. When consciousness was regained, he was able to drink water and eat some apple slices within about 10 minutes of initial incident. Patient was kept for additional observations and was able to verbally attest to feeling stable before leaving.

                                                Reporting primary symptoms: headache, fever, lightheadedness, elevated heart rate, arm soreness, muscle soreness, back pain, nausea, suppressed appetite, anxiety, and panic attacks. (see below for more information) Initially, felt faint and lightheaded. Stood up and the feeling worsened. Within five minutes, felt nauseated and clammy. Also, appeared pale in the face. Was given instructions to sit, close eyes, and take deep breaths. Applied a cool, wet rag to the face and neck as needed. Was anxious and may have had a panic attack triggered by the experience. Heart rate had elevated, but not to a concerning level. Within 30 minutes of initial vaccine administration, face was no longer pale and heart rate was lowering. Other symptoms mostly subsided within 90 minutes of the vaccine administration. The next morning (5/19/21), woke with a mild headache, low grade fever, some fatigue, slight nasal congestion, and very sore arm. Took Tylenol for fever and it was mostly gone by the next day (5/20/21). Felt well enough Saturday (5/22/21) morning for lots of physical activity (push-mowed lawn in humid conditions) and only had a mild headache and mild fatigue afterward. No notable symptoms on Sunday (5/23/21) morning, but had indigestion, gas pain, and some soreness (back muscle) late that night. Stayed up a little later than normal. Woke a few hours early (around 4:30 am) on Monday (5/24/21) with throbbing low-to-mid, left-side back pain and worsened indigestion and gas pain. Had anxiety that led to a panic attack. Did not feel well and tried stretching, taking Tums, deep breathing, used the bathroom, and walked around. This was helpful enough to return to sleep. Woke up again at 8:45 am and had a mild headache, some soreness in neck/shoulders, and anxiety about the situation. Took a shower, did some deep breathing, and tried to relax. Drank some caffeine at noon, but the headache was not relieved. Appetite was somewhat suppressed and was mildly lightheaded. Stomach became more unsettle by night. Stopped all caffeine intake and NSAID usage (and still no intake/usage at the time of this report). At night, anxiety over the situation worsened, so tried deep breathing, talking to others about the situation, and stretching. Panic attack occurred, but was able to manage with the aforementioned techniques. Woke the next day (5/25/21) with mild headache, muscle soreness in mid-to-upper back, shoulders, and neck, suppressed appetite, and anxiety. Was able to manage most symptoms with breathing, stretching, relaxing,  and talking through the situation. No panic attack on 5/25/21. Went to bed earlier than normal (around 9:30 pm) and woke on 5/26/21 around 9:30 am. Had similar symptoms, but appetite was more decreased and worsened anxiety. Decided to see doctor that afternoon (see item 19 for more information on testing from that visit) and was told to give more time to recover from vaccine side effects. Did not give doctor information about anxiety or panic attacks at that time.  Had a panic attack (less severe than previous) Wednesday night and managed with the aforementioned techniques. Thursday (5/27/21) morning woke with no headache and no fever, but still some soreness in neck/shoulder area, suppressed appetite, mild fatigue, and mild anxiety about the situation. No panic attack on 5/27/21. Friday (5/28/21) woke with similar symptoms and decided to visit doctor again about anxiety. Was prescribed Buspar and Zoloft. After taking Buspar (first time ever) at 2:30 pm, experienced an increased heart rate up to 160bpm and a low fever up to 100.2F. Experienced another panic attack during this time. Sought medical assistance from local ER around 3:30 pm. Was seen and monitored until discharge at about 11:45 pm. During stay, tests and levels were mostly normal except during a panic attack that was triggered after blood was drawn. Treated with Vistaril around 11:20 pm and monitored for about 20 minutes before being discharged. Anxiety was relieved after deep breathing and relaxing. Did not take Zoloft. Slept and woke on 5/29/21 with mild headache, unsettled stomach, and mild anxiety. Anxiety is more manageable so far and other symptoms were somewhat improved after eating breakfast. Currently, no plans to continue taking Buspar, but will consult doctor.

                                                First dose: my face went numb and tongue felt itchy 1.5 hours roughly for symptoms.  No common side effects; Second dose: calling it a panic attack. Racing heart, felt like I was passing out, mental fogging, trouble swallowing lasted about 1.5 - 2 hours. After 2nd dose I had the normal side effects, headache, chills, body aches fatigue.. After about 2 days of common side effects I noticed I was having trouble swallowing and it felt like I was being choked pulse food regurgitation and diarrhea.  It kept getting worse and worse after a week or so of hell I get an emergency endoscopy showing I have  eosinophilic esophagitis.  I?ve been put on all sorts of meds that are supposed to be treating this but nothing is working.  It?s been near a month now and 2 weeks have been on a hard core elimination diet  symptoms are persistent and discomfort it spreading to what feels like intestines, kidneys and possibly other locations I now have to go in for a colonoscopy soon as the meds should be working and discomfort is spreading.  Loads of headaches can?t sleep with all the discomfort.  Never hungry.  Possible permanent esophagus damage maybe more everything is still being diagnosed and no one is really finding any answers why.  For the last 6 years I?ve been on a health kick working out almost daily and eating very healthy.  No symptoms no warning  signs these one or more diseases it has all just started out of the blue post vaccine nothing else in my life has changed.

No Medical History information was reported.    On 04-May-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 04-May-2021, the patient experienced CRANIOCEREBRAL INJURY (Brain trauma) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant and life threatening), LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and medically significant), FALL (Fell on cement floor) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), EPISTAXIS (Bleeding from nose) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and SPEECH DISORDER (Could talk but not rational) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and disability). In May 2021, the patient experienced CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and disability). On an unknown date, the patient experienced BRAIN OEDEMA (Brain Swelling) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant and life threatening), SKULL FRACTURE (Multiple skull fractures) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant and life threatening) and MOVEMENT DISORDER (trouble picking things up and raising his legs) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and disability). The patient was hospitalized from 04-May-2021 to 20-May-2021 due to BRAIN OEDEMA, CRANIOCEREBRAL INJURY, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS and SKULL FRACTURE. The patient was treated with Surgery (On 07-May-2021, right part of skull was removed surgically to control brain swelling.) for Brain oedema; Surgery (On 08-May-2021 surgery was performed to remove multiple skull fractures.) for Skull fracture; Rehabilitation therapy for Confusional state; Rehabilitation therapy for Movement disorder and Rehabilitation therapy for Speech disorder. At the time of the report, CRANIOCEREBRAL INJURY (Brain trauma), BRAIN OEDEMA (Brain Swelling), SKULL FRACTURE (Multiple skull fractures), CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) and SPEECH DISORDER (Could talk but not rational) was resolving, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out) had resolved, FALL (Fell on cement floor) and EPISTAXIS (Bleeding from nose) outcome was unknown and MOVEMENT DISORDER (trouble picking things up and raising his legs) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       On 26May21 patient moved to a rehabilitation facility where he still remains 9Jun21.  He  awoke on 17May21 but was still confused. He is now making good progress and can now walk and talk but needed therapy to relearn these.  He  will need out patient therapy when they release him.  He still requires surgery to replace bone flap and has to wear a helmet. The goal is that he will be normal in 6 months but he is still having trouble picking things up and raising his legs.

                                                HCP confidently diagnosed me with Bell&#39;s Palsy. It came on suddenly and without much warning. I woke up to find that the right side of my face was weak - right eye hard to close, weak lower lip, and even foods/drinks had different or less taste. These symptoms have worsened a bit, most noticeable being my less active right eyelids and the weakness in my lips/face muscles (right side) makes it hard/embarrassing to talk or laugh, as my mouth becomes contorted.

                                                After the first day, I started to have minor arm pain at the injection site. I periodically used and ice pack and I took some advil.  2 days later, I woke up several times in the middle of the night with chest pain and shortness of breath. I felt paralyzed and just went back to sleep a few times. Around 6am,  I woke up and changed to sleeping in a chair in a sitting position as I felt a little less pressure on my chest while doing so. After I finally woke up a couple of hours later, my symptoms were more bearable although I did still feel chest pressure and slight shortness of breath, it did not seem like an emergency any more. These symptoms continued on into the next couple of days and started to go away with time.

My resting heart beat when I&#39;m falling asleep is pretty low, 50s and 60s, and my heart was pounding. I have a fitbit and checked it, wondering why it felt like I had just drank a pot of coffee, and my heartbeat reached 108 at several points, including while lying in bed trying to sleep. This happened several times that day and I recall calling my doctor&#39;s office for advice. I think I was advised to come in if I felt worse or if new symptoms arose.   I also experienced: fever (99.2), aches, chills, headache, poor sleep (awake early), fatigue, arm pain and diarrhea. I took Tylenol extra strength and had to go to work as we were shortstaffed and I wasn&#39;t given much of a choice. I took some Benadryl to help me sleep and by the 30th, I was a bit tired, but my fever and the other symptoms were gone. I had some arm pain but it wasn&#39;t nearly as painful as it was on the 29th. By the 31st I believe all symptoms had resolved

He is compliant with medication and did not have another provoking factor.  Approximately 6 hours after receiving the vaccine he had a generalized seizure, which was witnessed by his wife. He had an aura, behavioral arrest, tonic-clonic activity for 1 minute followed by a post-ictal period of several hours. This is consistent with his known seizures, but the provocation appears to be the vaccine he received earlier in the day.

Patient eventually was able to leave, but symptoms, although got better with the benadryl, was uncomfortable for a while, and chest was tight, with dizziness. Hives went away after ingesting medication.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included allergy to cefaclor and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Concomitant medications reported included desvenlafaxine succinate, gabapentin and dexlansoprazole.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 11:30 am, approximately six hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the morning of 23 Dec 2020, prior to receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt &#34;achy&#34;.  At 5:30 pm, the patient experienced chills, fever to 102, GI upset and diarrhea. At 11:00 pm, the patient reported difficulty sleeping, GI upset, LOC x 2 and pallor. The patient was transported to the emergency room via ambulance.  A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test and routine labs were collected; however, results were not provided. Treatment for the events included paracetamol, unspecified intravenous (IV) medications, ondansetron and ketorolac tromethamine. The emergency room discharge diagnosis was stomach flu.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, GI upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever, were considered resolved on 24 Dec 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 31-year-old, male subject with a medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, who experienced the unexpected events of loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, and stomach flu, and the expected events of chills and fever. The events of chills, fever occurred approximately 6 hrs. and the events of GI upset, loss of consciousness, difficulty sleeping occurred after 12 hrs. after the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The time to onset for the events of GI upset and diarrhea were unknown. The reporter did not provide the causality assessment for the events. Due to the temporal association between the LOC and the administration of the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however, the subject&#39;s medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and other concurrent conditions of GI upset, diarrhea, and stomach flu remain as confounders.

I would fall asleep for a bit but then at 4am I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so unbearable that I would clinch my eyes shut. Bones and muscle pains all over. Violent hot/cold flashes. I would feel hot all over and after a minute or so of placing a cold pack on my head I began to shiver despite sweating. Around 5am I was looking at my phone wondering if I should go to the ER because I legitimately felt like I was in danger.  The unbearable headache lasted a total of 14 hours from its onset. No OTC medications were taken.  Around 6pm on day 2 from the dose the intensity of the headache began to subside VERY slowly.  I woke up on day 3 completely fine as if nothing happened.

He reports mild swelling under his right eye, as well as to his right cheek area.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine,  I started to feel slight pain in the injection site (my arm) reminiscent of a bruise. An hour later, I started to feel tired and weak, and the soreness in my arm worsened slightly. The pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  45 minutes later, I experienced stiffness in my neck and upper back, though that isn&#39;t unusual for me. I also started to feel nauseous and cold at that time, but the nausea subsided within an hour.  The severity of these symptoms stayed the same the rest of the evening. I went to bed at midnight, and woke the next morning at 8am. My arm where I had received the shot felt much more sore and painful, especially when I move it, and mainly when any pressure is applied to the area. I was woken by pain in my arm when I payed on that side of my body. The pain is now a 4, but a 7 when pressure is applied. It is now 12:30 pm.

                                                &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   About 45 minutes after my shot, my left arm started hurting, basically going down from the injection site to my elbow. AT 1:30 am - 4/9/2021 (14 hours after shot), I awoke out of my sleep and was freezing. I got up and layer up on clothing and drank some water. From 1:30 am - 5:45 am- 4/9/2021, I was wide awake, but tired , yawning, freezing, and had a temp of 99.9. My mouth got very dry and I was drink just a little water, but found myself having to run to the restroom once an hours. My temp slowly got down to 99.2 by 5:30am. During this time, I was also nauseous from shaking so much from being cold. I slept for another 15 minutes and then was wide awake from 6:10 am- 7:30  and then fell asleep till 9:30am. As of 12:00pm, - 4-9-2021 I have slept maybe 4 hrs, I have a headache, my arm is throbbing and I am tired. I also feel like I have a bunch of mucus in my throat (but that could be from allergies).

                                                So I got the vaccine on January 23rd and the Sunday following I started noticing I was getting very dizzy I went to the ear doctor they said it was not my inner ear so I went to a heart doctor and they did a tilt table test and the tilt table suggested orthostatic hypotension. The heart doctor did alot of heart tests and the heart is good. My vision was blurry with constant headaches went to an eye doctor and I have onset strabismus in my right eye and then I went to a neurologist because the tips of my toes were numb . The heart doctor has me on fludrocortisone and metropolol because my heart rate was very high all the time ever since the vaccine it was stuck at 130 to 150 beats per minute no matter if I was resting or sitting. My pupils oscillate and ever since the adverse reaction started I have had pupillary athetosis or hippus. Horrible brain fog can&#39;t think clearly or sleep well insomnia came with all of this as well. I go to the mayoclinic, because dysautonomia is expected.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Down&#39;s syndrome.   On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 14-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced INFECTION (boil type infection near armpit). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinating\talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there/hearing voices of people talking to him) (seriousness criterion medically significant), ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR (different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done), ANXIETY (anxious, scared), DEPRESSED MOOD (Sad), DELUSION (having delusions), INSOMNIA (not sleeping), EATING DISORDER (taking a long time to eat) and WEIGHT DECREASED (lost 4 pounds). At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinating\talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there/hearing voices of people talking to him), INFECTION (boil type infection near armpit), ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR (different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done), ANXIETY (anxious, scared), DEPRESSED MOOD (Sad), DELUSION (having delusions), INSOMNIA (not sleeping), EATING DISORDER (taking a long time to eat) and WEIGHT DECREASED (lost 4 pounds) outcome was unknown.            On 01Apr2021, he had a boil type infection near his armpit. She wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment for the doctor until two days after so in the meantime she put hot compresses which helped. The MD prescribed an antibiotic that helped and it went away. Last Thursday, maybe seven or eight days later, her son showed different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done. He was hallucinating and talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there, he was anxious, sad, scared, and having delusions and hearing voices of people talking to him. He is normally self sufficient but he went from his normal routine and she had to tell him to eat and brush his teeth which he would normally do on his own. He is also not sleeping, taking a long time to eat which is unlike him, and has lost 4 pounds. His second dose (lot# 038B21A) was yesterday 14Apr2021. She is concerned if it is related to the vaccine or the antibiotic.

                                                I got the 2nd moderna vaccine on Wednesday, April 21st. With the shivers in the evening. Couldn?t sleep due to a fever. Had body aches the next day and felt light headed. Went bed that evening and slept a good 10 hours. So by Friday felt 90% still some stiffness, but felt good to go. Later in the afternoon and early evening I noticed a rash from the face down to the pelvic emerge. It is gone in the morning.  Hearing from a relative that got the Johnson and Johnson they also got the rash, but no other side effect.

Tinnitus became  debilitating with addition of second tone, resulting in repeated panic attacks at night and anxiety throughout the day. Severe impairment of daily activities with huge disruption of sleep and work.  Saw ENT and then family doctor who had to prescribe anxiety medication to control anxiety.

THen I was fine. A day before I hit my 2-week mark, I got really dizzy and started experiencing some mild confusion/forgetfulness, and had an inability to focus on anything.  It was so bad that I went to the doctor and he couldn&#39;t find anything wrong.  Then I found a forum online of people complaining about dizziness 2 weeks after their moderna shot and thought it best that I report it.

I woke up in the middle of the night after receiving the vaccine and had trouble going back to sleep.  I was having trouble regulating my body temperature, I was swinging from hot to cold all day.  I felt weak all day.  I had lower appetite.  Symptoms should get better in 36 hours.  In the end I am glad to have the vaccine and be safe, thank you for all you do.

Patient regained consciousness right away and was place on the floor lying down with legs raised. Paramedics were called to check on the patient. While waiting for the paramedics, was asked if he has any chronic conditions or had any breakfast in the morning prior to getting the vaccination. Pulse was checked and was 90 bpm. After couple minutes of lying down was moved to a chair to sit. He appeared to be shaking and nervous. Paramedics came and checked his glucose, blood pressure, pulse and asked few questions before clearing him. Patient refused to go to the hospital and sat down for 10-15 minutes before returning to his home.

Quickly escalated to difficult swallowing, body tingling, and extreme anxiety that almost caused a full blown panic attack. Luckily it subsided after about 20 mins of duress. Unfortunately around 12 hours after the injection at 3 AM I began experiencing quite severe flu like symptoms including nausea, extreme fatigue\weakness, occasional gagging, pain and diarrhea. Lasted until I awoke on the 12th (today) at approximately 8 am. Spent entire time in an on\off sleep also tried treating with tylenol and flu medication to no avail. Temperatures were checked twice both times results were in the high 99&#39;s.

I woke up on 05/26/21 at approximately 0120h feeling the need to urinate and was very sweaty, hot and thirsty. I sat down to urinate, and I felt dizzy standing back up. I was feeling very thirsty so proceeded to walk to get some water. I fainted after walking about 10 feet. I regained consciousness, and I drank water and ingested an Advil with the help of my wife. I felt a lot better after drinking the water, but still had a mild throbbing headache. I went back to sleep, and the fever symptoms came and went which affected my sleep quality. I drank more water any time I woke up. I took 2 more Advil as well at one time waking up. I woke up around 1300h on 05/26/21 feeling a lot better and a little more well rested. My fever symptoms are gone, but I am still a little sensitive to cold and feeling a little weak.

One of the nurse have to call in ambulance services , they checked ECG and transported me to nearby hospital&#39;s emergency department. Where I received 3-4 hours of emergency treatment ( a bed, re-do ECG, an emergency doctor&#39;s visit and Benadryl I.V. injection). All this life threatening events occured to me because of Moderna COVID19 vaccine. I was very excited and walk on my feet to clinic to take vaccine but I have to go in ambulance and face all this difficulties at the cost of my job day off and all other related inconvenience.    Both ambulatory services and hospital sent a huge bills, which upon my request, they submitted to my health insurance plan. Insurance company paid some amount but not in full. Insurance company said there is no government mandate for insurance companies to pay COVID-19 vaccine related emergiencies. so, they are not liable.     Second Dose:   Despite all this challenges, I decided to go for second dose to protect myself and the people of the from COVID-19. Again the same above story repeated even during the second dose. and they send bills to me.    Now there are close to $3000 bills on me due to above circumstances, which I don&#39;t think appropriate for me to pay. I was simply aiming for safety for myself and other general public by getting myself vaccinated without any prior knowledge of this could cost me financially and dangerous to my own health. I was simply following CDC guideline and suggestion.  In this situation, could you help me financial assistant or request ambulatory services and health to waive my financial obligations? Also, I request you to ask Moderna to reimburse for the cost of adverse effects of their vaccines.

Besides general left arm soreness for 2-3 days following vaccine, I had no other symptoms until Sunday January 3rd, at which time I began to notice increased fatigue, chills, and mild cough. Symptoms did not subside by Monday morning, January 4th, and I called in sick to work and requested that I receive a Covid 19 test from an urgent care. I tested positive for Covid 19 that day, and remained off work until 1/14/21. I experienced moderate chills, moderate increased skin sensitivity, and significant fatigue from 1/3/21 to 1/8/21, sleeping ~16-20 hours per day every day during that time. I began feeling better 1/9/21 and symptoms gradually improved until I was symptom-free on 1/12/21. I returned to work on 1/14/21, &gt;10 days following initial symptoms.

                                                After the vaccine was given I began to feel sensitivity around the shot location. So badly the sheet covering the shoulder was unbearable. I lost the strength to even roll over and my legs give way while walking. I sweated profusely while just putting on a t shirt and had to have assistance from feeling so weak and a 99.1 temperature at 09:00 a.m.  At approximately 02:00 p.m. I could not become warm with jeans shirt jacket heated blanket and an additional 3 comforters. I attempted to sleep but could not with 102.5 fever while sweating profusely.

Towards the end of the day I felt tired, however not sure if that was from the vaccine or because I did not sleep well. Tylenol reduced symptoms and they did not greatly interfere with my day.  The following morning all side effects were gone and I was back to completely normal.

Both were negative and I was instructed to just rest for 10 days and work from home. Experienced the same with 2nd dose, but twice as bad. Did not see a doctor in person.

The symptoms felt just like past instances of the flu I&#39;ve had.  Given this, I didn&#39;t go to work on 3/29, and instead went to get a covid test.  On 3/29, I also started to get consistent pain in emanating from the lymph node in my right arm, the same arm I received the vaccine in on 3/22.  The actual vaccine site no longer has any tenderness, and it was never painful after the shot.  I had no symptoms at all between 3/22 and 3/28.  The lymph node under my right arm is visibly swollen as well.  On 3/30, I was given the results of my covid test from 3/29, which was &#34;covid-19 not present.&#34;

                                                Felt a bit odd on the couch, little shiver and what felt like adrenaline. I got up and went into the bathroom where the incident occurred. I used to be on 10mg of Ramipril years ago and moved to 5 due to light headedness when standing up. Yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly. Getting up too fast with heart pressure meds prescribed for albumin /T1D and not for heart pressure. The secondary use of Ramipril is normal for type 1 diabetes after 20&#43; years. So I went to 5mg and haven?t had that issue since. I should also mention that when this used to happen to me I would lay down and recover with no problem.  Back to the incident it felt exactly like that but on steroids. I was in the bathroom looking for Tylenol and I got light headed, yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly, ringing in the ears, dizzy, and confused. I remember thinking I should probably get down on the tile floor and lay down like I?m used to from the episodes years ago with 10mg Ramipril causing the same symptoms but never anything so extreme. Next thing I know I?m on the ground waking up where I fainted and hit my head pretty hard on the way down. I probably have a minor concussion. Iced my head in the back where I hit it last night and this morning. Surprisingly 0 bumps, etc other than a little bit sore.  Trying to remember going down is impossible. There is a strange, I guess it?s not strange as I fainted, but to me being 1 moment thinking what I should do then the next moment still thinking that same exact thing but coming to on the bathroom floor with parents yelling over top of me as I was at their house is strange. I recall what almost felt like a dream while I was out but I was wondering why everyone was asking if I was ok, of course I?m ok I thought. Then I realized what happened and crawled around on the floor the rest of the night if I needed anything and was checked every hour through the night which was horrible but necessary.  Also my blood glucose was a 220 at the time of the incident according to my CGM so it didn?t have to do with low blood sugar.  In any case I feel better today but in a fog with a slight headache.

                                                I was released from quarantine from my Covid-19 infection 5 days prior to getting the first Moderna vaccine in the morning. By the evening, I felt sicker than I ever have in my entire life. I was shaking uncontrollably, had a fever, extreme chills, and a pounding headache and muscle aches. I didn&#39;t sleep that night and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until noon the next day. I am still lethargic today and seemed to have lost my sense of smell.   My Covid-19 symptoms from the 2 weeks prior were extremely mild and the vaccine experience was 1,000x worse. Something isn&#39;t right and I am questioning whether I should get the second shot.

On April 17th, two days after the shot I discovered a large bump (around 4-6 mm) under my skin on my lower neck, on the left side, close to the shoulder. I called a doctor and was advised to observe the bump for a week and schedule an in-person appointment with my doctor if the bump doesn&#39;t go away. The doctor said that it&#39;s most likely a lymph node.

                                                After about 2 hours, I felt a pull in my shoulder which led to excruciating pain throughout my shoulder and arm. I couldn?t sleep, so I contacted a dr online at 6 in the morning. I was able to see my doctor later that day, and she said the vaccine was injection too high (in my shoulder) opposed to in the deltoid muscle. I am now taking oral steroids and have an orthopedic appointment tomorrow.

The pharmacist had me place my feet up on a chair in front of me, gave me an electric fan  to point at myself and an ice pack that I applied to my head and back of neck. As the stars began to subside I felt a lump in my throat. The pharmacist then instructed me to continue to focus on breathing. Within 25-30 minutes I was clear of all adverse affects.

(not sure if this was a side effect or just a shock response to foreign matterials entering the body)  localized soreness in arm for a few days. worse second day than first.  chemical taste in mouth resembling isopropyl alcohol for about an hour or so, starting about 30 minutes after recieving vaccine, i assume this was just some of the sterilizing agent entering the body and getting circulated.  mild head fog in the days following the shot, this seems to have mostly gone away and i cant say with certainty if it is a side effect or was caused by some other factor such as stress.  mood disturbance / depression starting the day of the shot, this one might be completely unrelated, I attended a funeral of a family friend on that day which seems a reasonably likely cause for such, im just listing it because I want to be concise with my reporting of what Ive been experiencing.  mild headache behind the temple on the right side of my head, and behind both eyes.  heightened reaction to concrete allergy, not sure what exactly in concrete/cement i am allegric too possible nickel or chromates as pomphlox seems to fit the description, this has been recurrent for years but after recieving the vaccine a ring of hives formed on my left hand and my feet were the most broken out theyve ever been, i worked with cement 1 day after recieving the shot.  a relatively consistent feeling of coldness, since getting the shot ive felt abnormally cold, sometimes feeling the need for wearing a coat in 80&#43; degree weather. this is completely abnormal, typically i could wear a tshirt in 50°F weather and a hooded sweatshirt would suffice down into the 20s.  persistent joint pain in almost every joint of my body and the surrounding muscles, feels like it may be in the cartilidge or connective tissue, occasional pains had been experienced before and considered a normal part of life, but this has been relatively constant like an inflammatory response.  sleep cycle disturbance, normally i had abnormal sleeping habbits where being awake for 24&#43; hours at a time wasnt particularly uncommon (oddly this one seemingly gets worse when i stop drinking caffinated drinks), and it was impossible for me to get to sleep prior to like 2-3 am most nights followed by  sleeping for around 4-10 hours a night on average. however since recieving the shot ive been sleeping a lot more than this and at strange times (for me) like the middle of the afternoon.  fever/constant headache on the side the injection was recieved on has set in after about 2weeks and has been terrible, ive had to take ibuprophen for two days just to function, mild visual hallucinations have also occured in the past couple days mostly spatial distortions where the depth perception isnt working properly, and framerate issues where objects in motion leave a trail momentarily.

I had dark spots in my vision and intense pressure in my head. As I had been told to expect random side effects I went home and went to sleep early. The next day I had a lack of motor function with continued intracranial pressure and confusion. I called my doctor and went to the Emergency Room where my Blood Pressure was recorded to be Hypertensive and then retaken. I was given a CT scan and sent home. I was unable to work  the rest of the week and was out of work after being sent home sick the following week. I continued to experience intense intracranial pressure and an inability to form short term memories for three weeks after vaccination. I still continue to experience intracranial pressure and episodes of hypertension but have more ease in forming short term memories. Intracranial pressure has nonetheless decreased significantly compared to the immediate onset following inoculation. My medical testing is ongoing.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

                                                At approximately &#43;2 hours from time of vaccine, began experiencing severe (immobilizing) RIGHT FRONT rib pain. Pain level 6 of 10. Contacted doctor&#39;s answering service at &#43;24 hours from time of vaccine to inquire about course of action. Ice was recommended. Doctor&#39;s answering service concluded rib pain to be unrelated to vaccine but rather to Cerebral Palsy and/or muscle strain from 10,000 meter indoor rowing event completed -10 hours from time of vaccine. I am very skeptical of this finding since I routinely row 10,000 meters, and average 40,000&#43; meters each week. No prior known incidents of right front rib pain.  Pain history:  &#43;2 hours, 6 of 10  &#43;24 hours, 6 of 10, unable to conduct normal activity, painful to walk/exercise  &#43;36 hours until present, 6 of 10 but decreasing slowly. Still not able to return to normal routines

For then next couple days just felt rundown. Then three days post vaccine I began having some chest discomfort and shortness of breath. That night around one thirteen the morning I went to Emergency Department. they took a ECG and drew labs. the ECG showed normal rhythm just a little elevated and my Blood pressure was elevated. Upon the attending physician getting my lab work back i was admitted for my triponin levels being elevated. I was taken for chest X-rays and a Cat Scan per their pulmonary embolism protocols. Both of which showed nothing.  The next day i had a Echocardiogram, and Cardiac Catheterization, and a Cardiac MRI.

When I woke up, I felt mostly normal, so I took my Bupropion dose (150mg) and drank a cup of coffee. I exercised and went to the gym. When I got back I noticed my heart rate while resting was 130. This persisted into the night. I felt tired, weak, unfocused, and cold at night again. It is possible I had a slight fever again. 48 hrs after my second vaccine, I still have a high resting heart rate (90) which goes up to 120 whenever I move. It is as though I am exercising. I feel like I could jump up and run at any moment. I do not feel fatigued today thankfully. The high heart rate with fatigue is what worried me most.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused. One of the pharmacy technicians called 911 immediately and started the emergency response. he was able to regain his composure and move himself back the chair. The EMTs arrived and took his vitals, and discussed what happened. They eventually determined that he was ok and was free to go. The patient did not go to the hospital.

                                                I had a sore arm almost immediately following the shot that slowly got worse throughout the evening. In the morning my arm was very sore. I woke up around 6:30 with a headache and chills. throughout the morning, my headache worsened as did my chills. I felt fatigued and noticed my lungs felt the same as they did when I had COVID. Essentially all my COVID symptoms came back I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I slept most of the morning and then felt nauseous around 3 pm. I vomited around 3:30 and almost felt completely better after that. My headache, chills, and fatigue were still present but significantly less once I vomited. In the morning I woke up with a headache that lasted through the morning the second day after vaccine administration. By the end of the second day, I felt completely fine. My arm soreness was almost completely gone. I also had some aches and chills on the second day in the morning upon waking up but those were gone by mid-day. On day three I feel completely fine.

                                                Around 1 am, I was sitting home watching tv and I started to smell blood coming from throat and I starting to feel like a blood chunk is coming out. And it happened. A medium sized blood chunk came out followed by couple small pieces of blood then I did drink lime mixed with water and stopped. But I still feel like there is something kind of blocking my throat a little bit.

                                                I have not felt the same since I received the vaccine. Initially, I felt tingling in my fingers after receiving the injection. I also got chest and throat tightness. I felt very slightly shaky and just a bit off.  After that subsided a bit, I left the facility and started heading home. Ten miles from the store, I went back as I got another wave of feeling pretty terrible. I waited outside there for another hour until I felt better again. The next few days I had terrible fatigue and constant headaches, and the obvious sore arm. I had a couple days where I was a little better but then it would come surging back again.  For three weeks I&#39;ve had on and off migraines, extreme and dreadful fatigue like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before (feels like I&#39;m dying of cancer or something), and feeling out of it and spacey. It&#39;s been awful and I&#39;m terrified to get the second dose if the first one did all this to me. I was feeling great in the weeks leading up to the vaccine so I am certain that my reaction is to the vaccine. I hope this gets better soon. I&#39;m not sure what to do about dose 2.

I continued to speak to him and he was unable to hear initially.  He did cry out and gasp and tighten then started to have a few slow jerky movements bringing both arms and body up from the chair. It appeared as if he may vomit and I repositioned to ensure he would not slide off of the chair.  The movements lasted about a minute and then he started to come to.  He described feeling dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, and sweaty.  During the event his pupils were non responsive. At 11:17 he went pale and started feeling as if he was spinning and experiencing tingling.  He was still reclined in the chair and sitting up aided with the tingling.  He was given a cold pack to help regulate and given ice water at 11:18.  He stated he had not eaten yet today as he usually doesn&#39;t eat until 11. His temperature had dropped to 96.1 vs 97.5 prior to the vaccination.  BP was checked at 11:25 and was 120/72 which is lower than usual for him and to be expected with the LOC.  After drinking his water, I had him attempt to stand while grasping the wall/table for 2 minutes to assess his steadiness, then standing unassisted for 2 minutes.  After he felt steady enough we had him walk 10-15 feet and stand for another 2 minutes.  Patient was feeling tired and instructed not to drive home.  The situation was conveyed to his wife and they were instructed to seek ER/Urgent care if any of his symptoms reappeared. They stayed in the area to eat lunch and I checked in again at 12:12pm with the patient and he is feeling better after eating but still tired.  I also recommended following up with his primary as I will be sending her a copy of this report.

                                                24 hours after vaccination developed dizziness and muscle pain which progressed rapidly to confusion,  slurred speech, and labored breathing. Acute onset (minutes) developed full body ?pins and needles? and numbness especially prominent in hands, feet, and sides of neck. Bilateral. Acute symptoms lasted approximately 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, acute symptoms improved but followed immediately by chills, extreme lethargy, and flushing of face. I was disoriented (?dazed?) for approximately  3 hours after episode. I was in a remote area and was not able to present to medical care by the time symptoms subsided.

                                                After the individual received his vaccine he went to the medical monitoring area with two additional members of his party.  At approximately 1412 the individuals friends alerted me that he needs help. I walked approximately 40 feet to find a 33 year old male patient that was unconscious and seizing.  The seizure lasted about 20-30 seconds with the patient waking up confused. I instructed someone from my team to call 911 and request an  ambulance.  Another team member and myself assisted the patient to a wheelchair and moved him to our treatment area approximately 50 feet away.  The patient was somewhat confused, hot &amp; sweaty and fatigued.  I took a basic set of vital signs and got: BP 90/70 Pulse 56 Respirations 22 LOC x 4 No CBG  The ambulance arrived within 10 minuets and another round of vitals were taken.  The patients blood pressure and pulse were still low.  A CBG of 120 was achieved.  The patient was still hot / sweaty and fatigued.  The patient lied down on a cot and soon started feeling better.  He stopped sweating and his BP / Pulse started rising to within normal limits.  The two paramedics on site conducted a 12 lead ECG and didn&#39;t notice any amoralities.  Due to this incident being the first of its kind for the patient and without being a able to find a definitive known cause it was recommended that the patient be transported to the local hospital for further evaluation.  The patient declined and stated that he would have his friends take him if he starting feeling really bad.   It was strongly advised that he be transported via medics to the hospital but in the end the patient refused.

They gave him a choice of hospital or going home. He chose home. About 20 minutes later he had the chills and developed a headache. He then developed diarrhea.  He went to bed. When he woke up in the middle of the night he felt like he went into a GrandMal seizure. He had memory loss and confusion. He could not get up. His entire body was hurting. He went to the hospital. They gave him anti-nausea medicine. Put him on an IV (UNKNOWN NAME).  They prescribed him on a medicine for cluster headaches (can not remember name). Gave him 2 or different meds for his migraines. Dr. said he would call him in a week. The hospital gave him Ondansetron 8mg as needed.

                                                For several hours I had no side effects, including soreness at the injection site. In the evening, maybe 6-8 hours after the injection, the site became sore. After midnight, I started having severe chills and needed several layers of clothing and blankets to stay warm. I checked for a fever and did not have one. In the morning the chills were gone but I had a strong headache that lingered with varying intensity throughout the day. It is unclear if the headache was more from the vaccine or more from a lack of sufficient sleep because I couldn&#39;t sleep with the chills. The injection site has continued to be sore and seems to be increasingly sore. After waking up on 1-13-2021, I found myself feeling fatigued and lethargic, not dissimilar to the fatigue I felt when I had COVID. The fatigue has somewhat subsided over the course of the day, with lots of rest helping. The headache and soreness are ongoing, and the fatigue is present but less than earlier today. There&#39;s been somewhat of an ongoing lack of appetite, but I&#39;ve been able to eat in small amounts and keep down what I eat. The chills have come and gone a couple times throughout the day today, but that doesn&#39;t seem to last long.

                                                I recieved my second covid 19 vaccine by moderna.  I still have the subtle altered taste/smell that occured after receiving the first dose a month ago (I have previously reported that).  On 1/25/21, I recieved the 2nd dose of vaccine at 10 am and felt fine all day.  Around 10pm, I started to have chills.  This rapidly evolved to whole body rigors.  My tempature spiked.  I couldn&#39;t move, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would pass out or throw up.  I had to have my wife bring me a makeshift urinal since I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Went from freezing to boiling, back and forth.  Felt absolutely miserable.  Around 2-3 am broke out into a cold sweat and finally started to feel better.  I was drenched in sweat througout the night.  It was a very long 4-5 hours.  The following night I felt fine although I also was drenched in sweat when I woke up.

Over the course of the night, I fell more ill and finally took my temperature in the morning around 7 AM and had a fever of around 100.4 F. I took Tylenol about every 6 hours for the next 24 hours with my temperature fluctuating between normal and 100.4 F. During this time, I was too ill to do anything more than sleep or lay in bed. The following day, my temperature broke, but I was still experiencing aches, chills, and brain fog, along with the pain at the injection site. After about 84 hours from the time of the vaccination, I felt normal enough to resume my daily activities.

                                                I had noticed a minimal pain in my pec, but then a pump or DOMS sensation, almost minimal grade strain, thought nothing of it, just &#34;that&#39;s odd&#34;.  Then last night 3/10/2021 I felt a nerve time pain in my axillary space.  I know nerves can be &#34;funny&#34; at times since understanding pain science and low grade nerve information and still didn&#39;t think that was odd.  Today this morning 3/11/201 during my 545am work out I noticed around 6:15 am my delt (injection site) was very red.  Later it got itchy, and now 8:14pm swollen and starting to get warm, and the redness ring is now twice the size of my morning work out.  Pain is minimal none, just minor sorness (a 1/4th of the after day sorness from shot).  My pec area feels off.

                                                Gastro symptoms started the Monday following the vaccine. Acid reflux was continually getting worse and causing difficulty eating, and sleeping. Thursday I went to the ER and was diagnosed with pneumonia and given a gastro cocktail and recommended follow up with gastrointestinal physician. On Friday I felt worse and had a fever of 101 I took Tylenol and Motrin and continually felt worse. Went to ER with 103.4 fever and racing heart rate. BP was normal. Was discharged and told to continue medication. The next day (Saturday) I woke with a swollen penis and went back to the ER where I was given a steroid shot and told to ice and watch for any additional swelling. Fever has stayed down but have had aches and pains throughout the day

Later on, balloon-type blisters appeared. later majority of that skin peeled off and new pinkish skin surfaced. The entire feeling was like skin burn after boiling oil spill. I could not drive because hand movement or muscle pressure caused pain, leading to unable to sleep on the left side and let people touch my arm. Still, after the new skin, my arm shows many signs of ugly spots and marks and discoloration. It&#39;s mental trauma going through it. Over the period of 15&#43; days applying Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream helped.

Remained in bed the rest of the day and as long as I was lay on left side was ok.  Next day vertigo was gone however, remained light headed with light dizziness.  Has remained for the past week.

He was noted at 10:36 to be unresponsive in the chair as well as pale and limp. He was moved to the floor where he had agonal breathing and HR &gt;100. His neck was tilted to facilitate respirations. He was clammy and continued to be unresponsive for 90 seconds. EMS called. He had a period of postictal agitation with bilateral lower extremity failing for approximately 20 seconds. He then became responsive but still pale and clammy. He moved to a sitting position after 4 minutes of being awake and alert. EMS arrived, assessed him and left without transport. He left with his cousin who is driving him home. Instructed him to seek medical care for evaluation of this and prior episodes. Instructed him to seek clearance before next vaccination.

The diarrhea lasted for roughly an hour, and then the stomach pains subsided.  I also experienced difficulty sleeping prior to the diarrhea. My heart rate was elevated, and I couldn?t stay asleep.  I was also achey the entire day after my vaccination, but there were no other serious side effects.

He felt fine, so he walked to the bakery area and spoke with another pt, at the muffins display. He said his arm felt &#34;weird&#34; and said that happened to her, too.  He said he started feeling lightheaded and was leaning against the case.  He said, &#34; I blinked, fell to the ground and next he saw people standing around him.&#34;  He said, no nausea, just lightheaded and he hit the side of his head lightly. Staff helped him into a wheelchair and took him to the office.  I spoke with him in the office and asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital.  I received this information from the patient when I asked him if he could tell me what happened.  He was sweating and pale, but no nausea, no disturbance in his vision and his blood pressure wasn&#39;t elevated.   He told me again that he took no regular medication,  but a couple of years ago he had been dizzy after a tetanus shot.  I asked again if he had any discomfort or pain anywhere and he said only his arm felt sore near the shot.   I asked again if he felt like he would like to go to the hospital and he said no.  His family came and picked him up.

I have a subconjunctival hemorrhage in my left eye that fills about 1/3rd of the eye white with blood..... Headache, stiff muscles and overall tiredness are the only other remaining side effects besides a blood-filled eyeball at this point.

                                                20mins after the shot. I rapidly developed a fever and had trouble seeing. Felt like fainting. Really nauseous stomach and diarrhea. Chills but with a high fever. Threw up 25mins after shot. Immediately after that felt really nauseous and couldn?t see straight. Vision was black and I was seeing stars. Felt like hallucinating really bad. Couldn?t focus my vision. Got home and showered with a really hot shower and immediately started feeling better. 45mins to 1 hour after shot started feeling way better! Just sluggish the rest of the night.  For some reason was fighting going to sleep and fell asleep sitting up. Next day much better!

                                                Pt was seen in the Covid vaccine clinic for his second dose of moderna vaccine. Pt stated to this nurse that he typically passes out after receiving a vaccine or blood draw. This RN advised pt to sit in the same chair for his 15 min observation period. At approximately 1642 Pt started slumping over in his chair and was unresponsive to voice. His eyes were open, his skin become very pale and was diaphoretic. This Rn along with several RNs that were near by came to his aid. VS were obtained. At 1644 pt lost consciousness for approximately 15 to 30 seconds, EMS was called at this time (1644). Right before pt woke up he had witnessed convulsions. Upon waking, pt was lip smacking, no emesis at this time. His eyes were open and he was supporting his own weight but was not responding to voice commands. At approximately 1646 pt was alert and responding appropriately, stated that he knew where he was now and he was no longer confused. Pt was given an apple juice which he was able to drink without complications. At 1708 pt was A&amp;O x4, had a steady gait, stated that he felt back to baseline and safe to drive home. Pt declined EMS evaluation and left the clinic.

                                                At approximately 3am (~13 hours post-injection) I experienced chills. I was asleep in bed and was awakened by my own shivering. My bedroom was its typical temperature, I had my usual bedding on the bed, and my wife (next to me) did not feel that the temperature was unusually low. I added additional blankets and suffered through these chills for approximately one hour until they passed.  At approximately 9am (~19 hours post-injection) I began to experience severe body aches and fatigue. I got up, had breakfast, and then slept approximately 3 more hours. I awoke for lunch, played with my children, and then fell asleep for approximately 2 more hours. Body aches continued through the day. Over-the-counter Tylenol was sufficient to ease the discomfort. I would describe the level of body ache as similar to having completed an extremely strenuous physical activity the previous day; the last time I can remember feeling this sore was following a multi-day 100-mile backpack trip at high elevation. At present (10pm, approximately 32 hours post-injection) the body aches are subsiding but still present. My fatigue is also subsiding.

He remained in the waiting  room for a bit, and felt better in about 30 minutes.

I went to be around 11pm.  Upon laying down I began to get dizzy and my heart began to pound rapidly.  This strong heart pounding would last 5 hours straight. An hour later my throat started to get a tight feeling with tingling under the chin area and my saliva production began to slow drying out my mouth.  Breathing became more labored and difficult.  At this time my heart was still beating strong.  I had intense Insomnia.  The one time that I tried to lay down; when my body would try to doze off for a second; my body would suddenly jolt me awake with an intense shaking and heart pounding.

I was in bed for 5 weeks with most of the symptoms and regularly had fever exceeding 104. When I was allowed to return to work, the Dr. gave me light duty orders to not exceed 5 hours worked per day for 2 months.  After receiving the first vaccination dose, my arm became incredibly sore. These symptoms lasted for almost 2 weeks.   The morning following vaccination, my body began to ache and hurt on touch to the point where the cover woke me up in pain. These symptoms lasted nearly three days during both day and night.   I became nauseous about 24 hours following the vaccination. These symptoms lasted almost 4, 24 hour days.   I became dizzy, periodically, about 24 hours after receiving the vaccination.  These symptoms lasted for almost 7 days.   I had low grade fever on three occasions that I knew about, I treated with Tylenol.  These symptoms lasted 3 days after vaccination.   I had a horrible headache (I never have had headaches before) I could not open my eyes or expose them to light. Most of the pain was concentrated on the left side of my head. These headaches started 3 days after receiving the vaccination and lasted 5 days later until day 8. I used Tylenol, which seemed to have little effect and slept all day.

Patient appeared pale, and his head was nodding backward. 911 was called. I checked his pulse, and breathing which were both normal. Patient started to gradually lose consciousness and confused speech, but was roused by me asking him questions, to which he responded and shaking his shoulder. Patient gradually began to regain color and normal speech returned. Patient stated that he was panicked and is afraid of needles and worked him self up after receiving the vaccine.

The fever gave me chills and I needed to put on lots of warm clothes to stop the chills which were preventing me from sleeping.  The fever broke after about 2 hours.  All night, though, sleep was interrupted.  I woke up every hour or 2, looked at the clock, and hoped I could fall back asleep again.  Got up at 8:30 am, feeling tired.  Was tired all day and unable to do my daily activities.  Had to rest all day.  Finally, the following day (2 days after getting the shot), after a good night of sleep, I felt like myself again and had my energy back.

He walked back the vaccination room. We offered him water, then we checked his vitals at 11:24am (BP 111/62, HR 52 bpm). He took his mask off, took few deep breaths, took more water. Then rechecked his vitals again at 11:31 am (BP 115/79, HR 65 bpm). He said that he started feeling better and less sweaty. Per patient, he had a bagel, a Redbull and smoked marijuana few hours before the vaccine. He was nervous about getting the second dose and the possible side effects that he heard about. Patient left the pharmacy around 11:35am with his wife and son. His wife mentioned that she will be driving him home. Patient was counseled to seek medical help if he experience more adverse effects.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                Around 12 hours after the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine I experienced the expected severe fever, chills, and rigors.  This eventually subsided to a large extent by hour 30; however at hour 36 I slightly bent over to pick up an item from my nightstand and felt what seemed to be a pulled muscle in my left back.  I immediately went to bed and awoke with severe muscle spasms in that same area.  The muscle spasms continued lying, standing, and sitting.  Nothing relieved them and they were intermittent brought on spontaneously and also by movement.  I could not perform most daily functions and sought medical attention at the local urgent care.  There they diagnosed it as a thoracic myofascial strain.  They prescribed me cyclobenzaprine which helped decrease the frequency but not completely alleviate the spasms.

My right side of my face around the cheek, eye, and ear area began to tingle and feel numb around 20 to 30 min. After the shot was administered. It was only on the side of my face that Moderna covid vaccine was given. It ended up going away after 4 hours or so. The next day I had normal reactions to the shot for someone that had covid such as low fever, muscle inflammation, aches, and this brain fog, chills in my sleep.

Woke up again feeling worse at 7am. fever of 101 degrees. Took more tylenol and more benadryl. Slept until 2pm. Woke up still had fever and body aches. By 530pm body aches stopped and fever went away. By 7pm i felt normal. Injection site soreness lasted for less time on 2nd shot than on first shot.

                                                I was working on a fence about 5-5:30 pm and suddenly developed blurry vision. I continued working for another 5-10 minutes, then I went inside for dinner with my wife kids and in-laws. I complained I couldn?t see in my periphial  to my wife and mother n law.  I  ate dinner, salad and spaghetti. While eating my brother in law asked if I got a new car and that he hadn?t see the white one before. I tried to tell him what happened to my old car but got caught and couldn?t think clearly about the old car, the problems it had and the story.  After dinner I want out to help on the fence again and my son was handing  my brother in law boards and I tried to tell him the board wasn?t cut with a bevel yet. But couldn?t come up with any words to describe the board. I went to my wife explained my  that my brain wasn?t working right and I clearly had a problem. I developed some tingling in my right hand. She took me to  local ER referenced. My symptoms subsided on their own and they weren?t able to see anything on a cat scan. As I felt better I didn?t take the next step to the larger ER with and MRI.

Approximately 4-5 minutes later, the patient was observed to be slumping in the chair, and fell to the floor. It was not clear whether he hit his head. The patient was incoherent, and was asked to lie on his back. He tried to get up, and was positioned to a sitting position on the floor.  called 911, and conveyed all necessary info. A paramedic who happened to be shopping in the store intervened and tried to make an assessment of the patient. He asked several questions to determine patient awareness,(year, date, president). When Fire &amp; Rescue arrived, they performed a general assessment including cardiac monitoring. After roughly 15 minutes, the patient appeared to have regained his faculties. Although it was strongly suggested that he be transported to the hospital for further observation, the patient declined, and left the store of his own accord with his mother.

                                                Horrible ear infection started a few days after receiving vaccination. I was lethargic 2 days after vaccination, then woke up with the worst ear pain I?ve ever had. I could not sleep and NyQuil would only help for 1 hour. I went to the Urgent Care at 8am and was diagnosed with a bad ear infection. I was prescribed Amoxicillin and was given a shot of Tramadol which quickly helped the pain. I haven?t had an ear infection in 20 years and it is uncommon for adults to get them. I thought it would be important for you to track whether this is happening to other people and if anything could be done to prevent it.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

                                                Patient arrived to check in for appointment with his wife. Patient does not speak English so his wife translated and shared that the patient wasn&#39;t feeling well due to allergies to the pollen and wasn&#39;t sure if he could take the shot. I checked the patient&#39;s temperature and it was 98.7F. I asked the patient what his symptoms were. Patient reported mucus draining causing irritation to the back of his throat. I recommended OTC nasal spray for the post-nasal drip. I asked if patient had any history of allergic reaction to any vaccine, fainting, or history of seizures and patient denied. I stated patient was in the clear to take the shot if he was comfortable. Patient said okay. Pharmacist administered the shot and patient and his wife were seating in our waiting area to wait 20 min. After 10 min, patient&#39;s wife screams that her husband is not feeling well. Pharmacist rushes to the patient and sees his body shaking in the seat and asks a customer to lay him on the ground. Customer calls 911. Seizing lasted less than a minute. I approach the scene and immediately lay the patient to his side. Patient is conscious and breathing. Patient denied chest paint, headache, or tingling sensation in hands and feet. Patient vitals were checked. Paramedics arrive and did a full check up and everything was within normal limits. Patient openly reported he had not eaten all day and has history of fainting after shot due to anxiety of needles. Paramedics encouraged patient to seek medical attention, but patient denied. Patient was given water and a banana and went home.

                                                1h after the vaccination, I had the usual arm pain which lasted for a few days and then completely cleared away (next day I also had fever 37.5-38 C, fatigue, and muscle pain).  However, 8 days after the vaccination, on Friday 30th of April 2021, I woke up in pain: my arm was hurting again and this time I could not find a position on how to keep my arm and not feel pain. I eventually fell asleep but the arm pain at injection site persisted for days. Today (5th of May), five days after the second I still feel some discomfort in the shot area which sometimes goes above the pain threshold.   I did read about people having delayed arm pain, especially with the Moderna vaccine, which is a some kind of delayed antibody reaction. But I did not read about people having both just-after-shot pain and delayed pain and I do not know if I should take the second dose while my arm still hurts from the first does (I have my second shot in 2 weeks). Should I wait for no pain? Should I do it in the other arm? Could you please advise?  Probably nothing, but just to mention everything I know: one contributing factor could be that I went to the gym the previous day of receiving the vaccine and worked my shoulders - I was already a bit sore when I got the vaccine.

                                                Went to ER twice after first shot. Blood work from physical came back unnormal. High elevations in platelet, liver, and kidney. Very sick for 3 weeks. 2nd shot: woke up next day ended in ER with fever over 102. Continuous pain, nausea, anxiety, and migraines. PCP and doctors keep denying the shot caused the issues and urged me to get the 2nd dose.

                                                Developed tinnitus after 2 days of vaccination. Prior to vaccination I was having mild ringing in my right ear due to moderate hearing loss caused by ear drum perforation.  2 days after vaccination I started having tinnitus on left side of my brain on and off and now it&#39;s continuous , also ringing in my right ear has increased , it is causing to me to have sleepless nights and groggy days. It has not improved even after a month. It could be  a permanent damage but I am not sure.

                                                at around noon the day following my shot, I started feeling soreness all over my body. I took aleve. I felt some chills and a slight headache. These lasted until Sunday. Monday I started feeling very tired, very week, and still sore in my arms and a little in my legs. I took aleeve. Tuesday I still felt lingering soreness but no headache. I started feeling anxiety towards the end of my workday. At around 4pm I started to feel my legs quivering as if I had just run several miles and my muscles were week. This gave me anxiety as I was still working and assisting clients. at around 4:15 I started feeling like I was going to break out in hives around my neck area, which does sometimes happen to me. I got home and around 7pm I took a Zyrtec, but by that point hives started forming on my neck and head. I felt my lip start to swell. I woke up at about 3am on Wednesday to find both of my lips swollen and I took a Benadryl and went back to bed. I woke up at about 7am and my eyes were both swollen almost completely shut and my lips were swollen. I could feel itchiness from incoming hives around my neck and shoulders. I took two Benadryl and rested all day. The swelling mostly went down by the end of the day and I continued to nurse the Benadryl. I saw my doctor on the 15th. He advised how to proceed and prepare  with the second dose and referred me to an allergist.

                                                Starting the day of the vaccine in the evening, I had fever, felt tired and chills. Temperature 101-102 . I  took ibuprofen and went to sleep. I had chills the whole night. I woke up the next day and had headache, dizzy, nauseated. I continued to take ibuprofen every 4 hours.  Mild fever during the day and no fever at night. Nausea was improving.  Headache was not improving. The following day, I felt a little better, a little nauseated, headache, dizziness and diarrhea and left work early to go home. Took Zofran for dizziness and it helped a little. I did a telehealth visit over the phone and I was sent to get Covid test (negative).  Symptoms did not improve so I went to ER the follow day.  I was sent home with a prescription for higher dose Zofran and was told to stop ibuprofen and start Tylenol.   I went home and tried to rest.  Symptoms are slowly improving.  I was unable to drive for a whole week.  I had these symptoms for about 7 days. Headache, diarrhea and nausea went away, but I still felt fatigued.   The fatigue lasted for about another week (total of 2 weeks).

                                                After five days from the second dose of Moderna Covid Vaccine, I started to have vertigo, dizziness and lightheadedness and pressure on my ears. It is worse when I walk or turn my haead; I am at the day 13 today from the vaccine secon dose, and still have those feelings without any improvement. This has made me unfunctional and unable to walk or do my daily activities. I went to my neurologist 2 days ago and she found nothing wrong with my tests. She finally prescribed otc medication: &#34;meclizine&#34; that has not helped me much. I saw a lot of people are experiencing the same issue, dizziness and vertigo ;Please see thsi forum which shows I am not the only one. /

Body aches the entire next day in addition to being extra tired and constant diarrhea.  Had to stay home from work. I haven&#39;t felt 100% since, even though it has been over 2 weeks. After my wife got her second shot, our entire household got a suspicious flu like cold, then it happened again right after my second dose. That lasted almost a week each time and just seems unlikely to be a complete coincidence.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.   Concurrent medical conditions included Psychiatric disorder NOS (Been a psychiatric patient for many years.) and Multiple sclerosis (Being diagnosed with primary relapsing multiple sclerosis.). Concomitant products included CELECOXIB (CELEBREX) for Inflammation, HALOPERIDOL (HALDOL [HALOPERIDOL]) for an unknown indication.  On 08-May-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-May-2021, the patient experienced MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS RELAPSE (primary remitting multiple sclerosis to flare-up) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PSYCHOTIC DISORDER (caused a secondary psychosis/  talk to the voices in his head) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DISTURBANCE IN ATTENTION (Could not hold a conversation or pay attention to someone talking), AGGRESSION (Temper flares) and ENERGY INCREASED (excess energy). The patient was treated with HALOPERIDOL (HALDOL [HALOPERIDOL]) at a dose of 2 milligram every 2 hours for a couple of days and HALOPERIDOL (HALDOL [HALOPERIDOL]) ongoing since an unknown date at a dose of 5 milligram three times a day. At the time of the report, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS RELAPSE (primary remitting multiple sclerosis to flare-up), PSYCHOTIC DISORDER (caused a secondary psychosis/  talk to the voices in his head), DISTURBANCE IN ATTENTION (Could not hold a conversation or pay attention to someone talking), AGGRESSION (Temper flares) and ENERGY INCREASED (excess energy) outcome was unknown.  The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   With in a day or two of receiving his Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, the caller&#39;s son had experienced temper flares along with excess energy, could not hold a conversation or pay attention to someone talking to him. His psychiatrist told him to take Haldol (haloperidol) 2mg every 2 hours for a few days, then changed the dose to haloperidol 5mg three times daily. Caller is not sure about son&#39;s compliance to his medications, but was snot sure that he was taking them last weekend. The son was doing better than he did last week, emotionally. Mother did not have permission of to talk to psychiatrist or staff, but her son informed her that the psychiatrist felt that the vaccine caused his primary remitting multiple sclerosis to flare-up, which in turn caused a secondary psychosis. Last incident when MS triggered psychosis was 4 years ago. Patient has been stable until the vaccine. Patient&#39;s psychosis had caused him  in the past to talk to the voices in his head. He does sometimes get upset with the voices in his head, as sometimes they are angry, but sometimes the voices talk about religion and he works through problems. Patient described his post-vaccine psychosis as &#34;hell&#34;. Treatment included haloperidol.

                                                Around an hour or so after the shot, I had mild face numbness. I noticed this with the first dose as well, but in both cases, it went away. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the onset of a migraine as I get migraines from time to time and I did have headaches/migraines with both doses. Around 12 hours or so after getting the second shot, I had flu-like symptoms (headache, nausea, aches, mild fever). I couldn&#39;t focus and vomited water/stomach bile a couple of times. After around 12 hours of feeling flu-like, I started to feel better and could eat simple food again (Corn Chex, chicken broth). I also had soreness in the arm near the injection site. I can&#39;t remember if I had neck pain or not. After the 12 hours or so of the flu-like symptoms, I quickly recovered. I would have reported this via VAMS, but felt so bad during the first 24 hours after getting the second dose, that I was late to registering my second dose in the VAMS system and the system would not let me retroactively report my symptoms. This is why I am submitting this VAERS report in case that it is helpful.

                                                No side effects from first shot.  Second shot was different.  Got my second shot about 2PM and around 1-2 AM I was getting ready for bed.  At first I was just feeling tired but then I started shaking uncontrollably and muscles in my neck and back were spazzing out.  I lost all control of my body and fell over, convulsing for an unknown amount of time.  I apparently foamed and/or drooled all over myself.  I woke out of this effect around 3:30 AM.  This was Friday/Saturday.  Its Monday now.  I still cannot stand straight and cannot create complex thoughts in my mind.  I had a hard time perceiving colors for the first day and a half to two days after the seizure or stroke I suffered.  I still have a migraine that feels like an elephant is sitting inside my skull.  I still cannot perform complicated thoughts nor can I do complicated things with my hands because of a lack of motor skills.  I successfully pulled every muscle in my back and neck and cannot stand upright.  I&#39;m 35 and now need a cane.  Its already been 3 days and things really have not changed.  Won&#39;t catch me lining up for a booster shot.  NO THANK YOU.  I did not seek medical attention because lets face it the healthcare system is a joke I would have needed a ride to a hospital, increasing my odds of getting the virus, to have them hold me as long as they can to stab me and poke me and take samples, give me no results, and a humungo bill.  I will die before I go to a hospital ever again because the amounts of testing I required at the time would have covered back and neck and brain scans of various types and those tests are stupid expensive and 99% of the time I&#39;ve ever got one they said oh I&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong go see my friend who is a specialist blah blah blah and its the &#34;doctor-go-round&#34; where you blow all your money on morons that only care about lining their pockets.

But on the 6th day after my vaccination, I started to feel anxiety, insomnia, brain fog followed by  depression, panic attack and rapid heart palpitation and it lasted for 3 weeks. Until now, there are times that I can still feel the rapid heart palpitation.

                                                I received the vaccine on 6/25 at 10am. By 5pm I had severe body aches and a fever temperature of 100.8. That night I suffered from severe insomnia along with severe shaking, body aches and a 102 degree fever. I took extra strength Tylenol and used cold packs to attempt to reduce my fevers. The symptoms and 102 fever lasted throughout 6/26 at several times I contemplated going to the emergency room since the fever was high. My body aches were so bad and my entire body was tightening up causing extreme muscle and joint soreness. During the early morning hours of 6/27 my fever finally broke and I began sweating profusely. I would sweat and have a hot flash like event occur throughout the day. I also felt very foggy and my energy levels were extremely low. I did not feel better until 6/28. For the record I had already had the covid virus and my last blood work up (approx 3 months prior) from my physician showed high levels of antibodies.

                                                Three weeks after receiving the first dose (on 02/01/2021) I woke up with extreme dizziness and imbalance, I felt as if I was constantly leaning to the right.  I would get extremely nauseous from walking, working, or just sitting and turning my head.  When I would lay down on my right side I felt as if fluid were building up and that something was going to pop.  Advil, caffeine, and alcohol made my symptoms worse.  I was able to find some relief by laying down on my left side and through sleep.   After a week, I went to see Dr. at Clinic. They were unable to figure my issue, but they ruled out BPPV.  They also did a blood and urine test at this time. After two weeks the dizziness started to fade a little, but I was left with headaches, imbalance, tiredness, and pressure behind my ear and eye.  I noticed that any kind of stress or anger would make the symptoms much worse.  I visited Dr. at ENT Clinic.  She did several tests and was unable to find any obvious cases of my symptoms.  She suggested I might have had migraines, even though I had no history of them.  She told me to give it a month and come back if I was still having problems. After one Month the dizziness was pretty much gone, but I still was experiencing imbalance, headaches, and pressure.  Instead of getting dizzy I would get sharp shooting headaches that would last a couple of seconds.  I still had what felt like pressure behind my eye and ear.  I also still was unable to lay on my right side.  I visited ENT Dr. again and we decided to do an MRI with contrast.  The MRI came back negative.  We decided to start me on vestibular physical therapy. After 3 months I have gotten to the point where I do not feel imbalance every day.  I still will have days where I feel like I am leaning to the right, but those are getting less frequent.  I still occasionally get headaches, tightness, and fullness in the area.  I would say I am about 75 percent better. I feel what happened in my head is somehow the same reaction I had in my left arm.  I reported this reaction in a different report.  I would like to point out that both times these reactions occurred I drank alcohol the night before.

                                                Felt minor pain in arm at first, but it went away. Felt fine for at least two weeks. It&#39;s nearly time for my 2nd shot (coming up this Saturday) and for the past two or three days, my arm has been hurting at the injection site.  Pain was getting severe so I stretched (followed a 5 minute routine from a video), and now it is _very_ painful. Seems to have made it worse. I did the same routine in my other arm, but it feels fine.  The pain is very weird - I have no idea what muscle has the problem. I can lift my left arm above my head without any pain, and I can point it straight in front of me without any pain. I can carry something quite heavy without any pain at all. However, if I lean forward, there is some of the worst pain I have ever felt in my life at my upper forearm where I think I was injected. It has gotten worse the past day, and woke me up from sleep. It&#39;s uncomfortable / nearly impossible for me to lean over to pick something up, even from a table.  I have no bruises nor lumps or bumps from the vaccine though. Honestly I&#39;m really not sure if this is from the vaccine or from something else, but I have not lifted anything heavy (except grocery bags, yesterday), and have not stressed my arm in any weird way that the other arm hasn&#39;t been stressed (from stretching).  Am not sure if I should get the second shot at this point; am considering seeing my doctor, but so far have not contacted him about this. I&#39;m hoping it just goes away on its own.  Must stress that the pain I feel when leaning forward is some of the most intense pain I have ever felt - and I have had both eardrums rupture at once and passed out before. Must also again say that I still am not sure this is from the vaccine and it confuses me if it is because it has been 3 weeks (almost 4?) now since the 1st injection.

Symptoms could not recall the events during the 2-3 days of psychosis but his coworkers explained that he was acting very odd, shifting his weight, looking up and around without making much eye contact. He began repetitive behaviors such as saying he wants to finish the movie they were watching, continually repeating that phrase. After the movie, he began to tear up saying he wanted to get to the end of the movie even though the movie was over. Later on in the day his tone of voice changed from his normal tone and he became more talkative and beginning unusual conversations with anyone around him.  Later on after he was evaluated by medical, he wanted to be left alone outside on the ship. He denied any Suicidal ideation or homocidal ideation. They convinced him to come inside and was put on a one to one watch but became aggressive at one point as they tried to calm him down.

Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

This pain dissipated 48 hours after injection. Pain returned 6 days after injection, on Monday the 8th. Pain was in the lower portion of the left arm and in the calf muscle of left leg. In my opinion, this cannot be explained by any other physical activities.

                                                5-10 minutes after patient received vaccination he complained of feeling disoriented.  Patient was seated  approximately 6 feet in front of pharmacy counter and I went out to check on him.  Patient was sweating profusely and again complained of feeling disoriented.  I asked if he was feeling nauseous and he said no.  I placed a cold compress on the back of his neck and had him try to relax and breath evenly.   I then  got a ice pack for him and wrapped it in towels to protect the patient from the cold.  Offered patient some water which he denied.  Offered to call an ambulance and patient denied.  I took the patients blood pressure and it was 140/84. Patient states this is slightly higher than normal for him.  After 5 more minutes patient began to recover quickly.  Sweating stopped and his color returned to normal.  Patient stated he felt much better.  I took patients blood pressure again and it was 133/94.  Patient stayed under observation for another 15 minutes and said he felt fine and left the pharmacy.

Fever lasted from 9pm rapidly increasing to a highest measured temp (oral) of 102.9F for approximately 12 to 14 hours before gradually decreasing to under 100 roughly 36 hours after onset.  Tylenol did help slightly to control fever but did not seem to lower it.  Did nothing to reduce body aches.  Significant fatigue and soreness lasted approximately 3 days after dosage.

                                                Sinus pressure started the same night as the vaccine. The symptoms gradually worsened throughout the night. He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses. Then suddenly had a significant flow of blood from his RIGHT nostril. As of this evening he still has congestion in his sinuses, and intermittent tightness in his chest.

Approximately one week later, he developed mild, dull, diffuse chest pain and shortness of breath which has persisted since.   He was seen in clinic for chest pain and dyspnea on 15 Mar 2021. Patient noted his chest hurt ?all over? especially with deep or with normal inspiration. Reclining, laying down, and sleeping on his right side increased his pain (he did not trial sleeping on his left). Leaning forward decreased pain. He endorsed feeling short of breath, and stated he felt light headed twice while going up stairs, without passing out. He denied recent illnesses and other symptoms. He is a very physically fit Active Duty Marine, who has continued running despite his symptoms. During this encounter and later f/u encounter, he expressed he did not believe running made his symptoms significantly worse.  Vital signs were within normal range and he did not appear in distress. Cardiac and lung exam were normal, and no friction rub or murmur was appreciated. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, with HR consistent with his known, athletic-type normal variant heart rate. No other abnormalities were detected. Due to limited ancillary services within clinic, he was sent to USNHO ED for evaluation. There, he had basic labs (including Trop I) drawn, which were normal. EKG and portable chest xray were also unremarkable, and he was discharged with Motrin 800mg PO TID.  He was seen in clinic again 29 Mar 2021 for continued, unchanged symptoms, and reported he had been taking his Motrin only in the mornings and afternoons. Vital signs were unchanged (normal limits). Exam, including heart and lung, were normal. EKG again demonstrated sinus bradycardia, consistent with his normal resting heart rate. He was started on empiric therapy for pericarditis. He was released from clinic and will follow up in several weeks.

                                                Muscle cramping below sternum into the back around 1:00 AM in 3/20/21. The pain made me restless and never stopped, like a permanent cramp. Attempting a foam roller to stretch my muscle and release some pin to no luck. I considered going to the ER because of the pain not subsiding.   Around 2:30 AM I started throwing up, which lasted off an on for about a hour.   I returned to bed around 3:30 AM with the muscle tightness still happening. Around 4:00 I began having chills and my muscle started to relax. By 5:00 AM I was sleeping. No ongoing effective expect fatigue, and my throat was sore from throwing up.

Pain, Bloating, Feeling of extreme fullness, Nausea, constant gurgling of the stomach.  This lasted for approximately ~ 2 weeks.  These symptoms have not fully resolved but have improved 85-90%. Day 3-current: Twitching and muscle spasms began in the arm that I got the shot in.  Shoulder, bicep, and into the forearm were CONTINUOUSLY twitching all day long.  Sleep became difficult for a period of a few days due to this.   This muscle twitching then began to occur in all other parts of the body.  Eye lids, arms, legs, torso.  Everywhere.  The rate of the twitches at worst was approximately 30 twitches per minute bouncing around from one area of the body to another.  I am currently 3 weeks post vaccination and although I have seen significant improvement in the twitching, I am still currently experience this symptom.

                                                Within one minute of receiving the shot I felt disoriented and had trouble determining if I had buttoned my shirt correctly. For the next two and half hours I had trouble recalling basic things that I should have been observing such as which highway my driver had taken me home on although I knew where I was at.   I also experienced irregular breathing. To be specific, I would take a very large breath, a very short breath, or miss a breath. This started as a series of one to three irregular breaths every five minutes or so. My breaths became more irregular in the next hour. While driving to my employers office about fifteen or twenty minutes after my shot, my right eye closed and I could not open it for about seven seconds. My breathing also became deep and the pace was not under my control. Once at the office I sat in my manager&#39;s office to be observed. I experienced more intense episodes of the above listed symptoms such as both eyes closing and the left one watering. The watering continued into the next day periodically. At least two times while my eyes closed I had to put my elbow on the desk and my hand on my head to make sure I didn&#39;t fall out of the chair. I also felt very uncomfortable causing me to moan. This happened one time.   After this my manager called my parents and they came to take me home. It took them one hour to get there. While waiting I felt light headed and the breathing irregularities became less intense. When they got there I mainly felt disoriented. The disorientation could be best described as slightly impaired or slowed decision making.   I would also like to know if I should receive the second vaccination.

I had to lay down for about 5 minutes before I started feeling any sort of normal.  Just about everyday since the Shot I have had a a high pitched ringing that comes and goes and a sever migraine that does not change if I take any medication (Advil). the only way to feel better is to sleep. yesterday was the worst yet.  when I contacted my pharmacist that administered the vaccine they informed me that they did not report my initial side effects and only after I called today were they going to report them.

The patient began getting lightheaded and hot, his color went out of him and his eyes began rolling back in his head.  His eyelids turned a purple color and he appeared to momentarily stop breathing.  Myself and another pharmacist got him on the ground and supported his head with a coat.  When he &#34;came to&#34; and was talking to us.  He described feeling better on the cold floor and his color began coming back.   I was speaking with him the entire time.  While we were out with his 9-1-1 was called and paramedics arrived 15 min later.  by the time paramedics had arrived the patient had gotten up and back into the chair himself, was lucid and had color back in his face.  Paramedics arrived and took over.  He was given the green light from them and remained in the pharmacy area for a total of about 30 minutes before heading home. The patient was admittedly nervous for the shot and had not eaten or had anything to drink the whole day to that point. I believe he passed out from a variety of factors not related to the actual ingredients in the vaccine but cannot confirm this.

                                                Two days after receiving the vaccine, it triggered acid reflux for me which was previously under control. Since getting the first vaccine, this symptom has not gone away. I have chronic burping, throat irritation, and a gurgling sensation in my throat.

                                                I believe I experienced multiple symptoms as a result of my vaccine. My experience matches exactly as described in the article.  ON 4/1/21 at approximately 4pm I awoke from a nap experiencing acute vertigo, nausea and headache. I also was experiencing fever and chills. I began treating with excedrine but did not have an effect. The vertigo was very acute, my eyes were skipping and I was unable to walk. Nause was so intense that any attempt to leave my bed resulted in vomiting. I was unable to eat and could barely drink for the first 24 hours. Friday 4/2 at approx 7pm I took a dose of Promethazine which began to help the nausea. Extreme headache/migraine lasted for 3 days. During this time I also experienced extreme neck pain, as well as pain near base of skull, behind my ears, and on my temples. Symptoms were steadily improving each day, so I did not seek medical care during this time. I feel I became fully recovered by 4/18. I just had my second vaccine dose on 4/21 and I am very nervous about experiencing a relapse of symptoms.

                                                First I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to light, I was also feeling light headed and dizzy on my walk back to the car. (about 30 minutes after injection). I had someone else drive because I felt like I could not drive in my condition. On the ride home, about 40 minutes after injection, I began to have an increased heart rate and had a hard time swallowing. It was also slightly difficult to breathe. I felt like my head was cloudy and I had a hard time concentrating. I felt like my brain was responding about a half a second slower to what I saw. Like if I wanted to turn my head, I would think try to turn my head and my body would react a second later. When I got home, about 1 hour after the injection, my girlfriend told me my hands were freezing cold. I was also having a hard time walking in straight because I was so dizzy. I was still having some minor trouble breathing and swallowing. It was difficult to drink water. After about 2 hours my breathing returned to normal. My mind was cloudy all day, I felt like I was drunk.  On the second day, I woke up with an intense headache. It lasted for 3 days. My arm started to hurt on the second day as well, no pain at all the first day. My head was still cloudy and I had difficulty trying to recall memories or answer questions. By the third day this was basically gone. I was extremely tired for three days total. My mind remain cloudy for about a week.

                                                Patient received his vaccine around 9:30AM. Felt fine in 15 min. observation area. Returned to work and began feeling &#34;tingling and numbness in my legs, pressure in my head, ringing in my ears, my arms got heavy and it was hard to move, I had trouble using the phone so told coworker to get his boss&#34; He stated, &#34;I was slouching in my chair, sliding out of it, and my eyesight was blurry&#34;. Nurse was summoned and laid him flat w/feet elevated. He ate a &#34;few donuts and peanut butter crackers after his shot&#34;. He felt better when lying flat but as soon as he sat up, symptoms returned three times. BP-142/88 initially, then rose to 149/106, Pulse-92 10 min. later. On third attempt to sit up, BP 153/99. Patient says his BP has never been above 128/84 and that he just had his annual physical two weeks prior and it was good. EMTs were called since symptoms kept coming back. BP was 170/100s. Was transported to Hospital. He said they did a &#34;brain test&#34; having him touch his nose w/his finger, slid heels down shins, etc. but no other testing was done.&#34; He was discharged to home around 3PM and was told &#34;he had an anxiety attack&#34;. He said they never really asked him what happened. Later that evening at 9:30PM, symptoms returned and he had to lie down. He had &#34;pressure in his head, ringing in ears, and couldn&#39;t get up.&#34; Wife called EMTs. His vision was blurry. BP 150/110 upon exertion (movement) and 138/103 at rest, Pulse btw 105-110. He refused going back to hospital since they did nothing the 1st time. I spoke with him Monday morning and he had seen his Dr. She put him on a Beta blocker still his BP was still elevated. He still feels &#34;cotton headed, muddled, w/constant ringing in ears.&#34; Did not go to work on Monday. Felt frustrated that ER &#34;blew it off and said it was anxiety, which he said he was not feeling anxious until his symptoms began and would not go away&#34;.

                                                I got the shot around 3:15PM on Monday 4/26/21. Woke up Tuesday 4/27/21 with a minor headache and just felt out of sorts. Around noon that day I had a seizure at work and was rushed to the ER. While at the hospital waiting for a room to open up, I had another seizure. This one was much worse than the first. They had to intubate me and I spent 5 nights in the ICU. Another 3 on the Neurology floor for observation. The seizures caused Rhabdomyolysis which caused damage to my kidneys and significant muscle loss/damage. I wasn&#39;t able to walk at all for 3 days. After that I started to be able to get up out of bed and move around a little more each day.

In my previous 4 years of working, I&#39;ve only missed a less than a 1 handful of days of work due to health conditions, but suddenly after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine, I&#39;ve had a myriad of what I initially thought were heart attacks where I was unable to drive to work (had to pull over twice on the road due to serious risk of being in an accident / having unprovoked panic attacks the morning of  4/19/21 and 5/8/21).  Had extreme SOB and could seriously considered calling 911 on all 3 of my first episodes.  Went to Urgent Care on 5/10/21, and have had several phone visits with my primary care physician since then and was placed on medical leave until 5/22/21, although I still am experience some side effects even today.

                                                Received second dose of Moderna COVID 19 vaccine at 10AM Thursday 05/20.  T&#43;12-18hrs: Feeling flushed. Slightly confused. Body aches build over the night. Wake up with mild/moderate pain in back, knees, arm. Groggy. Went to work on something with a friend at 10:00 AM (T&#43;24Hrs), but had to return home because....  T&#43;24hr: ....headache growing. Went home and found fever at 102°.  Slight chills, bit mainly just heat without sweating. Fever hit 103.2 at peak. Went through 10lbs ice to keep the fever in check. Headache from T24hr-T36HR feels like a spike through the top of frontal lobe to my left eye.  T&#43;32hr: Headache still intense. Only back pain now. Appetite slowly increasing.  T&#43;48hr (Saturday morning). Back pain persists, but mild. Headache gone. Have a relatively normal day.  T&#43;60hrs (Sat. Afternoon): Back pain increasing. Stop all unnecessary lifting/moving.  T&#43;68hrs (early Sunday morning): Go to ER with the back pain. Absolutely excruciating spasms from top of sacrum - roughly LI/12T. Lower back stiff as wood. Given shot or Toradol, dose/prescription to flexiril. I specifically request this plan because usually takes care of the spasms; basically, get me able to move and the pain/spasms will go away.   NOTE: I have a history of back issues in this area, but I have not had an episode in years and certainly never had an episode that works like this with no relief. From about 2017-2019, I r  T&#43;70-78hrs: Feel normal.  T &#43; 78-88hrs: lower back pain comes back with an absolute vengeance.  T&#43;90hrs (early Monday morning): Return to ER. Back pain worse than Sunday morning. Receive toradol shot and prescription Prednisone. Back pain gone by around 10:30 AM. Decide to take prednisone Tuesday morning as its getting a bit late in the day by the time pharmacy fills the prescription.   T&#43;90hrs: Back pain returns in similar fashion as Sunday afternoon. Still. Barely mobile.   T&#43;96 hours: Wake up with lower back pain similar to Sunday/Monday morning. Took prednisone and flexiril this morning.   Please help me.

                                                The day after the shot, I had the expected fever. The following day, I began to have hand pain and weakness. This continued and seemed likely to be a flare of Sjogren&#39;s, significantly more severe than any symptoms I had previously experienced. After a couple of weeks, my rheumatologist tried me on a pack of methylprednisolone which helped while I was taking them but symptoms rebounded as soon as I finished the pack. This seems like it is not directly related to the vaccine&#39;s action, but the timing makes me think it prompted my immune system to get carried away even after it finished the response to the vaccine. We are continuing to investigate treatment, but in the meantime, I am having to get help for things requiring gripping and I am limited in my ability to type and thus work, so I am also having to look at speech-to-text programs.

A several days passed and the twitching moved to other parts of my body.  Here it is June 9th and the twitching still continues. I saw a Neurologist, Dr. and he ran additional tests to check for any muscular issues - everything came back normal.

Pain is elicited on palpation (no induration felt today) and with certain movements (lifting of arm and abduction).  He relates this specifically to the vaccine administration site.  He said that he had only experienced soreness at the administration sites immediately following the vaccinations until now.  He also has had numbness involving what appears to be the medial nerve (just one time in last week) and strange sensation down at the elbow/AC area.  Advised to F/U with PCP from health system return to work coordinator if employee feels he needs medical treatment .  This was communicated to employee and it is unknown at this time if employee has sought medical care.

                                                This morning when I woke up I had a slight headache on the back of my right side. I felt a wave within and my heart rate rose. I was really hungry and ate 3 or 4 bananas. I started to feel uneasy and felt tightness in my chest and pain below the injection site. My heart rate rose into the 100s. Normal RHR= 47-55. I was burping small burps. I was worried and started looking up ERs and contacting family. This event of immense amount tightness and uneasy feeling that lasted about 30-45. Temp was 99.4 then dropped to normal. I thought I was having a heart attack. I called my sister and my symptoms waned. I have had several &#34;cycles&#34; though out the day of feeling very uneasy and slight chest discomfort, but nothing on the level of this morning, or enough to make me go to the ER. It does seem that why I lay down or bend over when sitting down there is discomfort in my chest and I feel uneasy.

                                                Immediately after administration of vaccine as we were discussing scheduling an appointment for his second dose in 28 days, patient&#39;s fainted. He was sitting in a chair and slumped over. I caught him and was able to get him to floor in lying position while having my technician call emergency number. Patient came to in a couple of minutes and seemed a little disoriented. We got him a bottle of water and a cold rag for his face. He was clammy and sweating. When EMT arrived, they checked him out and cleared him to leave on his own.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

                                                Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine EUA Approximately 3 hours after vaccine, shoulder pain began to develop. Pain became significant, waking me in the middle of the night. The following day, I was unable to lift the arm I received the injection in no higher than about 80 degrees from my side. Pain increased despite taking OTC NSAIDS. By the second morning after vaccine administration, pain had worsened and right arm cannot be raised more than about 60 degrees without significant pain. Contacted PCP office about 12 hours after injection, they recommended NSAID dosages alternating ibuprofen and tylenol, and icing the shoulder. Pain impacts daily life activities, including caring for small children , lifting items that weigh more than a few pounds by the impacted arm, and significant difficulty reaching any object above the level of the shoulder. I have never previously experienced this kind of reaction to any other upper arm injection or vaccination.

Then still chills and insomnia. Fever that persisted over the next 36 hours. Responded well to Ibuprofen 400mg for 4.5 hours until symptoms returned. Began alternating with Acetominophen 650mg for better effect. Fever was highest (recorded) at 102.2 F 29 hours after injection. Woke up 40 hours from vaccine after a night of sleep and with reduced fever. Still going up and down a bit off any medication. Last reading 46 hours from vaccine 100.6, but two hours earlier was 99.4. I?ve also had nausea, exhaustion, and tiredness. Also cold symptoms which may be related to the slight cold I had the morning of the vaccination that I didn?t think was anything to worry about - my kid is in daycare and I feel like this for a large part of the winter!

                                                patient received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. After receiving in our immunization room, he left the room and then shortly walked over to the pharmacy in-window and told the pharmacy tech that he did not feel well and felt dizzy. Tech had him go sit down in the waiting room and went and got the nurse, who went out to check on patient. Patient was slumped in the waiting room chair with eyes closed and very sweaty. Patient said he wanted water, so staff quickly got him water. After a few sips, patient&#39;s head rolled back and he lost consciousness for roughly 10 seconds before waking up startled and confused. Ambulance was already called and when the arrived they triaged the patient for around 15 minutes. After about 15 minutes the patient seemed much better and the paramedics decided it was OK for him to leave and drive himself home.

                                                Patient had dark circles under their eyes and did discuss at the drop off window they had a needle phobia. Immediately after the immunization, he said he felt lightheaded. I, pharmacist, sat in the booth and talked to him for a couple minutes then asked if he felt he could finish his observation outside the booth.  I notified technician to hand him off to her for observation , sharing by observation that the patient did not look well but he said he was doing a little better. He said he felt better and he did wait in the chairs outside the immunization booth. While I was in the pharmacy discussing this information with my pharmacy technician when I heard yelling and I stepped back out of the pharmacy to observe the patient was sliding out of his chair, stiff straight. My other technician came to my assistance and we both tried to get him to the floor and he was making incoherent noises and his arm was bent behind him and not relaxing to where we could get him to the floor. He then came to and startled a bit, with a bewildered look on his face. He asked what happened and said he felt he was dreaming.  A witness waiting on her prescriptions for pickup said that it originally appeared he was having a seizure which was my concern as well. We called code white and 911 and store manager assisted us at the scene. Patient denied the ambulance.

It started out as pain at the injection site with extremely bad dizziness that has gotten worse each day. On day 4 after the injection I noticed a full pain in my left thumb area. The same side as the injection. I didn&#39;t think anything of it but as the hour&#39;s and days went by it continued and continues to get worse. The best way I could explain it is it feels like when your hand falls asleep without the pins and needles. Yesterday I ended up having to go to the ER. My issue with my left thumb area started to get much worse. I couldn&#39;t hold things in my left hand and started to radiate up my arm. It was the weirdest feeling I can&#39;t really explain it other than being slightly numb and very week. I wasn&#39;t able to move my hand much at all. They gave me a cat scan but they never called me back to be seen or to give me my results. I was there for 8 hours and was never called back to be seen. I had to leave this morning before I was seen because I didn&#39;t have anyone to watch son. Today is 8 days since I received my first covid shot and I still have major fatigue along with dizziness. I will start sweating profusely out of nowhere and then stops.  I&#39;ve had a numb/metallic taste in my mouth for about 4-5 days as well. I feel like I&#39;m in a complete fog and can&#39;t shake this feeling. I&#39;m having trouble concentrating and remembering things. I&#39;m drinking lots of water and trying to rest when I can but I&#39;m still feeling terrible with no signs of this getting better. My doctor suggested I report this to you and I&#39;m hoping and praying this goes away. Is there anything I can do or a specialist I could see? Thank you so much in advance.

                                                Around 7 PM on Tuesday, I began to feel fatigued. My abdomen became slightly tender. My arm was sore in the injection site, but that was nothing that I did not expect. As the night went on, I began to feel worse. I developed chills? And became feverish. I did take my temperature and it was 99.5° at one point. I took acetaminophen to help with the fever and bodyaches. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen seem to stem the fever symptoms. The highest my fever has ever been since Tuesday was 100.1°.  When I have a fever I do become congested. So I have not thought anything about congestion as I do develop congestion when I chill. I did develop a muted sense of smell and taste. I can still taste what I am eating and drinking.  My biggest concern is that I would love for my fever to go away. It is making me incredibly fatigued.

                                                Within five minutes of the vaccination, the patient expressed distress.  Patient was slumped over in his seat, extremely labored breathing and his eyes were rolling to the back of his head.  The Pharmacist spoke to the patient to see how he was feeling but he wasn&#39;t very responsive so we administered an Epipen and immediaetly called 911.  The paramedics came at around 6:20pm and checked the patients vitals. EMT said the patients vitals were normal and have the patient the option to go to the ER.  Patient was alert and able to drink water.   Patient refused hospitalization.  We advised the patient to go directly to the emergency room if he was developing any symptoms once home and to follow up with his primary care provider.

                                                My left arm was sore about 2-3 hours after the shot. Later that evening, my arm was worse and I could not lift my arm up past my chest. Around about 11:00 p.m., I began to feel chills, aches and pains. I was sluggish, tired and had no energy. The next day when I woke-up around 10:00 a.m., I still had the aches and pains, all the way down to the bottoms of my feet. My body hurt to stand. The aches and pains continued that evening, along with diaherra and chest pains. The pains continued through Saturday and the chest pains got worse. The pain would radiate from my chest to my left arm, to my left shoulder, and into my back between my shoulder blades. Then by 7:00 p.m. or so on Saturday, my chest started to feel better and my aches and pains were not as bad. I was then woken up around 12:00 a.m. or so, on Saturday/Sunday with severe chest pains again with the radiation of pain. This also came along with the aches and pains and diahrrea. This has continued through to today, Monday. I tried to do simple putting my dishes away and loading up my dishwasher, and couldn&#39;t complete the task due to the chest pain and severe aches and pains all over my body. I have tried to treat the symptoms with over-the-counter medications which would include: Advil II, Pepto Bismal, Alka-Seltzer, hot showers, hot baths, luke warm baths, vapor bath soaks and a heating pad.

My fever seemed to break in the middle of the night between Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday morning, I woke up feeling nearly 100%.

                                                On first injection, after about 7 hours I started feeling extremely lethargic, next day was 103 degree fever which lasted around 5 days with chronic diarrhea, and then a futher 7 days with 100&#43; degree fever that was not reduced further by OTC treatments. Weakness continued for 10 days, followed by insomnia (2 hours of sleep or less per night) with the ability to fall asleep, but no ability to stay asleep. And lack of appitite, eating around 50% less food than was before the vaccine. 3 weeks after initial injection, PCP recommended Trazodone, which improved the sleep function to about 4-6 hours per night, but not the usual 8, has not improved food intake very much.  6 weeks later, ability to eat and sleep normally has not returned. No other symptoms other than lethargia from caloric deficit.

                                                Approximately five minutes after shot, my face began to tingle. My heart felt like it was racing. I had difficulty focusing with my eyes, it felt like my eyes were rolling.  My feet began to tingle. My spouse honked the car horn for assistance. I reached for my epi pen but did not administer it because a doctor was approaching our car. I checked my pulse rate on my iWatch, it was 168.  My throat began to feel tight. The doctor listened to my lungs and heard wheezing. A paramedic came over as well. My blood pressure was taken but I do not remember what my blood pressure was.  At that point the doctor said I should use my epi pen. The paramedic said I should use Benadryl. They were in disagreement, and the paramedic said I should take 50mg of Benadryl and had me put my car seat in recline position.  It was at the point they noticed that my face and chest were flushed.  They had me drink water.  We waited about 45 minutes. My lungs were checked again by the paramedic and I was told my lungs were clear, my blood pressure was taken second time but I do not remember my blood pressure, my face was less flush,  my pulse was in the 70?s.  I still felt tingling on my scalp and feet, my throat felt like it had a lump in it.  I Began to feel nauseous.  I was given the okay to leave and go home.  I had nausea until the evening the next day.  I did not eat until dinner time the night after my shot.  I only drank water.  The next day I experienced shortness of breath performing  duties that typically do not make me out of breath.  I had to take many breaks and used my abuterol inhaler two times.

These symptoms lasted for approx. 8 hours, between 11:00 PM and 7 AM:  extreme weakness (unable to get out of bed; difficulty rolling over); extreme cold and shivering; profuse sweating; delusions between dreams; inability to sleep; severe muscle pain (every movement hurt, like a wore brush being run across whatever muscle moved).  Anxiety and panic attacks because I did not know that the side-effects could be so severe until talking to others who had similar experiences today. Those who I&#39;ve talked to prior to today had some reactions, but such bad ones. The side effects on the fact sheet are not described in terms that made me think these would be mild. However, mine last night were worse than any other illness I&#39;ve had in my life. Not having the strength to move and at the same time feeling as though I was freezing to death with lying in a puddle of sweat brought on a lot of fear--I felt sure I would not make it through the night, and could not even reach the phone to call anyone, which made it more terrifying.  After 7 AM today, falling asleep during work; sweating and chills; muscles ache and pain; exhaustion after performing simple tasks (making tea, eating cereal, etc.); fever between 100 and 102 degrees, fluctuating throughout day.

                                                Fatigue and arm pain same day following shot (Monday 1:15pm). Next morning (Tuesday) fatigue rapidly progressed to fever and chills. Chills became increasingly intense around 10am-noon, had to bundle up and lay down, could not move, work, or do anything productive. Chills, fever, headache, muscle aches became so bad they were totally incapacitating from about noon to 3PM, probably would have made my spouse drive me to the ER if I wasn&#39;t expecting some sort of vaccine reaction like this. However, just as suddenly as these intense flu-like symptoms came on, they began to recede. Fever broke around 3PM, began to feel better, and by about 7PM I was feeling mostly normal, just tired &#43; a headache. Next three days (Weds, Thurs, and Fri) felt a little fatigue and difficulty concentrating, nothing too terrible. But the flu symptoms the day after the injection were intense! and weirdly short-lived.

                                                Patient arrived for 2nd Moderna vaccine today 5/30/21. He explained that he sometimes becomes faint or passes out after having blood drawn. Inquired as to whether patient had eaten this morning and he stated that he had. Advised patient we would have him stay in the pharmacy area longer just to ensure that he didn&#39;t have any ill effects from the vaccine before returning home. Within a few seconds of receiving the vaccine, patient stated that he was &#34;starting to feel it&#34;. At that point, rather than have him move to the recovery area, I decided to keep him in the IMZ booth and told him &#34;I&#39;m going to just keep you in here and we will talk for a while&#34;. Upon asking patient what his plans for the day were, he became mildly disoriented and I held his shoulders to ensure that he didn&#39;t fall from the chair. He temporarily lost consciousness (10-15 seconds) while still seated in the chair. Upon regaining consciousness, he was alert and responsive and did not show any ill effects aside from feeling warm. I had patient sit on the floor and placed ice packs on back of his neck and gave him another to place on his forehead and chest. Patient sat and spoke with me for appx 25 more minutes before leaving the area with his wife.

Within 2 hours of shot swelling of left neck lymph node, which subsided in less than 4 hours.  Within 2 hours general itchiness felt on the skin with no visible skin reaction, subsided within 24 hours.  Within 2 hours feeling of drunkenness with no alcohol consumption.  According to my wife, I was even acting drunk.  General fatigue for up to 2-4 weeks; however, persistent fatigue measured over two shots is hard to determine.

For the past 7 months, if I do any sort of physical activity or get excited, I get a very debilitating brain fog and headache.  It?s adversely effecting my work and can be dangerous at times.  I?ve had to pull my car off the road on several occasions because the symptoms were so severe.  I?m learning how to cope with the triggers but has definitely decreased my quality of life.  I?m unable to exercise and have to be very careful when doing household chores.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

                                                I was given the injection on 01/27/2021 in the left arm at approximately 08:30 am. At around 08:00 pm I started to get really cold and had the worst case of the chills I have ever had. I was shaking so hard my body hurt. At around 10:30 pm I went to bend and started to get a low fever of about 101.4* and could not get warm. I started to get a bad headache and my body hurt. It was so bad I had to call in sick the next day for work. On 01/28/2021 I stayed home and had sever body aches, bad headache, the chills and I felt nauseas. From my left hip to my left knee it felt like I had a bad charley horse. That night I got another low grade fever of about 100.1*. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and still had a headache. I took some Aleve and went back to sleep. I called in sick again the next day and that day I was a little better only had a headache, a little nauseas and body was only a little sore. I went to bed and am fine today. A note I have never tested positive to COVID-19 and I test weekly.

The following day about 20 hours post injection I felt chills and tiredness. About 25 hours post injection I felt extreme fatigue and my whole body ached (this lasted for about 1 day). On day 3 post injection, I had a headache with nausea and motion sickness. Day 4 and beyond I have felt fine, no more symptoms of any sort. Chills were not treated. Body aches and headache were treated with ibuprofen and sleep.

                                                About 12 hours after the 2nd dose was given, I woke up at 2:30am with a severe headache, uncontrollable chills, muscular discomfort, soreness at the injection site, and fatigue.  I took 2 Tylenol, the chills subsided about 15 minutes after they began, and the headache was better about 30 minutes after taking the Tylenol.  I was in and out of sleep on the couch until around 6am, and I took my temperature at that time.  It was 102 degrees.  I took a couple more Tylenol at 7am and contained to take 2 every 4 hours (last dose around 6pm that night).  My temperature reduced gradually, but it was still over 101 degrees around noon.  By 6-7pm my fever was gone and didn&#39;t return.  I called out of work sick, and I fell back asleep in bed from 8am-11:30am.  I woke up with significant muscle pain in my left theigh (I sleep on my left side, but the pain was much more pronounced than usual).  This lasted 3-4 hours.  Overall, less acute muscle soreness lasted the full length of pronounced reactivity (~2:30am to ~6:30pm on 02/09).  Fatigue was evident until a went to bed around 11:30pm and not noted when I woke up at 6:30am on 02/10 for work.  Soreness at the injection site (left arm) gradually decreased over about 3 days following the injection, but it never impaired my ability to engage in everyday tasks.

I moved on to the next two cars and on the third car and about three minutes after his female partener called out for help and said that the Pt. passed out. Thats when the other nurse ran to the car to check on him and told me he was having a seizure. I ran to the lead to explain what happend and to call the medical team right away. The other nure was stablizing the patient. The patient was going in and out of consciousness for about ten seconds. The medical team arrived and took vitals.

                                                I began experiencing a high pitched, singular buzzing in my ears the morning after I received the vaccination. It initially started as an intermittent noise that came and went throughout the day.  Unfortunately, the sound level and length of buzzing both increased as the days passed. By Saturday, March 20th, the buzzing was loud and continuous and was affecting my ability to carry out day to day activities. Now. on March 23rd, I hear the buzz whenever I&#39;m awake. It&#39;s now accompanied by a headache that usually begins in the early afternoon. I haven&#39;t been able to find any respite or cure for the noise, and have been taking Tylenol to help the headache and using a white noise machine to help sleep. I&#39;m very, very hesitant to receive the second dose if the ringing may further worsen.

                                                I was unable to sleeep most of the night. I was kept awake by being very restless and could not hold still or get comfortable. I was tossing and turning between 11:00 PM and 5:00 AM when I finally got up. This feeling lasted until about 8;00 AM. I do not have a history of this condition at all and usually sleep very well.

                                                On March 24, 2021, the day of the shot, I only felt soreness in my left arm. The next morning, March 25, 2021, I began to feel body aches, chills, and I was in a cold sweat. I took ibuprofen throughout the day to combat the symptoms. The evening of March 25, 2021, the pain was much more severe (body aches all over my body, including my face, teeth, my hands were sore and stiff, etc.). I did not sleep much of the night because the symptoms were very uncomfortable due to the chills and cold sweats. The morning of March 26, 2021, my left armpit began to swell. By the afternoon, my left armpit (the arm where I received the vaccine) was swollen, tender, and soft. There is some redness and the swelling and tenderness are more pervasive. It is difficult to hang my arm at my side due to the pain and swelling. I understand, after calling the nurse hotline, that this is a common side effect but I also have a skin condition (Hidradenitis Supparativa) and it is difficult to know whether flare-ups are triggered by environmental factors.

                                                At 0100, approximately 12hrs after receiving round two of the series, I started shivering uncontrollably. I would characterize this more as spasms than chills. I experienced steady dull muscle ache with occasional sharp jolts of pain, especially in my extremities. My joints began to ache severely and I was unable to sleep.  I registered a fever of 100.3 (my normal temperature is ~97.5). Additionally, I experienced nausea and a moderate headache. I shivered most of the evening and finally got out of bed at 0700. I immediately noticed that I was lethargic and fatigued. My doctor recommended I take 1000mg Tylenol to address the symptoms. This was effective, but only for two hours. After that my symptoms returned - most notably the fever and uncontrollable shivering. Symptoms appear to be declining at this point, approximately 31 hours after injection.

                                                After the fifteen minute observation time. My left hand where my arm was injected became tingling and numb.   Ever since then my arm has been a numb feeling. After the second vaccine both sides of my cheeks get this numb tingling feeling. Like muscle weakness. Both arms now feel week and a numbing twisting feeling. I?ve never had this feeling before and feeling like I can?t grip. The feeling is like the arm was slept on. Or fingers being pulled backwards. The facial problem is quite concerning and happens anytime during the day.

                                                On Friday, April 2nd, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine.  Within minutes, my heart started racing and I felt faint.  Thereafter, my hands and face got the sensation of tingling.  It felt like ice was running through my veins.  My heart stopped racing approximately fifteen or so minutes after it began.  The tingling sensation in my hands and face ended approximately one hour later.  I also noticed a strange taste in my mouth during this same timeframe.  Subsequently, I had the sensation of being dizzy and lightheaded.  Importantly, I have never reacted to a vaccine in this manner.  On Saturday, April 3rd, I woke up with symptoms that were to be expected.  My arm was very sore and I felt a little achy.  However, I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded.    That evening and for the next week or so, my heart was beating rapidly, and my blood pressure was elevated.  I also had the continuous feeling of my skin crawling.  My hands and feet also seemed to be experiencing tremors and twitching.    On Sunday, April 4th, I woke up and noticed that my right eye seemed a little blurry as I read an article on my phone.  I assumed I must have slept on my eye wrong and did not pay it much attention.  I do not recall my eye being blurry for the rest of the day.  The following morning on Monday, April 5th, I woke up once again feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  As I walked to the restroom, I noticed that my right eye was blurry again.  This time it seemed to be more pronounced.  Moreover, when I closed my right eye, I could see hundreds of dots in different colors.  In addition to having blurry vision, my legs felt weak and nearly buckled as I walked.  I felt like I was intoxicated.  Upon returning to bed, my teeth began chattering and I felt like I was freezing.  I called my doctor?s office and spoke with a PA who recommended that I go to the ER.    While I checked in at the ER, I could not remember my ZIP code.  I felt like my brain was not running on all cylinders.  Upon explaining my symptomology to the ER doctor, she recommended that I have my blood drawn and that I get an MRI to rule out a stroke.  All test results came back normal.    On Wednesday, April 7th, I made an appointment with an allergist.  They tested me to see if I was allergic to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and Polysorbate 80.  For the skin scratch portion of the test, neither of the substances had much of a reaction on my skin.  I thought the Polysorbate 80 scratch had a little bit of redness to it, but it was negligible.  When the doctor injected Polysorbate 80 under my skin with a syringe, a welt formed.  I am not sure why, but PEG was not injected in the same manner.  As a result of the test, the allergist confirmed that I am allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He mentioned that there may be instances of cross reactivity to PEG for individuals that are allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He recommended that I not get the second Moderna dose unless it was administered in a controlled setting.    On Sunday April 11th, I noticed what felt like a hard vein in my abdominal fat.  It felt slightly tender to the touch.  I was fearful that it could be a clot.  On Tuesday, April 13th, I woke up and as a I stood in the shower, my foot was painful to stand on.  On top of my right foot near my ankle, I could visibly see red inflammation in a vein.  I massaged the vein and the redness and pain dissipated.  Being fearful that I did have blood clots, I scheduled an appointment with a PA at my doctor?s office that same day.  We discussed my ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and me being fearful of blood clots.  She had an EKG performed at the office and ordered a barrage of blood tests.  Everything continued to be normal.    On Sunday, April 18th, I again went to the ER, because the hard vein in my stomach became larger and more tender to the touch.  When I bent over, it felt like there was a lot of pressure emanating from the hard vein down to my groin.  Once again, blood was drawn and everything was normal.  I also had an ultrasound performed on the area that felt like a hard vein and the doctor concluded that it was most likely swollen lymph nodes.  I was diagnosed with lymphadenopathy.    On Monday, April 26th, I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to discuss the ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and pain in my stomach and groin area.  He told me that he had seen other patients that were experiencing similar symptoms and that my immune system was possibly overreacting to the vaccine.  He told me the symptoms should go away in time.  He also ordered a new blood test to check for clots.  The D-Dimer test came back normal.    On Tuesday, April 27th, I experienced a painful genital herpes outbreak.  I normally get one every year.  I had just recovered from an infection in December of 2020.  This outbreak was more intense and for the first time I had nerve pain that wrapped around my hip and down my inner thigh.  As of a week later, the infection is almost gone.      Today is May 4th, and I am still experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness.  Some days are better than others and every time I get optimistic that my dizziness and lightheadedness is finally gone, it reappears.  Being an IT consultant business owner and an attorney, I need to think clearly for my profession.  The side effects from the Moderna vaccine have made it very difficult to function.  I would like to get fully vaccinated, but I am fearful of getting the second shot.  I do not want the vaccine to cause permanent neurological damage or worse.    Finally, I am sure your organization is aware, but there are many other people experiencing the same symptoms as me.

We were able to wake him up and administer glucose tabs to him.  After one tablet, he was still incoherent but responsive.  After two tablets, he was becoming more coherent.  After the administration of a third tablet, he regained coherence.  At this time EMT&#39;s arrived.  He recorded a normal blood sugar.

                                                3 weeks after initial dose (4/23/2021), I started experiencing dizziness and a constant mild headache. With the dizziness, there was no visual perception of moving or spinning objects and no proprioception problems. The dizziness is more like a sense of being unsteady and an inability to maintain balance. The feeling has never gone away and persists in any position. On different occasions, many times per hour, there is a sweeping feeling that is never in a persistent direction. On the first day of symptoms, the headache was moderate with a feeling of facial puffiness with an elevated blood pressure near hypertensive crisis levels... which was on a Sunday. The following Wednesday morning, I visited the Emergency room at 0034 EST 5/19/2021 because the dizziness was not getting better. A review of systems was performed with no abnormal results. EKG was normal. Cranial CT scan showed no indications of stroke either although I have not looked at it myself yet.  Blood sugar level was at 90. Chem12 test was normal.  Well for more details, please contact me. Session is about to time out and I don&#39;t know how to extend it on my phone.  I have tried vestibular therapy motions. None improved the dizziness. I also have intermittent fog and below normal focus capacity.

After getting the 2nd dose, I got sick the same way as the first dose. I was very cold and very weak. Thursday and Friday I&#39;m very sick. I felt fine Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, my right arm swelled up so much that it couldn&#39;t handle it&#39;s own weight. The pain got really bad and I had to go back to the dr. I get naproxen sodium to take with Tylenol. Thankfully that worked. My arm still didn&#39;t work until later that Tuesday evening. I would not have been able to make it to the Dr. if I had to drive myself. The doctor called it Moderna arm and said it was something he has seen a lot of. Here is when I find out that something is not right. My mind starts getting trouble. If we went through the same thing in the winter, my heater would not be able to keep the house warm enough. I hear about the booster and I just know I can&#39;t handle it. I am not sure what to do about that.

He received COVID-19 vaccine on 1/13/2021 and immediately developed numbness and tingling in the area of injection which was the left shoulder.  Over the next 15 to 30 minutes numbness and tingling expanded to the left side of his body including face arm and leg and the left side of his trunk.  He began to feel foggy and had some slurred speech.  He presented to the Emergency Room and tests were performed to rule out a stroke.  The patient denies any other symptoms such as fever chills myalgias.  He did not have any weakness of the extremities.  He did not have any speech disturbances or visual disturbances.  This morning on examination he states his symptoms are much better.  He still has some residual numbness in his leg and arm.  Facial numbness is almost all gone.  As of 1/18/2021, residual numbness and tingling is only in his left ring and pinky finger.

The pain was sharp and stabbing.   Over a period of hours the left hand became weak.  He returned to work on the 19th and struggled with manual tasks with his left hand (he is a dentist). Based on his symptoms of pain followed by limb weakness, the diagnosis of brachial neuritis was clinically suspected by his PCP. On the 20th he received a steroid taper starting with 60mg daily for 4 days, then 40mg for 4 days then 20mg for 4 days and then off.  Within a day of starting steroids, the weakness improved slightly and the pain decreased.  As of January 27th he still uses tylenol for pain and has mild left hand weakness that is residual.

As a result I felt the need to go to bed early at about 9:30 PM. At about midnight I woke up with severe chills and intense body aches. I didnt get much sleep but the chills went away before 6:00 AM. The achiness remained but not as intense. I then had a migraine with a lost of appetite and more fatigue most of the day on February 10. Around 4:00 PM on the 10th all the symptoms suddenly started to leave and I began to feel normal.

My skin was warm to the touch, body aches and pain and sniffles, lots of congestion and complete fatigue and severe muscle aches. I had a slight headache also but in the middle of the night 2/3 to 2/4 I woke up drenched from sweat and had to redress because my clothes were soaked.  On 2/4 I had to have the air on because I was so hot but never developed a fever.  On 2/5 I was still fatigue and still couldnt do much.  2/6 I still had arm soreness but felt better overall and by 2/7 all symptoms had subsided.

WITHIN MAYBE 1-2 MINUTES, HIS WIFE CAME TO THE COUNTER AND SAID HE IS OUT, PASSED OUT.  I WENT TO CHECK ON HIM. YELLED TO MY TECH TO CALL 911. PATIENT WAS SLUMPED OVER IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS BREATHING AND HAD A PULSE, BUT NOT AWAKE. TRIED TO AROUSE HIM BE CALLING HIS NAME AND SHAKING HIS ARM TO WAKE HIM. HIS WIFE THEN WAS TAPPING THE SIDE OF HIS FACE TO WAKE HIM UP. SKIN WAS GRAY IN COLOR. SHE STATED HE IS GOING TO VOMIT AS HE WAKES UP AND NEEDED A GARBAGE CAN. I WENT TO GRAB CAN FROM PHARMACY AND RETURNED. SHE PUT CAN IN BETWEEN HIS LEGS AS HE CAME TO AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO VOMIT. HE WAS AWAKE BUT OUT OF SORTS.  AT THAT TIME THE EMT ARRIVED AND WENT TO WORK. PATIENT BP WAS LOW AND THEY STARTED IV FLUIDS. THE PATIENT WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO EMT AND ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS. THEY PREPPED HIM FOR TRANSPORT TO THE EMERGENCY DEPT FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. BY THE TIME THE PATIENT WAS BEING TRANSPORTED, HIS BP WAS BACK UP CLOSE TO NORMAL.  I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PATIENT AND HIS WIFE AROUND 5PM THAT DAY. THEY WERE LEAVING THE HOSPITAL AT THAT TIME. THE PATIENT WAS FEELING MUCH BETTER. HIS BP WAS BACK TO NORMAL, HIS COLOR WAS BACK, AND HIS VOICE WAS STRONG. THEY BOTH PLAN ON RETURNING FOR THE COVID 19 DOSE #2.

                                                On January 1 and 2nd,  approximately 10 days following administration  of Moderna vaccination,  I began to experience both hearing loss and tinnitus in my right ear.   The hearing loss and ringing noise in my right ear came on rather slowly, and progressed over a week&#39;s time.   There was no illness otherwise, and no trauma.  The ringing continued, and I sought out medical care from both Neurology and Otolaryngology.    My otolaryngologist could not find any cause and speculated that it could in fact be from the vaccination.  I underwent oral steroid treatment as well as a series of 3, sequential weekly steroid injections into my middle ear space, though my tympanic membrane.   I also started taking oral L-Lysine at the recommendation of my neurologist as well as other herbals including oral flavonoids to help reduce tinnitus.   None of the above treatments have made any improvement in my symptoms.   I had my hearing rechecked every week at ENT office and the same degree of hearing loss is evident.  None of which has returned to date.  I have most recently just last week begun to a pursue hearing aid device at the recommendation of my ENT physician.    I am currently scheduled for brain MRI to make sure there is not another physiologic cause such as a tumor or hemangioma on my nerve that would possible explain my new symptoms in the right ear.   That study is not completed yet.    The hearing loss and tinnitus is constant, and unchanged, now nearly 7 weeks.    The noise is significant and disturbs my sleep, and much of my daily function.

However after about day 6 I felt normal again. Then 20 days later, I am feeling the same symptoms again. My armpit is swollen and having brain fog and anxiety.

                                                @ 3-5 min... arm started feeling a little sore, like a dead arm. That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

It won&#39;t necessarily wake me up, but if I wake up in the middle of the night, it has a tendency to keep me up.  It is less noticeable with white noise or some other ambient sound(s) and doesn&#39;t necessarily seem to affect my hearing.

                                                Patient walked over to observation table and complained of nausea and light headedness.  He then walked back to his chair .  I took his blood pressure at 1313: 165/123 (L), P - 77. , BP @ 1322 - 143/118 (L), P - 82.  Patient was given cheese cracker and water after her reported that he hadn&#39;t eaten that morning, since he is intermittently fasting.  BP was attempted a third time; however, the patient was very agitated therefore the BP couldn&#39;t be read.  The patient complained of headache and anxiety.  Another attempt was made for the third BP @ 1335 - 168/104 (R), O2 - 97%.  The patient was encouraged to finish his crackers and have another bottle of water.  The final BP at 1350 - 147/104 (R).  Patient reported no headache and feeling less anxious.  Patient left with cousin and advised to report to PHCP for follow up of blood pressure.

I approached the patient and asked questions regarding symptoms and he stated he &#34;lost consciousness&#34; for a few seconds and was sweating. I waited with the patient for 10&#43; minutes and asked if his symptoms were getting better. I made sure he was awake and responsive. The patient stated he was feeling tingly and &#34;amphetamine-like effect.&#34; A few minutes later he was pouring the water on his head and decided to lay on the ground. Based on his response, I called 911. After paramedics arrived and checked his condition, his symptoms improved. Based on discussion with paramedics, it looked to be like a panic attack to vaccination.

When I went out to check on him he said he had a sudden onset of chills and sweating, kind of funny feeling. The sweat was visible on his skin (arms &amp; Face). I told him to sit another 10 minutes while we watched him. He was visibly nervous when he arrived and had told me this was his first vaccination in 20 years. After another 10 minutes he said he was feeling  and was ready to leave.

I am now nervous about the second dose, as I have heard it is worse for most people. )

They have tried taking vitamin c and d they have not helped so far.  The dizziness sometimes does get worse when doing certain motions

                                                I began to feel a little dizzy on 03-25.   This light lack of equilibrium steadily grew for the next couple days. I found my limbs had apparently began to lose strength.  breathing became difficult  as if I could only take 1/4 breaths unless I actively forced myself to inhale deeply.  I developed sleep apnea about this time.  Driving became difficult. I was walking and driving as if I was drunk.  When walking, it felt as if I was on a swaying ship. Driving felt like my workvan was in a constant crosswind that I wanted to correct from.  At this point, I stopped driving.  That was on 03-25.  On 03-26 I suddenly developed up-beat nystagmus in my vision that continues to this day, making me functionally blind.  I visited multiple urgent care facilities.  Received full panel blood work, urine tests and a MRI. All tests came out completely normal.   Doctors are baffled. I was given Valium to help with my eyes and that does help a little.  However I&#39;m still unable to see adequately to function without assistance.

                                                When we checked on patient in about 5 minutes after shot, patient complained about tightness is his neck and felt a lump in his throat. I did give me 25mg of liquid generic benadryl.  Monitored with a epi pen, bought never gave it to him because I didn&#39;t feel he was in breathing distress. He did want us to call the ambulance and they came in and determined he was not having a allergic reaction.

After that, I decided to go home and on the way home my neck started to get tight, not stiff, tight. I could still breathe but it was hard to take in a deep breath. I turned around and headed to the Hospital. I stayed in the hospital parking lot for about 30 minutes and the symptoms improved as well as my breathing improved but still felt tight in my neck. I went home started driving with plenty of water and was monitoring my breathing., and put on my machine for at least an hour.

Through the night the aches became severe enough to prevent sleep and I began to experience intense bouts of chills, followed by fever and profuse sweating. These symptoms continued through the day on Sunday 5/16. On Monday 5/17 I felt the symptoms lessening, and on Tuesday I felt better after a full 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Wednesday 5/19 I woke up feeling dizzy and disoriented. My limbs were weak and I was feeling body aches again, though not as sever as after the initial shot. I have a fever of 101.1 degrees F and have reached out to my PCP to give me direction on what to do next.

                                                I received my first shot on 1/12/21 and felt weakness and lethargy initially.  I was not able to lift the same amount of weight nor stay on a cardio machine as I once did (I exercise daily).  It never improved.  After my second shot on 2/9/21 I began to develop symptoms of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis).  I was awaking up at night, drinking a 40oz bottle of water and urinating every hour during hours of sleep.  I lost a significant amount of weight as well (I was questioned at work about it).  I have no family history of diabetes and I have always been lean and fit.  I went to the doctor on 2/27/21 because symptoms became overwhelming.

By Day 6 the rod felt smaller than a regular sized jujube and after that it was gone.  Vaccine 2 side effect Had 102 fever next day but felt OK the preceeding day. Arm where injection was also itches a little from time to time, but not as much as it did the day after getting the Vaccine.
