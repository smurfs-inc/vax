                                                Initially, around 1500hrs on Monday, January 4th, roughly 40 minutes after the injection, I developed a scratchy throat, a headache, and nausea.  I got home from work, and having no appetite due to nausea, I fell asleep on the couch around 1800hrs. Severe fatigue had set in. I did not wake up until 0500hrs the next morning to go to work on January 5th. I felt like I had not slept at all, however the scratchy throat had gone away. I worked all day with the nausea and headache. Throughout the day I developed chills, cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, and I felt like my mind was foggy (I had felt feverish since Monday night, but Tuesday was the first time I took my temperature that showed I had a fever.) I went home that night and slept all evening and well into the next morning. On the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, my symptoms had again gotten worse, so I called my primary care physician. He fit me in and tested me for the flu and for COVID. He prescribed me Ibuprofen for the headache/fever, and Ondansetron for the nausea/vomiting. My flu test came back negative on Thursday, January 7th, and my COVID test came back negative on Friday, January 8th. The fever finally broke on Friday evening and Saturday, January 9th  was the first day I woke up without a fever.  I still have the headache as of today, January 11th, and a low grade fever has returned. I am still very fatigued as well.

But later in the evening of the next day I think to me the most concerning side effect was I started getting some chest pain as if I pulled a muscle around my chest or what not. And it has continued into the next day as well which is now 2 days after second dose of vaccine.

                                                When I woke up the morning after getting the second dose, I felt fairly lethargic and it took me a while to get going, more so than usual even though I&#39;m not a morning person. I had a light headache, which I&#39;d put at about a 3 on a 1-10 scale, but after being at work for a few hours it increased to about a 5. I left early, around 1pm, and slept again from about 3pm to 8pm. The headache eased up after this nap, but was still there in the background. The next morning (this morning, 1/29), the headache was nearly entirely gone.

EMS was summoned at 8:10am and transported the patient to the emergency department for assessment. RN reports that the patient has no previous history of seizure. Symptoms have resolved and RN reports that the patient has had no recurrent symptoms or seizures while in the emergency department.

                                                Approximately two hours after injection, slight discomfort and soreness about 2 inches in radius below the the injection site, but not at the point of contact. Movement of the upper arm produced some levels of pain, but nothing noteworthy. It was uncomfortable to sleep on, though, so that was avoided. Lower arm unaffected.  The following morning,  the pain was immediately noticeable and made using the arm a severely difficult task. It was painful to move the forearm above stomach level, and essentially impossible to do any sort of heavy lifting with it. Pain relieving medication such as aspirin and ibuprofen helped in a minimal capacity, and was ultimately irrelevant in the healing process. These symptoms lasted the entirety of the day after the injection and most of the following day as well, subsiding mostly in the evening. Today (Thursday, third full day after), all pain and soreness/dullness are entirely gone. The second full day was easily the most intense in terms of pain.

The following night, 3/4/2021, muscle pain in upper back started to develop. The morning of 3/5/2021 the muscle pain had spread from upper back to neck and shoulders. The pain was severe enough to impede the ability to get dressed or drive.  I took Ibuprofen and noticed little relief, then took 1g of acetaminophen and experienced some relief. Pain persisted at same degree until the evening of  3/7/2021  where pain had started to noticeably subside. On morning of 3/8/2021,  armpit discomfort had ceased and muscle pain and been reduced to that of very slight soreness.  as on 3/10/2021 all pain had disappeared.

The condition has not improved, and it is now 39 hours after injection. Regular, everyday tasks are very difficult. Pain is about a 7.5/10.  Also, 24 hrs after injection I experienced a fever. The fever lasted for 12 hours without coming below 103 degrees, and went up to 105.2 degrees at its highest. This was accompanied by extreme chills. I have also have body aches, which are likely a result of the fever, and the fact that I haven&#39;t slept in 2 nights because of these side effects.

I noticed that if I put in an earbud or there is sufficient noise, I do not notice it but otherwise it is fairly annoying and made it harder to fall asleep. I took a hot shower and it seemed to help but the sound came back not long after.

                                                4 days later after the vaccine my left eye turned really red with crust and mucus coming out. I went to walk in clinic and was being treated for pink eye. I was started on an antibiotic eye drop. A day later my right eye started to have the same problem. I scheduled an appt with a eye specialist where he examined both eyes and said I had a major infection. I was started on steroid eye drops which I am still taking but seems my eyes are not getting better. I have a follow up with another specialist next week for further testing. I have been out of work due to this matter.

Treatment: Took the day after the shot off of work and slept a LOT (approx 18 hours on and off), stayed hydrated and fed. Did not take painkillers due to hearing it would interfere with vaccine uptake. Most symptoms except for headache had gone away by 30-hour mark. Only some lingering fatigue and achiness left over past 36-hour mark.

Left deltoid; he was monitored for 30 minutes after administration, and then intermittently assessed throughout the evening showing no signs of reaction. Overnight, he did not sleep and began to become restless and 0400 his prior normal 97s-98s temp had increased to 99.8. At 0500 he vomited a large amount and temp was 102.1, at which point he was given PRN acetaminophen for fever. SpO2 fell to 90%, and he was started on O2 at 4 L it was also noted his abdomen was distended, and he had erythema on his left arm extending from the base of his neck to his wrist.

                                                I started to develop the following symptoms fever,  joint pain, shortness of breathe, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain by 7:00 AM on Saturday 6th, and subsequently they increased until the only thing I could to was only lay in bed, during the night the shivering awfull, there was a point when my whole body was stiff and I wasn&#39;t able to move (or at least that was my perception at that point) the fever, joint pain, shortness of breathe, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain increased and by 3 AM I was vomiting. I took medication for the pain but the symptoms were lessened not for much, I remained in bed until 2:30 PM on Sunday 7th. I am still weakened, fatigued and with a slight shortness of breath, I am assuming by tomorrow I will be feeling better. No regrets whatsoever.

By 5 pm the day after I had stomach/abdominal pain aches, nausea and fatigue. The fever started at 100. That night I woke up at least once an hour from the pain. I had to throw up. The next day I woke up drenched in sweat and with the chills and a fever of 101.5, I think. And then the joint pain started. Especially in my knees. I applied icee hot and drank some pepto. And only ate a few crackers to have something in my body, tried to drink a lot of electrolytes. By Sunday night I woke up every hour from joint pain, especially my knees and lower back. I woke up in the middle of the night shivering and unable to get warm. I took a warm shower, and had to sit on the ground and just let the warm water run. My knees were in so much pain I couldn?t stand. Monday morning I woke up with a fever of 100 but tolerable joint and stomach pain. By Monday afternoon my fever had gone down, but still has abdominal pain, headache and mild joint pain.  I Was able to eat dinner chicken soup. Then Tuesday woke up fatigued and mild to low abdominal and now muscle pain.

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

This reaction was due to I believe the fact I had positive antibodies from a positive infection 8 months prior.  I had laboratory evidence of a positive serum antibody titer following the infection.  Was this vaccine studied in regards to patients who received the vaccine? because I believe it needs further study before it is given to patients who have already developed immunity from acquiring the actual COVID disease.

Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

                                                Moderna vaccine dose #1 received in right shoulder on 12/31/20 at 2:15PM. Injection was uneventful other than sensation of pressure. I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA. As of now, I still have limited range of motion and shoulder pain on the right which has improved slightly but is far from resolved. I still have difficulty with certain ADLs including putting clothes on and off, lifting items, and tasks that require raising my right arm above my head. I am concerned with the possibility of long term and/or permanent damage after reviewing the literature. I am also concerned about how many other healthcare workers the person who gave me my vaccine may be injuring and/or causing permanent harm to.

He came over to ask us if it was safe for him to get the second shot after 28 days since he got shingle 1 day after the first shot. He also had a rx from ER for 3 medidations prescribed for shingles. We did not fill his rx since he wanted to fill them in a pharmacy close to his family&#39;s home.

                                                During the first day after taking vaccine, started having a fever, headache, and sore throat. By the evening, fever was severe and 102&#43;, with severe headache and sore throat. After sleeping on that nigh (had disruption of sleep from 2 - 4 in the morning), it was looking normal., just had usual fatigue after a fever. But on Thursday (Took vaccine on Tuesday morning, March 02, 2021), I suddenly started having a seizure, my whole body was shaking, legs were cramping. I thought it was going to go away, but after 10 minutes it was getting worse and I had to call the emergency services. The fire service members first came, they measured my blood oxygen level, it was 98%, but my blood pressure was high (140). I was still shaking and having the seizure. They tried to calm me down by talking, after some time, my blood pressure came to normal and I started getting normal (no seizure at that point). I declined the ambulance service as it is expensive and I was getting normal. I had a 101 fever just after that and went to visit the health care facilities .

                                                I started developing issues with swallowing six hours after I was vaccinated. This resulted in a panic attack. I was able to calm myself down and used Benadryl several hours later.  It seemed to help with the swallowing issue and I went to bed. I woke up this morning (03/06/21) feeling much better. I still infrequently have trouble swallowing liquids. I?ve continued to take Benadryl. The feeling of tightness in my throat is located in my superior throat. My breathing - to my knowledge - has remained unobstructed the entire time. If I don?t return to normal by Monday, I will be visiting the center on campus.

Patient came in today around 1 pm stating he was sore and couldn&#39;t sleep last night and today he has limited movement in left arm. He can lift it up to almost horizontal position forward but difficulty moving it backwards. He took 2 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen as directed and still sore. Advised he can take 4 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen (800 mg) every 8 hours for a day and see if that relieves pain and motion. He can also put a cold compress to affected area for slight swelling. If not better in a day or so advised him to contact a doctor, because might need something stronger to treat reaction to vaccine.

                                                On the night of the 20th, I experienced a mild headache and minor left arm soreness. I went to bed at 9:30pm and woke up at 2:00am unable to move my left arm due to severe pain, a pounding headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and minor nasal congestion. I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep the remainder of the night due to the pain. All symptoms persisted the morning and afternoon of the 21st as well. The severe arm pain subsided but I still struggled to lift my arm past 90 degrees without intense pain. I went to bed on the 21st unable to rest on my left shoulder due to the pain and woke up the 22nd with most symptoms gone except for a minor headache and moderate soreness in the left arm.

Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

He was dazed and said he just felt off. When he stood up, he fell down and felt very dizzy.  We were doing a vaccine clinic at his place of employment that day so I was still on site and he came back into the room I was stationed around 1:30pm. He said he felt ok, was talking, breathing fine, just felt a little &#34;off.&#34; He had white spots all over his left arm and some on his right.   None were raised, red, or itchy. His left hand was red/purple in color. I gave 50mg of diphenhydramine and he stated about 10 minutes later he felt better.  I observed him for approximately another hour. He was walking around, talking fine and stated he felt normal when he left. He still had some slight discoloration on his left arm.

He was brought immediately to exam room where he became pale, diaphoretic, and stated he &#34;felt like he was in a dream.&#34; Seated BP was 74/palp. He was placed in supine position on exam table, cool compresses placed on forehead and back of neck. He complained of some nausea, which quickly improved. He never lost consciousness. His color and alertness improved steadily over the next 10 minutes. Repeat BP (lying) was 100/50. After a few minutes he sat up on exam table, dangling legs. BP remained stable at 110/60, HR 84. He continued to improve and stated that he felt better, drank some water and ate some goldfish crackers. Reported that he just remembered he had not eaten since lunch. After another 5-10 minutes he was alert, oriented, able to walk unassisted. Final BP 114/70, HR 80. His wife remained with him and confirmed she could drive him home. Discussed that although I feel confident this was a vasovagal near-syncope, if symptoms recur or worsen, he should go to ER for evaluation. Understanding verbalized.

                                                I am the patient&#39;s neurologist. The patient has very well controlled epilepsy without a seizure in over a year. He is compliant with medication and did not have another provoking factor.  Approximately 6 hours after receiving the vaccine he had a generalized seizure, which was witnessed by his wife. He had an aura, behavioral arrest, tonic-clonic activity for 1 minute followed by a post-ictal period of several hours. This is consistent with his known seizures, but the provocation appears to be the vaccine he received earlier in the day.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included allergy to cefaclor and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Concomitant medications reported included desvenlafaxine succinate, gabapentin and dexlansoprazole.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 11:30 am, approximately six hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the morning of 23 Dec 2020, prior to receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt &#34;achy&#34;.  At 5:30 pm, the patient experienced chills, fever to 102, GI upset and diarrhea. At 11:00 pm, the patient reported difficulty sleeping, GI upset, LOC x 2 and pallor. The patient was transported to the emergency room via ambulance.  A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test and routine labs were collected; however, results were not provided. Treatment for the events included paracetamol, unspecified intravenous (IV) medications, ondansetron and ketorolac tromethamine. The emergency room discharge diagnosis was stomach flu.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, GI upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever, were considered resolved on 24 Dec 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 31-year-old, male subject with a medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, who experienced the unexpected events of loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, and stomach flu, and the expected events of chills and fever. The events of chills, fever occurred approximately 6 hrs. and the events of GI upset, loss of consciousness, difficulty sleeping occurred after 12 hrs. after the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The time to onset for the events of GI upset and diarrhea were unknown. The reporter did not provide the causality assessment for the events. Due to the temporal association between the LOC and the administration of the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however, the subject&#39;s medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and other concurrent conditions of GI upset, diarrhea, and stomach flu remain as confounders.

                                                I received it at 10am and around 2am that night I started to have a bad headache and body aches. I would fall asleep for a bit but then at 4am I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so unbearable that I would clinch my eyes shut. Bones and muscle pains all over. Violent hot/cold flashes. I would feel hot all over and after a minute or so of placing a cold pack on my head I began to shiver despite sweating. Around 5am I was looking at my phone wondering if I should go to the ER because I legitimately felt like I was in danger.  The unbearable headache lasted a total of 14 hours from its onset. No OTC medications were taken.  Around 6pm on day 2 from the dose the intensity of the headache began to subside VERY slowly.  I woke up on day 3 completely fine as if nothing happened.

He reports mild swelling under his right eye, as well as to his right cheek area. He also reports that he can?t fully open his right eye, which impairs his field of vision; otherwise, denies any vision changes. Instructed that the symptoms were suggestive of Bell?s Palsy, but to go straight to ER for further evaluation.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine,  I started to feel slight pain in the injection site (my arm) reminiscent of a bruise. An hour later, I started to feel tired and weak, and the soreness in my arm worsened slightly. The pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  45 minutes later, I experienced stiffness in my neck and upper back, though that isn&#39;t unusual for me. I also started to feel nauseous and cold at that time, but the nausea subsided within an hour.  The severity of these symptoms stayed the same the rest of the evening. I went to bed at midnight, and woke the next morning at 8am. My arm where I had received the shot felt much more sore and painful, especially when I move it, and mainly when any pressure is applied to the area. I was woken by pain in my arm when I payed on that side of my body. The pain is now a 4, but a 7 when pressure is applied. It is now 12:30 pm.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Down&#39;s syndrome.   On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 14-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced INFECTION (boil type infection near armpit). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinating\talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there/hearing voices of people talking to him) (seriousness criterion medically significant), ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR (different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done), ANXIETY (anxious, scared), DEPRESSED MOOD (Sad), DELUSION (having delusions), INSOMNIA (not sleeping), EATING DISORDER (taking a long time to eat) and WEIGHT DECREASED (lost 4 pounds). At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinating\talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there/hearing voices of people talking to him), INFECTION (boil type infection near armpit), ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR (different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done), ANXIETY (anxious, scared), DEPRESSED MOOD (Sad), DELUSION (having delusions), INSOMNIA (not sleeping), EATING DISORDER (taking a long time to eat) and WEIGHT DECREASED (lost 4 pounds) outcome was unknown.            On 01Apr2021, he had a boil type infection near his armpit. She wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment for the doctor until two days after so in the meantime she put hot compresses which helped. The MD prescribed an antibiotic that helped and it went away. Last Thursday, maybe seven or eight days later, her son showed different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done. He was hallucinating and talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there, he was anxious, sad, scared, and having delusions and hearing voices of people talking to him. He is normally self sufficient but he went from his normal routine and she had to tell him to eat and brush his teeth which he would normally do on his own. He is also not sleeping, taking a long time to eat which is unlike him, and has lost 4 pounds. His second dose (lot# 038B21A) was yesterday 14Apr2021. She is concerned if it is related to the vaccine or the antibiotic.

                                                Received 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/20. Besides general left arm soreness for 2-3 days following vaccine, I had no other symptoms until Sunday January 3rd, at which time I began to notice increased fatigue, chills, and mild cough. Symptoms did not subside by Monday morning, January 4th, and I called in sick to work and requested that I receive a Covid 19 test from an urgent care. I tested positive for Covid 19 that day, and remained off work until 1/14/21. I experienced moderate chills, moderate increased skin sensitivity, and significant fatigue from 1/3/21 to 1/8/21, sleeping ~16-20 hours per day every day during that time. I began feeling better 1/9/21 and symptoms gradually improved until I was symptom-free on 1/12/21. I returned to work on 1/14/21, &gt;10 days following initial symptoms.

Towards the end of the day I felt tired, however not sure if that was from the vaccine or because I did not sleep well. Tylenol reduced symptoms and they did not greatly interfere with my day.  The following morning all side effects were gone and I was back to completely normal.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

                                                At approximately &#43;2 hours from time of vaccine, began experiencing severe (immobilizing) RIGHT FRONT rib pain. Pain level 6 of 10. Contacted doctor&#39;s answering service at &#43;24 hours from time of vaccine to inquire about course of action. Ice was recommended. Doctor&#39;s answering service concluded rib pain to be unrelated to vaccine but rather to Cerebral Palsy and/or muscle strain from 10,000 meter indoor rowing event completed -10 hours from time of vaccine. I am very skeptical of this finding since I routinely row 10,000 meters, and average 40,000&#43; meters each week. No prior known incidents of right front rib pain.  Pain history:  &#43;2 hours, 6 of 10  &#43;24 hours, 6 of 10, unable to conduct normal activity, painful to walk/exercise  &#43;36 hours until present, 6 of 10 but decreasing slowly. Still not able to return to normal routines

For then next couple days just felt rundown. Then three days post vaccine I began having some chest discomfort and shortness of breath. That night around one thirteen the morning I went to Emergency Department. they took a ECG and drew labs. the ECG showed normal rhythm just a little elevated and my Blood pressure was elevated. Upon the attending physician getting my lab work back i was admitted for my triponin levels being elevated. I was taken for chest X-rays and a Cat Scan per their pulmonary embolism protocols. Both of which showed nothing.  The next day i had a Echocardiogram, and Cardiac Catheterization, and a Cardiac MRI.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night with a fever, took 400mg of ibuprofen to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I felt mostly normal, so I took my Bupropion dose (150mg) and drank a cup of coffee. I exercised and went to the gym. When I got back I noticed my heart rate while resting was 130. This persisted into the night. I felt tired, weak, unfocused, and cold at night again. It is possible I had a slight fever again. 48 hrs after my second vaccine, I still have a high resting heart rate (90) which goes up to 120 whenever I move. It is as though I am exercising. I feel like I could jump up and run at any moment. I do not feel fatigued today thankfully. The high heart rate with fatigue is what worried me most.

                                                I had a sore arm almost immediately following the shot that slowly got worse throughout the evening. In the morning my arm was very sore. I woke up around 6:30 with a headache and chills. throughout the morning, my headache worsened as did my chills. I felt fatigued and noticed my lungs felt the same as they did when I had COVID. Essentially all my COVID symptoms came back I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I slept most of the morning and then felt nauseous around 3 pm. I vomited around 3:30 and almost felt completely better after that. My headache, chills, and fatigue were still present but significantly less once I vomited. In the morning I woke up with a headache that lasted through the morning the second day after vaccine administration. By the end of the second day, I felt completely fine. My arm soreness was almost completely gone. I also had some aches and chills on the second day in the morning upon waking up but those were gone by mid-day. On day three I feel completely fine.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused. One of the pharmacy technicians called 911 immediately and started the emergency response. he was able to regain his composure and move himself back the chair. The EMTs arrived and took his vitals, and discussed what happened. They eventually determined that he was ok and was free to go. The patient did not go to the hospital.

This occurred while driving, after waiting 15 minutes and leaving the facility.  I became very hot and started sweating, too.  The feeling of faintness lasted for about 20 minutes, then improved.  I felt lethargic, mildly dizzy, and generally foggy for several hours afterwards.

And it happened. A medium sized blood chunk came out followed by couple small pieces of blood then I did drink lime mixed with water and stopped. But I still feel like there is something kind of blocking my throat a little bit.

                                                I have not felt the same since I received the vaccine. Initially, I felt tingling in my fingers after receiving the injection. I also got chest and throat tightness. I felt very slightly shaky and just a bit off.  After that subsided a bit, I left the facility and started heading home. Ten miles from the store, I went back as I got another wave of feeling pretty terrible. I waited outside there for another hour until I felt better again. The next few days I had terrible fatigue and constant headaches, and the obvious sore arm. I had a couple days where I was a little better but then it would come surging back again.  For three weeks I&#39;ve had on and off migraines, extreme and dreadful fatigue like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before (feels like I&#39;m dying of cancer or something), and feeling out of it and spacey. It&#39;s been awful and I&#39;m terrified to get the second dose if the first one did all this to me. I was feeling great in the weeks leading up to the vaccine so I am certain that my reaction is to the vaccine. I hope this gets better soon. I&#39;m not sure what to do about dose 2.

Symptoms started to get worse the next day of vaccination as I was hardly moving my left arm and i had to get off work early because i couldn&#39;t stand on my feet for a long time. finally on the third day symptoms started to improve.

                                                For several hours I had no side effects, including soreness at the injection site. In the evening, maybe 6-8 hours after the injection, the site became sore. After midnight, I started having severe chills and needed several layers of clothing and blankets to stay warm. I checked for a fever and did not have one. In the morning the chills were gone but I had a strong headache that lingered with varying intensity throughout the day. It is unclear if the headache was more from the vaccine or more from a lack of sufficient sleep because I couldn&#39;t sleep with the chills. The injection site has continued to be sore and seems to be increasingly sore. After waking up on 1-13-2021, I found myself feeling fatigued and lethargic, not dissimilar to the fatigue I felt when I had COVID. The fatigue has somewhat subsided over the course of the day, with lots of rest helping. The headache and soreness are ongoing, and the fatigue is present but less than earlier today. There&#39;s been somewhat of an ongoing lack of appetite, but I&#39;ve been able to eat in small amounts and keep down what I eat. The chills have come and gone a couple times throughout the day today, but that doesn&#39;t seem to last long.

I still have the subtle altered taste/smell that occured after receiving the first dose a month ago (I have previously reported that).  On 1/25/21, I recieved the 2nd dose of vaccine at 10 am and felt fine all day.  Around 10pm, I started to have chills.  This rapidly evolved to whole body rigors.  My tempature spiked.  I couldn&#39;t move, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would pass out or throw up.  I had to have my wife bring me a makeshift urinal since I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Went from freezing to boiling, back and forth.  Felt absolutely miserable.  Around 2-3 am broke out into a cold sweat and finally started to feel better.  I was drenched in sweat througout the night.  It was a very long 4-5 hours.  The following night I felt fine although I also was drenched in sweat when I woke up.

Over the course of the night, I fell more ill and finally took my temperature in the morning around 7 AM and had a fever of around 100.4 F. I took Tylenol about every 6 hours for the next 24 hours with my temperature fluctuating between normal and 100.4 F. During this time, I was too ill to do anything more than sleep or lay in bed. The following day, my temperature broke, but I was still experiencing aches, chills, and brain fog, along with the pain at the injection site. After about 84 hours from the time of the vaccination, I felt normal enough to resume my daily activities.

Then last night 3/10/2021 I felt a nerve time pain in my axillary space.  I know nerves can be &#34;funny&#34; at times since understanding pain science and low grade nerve information and still didn&#39;t think that was odd.  Today this morning 3/11/201 during my 545am work out I noticed around 6:15 am my delt (injection site) was very red.  Later it got itchy, and now 8:14pm swollen and starting to get warm, and the redness ring is now twice the size of my morning work out.  Pain is minimal none, just minor sorness (a 1/4th of the after day sorness from shot).  My pec area feels off.

Thursday I went to the ER and was diagnosed with pneumonia and given a gastro cocktail and recommended follow up with gastrointestinal physician. On Friday I felt worse and had a fever of 101 I took Tylenol and Motrin and continually felt worse. Went to ER with 103.4 fever and racing heart rate. BP was normal. Was discharged and told to continue medication. The next day (Saturday) I woke with a swollen penis and went back to the ER where I was given a steroid shot and told to ice and watch for any additional swelling. Fever has stayed down but have had aches and pains throughout the day

                                                At approximately 3am (~13 hours post-injection) I experienced chills. I was asleep in bed and was awakened by my own shivering. My bedroom was its typical temperature, I had my usual bedding on the bed, and my wife (next to me) did not feel that the temperature was unusually low. I added additional blankets and suffered through these chills for approximately one hour until they passed.  At approximately 9am (~19 hours post-injection) I began to experience severe body aches and fatigue. I got up, had breakfast, and then slept approximately 3 more hours. I awoke for lunch, played with my children, and then fell asleep for approximately 2 more hours. Body aches continued through the day. Over-the-counter Tylenol was sufficient to ease the discomfort. I would describe the level of body ache as similar to having completed an extremely strenuous physical activity the previous day; the last time I can remember feeling this sore was following a multi-day 100-mile backpack trip at high elevation. At present (10pm, approximately 32 hours post-injection) the body aches are subsiding but still present. My fatigue is also subsiding.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                Around 12 hours after the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine I experienced the expected severe fever, chills, and rigors.  This eventually subsided to a large extent by hour 30; however at hour 36 I slightly bent over to pick up an item from my nightstand and felt what seemed to be a pulled muscle in my left back.  I immediately went to bed and awoke with severe muscle spasms in that same area.  The muscle spasms continued lying, standing, and sitting.  Nothing relieved them and they were intermittent brought on spontaneously and also by movement.  I could not perform most daily functions and sought medical attention at the local urgent care.  There they diagnosed it as a thoracic myofascial strain.  They prescribed me cyclobenzaprine which helped decrease the frequency but not completely alleviate the spasms.

My right side of my face around the cheek, eye, and ear area began to tingle and feel numb around 20 to 30 min. After the shot was administered. It was only on the side of my face that Moderna covid vaccine was given. It ended up going away after 4 hours or so. The next day I had normal reactions to the shot for someone that had covid such as low fever, muscle inflammation, aches, and this brain fog, chills in my sleep.

He received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine (lot number 003B21A, expiration date 9/9/2021) around noon at the vaccine facility.  About 2 1/2 hours later, the patient developed burning and itching of the eyes and rhinorrhea.  The patient&#39;s co-workers and a medic looked at him and said that his eyes were red and puffy, and told him that he should report to the ER.  He also experienced some throat itching, and said that his thinking was &#34;cloudy&#34;.  The patient said that he had eaten nothing in the previous several hours.  He had not taken any medications that day.  He is not aware of any known drug or food allergies, and he has not been sick in the past few weeks.  He denies having had any vaccinations in the previous 2 weeks.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

                                                Muscular pain in left shoulder and arm became very painful 24-36 hours after injection. It was difficult to sleep due to pain. This pain dissipated 48 hours after injection. Pain returned 6 days after injection, on Monday the 8th. Pain was in the lower portion of the left arm and in the calf muscle of left leg. In my opinion, this cannot be explained by any other physical activities.

Patient was seated  approximately 6 feet in front of pharmacy counter and I went out to check on him.  Patient was sweating profusely and again complained of feeling disoriented.  I asked if he was feeling nauseous and he said no.  I placed a cold compress on the back of his neck and had him try to relax and breath evenly.   I then  got a ice pack for him and wrapped it in towels to protect the patient from the cold.  Offered patient some water which he denied.  Offered to call an ambulance and patient denied.  I took the patients blood pressure and it was 140/84. Patient states this is slightly higher than normal for him.  After 5 more minutes patient began to recover quickly.  Sweating stopped and his color returned to normal.  Patient stated he felt much better.  I took patients blood pressure again and it was 133/94.  Patient stayed under observation for another 15 minutes and said he felt fine and left the pharmacy.

                                                Sinus pressure started the same night as the vaccine. The symptoms gradually worsened throughout the night. He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses. Then suddenly had a significant flow of blood from his RIGHT nostril. As of this evening he still has congestion in his sinuses, and intermittent tightness in his chest.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

                                                Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine EUA Approximately 3 hours after vaccine, shoulder pain began to develop. Pain became significant, waking me in the middle of the night. The following day, I was unable to lift the arm I received the injection in no higher than about 80 degrees from my side. Pain increased despite taking OTC NSAIDS. By the second morning after vaccine administration, pain had worsened and right arm cannot be raised more than about 60 degrees without significant pain. Contacted PCP office about 12 hours after injection, they recommended NSAID dosages alternating ibuprofen and tylenol, and icing the shoulder. Pain impacts daily life activities, including caring for small children , lifting items that weigh more than a few pounds by the impacted arm, and significant difficulty reaching any object above the level of the shoulder. I have never previously experienced this kind of reaction to any other upper arm injection or vaccination.

Then still chills and insomnia. Fever that persisted over the next 36 hours. Responded well to Ibuprofen 400mg for 4.5 hours until symptoms returned. Began alternating with Acetominophen 650mg for better effect. Fever was highest (recorded) at 102.2 F 29 hours after injection. Woke up 40 hours from vaccine after a night of sleep and with reduced fever. Still going up and down a bit off any medication. Last reading 46 hours from vaccine 100.6, but two hours earlier was 99.4. I?ve also had nausea, exhaustion, and tiredness. Also cold symptoms which may be related to the slight cold I had the morning of the vaccination that I didn?t think was anything to worry about - my kid is in daycare and I feel like this for a large part of the winter!

                                                patient received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. After receiving in our immunization room, he left the room and then shortly walked over to the pharmacy in-window and told the pharmacy tech that he did not feel well and felt dizzy. Tech had him go sit down in the waiting room and went and got the nurse, who went out to check on patient. Patient was slumped in the waiting room chair with eyes closed and very sweaty. Patient said he wanted water, so staff quickly got him water. After a few sips, patient&#39;s head rolled back and he lost consciousness for roughly 10 seconds before waking up startled and confused. Ambulance was already called and when the arrived they triaged the patient for around 15 minutes. After about 15 minutes the patient seemed much better and the paramedics decided it was OK for him to leave and drive himself home.

                                                Patient had dark circles under their eyes and did discuss at the drop off window they had a needle phobia. Immediately after the immunization, he said he felt lightheaded. I, pharmacist, sat in the booth and talked to him for a couple minutes then asked if he felt he could finish his observation outside the booth.  I notified technician to hand him off to her for observation , sharing by observation that the patient did not look well but he said he was doing a little better. He said he felt better and he did wait in the chairs outside the immunization booth. While I was in the pharmacy discussing this information with my pharmacy technician when I heard yelling and I stepped back out of the pharmacy to observe the patient was sliding out of his chair, stiff straight. My other technician came to my assistance and we both tried to get him to the floor and he was making incoherent noises and his arm was bent behind him and not relaxing to where we could get him to the floor. He then came to and startled a bit, with a bewildered look on his face. He asked what happened and said he felt he was dreaming.  A witness waiting on her prescriptions for pickup said that it originally appeared he was having a seizure which was my concern as well. We called code white and 911 and store manager assisted us at the scene. Patient denied the ambulance.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

                                                I was given the injection on 01/27/2021 in the left arm at approximately 08:30 am. At around 08:00 pm I started to get really cold and had the worst case of the chills I have ever had. I was shaking so hard my body hurt. At around 10:30 pm I went to bend and started to get a low fever of about 101.4* and could not get warm. I started to get a bad headache and my body hurt. It was so bad I had to call in sick the next day for work. On 01/28/2021 I stayed home and had sever body aches, bad headache, the chills and I felt nauseas. From my left hip to my left knee it felt like I had a bad charley horse. That night I got another low grade fever of about 100.1*. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and still had a headache. I took some Aleve and went back to sleep. I called in sick again the next day and that day I was a little better only had a headache, a little nauseas and body was only a little sore. I went to bed and am fine today. A note I have never tested positive to COVID-19 and I test weekly.

                                                I began experiencing a high pitched, singular buzzing in my ears the morning after I received the vaccination. It initially started as an intermittent noise that came and went throughout the day.  Unfortunately, the sound level and length of buzzing both increased as the days passed. By Saturday, March 20th, the buzzing was loud and continuous and was affecting my ability to carry out day to day activities. Now. on March 23rd, I hear the buzz whenever I&#39;m awake. It&#39;s now accompanied by a headache that usually begins in the early afternoon. I haven&#39;t been able to find any respite or cure for the noise, and have been taking Tylenol to help the headache and using a white noise machine to help sleep. I&#39;m very, very hesitant to receive the second dose if the ringing may further worsen.

                                                On March 24, 2021, the day of the shot, I only felt soreness in my left arm. The next morning, March 25, 2021, I began to feel body aches, chills, and I was in a cold sweat. I took ibuprofen throughout the day to combat the symptoms. The evening of March 25, 2021, the pain was much more severe (body aches all over my body, including my face, teeth, my hands were sore and stiff, etc.). I did not sleep much of the night because the symptoms were very uncomfortable due to the chills and cold sweats. The morning of March 26, 2021, my left armpit began to swell. By the afternoon, my left armpit (the arm where I received the vaccine) was swollen, tender, and soft. There is some redness and the swelling and tenderness are more pervasive. It is difficult to hang my arm at my side due to the pain and swelling. I understand, after calling the nurse hotline, that this is a common side effect but I also have a skin condition (Hidradenitis Supparativa) and it is difficult to know whether flare-ups are triggered by environmental factors.

                                                Patient is 39-year-old male with no significant past medical history who works at long-term care facility.  He received COVID-19 vaccine on 1/13/2021 and immediately developed numbness and tingling in the area of injection which was the left shoulder.  Over the next 15 to 30 minutes numbness and tingling expanded to the left side of his body including face arm and leg and the left side of his trunk.  He began to feel foggy and had some slurred speech.  He presented to the Emergency Room and tests were performed to rule out a stroke.  The patient denies any other symptoms such as fever chills myalgias.  He did not have any weakness of the extremities.  He did not have any speech disturbances or visual disturbances.  This morning on examination he states his symptoms are much better.  He still has some residual numbness in his leg and arm.  Facial numbness is almost all gone.  As of 1/18/2021, residual numbness and tingling is only in his left ring and pinky finger.

                                                pain in the left shoulder followed by weakness in the left hand, left, left deltoid and mild weakness in the left tricep.  The pain was sharp and stabbing.   Over a period of hours the left hand became weak.  He returned to work on the 19th and struggled with manual tasks with his left hand (he is a dentist). Based on his symptoms of pain followed by limb weakness, the diagnosis of brachial neuritis was clinically suspected by his PCP. On the 20th he received a steroid taper starting with 60mg daily for 4 days, then 40mg for 4 days then 20mg for 4 days and then off.  Within a day of starting steroids, the weakness improved slightly and the pain decreased.  As of January 27th he still uses tylenol for pain and has mild left hand weakness that is residual.

As a result I felt the need to go to bed early at about 9:30 PM. At about midnight I woke up with severe chills and intense body aches. I didnt get much sleep but the chills went away before 6:00 AM. The achiness remained but not as intense. I then had a migraine with a lost of appetite and more fatigue most of the day on February 10. Around 4:00 PM on the 10th all the symptoms suddenly started to leave and I began to feel normal.

                                                Within the next 24 hours after my entire left bicep couldnt move and was in severe pain.  My skin was warm to the touch, body aches and pain and sniffles, lots of congestion and complete fatigue and severe muscle aches. I had a slight headache also but in the middle of the night 2/3 to 2/4 I woke up drenched from sweat and had to redress because my clothes were soaked.  On 2/4 I had to have the air on because I was so hot but never developed a fever.  On 2/5 I was still fatigue and still couldnt do much.  2/6 I still had arm soreness but felt better overall and by 2/7 all symptoms had subsided.

                                                On January 1 and 2nd,  approximately 10 days following administration  of Moderna vaccination,  I began to experience both hearing loss and tinnitus in my right ear.   The hearing loss and ringing noise in my right ear came on rather slowly, and progressed over a week&#39;s time.   There was no illness otherwise, and no trauma.  The ringing continued, and I sought out medical care from both Neurology and Otolaryngology.    My otolaryngologist could not find any cause and speculated that it could in fact be from the vaccination.  I underwent oral steroid treatment as well as a series of 3, sequential weekly steroid injections into my middle ear space, though my tympanic membrane.   I also started taking oral L-Lysine at the recommendation of my neurologist as well as other herbals including oral flavonoids to help reduce tinnitus.   None of the above treatments have made any improvement in my symptoms.   I had my hearing rechecked every week at ENT office and the same degree of hearing loss is evident.  None of which has returned to date.  I have most recently just last week begun to a pursue hearing aid device at the recommendation of my ENT physician.    I am currently scheduled for brain MRI to make sure there is not another physiologic cause such as a tumor or hemangioma on my nerve that would possible explain my new symptoms in the right ear.   That study is not completed yet.    The hearing loss and tinnitus is constant, and unchanged, now nearly 7 weeks.    The noise is significant and disturbs my sleep, and much of my daily function.

Immediately that evening I began to feel symptoms of fatigue. This grew into an overall feeling of sickness and 3 days later, I had major brain fog. This then developed into high anxiety.  However after about day 6 I felt normal again. Then 20 days later, I am feeling the same symptoms again. My armpit is swollen and having brain fog and anxiety.

That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

                                                Bilateral tinnitus. I have periodically noticed tinnitus throughout my life, but it has been persistent over the past few months. It won&#39;t necessarily wake me up, but if I wake up in the middle of the night, it has a tendency to keep me up.  It is less noticeable with white noise or some other ambient sound(s) and doesn&#39;t necessarily seem to affect my hearing.
