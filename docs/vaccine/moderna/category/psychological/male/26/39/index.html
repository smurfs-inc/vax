                                                Initially, around 1500hrs on Monday, January 4th, roughly 40 minutes after the injection, I developed a scratchy throat, a headache, and nausea.  I got home from work, and having no appetite due to nausea, I fell asleep on the couch around 1800hrs. Severe fatigue had set in. I did not wake up until 0500hrs the next morning to go to work on January 5th. I felt like I had not slept at all, however the scratchy throat had gone away. I worked all day with the nausea and headache. Throughout the day I developed chills, cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, and I felt like my mind was foggy (I had felt feverish since Monday night, but Tuesday was the first time I took my temperature that showed I had a fever.) I went home that night and slept all evening and well into the next morning. On the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, my symptoms had again gotten worse, so I called my primary care physician. He fit me in and tested me for the flu and for COVID. He prescribed me Ibuprofen for the headache/fever, and Ondansetron for the nausea/vomiting. My flu test came back negative on Thursday, January 7th, and my COVID test came back negative on Friday, January 8th. The fever finally broke on Friday evening and Saturday, January 9th  was the first day I woke up without a fever.  I still have the headache as of today, January 11th, and a low grade fever has returned. I am still very fatigued as well.

                                                So later that evening around 9:30pm I started with Chills, and a low grade fever lots of body ache and head ache, to the point I did not get much sleep the night of. It lasted the whole next day. But later in the evening of the next day I think to me the most concerning side effect was I started getting some chest pain as if I pulled a muscle around my chest or what not. And it has continued into the next day as well which is now 2 days after second dose of vaccine.

I had a light headache, which I&#39;d put at about a 3 on a 1-10 scale, but after being at work for a few hours it increased to about a 5. I left early, around 1pm, and slept again from about 3pm to 8pm. The headache eased up after this nap, but was still there in the background. The next morning (this morning, 1/29), the headache was nearly entirely gone.

I noticed that if I put in an earbud or there is sufficient noise, I do not notice it but otherwise it is fairly annoying and made it harder to fall asleep. I took a hot shower and it seemed to help but the sound came back not long after.

                                                4 days later after the vaccine my left eye turned really red with crust and mucus coming out. I went to walk in clinic and was being treated for pink eye. I was started on an antibiotic eye drop. A day later my right eye started to have the same problem. I scheduled an appt with a eye specialist where he examined both eyes and said I had a major infection. I was started on steroid eye drops which I am still taking but seems my eyes are not getting better. I have a follow up with another specialist next week for further testing. I have been out of work due to this matter.

Treatment: Took the day after the shot off of work and slept a LOT (approx 18 hours on and off), stayed hydrated and fed. Did not take painkillers due to hearing it would interfere with vaccine uptake. Most symptoms except for headache had gone away by 30-hour mark. Only some lingering fatigue and achiness left over past 36-hour mark.

                                                Patient received a COVID-19 vaccine Moderna 1/13/21 around noon. Left deltoid; he was monitored for 30 minutes after administration, and then intermittently assessed throughout the evening showing no signs of reaction. Overnight, he did not sleep and began to become restless and 0400 his prior normal 97s-98s temp had increased to 99.8. At 0500 he vomited a large amount and temp was 102.1, at which point he was given PRN acetaminophen for fever. SpO2 fell to 90%, and he was started on O2 at 4 L it was also noted his abdomen was distended, and he had erythema on his left arm extending from the base of his neck to his wrist. Dr. was called, and Benadryl was given for suspected allergic reaction to the vaccine. Over the next hour the erythema resolved, though other effects continued throughout the day( vomiting, fever, etc)

Since then I have been feeling nauseated after I eat. I cannot eat like I normally do and it has been almost five days. If this persists through the weekend I will visit my doctor next week.

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

                                                At 3 AM, 12 hours following the vaccine administration, I awoke with severe fever/chills, body aches and severe headache, which progressed to nausea and vomiting x 3 episodes and was very sick for one day, home bound and could not work.  This reaction was due to I believe the fact I had positive antibodies from a positive infection 8 months prior.  I had laboratory evidence of a positive serum antibody titer following the infection.  Was this vaccine studied in regards to patients who received the vaccine? because I believe it needs further study before it is given to patients who have already developed immunity from acquiring the actual COVID disease.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

                                                Moderna vaccine dose #1 received in right shoulder on 12/31/20 at 2:15PM. Injection was uneventful other than sensation of pressure. I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA. As of now, I still have limited range of motion and shoulder pain on the right which has improved slightly but is far from resolved. I still have difficulty with certain ADLs including putting clothes on and off, lifting items, and tasks that require raising my right arm above my head. I am concerned with the possibility of long term and/or permanent damage after reviewing the literature. I am also concerned about how many other healthcare workers the person who gave me my vaccine may be injuring and/or causing permanent harm to.

He came over to ask us if it was safe for him to get the second shot after 28 days since he got shingle 1 day after the first shot. He also had a rx from ER for 3 medidations prescribed for shingles. We did not fill his rx since he wanted to fill them in a pharmacy close to his family&#39;s home.

                                                During the first day after taking vaccine, started having a fever, headache, and sore throat. By the evening, fever was severe and 102&#43;, with severe headache and sore throat. After sleeping on that nigh (had disruption of sleep from 2 - 4 in the morning), it was looking normal., just had usual fatigue after a fever. But on Thursday (Took vaccine on Tuesday morning, March 02, 2021), I suddenly started having a seizure, my whole body was shaking, legs were cramping. I thought it was going to go away, but after 10 minutes it was getting worse and I had to call the emergency services. The fire service members first came, they measured my blood oxygen level, it was 98%, but my blood pressure was high (140). I was still shaking and having the seizure. They tried to calm me down by talking, after some time, my blood pressure came to normal and I started getting normal (no seizure at that point). I declined the ambulance service as it is expensive and I was getting normal. I had a 101 fever just after that and went to visit the health care facilities .

I went to bed at 9:30pm and woke up at 2:00am unable to move my left arm due to severe pain, a pounding headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and minor nasal congestion. I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep the remainder of the night due to the pain. All symptoms persisted the morning and afternoon of the 21st as well. The severe arm pain subsided but I still struggled to lift my arm past 90 degrees without intense pain. I went to bed on the 21st unable to rest on my left shoulder due to the pain and woke up the 22nd with most symptoms gone except for a minor headache and moderate soreness in the left arm.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included allergy to cefaclor and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Concomitant medications reported included desvenlafaxine succinate, gabapentin and dexlansoprazole.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 11:30 am, approximately six hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the morning of 23 Dec 2020, prior to receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt &#34;achy&#34;.  At 5:30 pm, the patient experienced chills, fever to 102, GI upset and diarrhea. At 11:00 pm, the patient reported difficulty sleeping, GI upset, LOC x 2 and pallor. The patient was transported to the emergency room via ambulance.  A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test and routine labs were collected; however, results were not provided. Treatment for the events included paracetamol, unspecified intravenous (IV) medications, ondansetron and ketorolac tromethamine. The emergency room discharge diagnosis was stomach flu.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, GI upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever, were considered resolved on 24 Dec 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 31-year-old, male subject with a medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, who experienced the unexpected events of loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, and stomach flu, and the expected events of chills and fever. The events of chills, fever occurred approximately 6 hrs. and the events of GI upset, loss of consciousness, difficulty sleeping occurred after 12 hrs. after the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The time to onset for the events of GI upset and diarrhea were unknown. The reporter did not provide the causality assessment for the events. Due to the temporal association between the LOC and the administration of the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however, the subject&#39;s medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and other concurrent conditions of GI upset, diarrhea, and stomach flu remain as confounders.

I haven?t been able to sleep since then and my fever has spiked as high as 104.5. I?m also experiencing headache, ear aches, mild sore throat, nausea, and chest tightness/pain during deep breathing. No shortness of breath symptoms though. Aleve and Tylenol do not appear to be helping. I feel worse than when I had Covid back in November.

I would fall asleep for a bit but then at 4am I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so unbearable that I would clinch my eyes shut. Bones and muscle pains all over. Violent hot/cold flashes. I would feel hot all over and after a minute or so of placing a cold pack on my head I began to shiver despite sweating. Around 5am I was looking at my phone wondering if I should go to the ER because I legitimately felt like I was in danger.  The unbearable headache lasted a total of 14 hours from its onset. No OTC medications were taken.  Around 6pm on day 2 from the dose the intensity of the headache began to subside VERY slowly.  I woke up on day 3 completely fine as if nothing happened.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Down&#39;s syndrome.   On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 14-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced INFECTION (boil type infection near armpit). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinating\talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there/hearing voices of people talking to him) (seriousness criterion medically significant), ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR (different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done), ANXIETY (anxious, scared), DEPRESSED MOOD (Sad), DELUSION (having delusions), INSOMNIA (not sleeping), EATING DISORDER (taking a long time to eat) and WEIGHT DECREASED (lost 4 pounds). At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinating\talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there/hearing voices of people talking to him), INFECTION (boil type infection near armpit), ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR (different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done), ANXIETY (anxious, scared), DEPRESSED MOOD (Sad), DELUSION (having delusions), INSOMNIA (not sleeping), EATING DISORDER (taking a long time to eat) and WEIGHT DECREASED (lost 4 pounds) outcome was unknown.            On 01Apr2021, he had a boil type infection near his armpit. She wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment for the doctor until two days after so in the meantime she put hot compresses which helped. The MD prescribed an antibiotic that helped and it went away. Last Thursday, maybe seven or eight days later, her son showed different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done. He was hallucinating and talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there, he was anxious, sad, scared, and having delusions and hearing voices of people talking to him. He is normally self sufficient but he went from his normal routine and she had to tell him to eat and brush his teeth which he would normally do on his own. He is also not sleeping, taking a long time to eat which is unlike him, and has lost 4 pounds. His second dose (lot# 038B21A) was yesterday 14Apr2021. She is concerned if it is related to the vaccine or the antibiotic.

Towards the end of the day I felt tired, however not sure if that was from the vaccine or because I did not sleep well. Tylenol reduced symptoms and they did not greatly interfere with my day.  The following morning all side effects were gone and I was back to completely normal.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

For then next couple days just felt rundown. Then three days post vaccine I began having some chest discomfort and shortness of breath. That night around one thirteen the morning I went to Emergency Department. they took a ECG and drew labs. the ECG showed normal rhythm just a little elevated and my Blood pressure was elevated. Upon the attending physician getting my lab work back i was admitted for my triponin levels being elevated. I was taken for chest X-rays and a Cat Scan per their pulmonary embolism protocols. Both of which showed nothing.  The next day i had a Echocardiogram, and Cardiac Catheterization, and a Cardiac MRI.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night with a fever, took 400mg of ibuprofen to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I felt mostly normal, so I took my Bupropion dose (150mg) and drank a cup of coffee. I exercised and went to the gym. When I got back I noticed my heart rate while resting was 130. This persisted into the night. I felt tired, weak, unfocused, and cold at night again. It is possible I had a slight fever again. 48 hrs after my second vaccine, I still have a high resting heart rate (90) which goes up to 120 whenever I move. It is as though I am exercising. I feel like I could jump up and run at any moment. I do not feel fatigued today thankfully. The high heart rate with fatigue is what worried me most.

                                                I had a sore arm almost immediately following the shot that slowly got worse throughout the evening. In the morning my arm was very sore. I woke up around 6:30 with a headache and chills. throughout the morning, my headache worsened as did my chills. I felt fatigued and noticed my lungs felt the same as they did when I had COVID. Essentially all my COVID symptoms came back I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I slept most of the morning and then felt nauseous around 3 pm. I vomited around 3:30 and almost felt completely better after that. My headache, chills, and fatigue were still present but significantly less once I vomited. In the morning I woke up with a headache that lasted through the morning the second day after vaccine administration. By the end of the second day, I felt completely fine. My arm soreness was almost completely gone. I also had some aches and chills on the second day in the morning upon waking up but those were gone by mid-day. On day three I feel completely fine.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused. One of the pharmacy technicians called 911 immediately and started the emergency response. he was able to regain his composure and move himself back the chair. The EMTs arrived and took his vitals, and discussed what happened. They eventually determined that he was ok and was free to go. The patient did not go to the hospital.

                                                For several hours I had no side effects, including soreness at the injection site. In the evening, maybe 6-8 hours after the injection, the site became sore. After midnight, I started having severe chills and needed several layers of clothing and blankets to stay warm. I checked for a fever and did not have one. In the morning the chills were gone but I had a strong headache that lingered with varying intensity throughout the day. It is unclear if the headache was more from the vaccine or more from a lack of sufficient sleep because I couldn&#39;t sleep with the chills. The injection site has continued to be sore and seems to be increasingly sore. After waking up on 1-13-2021, I found myself feeling fatigued and lethargic, not dissimilar to the fatigue I felt when I had COVID. The fatigue has somewhat subsided over the course of the day, with lots of rest helping. The headache and soreness are ongoing, and the fatigue is present but less than earlier today. There&#39;s been somewhat of an ongoing lack of appetite, but I&#39;ve been able to eat in small amounts and keep down what I eat. The chills have come and gone a couple times throughout the day today, but that doesn&#39;t seem to last long.

Over the course of the night, I fell more ill and finally took my temperature in the morning around 7 AM and had a fever of around 100.4 F. I took Tylenol about every 6 hours for the next 24 hours with my temperature fluctuating between normal and 100.4 F. During this time, I was too ill to do anything more than sleep or lay in bed. The following day, my temperature broke, but I was still experiencing aches, chills, and brain fog, along with the pain at the injection site. After about 84 hours from the time of the vaccination, I felt normal enough to resume my daily activities.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                Around 12 hours after the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine I experienced the expected severe fever, chills, and rigors.  This eventually subsided to a large extent by hour 30; however at hour 36 I slightly bent over to pick up an item from my nightstand and felt what seemed to be a pulled muscle in my left back.  I immediately went to bed and awoke with severe muscle spasms in that same area.  The muscle spasms continued lying, standing, and sitting.  Nothing relieved them and they were intermittent brought on spontaneously and also by movement.  I could not perform most daily functions and sought medical attention at the local urgent care.  There they diagnosed it as a thoracic myofascial strain.  They prescribed me cyclobenzaprine which helped decrease the frequency but not completely alleviate the spasms.

My right side of my face around the cheek, eye, and ear area began to tingle and feel numb around 20 to 30 min. After the shot was administered. It was only on the side of my face that Moderna covid vaccine was given. It ended up going away after 4 hours or so. The next day I had normal reactions to the shot for someone that had covid such as low fever, muscle inflammation, aches, and this brain fog, chills in my sleep.

No treatment Body aches, fatigue, abdominal cramps, dry lips, dry mouth and throat, sinus pressure, nasal passage closed on one side and closing on the other, pale white skin on back of throat on the right side, chest tightness while laying face-down,  minor nausea, and very tired but unable to stay asleep all night.  Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

This pain dissipated 48 hours after injection. Pain returned 6 days after injection, on Monday the 8th. Pain was in the lower portion of the left arm and in the calf muscle of left leg. In my opinion, this cannot be explained by any other physical activities.

Shortly thereafter a rapidly rising fever accompanied by mild nausea and severe bout of chills.  Loss of appetite, brain fog, poor concentration.  Fever lasted from 9pm rapidly increasing to a highest measured temp (oral) of 102.9F for approximately 12 to 14 hours before gradually decreasing to under 100 roughly 36 hours after onset.  Tylenol did help slightly to control fever but did not seem to lower it.  Did nothing to reduce body aches.  Significant fatigue and soreness lasted approximately 3 days after dosage.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

                                                Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine EUA Approximately 3 hours after vaccine, shoulder pain began to develop. Pain became significant, waking me in the middle of the night. The following day, I was unable to lift the arm I received the injection in no higher than about 80 degrees from my side. Pain increased despite taking OTC NSAIDS. By the second morning after vaccine administration, pain had worsened and right arm cannot be raised more than about 60 degrees without significant pain. Contacted PCP office about 12 hours after injection, they recommended NSAID dosages alternating ibuprofen and tylenol, and icing the shoulder. Pain impacts daily life activities, including caring for small children , lifting items that weigh more than a few pounds by the impacted arm, and significant difficulty reaching any object above the level of the shoulder. I have never previously experienced this kind of reaction to any other upper arm injection or vaccination.

Woke up 40 hours from vaccine after a night of sleep and with reduced fever. Still going up and down a bit off any medication. Last reading 46 hours from vaccine 100.6, but two hours earlier was 99.4. I?ve also had nausea, exhaustion, and tiredness. Also cold symptoms which may be related to the slight cold I had the morning of the vaccination that I didn?t think was anything to worry about - my kid is in daycare and I feel like this for a large part of the winter! Thanks

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

                                                I was given the injection on 01/27/2021 in the left arm at approximately 08:30 am. At around 08:00 pm I started to get really cold and had the worst case of the chills I have ever had. I was shaking so hard my body hurt. At around 10:30 pm I went to bend and started to get a low fever of about 101.4* and could not get warm. I started to get a bad headache and my body hurt. It was so bad I had to call in sick the next day for work. On 01/28/2021 I stayed home and had sever body aches, bad headache, the chills and I felt nauseas. From my left hip to my left knee it felt like I had a bad charley horse. That night I got another low grade fever of about 100.1*. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and still had a headache. I took some Aleve and went back to sleep. I called in sick again the next day and that day I was a little better only had a headache, a little nauseas and body was only a little sore. I went to bed and am fine today. A note I have never tested positive to COVID-19 and I test weekly.

He received COVID-19 vaccine on 1/13/2021 and immediately developed numbness and tingling in the area of injection which was the left shoulder.  Over the next 15 to 30 minutes numbness and tingling expanded to the left side of his body including face arm and leg and the left side of his trunk.  He began to feel foggy and had some slurred speech.  He presented to the Emergency Room and tests were performed to rule out a stroke.  The patient denies any other symptoms such as fever chills myalgias.  He did not have any weakness of the extremities.  He did not have any speech disturbances or visual disturbances.  This morning on examination he states his symptoms are much better.  He still has some residual numbness in his leg and arm.  Facial numbness is almost all gone.  As of 1/18/2021, residual numbness and tingling is only in his left ring and pinky finger.

The pain was sharp and stabbing.   Over a period of hours the left hand became weak.  He returned to work on the 19th and struggled with manual tasks with his left hand (he is a dentist). Based on his symptoms of pain followed by limb weakness, the diagnosis of brachial neuritis was clinically suspected by his PCP. On the 20th he received a steroid taper starting with 60mg daily for 4 days, then 40mg for 4 days then 20mg for 4 days and then off.  Within a day of starting steroids, the weakness improved slightly and the pain decreased.  As of January 27th he still uses tylenol for pain and has mild left hand weakness that is residual.

As a result I felt the need to go to bed early at about 9:30 PM. At about midnight I woke up with severe chills and intense body aches. I didnt get much sleep but the chills went away before 6:00 AM. The achiness remained but not as intense. I then had a migraine with a lost of appetite and more fatigue most of the day on February 10. Around 4:00 PM on the 10th all the symptoms suddenly started to leave and I began to feel normal.

My skin was warm to the touch, body aches and pain and sniffles, lots of congestion and complete fatigue and severe muscle aches. I had a slight headache also but in the middle of the night 2/3 to 2/4 I woke up drenched from sweat and had to redress because my clothes were soaked.  On 2/4 I had to have the air on because I was so hot but never developed a fever.  On 2/5 I was still fatigue and still couldnt do much.  2/6 I still had arm soreness but felt better overall and by 2/7 all symptoms had subsided.

                                                On January 1 and 2nd,  approximately 10 days following administration  of Moderna vaccination,  I began to experience both hearing loss and tinnitus in my right ear.   The hearing loss and ringing noise in my right ear came on rather slowly, and progressed over a week&#39;s time.   There was no illness otherwise, and no trauma.  The ringing continued, and I sought out medical care from both Neurology and Otolaryngology.    My otolaryngologist could not find any cause and speculated that it could in fact be from the vaccination.  I underwent oral steroid treatment as well as a series of 3, sequential weekly steroid injections into my middle ear space, though my tympanic membrane.   I also started taking oral L-Lysine at the recommendation of my neurologist as well as other herbals including oral flavonoids to help reduce tinnitus.   None of the above treatments have made any improvement in my symptoms.   I had my hearing rechecked every week at ENT office and the same degree of hearing loss is evident.  None of which has returned to date.  I have most recently just last week begun to a pursue hearing aid device at the recommendation of my ENT physician.    I am currently scheduled for brain MRI to make sure there is not another physiologic cause such as a tumor or hemangioma on my nerve that would possible explain my new symptoms in the right ear.   That study is not completed yet.    The hearing loss and tinnitus is constant, and unchanged, now nearly 7 weeks.    The noise is significant and disturbs my sleep, and much of my daily function.

Immediately that evening I began to feel symptoms of fatigue. This grew into an overall feeling of sickness and 3 days later, I had major brain fog. This then developed into high anxiety.  However after about day 6 I felt normal again. Then 20 days later, I am feeling the same symptoms again. My armpit is swollen and having brain fog and anxiety.
