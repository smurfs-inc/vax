                                                About 8pm I began t experience total body itching.  At 11pm the itching was too much to allow for sleep.  I took two Gabapintin 300mg.  At 4AM I went to sleep.  I contactedmy dermatologist.  He suggested the vaccine may have started a Grover&#39;s response.  He asked that I add Zyrtec (over the counter) to my meds.  He asked that I continue hydrating my skin with Vanicream cream.  I folllowed his advice.  The itching stopped on Sunday.  I continued with the Zyrtec but stopped the Gabapintin.   Today, Tuesday, I am having muscle tightening, especially in my legs.

                                                fever, muscle and joint pain, significant high fever, severe sinus headache, exhaustion. Symptoms started about six hours after injection. I had a significant fever that lasted for 18 hours. The first night I was unable to sleep because the body soreness and pain would not allow me to get comfortable. I started taking Tylenol shortly after the symptoms started but it did little to mitigate the symptoms during the first 24 hours. By the end  second day following vaccination, symptoms were beginning to subside. On the morning of the third day, I pretty much back to normal.

His windows werte down and he could not remember how to close them.  He had been there for hours and unrinated in his clothing.  He told the police he was making sure the waitesses were doing there jobs correctly.  Again this was a Shell gas staion and not a resterant.  The police closed his windows and sent him home.  He hit the side of the house with the truck.  Then when he got to the garage he could not remember how to put it in park.  He is still having memory issues today but he can carry a conversation.  Tuesday he could not complete a sentance

Overnight, his wife woke to him  having an episode of what appeared to be a tonic clonic seizure around 5 am on 2/23/21, followed by a period of disorientation and unresponsiveness consistent with a post ictal state. The patient has no history of seizures. It is unclear if this had anything to do with the Moderna vaccine,  but I am reporting it due to the timing of the episode in conjunction with the vaccine.

                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

But then a fever, chills and aches the day after vaccine. Two days after, still febrile and feeling worse and experiencing shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Fatigue, fever and lightheadedness continue for three more days. On the 6th day post-vaccine, taken to ER and admitted to hospital with a pneumonia and blood counts dangerously low. Received 3 blood transfusions and is receiving 2 different IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Still in hospital and waiting to see how blood counts go. I can?t say the vaccine CAUSED this, but it all happened rapidly, immediately following the vaccine.

This continued about 1 1/2 hrs. then he could not get out of bed to go to the bathroom; thus wetting himself multiple times during the night; Patient was restless for about 5 hrs. but still could not get up even with me (his spouse) trying to help.  He also could not understand how to help move his body to keep from falling out of bed (never fell out but I could not get his entire body on the bed until our daughter arrived around 9:30 am.  It took our grandson who is 6&#39;5&#34; tall &amp; 275 lbs. to help get patient up and walked him into our sunroon.  throughout the day, patient could not stand without help &amp; continued to urinate on himself.  He could, however, feed himself breakfast &amp; lunch.  At 7:30 pm grandson and daughter had to walk patient into bedroom.  patient could not walk without us telling him how and pushing his feet forward.  It took both grandson and daughter to pull him onto the bed as he collapsed when he got to the bed.  Patient slept until approximately midnight. at that time our daughter helped him to the bathroom and helped to change his underwear and tshirt which was wet from having a fever.  Afterward, patient was able to go to the bathroom by himself but was very tired.  He was able to walk outside with the help of a cane on 2/5/21 2 pm.  On 2/6/21, patient complained of his back hurting and itching.  We discovered he had shingles!  Not a full body rash but shingles on his left side around his waist.

                                                Starting about 5 or 6 hours after the injection I became extremely tired and that persists through today, 7 days later. At times, I found even a small exertion like walking up a couple of flights of stairs to be exhausting. At times my head felt buzzy, although I haven&#39;t had a fever. At times I also felt fine but then would relapse. My sleep has also been erratic, although not very good normally. Arthritic joints are more painful.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   Around 8 hours after the shot, my left shoulder started to hur, when I raised my arm. Over the next few hours I grew more tired than usual with a very low-level, generalized ache. I went to sleep at 11. I woke up at 2 in quite a bit of generalized pain, left shoulder so painful I could not lie on my left side, unable to get comfortable in any position, feeling worse and worse. At 2:30 I got up, which immediately made me feel a bit better. I took an acetominophen, a half codeine acetominophen #3, and around 5 ml promethazine/codeine syrup. At around 4:00 I had some cheese and bread. At around 4:30 I was able to go back to sleep. I got up at 8:30, still achy/hurting, but distinctly better. I am writing this at 11 a.m. One other thing to note: after the shot I seemed to be having a  very odd, mild allergic reaction intermittently, when I ate some foods that I eat every day. Mostly it was a case of my hard palate itching.

                                                Neurological, including trigeminal neuralgia and one Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms.  Tried to complete online at library on 2/24/2021 but timed out at 20 minutes.  Item #18:  CDC asked to report any Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms (also trigeminal neuralgia is related to BP).  48 hrs post vax, mid-afternoon Sat, Feb 6th: Suddenly unable to comprehend book I was reading;  and  there was a physical sensation of irritation just inside my skull, wrapping around my brain (meninges?) -  it did not intrude into brain.  Felt lack of &#39;presence&#39; in room.  Slightly unstable on my feet.  Believed these were related to vaccine, would soon abate, but, also, that this would be no way to go through life!   These lasted 2-3 hours.  (I neither drink alcohol or take recreational drugs.)  About that time, a &#39;twinging&#39; precursor to trigeminal neuralgia began   uncertain whether it was TN?  Recurred every 3 hrs.  But then awakened at 6:30 a.m. by two painful TN jabs, repeated more strongly at 9:40 a,m.  At about 12:30 pm, return of light &#39;twinging&#39; sensation, then nothing  no recurrence.  3rd TN episode in 3 years, the briefest, the only one not requiring oxcarbazepine.  Checked for Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms (which I&#39;ve never had):  The left side of my mouth wasn&#39;t producing any saliva at all  none.  This improved very slowly, continuing for 5 or 6 days; by far the longest lasting symptom.  About Monday, the 8th, experienced an expanded  time warp driving to library  took forever to reach two roundabouts.  Lucid, alert, vision &amp; reactions normal.  Speed was a mile or two above limit.  No euphoria or nystagmus.  At library, conversation and work seemed normal.  Around the same time I had about an 18 hour complete memory loss with regard to medications.  Two dose periods in succession.    On Monday, Feb 8th, I called our 4 day a week neurologist.  He said the symptoms    were an immune response to the vaccine but that he&#39;s never seen them together before.  It was scary.  I&#39;m not going to take the second dose at this time.  And will depend upon PCP.       Filling out this form because you&#39;ve asked about any adverse reaction related to Bell&#39;s Palsy (which TN is closely related to).  I wonder how many others have experienced trigeminal neuralgia symptoms following vaccination?  It&#39;s a cumulative disease and devastating in advanced forms.  :-(

                                                After nearly 2.5 months I still have pain in my upper left arm near the injection site and in the right arm from the second dose. This makes it difficult to put on jackets, shirts, etc without significant pain and also interrupts my sleep. This pain is constant but aggravated by movement. I would rate it 7 on a 10 scale. I am wonder if this might be SIRVA or something similar. I have never had issues with vaccinations previously.

                                                Symptoms began the day after the patient received the second shot. He was very tired and weak. By the afternoon, he was so weak he could not lift himself out of the chair. Even with the help of another person, he was too weak to stand. I called for emergency help. He had a fever of 101, was vomiting, very disorientated, confused, could not understand what people were saying to him. At the hospital he continued to feel disorientated, had nausea, dizzyness, a headache, a fever of 104, was dehydrated. He was admitted to hospital and spent one night. Once home, he has begun to regain strength and other symptoms have diminished. Four days after coming home he is feeling stronger and more back to normal.

                                                At this point I am going to give you an account of my past 14 months health and how I know it is related to the covid virus.   i am sure i have had long covid  from december 2019 or january 2020 to the present based on symptoms i incurred on these dates. On my first night I ended up vomiting my guts out at 2:00 in the am. The following 2 weeks I had constant diarrhea.  At the end of those 2 weeks,  i ended up in emergency room. And this all happening when  i haven&#39;t&#39; vomited in over 30 years.  vital signs and blood work were good at the hospital and the drs were confused as to why i felt so bad. i returned home the next day where our permanent home is,  and 3 months later the covid thing surfaced. at first being thought of as a respiratory disease. then in the past months it is surfacing that it may now be considered a gastrointestinal disease that progresses to a respiratory disease. after checking the five main symptoms of long covid i discovered that i have at least 3 of the 5  common symptoms for this. Those being extreme fatigue, joint pain, and cough. In addition to the long covid symptoms, I have encountered tasting issues on and off again.  I have had many discussions with my primary care doctor, and no results or conclusive information came from my inquiries. Then on feb 12, 2021 I got my first moderna shot. About 2-3 weeks later I encountered a sharp pain in a muscle in my neck left side. Shortly thereafter I got very light headed. Then another  week later while  driving a motor home, I encountered a frightening experience with my eyes, and the neck pain and soreness was still there. My vision was very blurred and I was seeing double vision at different angles. I ended up at the medical center and was admitted for 4 days. Before I was admitted, I saw a local ophthalmologist here and he diagnosed me with a condition known as ?edema in optic nerve, inferior, consistent with optic nephropathy?. The symptom I had to get me to the doctor was I was losing eyesight in my left eye. After hd steroid treatment for 4 days, and a plethora of tests, including spinal tap, multiple mri?s, and probably over 20 blood tests (11 at one draw), I was released 3-18-2021 and still can?t see above the equator line of my left eye. And I also am extremely sensitive to light. I also have sensitivity inside my eye as best described as a soreness, especially when I try to look upwards. I have a follow up appt with the ophthalmologists that I first saw that advised me to get to the hospital. And that is on mar 26th 2021.  to mention another point of interest, my granddaughters boyfriends mother is a charge nurse at the emergency ward at the hospital, and she has said that they also have recently encountered emergency patients, who have recently received moderna, and are also having issues with eye problems. What problems in particular, I haven?t a clue at this time.  This is at the very least, extremely alarming to me, and I have no idea whether I may completely lose all function of my left eye., or not. But I adamantly feel this should be investigated by the cdc and any and all other agencies that should be involved.  I would be willing to have further discussions via phone or whatever to help you out with an investigation.

                                                Hallucinations; Dizziness; Fatigue; Nausea; Vomiting; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning her husband, a 77-year-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On an unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: unknown) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 01 Mar 2021, approximately three days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 03 Mar 2021, after second dose of vaccine, the patient experienced nausea and vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, and hallucinations. The event hallucinations were considered to be medically significant. The patient was also not been out bed for seven days. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not applicable.    The outcome of the events, hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events (dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding these event (hallucination) has been provided at this time. Medical history and concomitant medications are required for assessment. However, further information has been requested. However, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting are expected for mRNA1273.

                                                Received my 1st Covid shot yesterday at 11:45. No problem. Went home and went for a 4 mile walk. Still no problem. At about 2:00 AM this morning I woke up shivering. Added another blanked and turned up the heat. No improvement. Finally got up and woke up my wife. Temperature was 101.7° F. Blood pressure was 149/90. Took some ibuprofen and sat on the sofa with a heating pad on my chest for about two hours. Blood Pressure dropped back to its normal 125/75 (may have been high because I took it the moment I got up) but temp was the same. However, shivering had stopped, so I went back to bed.  When I woke up this morning (about 8:00) temperature was 99.1° F, blood pressure was normal (125/71) and no other symptoms. My arm isn&#39;t sore either. It appears that the elevated temperature was my only reaction from the shot. It&#39;s interesting because during the entire time I did have COVID symptoms, I never had any elevated temperature.

I THREW UP TWO DIFFERENT TIMES.  THE NEXT DAY I WAS STILL VERY WEAK. I TRIED TO GET OUT OF MY CHAIR AND I FEEL. I WAS UNABLE TO GET UP WITHOUT ASSISTANCE.  THE WEAKNESS AND FEVER CONTINUED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  I AM STILL VERY WEAK AND CAN&#39;T HARDLY WALK. MY HIP FLARED UP AND CAUSED ME GREAT PAIN AND IMBALANCE.  ALL THE AREAS THAT I HAD OCCASSIONAL OSTEOARTHRITIS I AM NOW IN CONSTANT PAIN.  I CAN NO LONGER SLEEP ON MY RIGHT SHOULDER.  BOTH OF FEET FLARED UP AND HURT ALL THE TIME.

I tried my hardest to stay up awake until bedtime to try and not mess up my sleep schedule. When I went to bed I slept for 10 hours which is unheard of for me. I am still tired this morning. The other thing is on my Eliquis I take it twice a day, I set my cell phone to go off. I apparently just turned my phone  when it went off in the evening, I didn&#39;t remember to take my 2nd dose of my medication. I worried if the vaccine caused some confusion.   I am going to call my Primary Care doctor today. I did call the VA as well and talk to a nurse who said that I should be feeling better today.

I asked my wife if my face was  red and she said, ?yes?. I felt somewhat weak and paramedic called the Dr over.  We talked and he determined that I had not eaten.  Walked me around car, put me in the passenger seat.  My wife  then drove.  I was a little disoriented late but didn?t complain. Since then I have felt like I did in July 2019 when I had coronial virus.  Felt bad, 93oxygen, 77 heart beat which is high for me.   Friday I did not get out of bed nor went outside. Sat more of the SamE.  Woke up at midnight sat and felt better.  I?m better but weak.

                                                About 4 hours after his vaccine, the injection site starting hurting, but not bad.  He could not sleep on it at night as he felt like he was sleeping on a red hot pocker.  On Saturday he was extremely tired in the afternoon.  Had to come in from yard work as he could not function.  He also had pain in his neck and shoulders.  On Sunday he the feelings were going away, but his muscles started aching.  On Monday he felt really strange, felt like he was in a fog, and his muscles ached.  He could not get relaxed, did his normal Monday chores, laundry and house cleaning.  He then tried to relax but his muscles and nerves were very tense.  He went to bed around 9:30 on Monday, fell asleep and awoke at 2:00 AM and could not go back to sleep his muscles in his arms and legs were in spasm and his arm would jump like a shock reaction and jump off of the mattress, as well as his leg.  It was worse on the left side than the right arm.  This went on every 10-15 minutes for about 3-4 hours.  Around 4:00 AM this morning it eased off to sleep and woke up at 10 and felt better today.  He hasn&#39;t had any more of the seizure type feelings in his arms or legs.  He did speak with Moderna who told him that he was the 4th one with this reaction and to report this to us.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

On 2/25/2021, his left leg weakness became worse. His wife gave him cane and took him to PCP who diagnosed him with BPPV and gave him meclizine.  Next day, he started having jaw stiffness and had difficulty in brushing his teeth.  He was complaining of blurry vision in both eyes.  He denied any double vision.  He stated he could not read things which he was able to read 2 days ago.  A day before he presented to Hospital, he was not able to walk at all and he required walker.  According to his wife, when she went to see him at Hospital around 7 PM on 03/05/2021, his oxygen saturation dropped twice and internist decided to transfer him to ICU. Later on, the decision was made to transfer him to Medical Center.  Pt was intubated, developed diffuse segmental myoclonus, required intense sedation; /ivig ineffective, now giving plasmapheresis.  pt underwent imaging of CNS, LP and extensive laboratory testing.

                                                I experienced this rather immediate unexpected gradually increasing dizziness with impaired balance while walking at accustomed pace over approximately 12-15 minute time period.  I was compelled to leave the track and lay down on an exercise mat where fortunately my wife came by t Within half hour of this attack i coiuld not stand and walk independently without support. My first time to a hospital ER  in my 78 years of life. Recommended for observation and additional tests I stay overnight in observation unit. Diagnosis appeared to be perplexing for physicians.  My wife  came by to assist me in standing , walking to the car and driving me to nearby ER. What happened to me was a frightening, anxiety-producing and dangerous situation. I could have easily fallen with substantial head or other bodily injury. Being in excellent health and with nothing else unusual having occurred recently to affect my general health (no changes, no illnesses), I cannot help conclude this episode was a serious adverse reaction to my 2nd Moderna vaccination.  I now consider what happened on 3/28/21 a &#34;Vestibular Attack&#34;. I think possibly my body for some reason related to the vaccine might have been attacking itself, if that makes sense to scientists.  I hope this doesn&#39;t happen to others. I am not anti-vaccination. But individuals should be warned about this possible dangerous reaction or adverse side effect, which in my case did not occur immediately after the 2nd Moderna dose. I&#39;ve complained to the hospital that possibility of severe dizziness with extreme loss of balance being related to recent Moderna 2nd vaccination was NOT discussed or commented.

Over the course of the day I alternated taking Ibuprofen (200mg) and Acetaminophen (500mg) every two hours for eight hours to drive down the temperature.  I also pushed water, and took naps.  I continued this treatment throughout the day of Feb. 19, and once on Saturday, Feb. 20.  I experienced a deep degree of lethargy beginning these days and continuing for several days later.  I did not &#34;feel like my old self&#34; until Friday, Feb. 2, eight days following the vaccination.

He fell on the floor and was unable to get up.  His face was very flushed and he broke out in a sweat several times.  We had to have fire dept come and pick him up off the floor.  He was able to get around a little bit with a walker, but spent most of the day in bed and was transported to bathroom by wheelchair.  He was also a bit confused.  He had very little appetite and was unable to eat very much.  At dinner time, he ate a little bit of soup and when he stood up at the table, fell again onto wood floor.  We had to call fire dept to pick him up from floor and EMT&#39;s/ambulance to come out and check him over.  VItals were all normal.  He was just a little bit better on the next several days.  We made an appointment for him to see Dr. on 3/3.  Doctor did blood work which came back normal. Pt. is still not back to normal.

Irritating small pain the full length of my spine.  Laid down and attempted to sleep no luck. I checked my pulse...very week and uneven. Missing beats...3-small beats in a row many times. Very erratic. It was like that till 5:AM in the morning. I must have finally fallen to sleep and by the time I got up at 8:30AM...my heart beat was back to normal again. Small muscle pains now but nothing else.

                                                By 3:00 he had a whole body chill.  He was then incoherent, lost all control of all body muscles and was incontinent both bladder and bowel.  He continued as such when Dr. said to give him Prednisone along with the Benadryl he was receiving every six hours starting at 3:30 p.m. 3/8/2021.  He was given a Prednisone at 4:00 p.m. 3/9/2021 and again at 8:00 p.m. on 3/9/2021 along with his Benadryl.  He was unable to ambulate or even turn his body over in bed.  He was able sip water and sports drink but ate nothing since noon on 3/8/2021.  It wasn&#39;t until early Sunday morning that he was able to move his legs and get to a walker and use the toilet.  He slow, very slowly has improved since then.  Late Sunday he was able to get up, and sit in a chair.  Later he was able to take a sit down shower and shampoo and   be an to feel &#34;nearly human&#34; again.  He has slowly progressed since then and Monday morning was able to navigate by himself and to descend and ascend a 13 stair step to the basement.    In discussing the 24 hours he spent in bed he was unaware of any of the things going  on such as not being able to move, but knew he was in pain if he moved his legs.  He also had a temperature of 102.3 which rose to 102.9 and then with cold compress on his forehead and time his fever dropped to 95.4 and the back up to a normal of 97.5.  These are similar symptoms he had after the first injection of the Covid 19 Moderna vaccine and he had had a similar reaction in 2017 from the first flu shot he ever had in his life.  He felt he needed to take this vaccine in order to be able to &#34;have a life&#34; even though we assumed he would have such a bad reaction.  He is slowly improving and if it is like the first injection it will take him nearly two weeks before he can ambulate at the level he was before the vaccination.  Still, he is grateful to Center for being so proactive as to have available the vaccine and it being more convenient for cancer patients than waiting in line at a mass inoculation center.   He would appreciate an acknowledgement that this information has been received and could possibly passed along to help others in his situation.  Thanks.

He was initially tachycardic, febrile and had leukocytosis 18K, with admission labs with creatinine 1.8, lactate 2.4. He had need for supplemental oxygen and was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Respiratory viral panel including SARS COV2 PCR was neg. Blood cultures from 2/24, 2/27, 3/3 were negative. CT chest showed some prominent mediastinal adenopathy which was increased from prior CT 2017. Also had axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2/27 he had a code blue called for bradycardia in context of receiving ativan for a CT study. Antibiotics  were changed to Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, acyclovir on 2/28. Multiple attempts by multiple providers at doing a lumbar puncture have been unsuccessful.  Bronchoscopy 3/2 with left lower lobe secretions. Cultures negative. He has stayed incessantly febrile and working diagnosis is probable underlying lymphoproliferative neoplasm immunostimulated by vaccine. At this time a bone marrow and lymph node excisional biopsy is planned. Patient is unstable to proceed for MRI imaging at this time due to hypotension.

By 8:00pm I began to feel weak, tired and poorly. By 11:pm I had developed a fever and aches and pains in most joints and muscles which mimicked flu symptons. During the night I became chilled and found it hard to sleep from all of the discomfort. Most of these symptons were almost gone by the next night except for the swelling, which took another 2 days to go down. I have had no other symptons since then.

He did not take his medications, did not remember to take it.  He came out to his wife and she heard some noise and he looked over to the dog dish to refill it and didn&#39;t refill it as he usually does.  Just a lot of forgetful things that he did.  He had dizziness and was hanging on the door frame and went to bed, and told his wife that he did not know anything and did not know what he was doing.  They took him to the doctor and was seen by the doctor who checked his VS and said that he was okay, and told them that he was having a reaction to the vaccine, and was starting to come around and remembering things while he was in the doctors office.  They were advised to take him home and let him rest, and he did and didn&#39;t eat until last evening.  He had the same reaction that he had when he had the COVID virus.  He knew everything this morning and back to his baseline.

The afternoon of 03/11/21, he also developed right facial droop and weakness. EMS was called and he was found to have suffered a left MCA stroke. He was admitted to the hospital for this  and underwent thrombectomy. Of note, he was febrile and hypotensive on admission.

                                                On the fifth day after vaccination I found myself disorganized in routine, everyday activities, such as washing &amp; dressing, preparing meals, etc.; for example, I omitted washing my ears and forgot to put the kettle on.  In the afternoon I was troubled by a headache of a novel sort, not with indefinite perimeter, but more specifically delimited, with ragged edges.  Then that evening after ascending a flight of stairs, I heard a loud thumping, then suddenly realized that it was my own heartbeat that I could hear in my head.  These bizarre effects disappeared by the next day. On the seventh through fourteenth days after the vaccination, I experienced a soreness in my trunk below the rib-cage, at first toward the sides, but then becoming more insistent and less localized; this was accompanied by headache (normal dull sort), along with irritation at the back of my nasal passages, and a feeling of being tired already upon waking.

                                                I had my 2nd Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on Thursday morning March 18, 2021 at  the hospital.  Everything went fine.  At approximately 4.00am Friday morning.  I was awakened and barely made it to the toilet where i vomited 3 times.  Following that took my temperature and it was 102.5.  I was shaking all over, ached all over as well as a headache.  very similar to my 1st vaccine reaction only much worse.  Again i was planning to play golf Friday and Saturday mornings but cancelled.  Can&#39;t play golf when you can barely walk.  I drank pedialyte and gatorade to  rehydrate and basically had no energy to do anything but sleep off and on for the next 2 days.  It wasn&#39;t until Tuesday that I began feeling normal.  Temperature slowly went down and finally was normal Monday night.

Over the next few days the pain got worse so that I couldn&#39;t lie on that side of my body. The symptoms progressed towards my shoulder and neck and other lymph nodes became painful. The next phase a few days later was red spots and blisters around the injection site on my chest near my neck on my left side. At the present time the blisters have mostly gone away but they&#39;ve been replaced by welts where the red spots were these are swollen and red. All of these symptoms are accompanied by fatigue and muscle pain also around my left shoulder. I have been treating it for the past 3 days with ice and am now taking an antihistamine Benadryl.

On 11-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DEAFNESS UNILATERAL (lost most the hearing in the left ear) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and FEELING ABNORMAL (had a bad day generally). In April 2021, DEAFNESS UNILATERAL (lost most the hearing in the left ear) was resolving. At the time of the report, FEELING ABNORMAL (had a bad day generally) outcome was unknown.            No relevant concomitant medications were reported. The patient confirmed lost most of the hearing in the left ear by a visit to the clinic after a hearing exam was done. The patient stated that he can hear better now but the left ear was not usable and could not use a telephone. It was better now but still not ok and was still &#34;metallic.&#34; The patient does not know if 2nd dose had influenced the hearing and stated that he did not have prior history of hearing issues. Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to events was not applicable. No treatment information was provided.

                                                wife called this morning at ~ 9:00 a.m. to report that he woke up with a fever of 101, has been throwing up, is dizzy and disoriented since he woke up this morning.  I advised that he remain seated or lying down, to give Tylenol per dosage on pkg/bottle.  To call 911 if symptoms worsen.  Wife stated that  did have COVID infection in Sept. 2020.  He walks with walker.  I called wife back at 1:50 pm.  States  took Tylenol, fever went down to 99, and he has been able to keep small amt of fluid down.  He has remained seated to avoid risk of falling.  Wife has him urinating in bucket.  Re-emphasized calling PCP to consult, or 911 if symptoms worsen.  To continue Tylenol per pkg instructions.  Wife voiced understanding.

                                                Pt here with concerns of numbness and tingling of his body since his COVID vaccine. He had it on 2/3 in his R deltoid. He notes started to feel bad on 2/6. He went to urgent care and was told that he probably had TIA. He came into clinic that next week and I ordered an MRI of his brain.  MRI brain showed senescent changes and mastoid congestion, but no evidence of stroke/acute event.        His symptoms started with R hand numbness (R thumb and R index finger), then progressed to R leg and arm numbness, R facial numbness with trouble speaking, which he describes as feeling like he had a lidocaine shot at the dentist. He denies any acute illness at that time, but did sleep alot more.         Currently the only symptom he has left is R index and thumb numbness as well as feeling like the R side of his face feels different than the L.

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

Patients&#39; medical history, as provided by patient&#39;s spouse, was emergency room(ER) admission in November 2020 because he had a congested chest (he had fluid around his heart). At that time, they gave him pills for kidney function. Other concomitant medication reported was Coumadin, blood thinner. Two weeks before receiving the vaccine, patient&#39;s EKG was normal.  On 11 Feb 2021, in the morning, patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273(BATCH/LOT # 007M20A) probably in the right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, approximately after 15 minutes of receiving vaccine, they left and patient was immediately very tired, his hands were shaking. So, patient&#39;s spouse made them down sleep for too long. On Friday, 12 Feb 2021 she tried to pick him up, but he was tired, exhausted, and sick.   On Saturday, 13 Feb 2021, she brought him a coffee and he couldn&#39;t hold it because his hands were shaking, so she gave him the coffee and then made him pee on the bed because he couldn&#39;t get up. At lunch time she made him eat something and he fell sleep again. His wife was hanging around him all day and around 7:30pm she realized that he was cold, and his neck was sweating, she couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat. So, she called emergency services and when they arrived, her husband&#39;s blood pressure went down until he died. Treatment for the events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  Patient was pronounced dead on 13 Feb 2021 20:00. The cause of death was not provided. The plans for an autopsy were not provided.  The events of blood pressure went down until he died and couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat were fatal. The outcome for the remaining events were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 81 year old, male patient, who experienced a serious event of death among others, 2 days after receiving mRNA- 1273 (Lot# 007M20A).

                                                Per neurology consult: &#34;Patient was at his baseline until when he received his 2nd dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.  He complained of dyspnea and fear of impending doom after waking up the following morning with some disorientation.  He was found to be in AFib with RVR after it was brought to ER  the following morning  and the rhythm was converted to normal sinus rhythm.  Patient continues to have confusion after admission yesterday that seem to get worse today to the point where he did not know his own name or birthdate, and seemed to have global amnesia.  Patient has been more drowsy this afternoon after receiving lorazepam 1 mg IV for potential seizure activity so no reliable neurologic exam was obtained.  Patient remains afebrile with pulse ox in the low 90s on 4 L of supplemental nasal oxygen in the hospital.  He had moderate decrease in kidney function upon admission that has improved.  He has baseline anemia with hemoglobin at around 10. Incidentally patient had shingles in the right thoracic dermatome week ago for which he received valacyclovir.

                                                Pt reported that he start sweating and could not understand what TV saying - he was very confused.  He is living alone. He called 911 and 911 came to his home and checked him.  Once they arrived at his home, he started feeling better. His blood pressure was normal per patient. He thinks they didn&#39;t check his temp.  He told me once I asked him if he has any heart problem. He has 4 stents and he thinks he had similar problems  about 4 months ago.

Starting the day after that, the patient&#39;s wife reported that the patient began to display confusion, weakness, and fatigue. The patient also presented to the clinic on 4/2/2021 with complaint of &#34;sinus pressure&#34; and was prescribed an antibiotic. He progressively worsened to the point where he was only able to speak a few words, and presented to hospital on 4/7/2021. Given extremely low platelet count on presentation, a diagnostic workup for TTP vs. ITP was commenced. It was determined by the inpatient hematology/oncology service that the patient was likely experiencing alterations in mental status and weakness and thrombocytopenia due to TTP.  Fresh frozen plasma was administered. Plasma exchange daily x 5 days and corticosteroids were initiated.

I had no appetite when I woke up at 6am, took my morning meds and went back to bed. Noon I felt a little better and it gradually went away and it seem to gradually go away. Because I have an auto-immune disease I seem to have had a reaction to the vaccine because it did not bother my wife, except for her being a little tired.

PTA bowel obstruction led to a syncopal episode following use of laxative, and several episodes of vomiting in the days prior . Upon admission Patient was receiving conservative therapy for a partial obstruction when he developed increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory status and eventually developed significant hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Neurology was consulted for altered mentation in the setting of respiratory failure. Patient with ascending paralysis. MRI of the head and neck as well as CTA were obtained x2. Patient was ultimately diagnosed with Guillain-Barre, variant and received 5 days of Intravenous Immune Globulin therapy.  Patient&#39;s small bowel obstruction resolved and ultimately patient required percutaneous tracheostomy tube and gastrostomy tube placement for prolonged respiratory failure and neurologic compromise.  The patient had uneventful ventilatory requirements and ultimately was performing intermittent spontaneous breathing trials; however, still had episodes of apnea, but improved.  He was tolerating tube feeds at goal with resolution of his small bowel obstruction, which was thought secondary to his Guillain-Barre.  The patient did develop abnormal LFTs which were thought secondary to cholecystitis not requiring operative intervention, with improving LFT findings on antibiotics.  The patient had a nonobstructive cholecystitis.  The patient&#39;s mentation was improving to the point where he was able to communicate and open his eyes upon discharge, as well as was working with Physical Therapy for strengthening.  He was able to move his upper extremities and followed commands and lower extremities were improving in strength as well. Patient was discharged via private air flight to acute care ICU facility.

I went to his room,I told the staff to call 911. He had started eating his lunch and felt that the food was stuck at the notch at the bottom of his neck. I prepared to give the EpiPen. He stopped coughing and said he was feeling better, but the staff member . said he didn&#39;t sound right. I decided not to give the EpiPen.  The Depot Runner asked to see his throat and tongue and agreed that he didn&#39;t need the EpiPen. Several other staff members came.  Asked a staff member to take his vitals. EMS arrived and took him to the ER.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 Vaccine: My dad has never had any sort of odor in his life and 3 days after getting the first vaccine shot, he has an incredibly foul odor (that he cannot smell) and it has not yet gone away. He showers frequently and I wash all his clothing and pajamas but this odor is strong and relentless. It&#39;s not a typical body odor smell though...it&#39;s like a &#34;medical odor,&#34; or something else very strange that is quite hard to describe.  I cannot seem to attribute this new odor to anything other than a negative side-effect to his first shot of the Moderna vaccine as nothing else has changed in his day-to-day life.  He also began experiencing cold symptoms about 4-5 hours after receiving his first dose of the vaccine. He was stuffed up, very congested, and extremely tired. He slept a LOT more than usual. I believe it is quite possible he actually just ended up with a cold because his immune system was so busy responding to the vaccine. (Is this possible/likely?)  Please let us know if others are experiencing this too, or if something can be done about it. Is his body not metabolizing an ingredient to this vaccine or something?

Patient contacted doctor. A few days after MD appointment patient was back to normal.

                                                Daughter calling to ask about side effects of COVID vaccine? She said her 83 yr old dad got the COVID- 19 yesterday and overnight he became confused, had severe weakness, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, and became feverish.  She said mom said they both got first dose of COVID vaccine yesterday around noon- then last night he started to feel unwell. Around 2am- her mom said her dad- became very weak, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, confused, started coughing, he had chills, felt feverish. She said so concerning by 4am her mom called EMS who came and took him to the Medical Center.   She said he had pretty severe case of COVID in December that he need hospitalized for-she said  he as really weak, foggy headed at that time, kind of out of his mind- she said was told that is how he was acting last night.   After being seen in ED and getting put on some fluids and then antibiotics he now seems to be acting more like himself. They hydrated- have some concerns about possible pneumonia dx so they started him on antibiotics- was told this might be due to his rxn post &#43; COVID vaccine - which is what prompted her to call today.   He is supposed to follow up with his PCP doctor.  He seemed better when he got home this morning- she said just left him a little bit ago after eating early lunch with him. She is not sure if getting him hydrated &amp; sent home with antibiotics is what helped or just time since now about 24 hours post vaccination dose.  Confirmed he has had no prior rxn to any other vaccines in the past.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 031620A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient experienced little bruising in the arm. On 12 Feb 2021, the patient was a bit off.

It felt like it was invaded with COVID. He went to hospital and got tested for COVID, Strep throat and Flu, and all three test results were negative. On an unknown date, the patient experienced tightening in his throat muscle and he went to the hospital where he was admitted.  While there, they did every possible test, chest MRI, Neck MRI, all possible viral tests, and rapid and full COVID test.  The rapid and full COVID tests came back negative.

                                                Patient describes headache that is excruciating soon after the injection. On the fourth day post injection, he states he had pressure in the left side of his chest, the left side of his nose swelled up and is very painful, he had a &#34;slight&#34; temperature, and decreased appetite. He states he is still feeling bad and the headache and his nose is what bothers him the most. He called his cardiologist and the cardiologist advised him that the doctor did not think he needed to be seen for the chest pain. The patient states that if the pain does not improve he is going to the Emergency Department. He noted that the injection was done in his left arm and the left side of his body is what is reacting so strongly.

                                                Patient states that twenty-four hours after administration (3/4/21) he spiked a fever, went into a state of delirium, and had difficulty breathing.  When he presented at the Emergency Room he had low SpO2.  They supplemented him with oxygen and gave him acetaminophen and after the fever broke he was sent home (3 hours in ER) with normal mental status.  Emergency Room ran some tests to determine if he had stroke or cardiac event which came back negative.

                                                Patient has long standing COPD and asthma. He has been stable on his home medications for years. No hospitalizations for these issues in the past. During Covid times he has been very restricted to his home with no visitors. Approximately 5 days after receiving the 2nd Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, he started having increased difficulty with breathing. Over the next few weeks he continued to get worse and required home oxygen and an adjustment with his medications. He was started on steroids and antibiotics about 3 weeks after the vaccine and then hospitalized on 3/16/2021 with COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. He tested negative for Covid at that time. He was in the hospital for 9 days and discharged home on steroid taper and home oxygen. A few days after being at home, he had gradual onset of subacute dementia/delirium. All workup has been negative. MRI/MRA normal. He is currently continuing on oxygen and again on steroids and mental status may be starting to improve.     The concern here is that patient was stable and had been stable on his medication regimen for years. He was doing well until approx 5 days after his second Covid vaccine when he started having worsening pulmonary complaints and eventually ended up in the hospital. He continues to be on oxygen at home and was recently started back on steroids. There has been no explanation for his subacute onset of Dementia/Delirium. MRI/MRA normal. This has been discussed with both Pulmonology and Neurology specialists.

                                                Patient presents today with his wife and son. He was recently hospitalized having developed a fever the day after his Covid vaccine 1 with associated confusion and some ataxia. He was admitted to the hospital overnight where an MRI scan suggested no acute change showing only moderate cerebral atrophy and some small vessel occlusive changes. He tested positive for Covid by PCR in the emergency department on 1/22. His oxygen saturation was stable. He did have a fever and describes falling off the toilet because of some generalized leg weakness and uncoordination. He has had some chronic left greater than right upper extremity sensory loss following prior cervical spine stenosis requiring urgent surgery in 3/2019. He has had some chronic left foot drop as well. He reports being somewhat deconditioned having spent some time in bed to the above episode but is now ambulating with a cane at home and has occupational and physical therapy in place. He has been mildly dyspneic on exertion above baseline but attributes this to some deconditioning. He did have an episode of lower dental pain with ambulation in the office that was more than usual though denies associated chest pain or pressure and has had no jaw or shoulder pain with exertion. Review of systems is negative for headache.

                                                On Tuesday after receiving the vaccine Lowell fell out of bed and was unable to get up. I called 911 and the EMTs helped him up into his wheelchair. Since he has Parkinson&#39;s and has balance problems he is unable to stand on his own for very long. All day Tuesday he was incoherent and fell twice in the bathroom where on the floor he was incontinent of his bowels. Later in the day he was incontinent of urine while sitting in his chair and was unaware of it. Two days later he says he doesn&#39;t recall any of that but his cognition seems to be better now. I think this should be a warning for Parkinson&#39;s patients.

                                                I am a four-year resident of facility and have never experienced a serious illness or traumatic injury in all of my adult life (I turn 86 this year). So on January 23rd I received my initial shot of the Moderna vaccine, for which I experienced no reaction, whatsoever. One month later I returned to hospital for my Moderna Booster shot on Saturday, February 20. I felt a few chills that evening, with nothing to speak about, but awoke on Sunday morning feeling so ill that I could barely sit up in bed. I borrowed my wife?s walker and managed to make it to and from the bathroom, and got back to bed again, whereupon I called my son, an emergency-room physician, who told me to take two Advil tablets (or its equivalent), and welcomed me to the club. I stayed in bed through the rest of Sunday and continued to sleep and rest throughout Monday morning, only feeling well enough to get out of bed without assistance by noon on Monday, thereby missing the February meeting of the monthly meeting that had been scheduled for that morning (and for which I had regularly been a member of and had attended every meeting for over three years). My personal takeaway from all this was that ?the cure was worse than the disease.?

                                                Patient was in usual state of health when received first Covid Moderna vaccine on 2/2/21 and did fine until about 2/17.  He started c/o discomfort and appetite decreased.  2/18/21 had low grade fever.  2/22  fever and generalized weakness and abnormal labs (elevated potassium).  2/22 hydration was started.  2/25 antibiotic started for UTI for 7 days.  Patient seem to improve except appetite.  Since vaccine, patient remained on frequent IV hydration and had poor appetite through February into March.  On 3/2/21, patient received 2nd dose of  Moderna Vaccine while on Augmentin for UTI, issue with dehydration and appetite.  By 3/4/21, patient was noticed to have trouble chewing and swallowing.  Speech was ordered.   On 3/5/21, it was noted patient had continued poor appetite, weakness, dehydration risk, debility.  On 3/8/21, it was noted patient had intermittent confusion.  By 3/10/21, patient was more alert.   Patient remained fairly consistent from that time with poor appetite, dehydration issue, weakness and dysphagia management.  Then on 3/27/21 he became disoriented, wheezing, labored breathing,   Vitals were 92% oxygen on room air, Temp 97.5, 158/62, pulse 94.  Oxygen started and sent to ER.  Family reported patient is admitted to hospital with mild stroke and UTI.   The vaccine seemed to change patient&#39;s state of health about 2 weeks post first dose with multiple sequelae.  This seems similar to timing of actual COVID infection pattern when it is the actual virus.

We had to have help from a man and a women to help get him on the toilet, off the toilet, to sit him up on the couch, getting in and out of bed. He could not function on his own. It effected him mentally. Right now he couldn&#39;t even that this happened. On the 15th he seemed normal. But now like a week later his memory and strength was bad. Today he is not that bad. It seems to be coming and going with the problem mentally. I took him to the doctor today.

His wife got up and he had urinated on himself, and his wife felt his forehead and he did not feel hot.  Went back to bed, he went to sleep and the next morning 2/13/21, wife got up and when he got up around 7:30 he was dressed, but not buttoned right and had his hat on and was confused.  He sat in front of the fireplace not moving, and starting talking nonsense until 9:00 - 9:30 when he started talking to her.  He could not differentiate between morning and night, and then slowly progressed back to normal.  Did not eat much, and said that he could eat anymore.  He was pacing back and forth and then finally cleared mentally and was ok around 10:00 AM.   He is now back to his normal self today 2/16/21.   She gave him 250 mg of Tylenol around 9:30 AM on 2/13/21 as his temp was 100.1.  HIs blood pressure at that time was 103/59 and pulse 100.   She then checked it in the other arm and it was 104/60, pulse 99.  She then checked it again on Monday and it was 108/61 with 68 pulse rate which is normal for him.

He couldn&#39;t give me a clear answer and I don&#39;t know how long he was on the floor.  I noticed he seemed very weak and I asked him when was the last time he had something to eat and he wasn&#39;t sure.  He said maybe 1 or 2 days.  I asked if he didn&#39;t have an appetite and he couldn&#39;t answer me or give me a reason.

He has begun to have mild memory changes after suspected COVID illness (covid testing negative) in November, but daughter of patient, with whom he lives, states that his memory and orientation now significantly changed- he seems to have forgotten the last &#34;3 years&#34; of memory.  Presented to ER 1/16/21 as she checked his O2 and found him to be hypoxic in 60s. He is being treated for possible CAP with underlying perviously undiagnosed ILD vs post-covid lung changes (per pulmonology), and his energy and ability to walk have returned but memory is significantly impaired, confabulating and oriented only to self despite good oxygenation on 5L O2 by NC.

                                                I received a Moderna vaccine injection on January 19, 2021 at approximately 3:15 p.m.  Later that evening at about 7:40 p.m, I was suddenly hit with pain in my back like someone had hit me with a board.  The pain continued to surround the midsection in a swath of about 15 inches.  I felt like my muscles were failing me.  I made it to my bed where I started shivering and shaking uncontrollably feeling like I was having a seizure.  The shaking was sporadic, lasting about an hour. I was covered with a blanket and continued with liquids for dehydration and was given an Xanax to calm nerves. Later that night while attempting to sleep, I was perspiring and my heart was beating 90 to 100 beats hindering sleep.  Through the night I attempted to go to the bathroom but with absolutely no control over my arms and legs I was unable to stand.  Rolling off the bed and unable to pull myself back, I lay on the floor and pulled a cover over me.   At about 4:30 a.m. (Wednesday morning.) I was covered with another blanket and a pillow was put under my head.  I slept until awakened at about 11 a.m  My heart rate and oxygen level was chedked and appeared to be within normal range.  I was greatly fatigued, and light-headed. Continuing a regimen of liquids, I was fed a small amount of soup and some fruit. I ate nothing the rest of the day. I slept most of the day.  In the evening, I was fatigued and nauseated and spent 2-3 hours through the night on my knees in the bathroom attempting to vomit.   Thursday morning I was awakened around 11.a.m. and was barely able to lift my head.  I slept more until needing to use the bathroom and receiving more liquids. Two hours later I was able to eat only a half a piece of toast ? the first and only thing I was able to eat that day.  Early evening having no control of  my legs, I attempted to walk. It was difficult getting legs out of the covers, but I got up and walked a few feet with the help of a walker. However, an hour later (about 8:30) I went to the bathroom and was unable to pull myself up from the toilet and fell to the floor and crawl flat on my stomach to my bed.  I had no strength in my legs and arms and needed assistance from two people to put me on my bed. Periodic rapid heartbeat and fatigue caused restless sleep. Some strength began to return on Friday and with caution over the weekend, and support from a loving family, I appear to be making a slow recovery.  Checking with several family medical people working in hospitals, my experience with the serum seemed more extreme than most.  Therefore, it was felt that I should report some information on how the Moderna injection affected me that it may be of help to others. (Some of the above information was related to me as I was not always cognizant of conditions at particular times.) I am still puzzled, as members of my family are, as to what happened to me.  We would be grateful for any information that might be helpful for us to understand my situation as it relates to others that may have had similar experiences with the Moderna serum.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included  Covid -19  She wants to disclose that her dad was one of the first people to receive the COVID-19 disease on 17March2020. He was hospitalized for 3 weeks because at that time no one knew about the disease and how to treat it. He was positive with COVID-19 for 84 days (16 nasal swabs were done). She kept him in  quarantine until 10June2020 in the basement as  per doctors advice and no known allergies were reported.  Lab data  include   Normal CT Scans. Concomitant medications reported included  gabapentin 400mg Three times a day Eliquis 2.5mg, pantoprazole 40mg, furosemide 40mg ,carvedilol 6.25mg Half a tablet every morning and every night, Tamsulosin 0.4mg, potassium 10mq, hydrocodone 5/325 every day, metformin 1000mg ,zinc 50mg, Vitamin D35000IU, Multivitamin, Vitamin C 1000mg, Magnesium 400, Probiotic.  On 06 Mar 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number  029A21A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  She states that after the first dose on 6Feb2021, her father was admitted to the Hospital  for 8 days due to the vaccine attacking his brain. He had delirium, hallucinations, and constantly did not know where he was due to great confusion. After 8 days in the hospital, he had to go to rehab for 8 days to learn how to walk all over again. The hospital, after testing him over and over again, decided that the vaccine was the cause of his symptoms. His mental symptoms took 5 days to clear.  He took his second shot on 6 Mar 2021, and this time he  was admitted to the ICU due to his symptoms returning 10 fold from the first time he experienced it. Within 4 hours after he took the vaccine, he started saying crazy stuff that doesn&#39;t make sense, then slept a lot and had severe dreams and  hallucinations. She also mentions that her father had very violent behavior and it was very out of  character for him. She states that she believes the vaccine affected the frontal lobe of his brain,  even though both CT scans can through as clear. She discloses the Hospital will not do a MRI for her father since the two CT scans came back clear. She also mentions that he is still reaching for  things and eating things that are not there, she mentions he is very weak and her biggest worry is that this time, he won&#39;t come back to her mentally like he did the first time due to the severity of the symptoms. She believes that because he had the disease for so long, his body has built antibodies to it and he probably was not a good candidate to receive the vaccine.  Her main concern is that the hospital isn&#39;t doing anything for him, that the first time it took 5 days to clear his head, but she is scared that this time he won&#39;t come back to her.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.
