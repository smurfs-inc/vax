At 4AM I went to sleep.  I contactedmy dermatologist.  He suggested the vaccine may have started a Grover&#39;s response.  He asked that I add Zyrtec (over the counter) to my meds.  He asked that I continue hydrating my skin with Vanicream cream.  I folllowed his advice.  The itching stopped on Sunday.  I continued with the Zyrtec but stopped the Gabapintin.   Today, Tuesday, I am having muscle tightening, especially in my legs.

Overnight, his wife woke to him  having an episode of what appeared to be a tonic clonic seizure around 5 am on 2/23/21, followed by a period of disorientation and unresponsiveness consistent with a post ictal state. The patient has no history of seizures. It is unclear if this had anything to do with the Moderna vaccine,  but I am reporting it due to the timing of the episode in conjunction with the vaccine.

                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

But then a fever, chills and aches the day after vaccine. Two days after, still febrile and feeling worse and experiencing shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Fatigue, fever and lightheadedness continue for three more days. On the 6th day post-vaccine, taken to ER and admitted to hospital with a pneumonia and blood counts dangerously low. Received 3 blood transfusions and is receiving 2 different IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Still in hospital and waiting to see how blood counts go. I can?t say the vaccine CAUSED this, but it all happened rapidly, immediately following the vaccine.

The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

By the afternoon, he was so weak he could not lift himself out of the chair. Even with the help of another person, he was too weak to stand. I called for emergency help. He had a fever of 101, was vomiting, very disorientated, confused, could not understand what people were saying to him. At the hospital he continued to feel disorientated, had nausea, dizzyness, a headache, a fever of 104, was dehydrated. He was admitted to hospital and spent one night. Once home, he has begun to regain strength and other symptoms have diminished. Four days after coming home he is feeling stronger and more back to normal.

                                                Hallucinations; Dizziness; Fatigue; Nausea; Vomiting; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning her husband, a 77-year-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On an unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: unknown) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 01 Mar 2021, approximately three days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 03 Mar 2021, after second dose of vaccine, the patient experienced nausea and vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, and hallucinations. The event hallucinations were considered to be medically significant. The patient was also not been out bed for seven days. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not applicable.    The outcome of the events, hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events (dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding these event (hallucination) has been provided at this time. Medical history and concomitant medications are required for assessment. However, further information has been requested. However, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting are expected for mRNA1273.

                                                Received my 1st Covid shot yesterday at 11:45. No problem. Went home and went for a 4 mile walk. Still no problem. At about 2:00 AM this morning I woke up shivering. Added another blanked and turned up the heat. No improvement. Finally got up and woke up my wife. Temperature was 101.7° F. Blood pressure was 149/90. Took some ibuprofen and sat on the sofa with a heating pad on my chest for about two hours. Blood Pressure dropped back to its normal 125/75 (may have been high because I took it the moment I got up) but temp was the same. However, shivering had stopped, so I went back to bed.  When I woke up this morning (about 8:00) temperature was 99.1° F, blood pressure was normal (125/71) and no other symptoms. My arm isn&#39;t sore either. It appears that the elevated temperature was my only reaction from the shot. It&#39;s interesting because during the entire time I did have COVID symptoms, I never had any elevated temperature.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

On 2/25/2021, his left leg weakness became worse. His wife gave him cane and took him to PCP who diagnosed him with BPPV and gave him meclizine.  Next day, he started having jaw stiffness and had difficulty in brushing his teeth.  He was complaining of blurry vision in both eyes.  He denied any double vision.  He stated he could not read things which he was able to read 2 days ago.  A day before he presented to Hospital, he was not able to walk at all and he required walker.  According to his wife, when she went to see him at Hospital around 7 PM on 03/05/2021, his oxygen saturation dropped twice and internist decided to transfer him to ICU. Later on, the decision was made to transfer him to Medical Center.  Pt was intubated, developed diffuse segmental myoclonus, required intense sedation; /ivig ineffective, now giving plasmapheresis.  pt underwent imaging of CNS, LP and extensive laboratory testing.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included type II diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, heart failure, acid reflux, and urinary retention. Concomitant medications included metformin, gabapentin, furosemide, spironolactone, omeprazole, and tamsulosin.   On 06 Jan 2021, hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the evening of 06 Jan 2021, hours after vaccination, the patient began feeling chills and discomfort. Overnight he began to experience night sweats and did not sleep at all.

Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided, although the patient reported he was not sure if he would take the second dose.  The outcome for the events, night sweats and delirium, was considered resolved. The outcome for the events, chills, discomfort, did not sleep at all, and collapsed, was considered resolving. The event, weak, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the events, chills, discomfort, night sweats, did not sleep at all, delirium, collapsed, and weak, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine due to feeling well before the vaccine and feeling more or less disabled after receiving it.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 80-year-old, male subject with medical history of type II diabetes and diabetic neuropathy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of delirium and non-serious unexpected event of asthenia, discomfort, insomnia, fall, and night sweats, and non-serious expected event of chills. The event of discomfort, insomnia, chills and night sweats occurred 1 day; the event of delirium, and fall occurred 2 days and asthenia occurred 6 days after mRNA-1273 administration.  The subject was on metformin for diabetes ty II and gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy, Lasix and spironolactone for heart failure, omeprazole for acid reflux and Flomax for urinary retention. Treatment details not provided. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He then continued to be hypotensive requiring IV fluids and subsequently IV vasopressors. Patient&#39;s BP was stabilized with vasopresor, however he continued to deteriorate clinically with altered mental status and lethargy, concerned for bowel peroration based on physical exam by MD. He was then emergency intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He was then transferred to acute care hospital near by.

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental.

                                                I am a four-year resident of facility and have never experienced a serious illness or traumatic injury in all of my adult life (I turn 86 this year). So on January 23rd I received my initial shot of the Moderna vaccine, for which I experienced no reaction, whatsoever. One month later I returned to hospital for my Moderna Booster shot on Saturday, February 20. I felt a few chills that evening, with nothing to speak about, but awoke on Sunday morning feeling so ill that I could barely sit up in bed. I borrowed my wife?s walker and managed to make it to and from the bathroom, and got back to bed again, whereupon I called my son, an emergency-room physician, who told me to take two Advil tablets (or its equivalent), and welcomed me to the club. I stayed in bed through the rest of Sunday and continued to sleep and rest throughout Monday morning, only feeling well enough to get out of bed without assistance by noon on Monday, thereby missing the February meeting of the monthly meeting that had been scheduled for that morning (and for which I had regularly been a member of and had attended every meeting for over three years). My personal takeaway from all this was that ?the cure was worse than the disease.?

Instead of him using the rollater to come from his bedroom I got the wheel chair out of the care and got him to the table where I fed him a little breakfast.  His blood pressure was low then high (I don&#39;t now have the readings) By 5 pm I called the ambulance.  He was in the hospital until I transferred him to hospice 6 days later.  He died in hospice 4 days after that.

We had to have help from a man and a women to help get him on the toilet, off the toilet, to sit him up on the couch, getting in and out of bed. He could not function on his own. It effected him mentally. Right now he couldn&#39;t even that this happened. On the 15th he seemed normal. But now like a week later his memory and strength was bad. Today he is not that bad. It seems to be coming and going with the problem mentally. I took him to the doctor today.

He has begun to have mild memory changes after suspected COVID illness (covid testing negative) in November, but daughter of patient, with whom he lives, states that his memory and orientation now significantly changed- he seems to have forgotten the last &#34;3 years&#34; of memory.  Presented to ER 1/16/21 as she checked his O2 and found him to be hypoxic in 60s. He is being treated for possible CAP with underlying perviously undiagnosed ILD vs post-covid lung changes (per pulmonology), and his energy and ability to walk have returned but memory is significantly impaired, confabulating and oriented only to self despite good oxygenation on 5L O2 by NC.
