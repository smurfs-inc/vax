It retuned to normal after 6 hours, and then occurred again 1 week later...for 6 hours. I took Bystolic, and about 8 hours later it returned to baseline (about 62/min.  on Sun 1/24/2021, I woke up to bloody diarrhea x several episodes...this continued until Wed 27th, at which time my son (a 4th year graduating MD student) drove me to hospital and I was seen in ER room by MD. I was admitted, and had emergency surgery 1/27/2021 straight from Er Room. I had life saving surgery the next day to stop a lower GI bleed (of unknown origin). I was discharged 3 days later, and I am awaiting more testes, appts, etc.... I have lost time, money, and work from this near death experience... and the tachycardia still needs to be followed up on . I am EXTREMELY upset by these events, as I almost died....was hospitalized, incurred a lot of expense, used up all my sick pay and personal days, and out-of -pocket to my healthcare insurer.

Afterward, the patient experienced no adverse side effects. About 48 hours later, however, at 2pm on March 18th, the patient&#39;s spouse attempted to wake him from a nap. The patient seemed much groggier than normal and his expression appeared vacant. When pressed by his spouse, the patient could not say who he was, or who his wife was. He agreed to travel with his wife to the hospital. At the hospital, a healthcare professional asked the patient who he was. He answered with his correct name. He also correctly identified his spouse by name. But when asked where he was, the patient gave a long and incoherent response. After this initial screening, doctors at the hospital evaluated the patient for a stroke. They ruled this out as a possibility. Next, they suspected the patient&#39;s MS lesions may have contributed to his &#34;cognitive event.&#34; However, after comparing his 2018 scan to a current scan, they determined this was unlikely the cause. After about 24 hours at the hospital, a neurologist hypothesized that the patient had experienced a seizure. Another doctor at the facility concurred with this assessment. By late Friday (more than 24 hours after the episode), the patient had regained most of their cognitive functioning, though he still experienced mild confusion around the week&#39;s events (even preceding the &#34;cognitive event&#34;). Prior to now, the patient has never had a seizure before.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

                                                The night of my vaccination I went to bed early. I was tired and a little achey. I woke up about 2:00 AM with significant discomfort in my chest. My chest felt heavy and when I inhaled it felt like someone was squeezing both lobes of my lungs. I got out of bed and went to the bathroom to urinate. I went back to bed and tried to get back to sleep. The discomfort in my chest continued and seemed to get worse. I got back out of bed at about 2:45 AM and went downstairs where I walked around my living room to see if that would help me feel better. I continued to feel severe discomfort in my chest and lungs. I did not otherwise feel bad. I was not congested. I could  still take a deep breath but it hurt to do so.  I took my temperature and I did not have a fever. At about 3:00 AM I woke up my wife and she drove me to the emergency room at Medical Center. On the car ride to the hospital I started to feel much better. By the time I checked into the emergency room most of my discomfort had dissipated and only a very slight feeling of heaviness remained in my chest.

The chills lasted approximately 3 hours.  The body aches were not severe but lasted 24 hours, as did the shortness of breath.  I did go to work on the the 18th (the morning after the shot), but had to leave work early because I was too short of breath to stand up for very long and I also had trouble focusing on my work.

                                                On Saturday 01/23/2021 morning when I got out of bed I experienced difficulty maintaining my balance. I had to use a wall to be able to stand. I did not fall. I stumbled into the bathroom, still unsteady. I urinated sitting down, still feeling unsteady, head spinning. I took my blood pressure 130/70, which is normal. Was feeling steadier. Was able to walk down stairs to ground floor of home. Still not felling normal, but steady on my feet. After eating breakfast, no additional symptoms through day. I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages over the past week. When I went to bed Sat night, lying in bed I was light headed. Sunday morning same problems. I performed some vehicle maintenance and would get down on the ground. Head would start spinning, everything would return to normal once standing. At bedtime same feelings when lying down in bed. Monday morning (today) same problems.

Medical history included treatment for tuberculosis and dialysis. Concomitant medication included calcium acetate, Renvela, glipizide, omeprazole, aspirin, vitamin D, losartan, furosemide, rifampin, and Sensipar.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 030L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13 Jan2021, the patient tested negative for COVID-19). On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, and feeling weird/funny. On 17Jan2021, the patient experienced difficulty breathing and swelling. On 18 Jan 2021, the patient declined dialysis, was tired and wanted to lay down. At 8 am, the patient was found nonresponsive and cold and is believed to have passed away around 4 am. The coroner tested the deceased for COVID-19 and the test was positive. No autopsy was reported. No death certificate was issued at the time of the report but the reporter believes it will list cause of death as COVID complications.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events of limb discomfort, feeling abnormal, dyspnea, fatigue, swelling, unresponsive to stimuli, body temperature abnormal, was fatal.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient was died. Cause of death was COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events developed on four days after first dose of mRNA-1372. Dyspnea, unresponsive to stimuli, and death were consistent with infection in pandemic set up confounded by age of patient and refusal of dialysis Cause of death was reported as COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided. Based on reporter&#39;s causality the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: COVID-19

The appointment was at 4:00pm.  I left at 3:45 to go pick her up.  Around 4:30pm I knew that I was lost and had no idea where I was at. I finally came across a main highway that took me to my targeted location. I went into a store to ask the clerk directions. I&#39;ve lived in town for over 46 years, yet I had no idea where I was at. Very scary.

His wife joined him to help at about 12:15 AM and she found him to be disoriented and confused. He has no memory of what happened during the preceding 45 minutes. No indication of any fall or injury. He had no preceding medical problems. No medications. Had received his 1st Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at about 5:30 PM on 2/13. His wife took him to a local ER. No focal findings on neuro exam. His confusion gradually improved over the next 24-36 hours but he still can?t remember what happened at the beginning of the episode. Head CT revealed an incidental 6 mm colloid cyst in the 3rd ventricle. Transferred to Hospital for further evaluation and monitoring where seen by Neurosurg and Neurology. Had MRI and EEG. No arrhythmia on ECG or telemetry. Neurology felt the episode was due to transient global amnesia. Discharged on 2/16.

                                                I am allergic to polyethylene glycol ?  it actually put me in the hospital for years ago. I had no idea it was in the vaccine, although a smaller amount than I had taken before. I started experiencing severe and awful anxiety and panic that night I got the vaccine. I had other minor side effects that were expected but they went away within a day. Several days later, I began experiencing pain in both my bilateral Achilles tendons and bilateral knee pain. A physical therapist examined both and said that I was swollen. I have had both of those problems under control for a very long time. I am improving somewhat  but nearly 2 weeks later I am still having some repercussions. I am now scared and don&#39;t know if I should get the second injection done because the previous adverse symptoms were awful. Thank you.

Cannot sleep much at night. Dry cough. No wt changes or LE pain/swelling. No f/c. No ill contacts. No chest pain currently. Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis.

On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

                                                Pt received 1st dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 01/04/2021 in L deltoid. Came back to clinic at 0800 on 01/06/2021 c/o excruciating pain in entire L arm radiating to neck, chest, and around his upper and lower back. States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

He has allergies to bees/egg and a h/o anaphylaxis 2/2 receiving an injection of penicillin in the past. Discussed that prior h/o anaphylaxis to PCN injection was not a contraindication to this vaccination, but is a precaution. Discussed risks of receiving the vaccination vs benefits of the vaccine, which patient states &#34;I already had this discussion with Dr.!&#34; He has multiple comorbidities which place him at a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. Again received the risk vs benefit discussion. Patient stated understanding and desire to proceed with the vaccination.

At 45 minutes later, staff alerted that he was c/o palpitations. Due to confusion and weakness, we were unable to transport him to an examination room. Oxygen, water, and vitals machine were brought to him. He presented with SOB, confusion, lightheadedness. Exam demonstrated acute distress, speaking in staccato sentences. HR in 80s, with lungs CTAB and no stridor - despite increased RR to 20s. Vitals with HR in 70s, SpO2 remained 97% or greater on RA. BP was initially 140/72. A code blue was called and Drs. presented to the area. Patient c/o itchy throat and still p/w confusion/combativeness, loss of orientation, and SOB. No visible swelling noticed. At around 13:58, patient syncopized. HR and SpO2 remained 70-80s and &gt;98% on room air respectively. Pulse remained palpable. At that time, an epipen was administered. Patient woke up. During the entire episode, he was able to recognize a staff member with whom he was previously familiar. EMS arrived, vitals remained stable.

When I arrived at the donor center to give a monthly platelet donation my blood pressure was extremely high, 184/104.  My average blood pressure varies with an average of 135/80.  Never above 150/90.  It has stayed relatively high, though a late-day glass of red wine seems to bring the blood pressure lower.

A few days later the redness traveled down to his forearm and a bumpy rash also appeared from the injection site to the forearm. The client reports that his arm is so itchy that he has not slept much since 01/28/2021. The client sought medical attention on 02/17/2021 and was put on a prednisone taper. The client indicates he feels the rash and itchiness is &#34;a little better&#34;. The client&#39;s medical provider told him to RTC if symptoms were not improving. The client reports that he feels they are improving and he is not going  to see his medical provider at this time.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                Out of know where on 1-13-21 awoke at 3:00 AM with severe anxiety which has continued to date, 1-31-21 but not as severe.  Unable to sleep, no matter what medication given.   At beginning had high blood pressure which is unusual for me and heart palpitations.  Had two trips to the ER , 1-13-21  9:00 PM, released  and  1-15-21 10:00  PM and admitted, kept for one day.   Heart palpitations decreased within the first week and blood pressure came down to normal.    Unable to sleep, after being given Hydroxyzine Hydrochloride-25mg and later Alprazolam-.5 mg.   Tried taking herbs before taking Alprazolam due to the addiction factor.  Took Kava , Deep Sleep and CBD.  Took Alprazolam after herbs didn&#39;t seem to help but it made me feel bad and didn&#39;t help with the sleep so went to over the counter sleep aid.

                                                2/16/2021:  Telephone call to PCP/DR: I.  This is all a little strange. Especially with the fever. I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.  He was told to go back on Mycophenolate which he started on Friday. Left hand pain from palm to wrist on Saturday.  Some shoulder pain on the left and right side.  Sunday pain got worse.  Went to the ER at hospital yesterday.  Dx&#39;d with carpal tunnell syndrome and gave him a wrist brace. He is taking tylenol/ibuprofen (200mg two tabs q 8 hours) as directed. Temp was 99.8 yesterday.  Temp is 99.5 this morning altho he is taking ibu/tylenol as directed. His wife reports he has traveling pain.  Today is pain is in the Right hand and right shoulder.  No left sided pain today.  Today he is able to hold a spoon in the left hand. He had a &#34;real rough night last night&#34;, didn&#39;t sleep much. She has called Rheum but hasn&#39;t heard from them. Okay to put him in with NP? For ER follow up?  Or should something else be done? 2/19/2021: Call to office PCP/DR. His wife called saying that he went to the emergency room for severe pain in his left hand and swelling he could not hang on to anything.   The pain started on Friday and kept getting worse all weekend . The er told him that it was carpel tunnel and gave him a wrist splint.  His wife says that she call his rheumatologist and they started him on prednisone 40 X 3 days, 30 X3 days, 20 X 3 days, 10 for 3 days then stop.  She states that now he is having traveling pain it went into his left shoulder and arm. Now it is in his right shoulder and hand the right hand is very swollen can not make a fist. This am she states that he is limping on the right leg the cord in the back is very painful,  She then states that now that she thinks about it over a week ago in the evening he told her several nights that he was having difficulty swallowing first it was on the left side then the right side of his throat he did salt water gargles and was fine in the morning but it has continued to come back every night she states now he is saying that it fells like there is something in his throat.  Since yesterday it is on the left side of his throat.  She is call the rheumatologist but wonders what you think. 2/19/2021: OV with PCP see previous.

                                                Possible MSG reaction, probably aggravated after vaccination.   Had meal approx. 1 hour before vaccination.   After vaccination (roughly 45 minutes), felt &#34;foggy&#34; feeling, akin to being drunk.   After looking for possible links to vaccine, and given that the reaction seemed like a strong reaction previously attributed to  MSG, searched the ingredients listed by the caterer and found that a side dish listed MSG.   ~~  Drove home without incident.  &#34;Foggy&#34; feeling dissipated after a few hours.   No significant reaction to the vaccine itself except slightly sore arm.

Around the 4th day he started having a tickling  and numbness around the mouth area.  On 3/1/2021 he felt a difference and could tell something was going.  He went to see his PCP on 3/2/2021.  He was diagnosed w/ Bells Palsy.  He did not give him any meds that day.  When he got home his symptoms got worse.  He contacted his PCP which then prescribed steroids and baclofen.  Pt is applying warm compresses and messages.  He has also had acupuncture.  His left eyebrow is downward and the left side of his mouth is drooping.  He feels like he has sand in left eye.

I hobbled/hopped to the hall calling out to my wife and  slid along the wall to the floor rubbing my leg and calf. After a few minutes I regained mobility and have not had that same experience. I have hadintervals of sharp aching in the hip joint and calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to experience a numbness/tingling from the injection site to my elbow as well as along my left leg and a general weakness in my left arm. After waiting a few weeks to see if things would change,I reported it anecdotally to our Infection Control Nurse and she advised me to report to VAERS.

Was confused , trying to give me his remote to do what with I wasn&#39;t sure.  He had trouble with getting ideas across.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal for him.  However, we called him this morning at 8:45 am and he was lucid, he stated that when he went home around 4 pm , his left arm , hand and face were numb.  He stated that he could not pick up his cap with his left hand.  Today he woke and feels normal.  He was lucid and able to present ideas in a normal manner.  He vaguely remembers coming back to the clinic yesterday.

He couldnt put words together to make a sentence.  He got up to go into the kitchen and then urinated all over himself.  He was worried about falling sleep, scared he would die in his sleep.  The 3rd woke up and was feeling some better but still foggy headed.  Pt went to the ER about 5 days later.  They did a CT and blood work.  He thinks the tests results came back negative. They wanted him to stay longer and maybe see a Neurologist but since there wasnt one available to see at that time the pt decided to go home.  He has blood work and urine labs to be done at the facility on 2/23/2021.  Pt states he is feeling better at this time.

                                                felt so bad; severe chest pain; Chest pain and arm pain; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning her husband, a 71-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced abnormal feeling, severe chest pain,  and arm pain.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included the patient had a heart attack on 26 May 2020 and on October 2020 the patient had five bypass, two arteries they took. Since October the patient&#39;s condition was stated to be great. Concomitant medications reported included Insulin Bovine, Multivitamins [vitamins Nos], acetylsalicylic acid and Medication related to patient&#39;s heart attack.  On 12 Feb 2021, unspecified days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:007M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Feb 2021, post receiving mRNA-1273, the patient had no reaction and did not feel bad.  On unspecified day in Feb 2021 one week prior to the reporting the events, the patient experienced chest pain and arm pain, minimum that lasted for 10 minutes. 3 or 4 night prior reporting the event, the patient was feeling abnormal, went to ER and was hospitalized with severe chest pain. The patient was in a regular room and was transferred to ICU. Next day, Cardiac catheterization was performed to see the patient&#39;s heart and found that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing.  Treatment for the event, severe chest pain included morphine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event of arm pain was considered Recovered/Resolved.  The events, abnormal feeling, severe chest pain were considered as unknown. The patient is still hospitalized.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old, male patient, who experienced severe chest pain, feeling abnormal. Cardiac catheterization was performed which showed that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack (May 2020) and bypass (October 2020) confounds the causality. Further information has been requested.

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

                                                About 30 minutes after the administration of the vaccine, his case manager came to ask for assistance because the client was feeling unsteady and his speech seemed slower than it normally is.  She was worried about an allergic reaction.  He did seem a little shaky.  They had him sit on a bench outside for fresh air.  He said this was helping.  I took his radial HR.  It was regular, 70 bpm.  I was unable to get his blood pressure due to a broken cuff.  He was feeling much better at that point.  He did eat breakfast.  He said his arm felt fine.  No rash or hives observed and no shortness of breath.   His case worker brought him some water.  We sat there for about 15 minutes.  He felt much better and the case worker said he seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.

(I tested positive on 12/22/20 with symptoms  starting 12/19/2020 and quarantined with a back-to-work date of 12/29/20.  The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..  Made me react to steady myself for just a second.

Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the vaccination her husband met with his son.  He reported that his dad did not know anything.  His wife told the son to bring him to Hospital.  They brought him to the hospital and got there and his son said that he had called the daughter and he did not know the day, month, his grandson&#39;s name, like he wasn&#39;t there.  He had a funny look on his face that he was &#34;out of it&#34;.  Asked simple questions about pet at home, favorite and could not remember the name of the cat.  He then came out and said that he was fine. They ran tests for a mini-stroke, CT scan, blood work.  They had a consult with Neurology, virtual.  The neurologist did some questioning, and by 3:00 they felt that it was like a mini-stroke, and she said that she felt it was from the vaccination as it occurred right after the vaccine.  She took him home, and told him to take a nap.  By 4:30 PM she woke him up and said that they were going to eat, she was getting things ready.  He was sitting on the couch about 5:00 PM and had that blank stare again.  He went walking through the house walking aimlessly and started fumbling through papers .  She called 9-1-1 and within 10 minutes they took him to the ER.  It took her an hour to get to the hospital, his daughter met them at the ER.  He told them that he was fine, and they knew that he was not.  By 7:00 PM they were going to do an MRI and wanted to admit him to the hospital.  All of a sudden at 9:00 he was having another episode.  She got the nurse and they watched him and decided that he was having a seizure, (agitation, not making sense.).  The entire episode lasts for about 30 minutes.  They did an MRI and an EEG, which she does not have the results of.   On 2/11/21 she talked to the neurologist who insisted it was due to the vaccine.  He has now settled down and has not had another seizure since 9:00 PM the night before.   He was discharged yesterday at around 1:00 PM, he slept, got up and is fine this morning.  He was diagnosed with seizures, and to FU with Dr. in Epilepsy clinic, and prescribed Keppra, which he has not taken as he feels it was due to the vaccination..   He does not remember the events that took place.

No muscle ache. After vaccination I lifted weights, stretched arm and took very cold and very warm showers on the area. My theory was dispurse the concentration to avoid the muscle ache. Maybe so. But it may have lead to full body adverse event.

                                                Extreme sensitivity / intolerance to  loud sounds.  During the cleaning of  my house by people who have been doing it for years I found that the sounds of a vacuum cleaner working and normal conversations between the cleaners and my wife and daughter became almost intolerable.  I was unable to concentrate on work I was doing and had to go to a room where those sounds were significantly less.  I have never before experience this intolerance to customary sound levels.  The intolerance passed within about three hours of when I noticed it.

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

                                                One week after 2nd Moderna, started coughing periodically in day and night chest conjestion started to build at night. After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?

He was diagnosed with fluid near his hip joint at the hospital and was discharged the same day. The next day, March 7 he was still in pain but able to walk with assistance. On March 8 he got an x-ray from an orthopedic physician and severe arthritis was found. March 10 the severe pain persisted, but he was able to walk with a walker.
