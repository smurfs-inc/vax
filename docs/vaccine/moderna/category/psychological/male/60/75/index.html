Onset of symptoms occurred in the early morning hours the day after receiving the vaccine.  Symptoms completely resolved by the next morning.  Treatment was conservative with Tylenol, rest, and hydration.  I missed one day of work due to this brief episode.  I am a SARS COVID survivor who had a very severe / life threatening case of SARS COVID 19.    I was hospitalized and treated from March 28, 2020 to May 16, 2020.

Insomnia that night accompanying whole-body aches/pains/malaise.  Pain most notable in extremities. Nausea more significant at 12 hours (i.e. 6AM) but no vomiting. Significant lethargy all day 1/22/2021. Pain/nausea gone by 6PM but lethargy remained.  Slept most of the day. Symptoms gone by following morning (1/23/2021), so roughly 36 hours.   Overall these were symptoms consistent with a really bad case of the flu, minus the respiratory symptoms.  I often work through illnesses like the flu.  Couldn?t work through this.

It retuned to normal after 6 hours, and then occurred again 1 week later...for 6 hours. I took Bystolic, and about 8 hours later it returned to baseline (about 62/min.  on Sun 1/24/2021, I woke up to bloody diarrhea x several episodes...this continued until Wed 27th, at which time my son (a 4th year graduating MD student) drove me to hospital and I was seen in ER room by MD. I was admitted, and had emergency surgery 1/27/2021 straight from Er Room. I had life saving surgery the next day to stop a lower GI bleed (of unknown origin). I was discharged 3 days later, and I am awaiting more testes, appts, etc.... I have lost time, money, and work from this near death experience... and the tachycardia still needs to be followed up on . I am EXTREMELY upset by these events, as I almost died....was hospitalized, incurred a lot of expense, used up all my sick pay and personal days, and out-of -pocket to my healthcare insurer.

I remained in bed until about 4pm 2/5/21 &amp; soaked in a hot bath which relieved the joint pains.  Headache, nausea &amp; weakness continued 2/6/2021 &amp; 2/7/2021 with the headaches coming if any sudden movements such as coughing or standing up too fast &amp; nausea irritated by eating anything but saltine crackers.  Today is 2/7/2021, took sick days from work 2/5, 2/6 &amp; 2/7.

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

                                                The patient was given his vaccine at 11:40am and a few minutes later 11:43am he said he was feeling very flushed and off. He said this extremities (hands and feet) felt hot and blotchy which is not normal for him (he does have neuropathy). He was sitting down for a couple minutes and I gave him water to drink just to calm down if it had been anxiety, but it did not seem to help. He started to complain of his heart pounding and beating rapidly. He said he was sweating and just felt very strange. I asked if he was short of breath at all which he denied. I immediately called 911 to have him be checked out and make sure he was ok since his symptoms had been going on for a few minutes, he was still complaining, and was not resolved with sitting or drinking a cold water. The patient did state that he had not eaten yet today (he does intermittent fasting and normally does not eat until 2pm), he did not take his blood pressure medication atenolol, and had driven about an hour here with his mother as she also got the vaccine today. While waiting for the ambulance I took his blood pressure which was very high 187/95mmHg which the patient confirmed is high for him. The ambulance arrived within 10 minutes and they checked him out. He did decline to go to the hospital after a thorough evaluation. The patient left once the paramedics cleared him at about 12:35pm so he was sitting and being monitored for a good 45 minutes before he left the store. The patient was never given any meds during this process and was cleared to go home by paramedics.

Went to ER and was given EKG, Chest X-Ray, and blood tests to check for heart attack. Symptoms subsided after a bit. Labs were inconclusive. Sent home. Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

Uncomfortable but never to the point of difficulty breathing. ~08:30, BP 128/99 (I think) Systolic up only a bit.  Diastolic very high for me sent to urgent care part of clinic.   Monitored BP, oxygen, did EKG (normal), symptoms started easing ~ 09:40.  Sent home. Attending PA though it might just be a Vaso-Vagel response, but, after hundreds upon hundred of needles, I&#39;ve never had such a response, and, my symptoms did not involve a low BP, fainting or nausea, rather I remained conscious, had throat constriction with increased BP and a narrowed pulse pressure  range.

                                                On March 16th at roughly 1:30pm, the patient received his first dose of the COVID19 Moderna vaccine. Afterward, the patient experienced no adverse side effects. About 48 hours later, however, at 2pm on March 18th, the patient&#39;s spouse attempted to wake him from a nap. The patient seemed much groggier than normal and his expression appeared vacant. When pressed by his spouse, the patient could not say who he was, or who his wife was. He agreed to travel with his wife to the hospital. At the hospital, a healthcare professional asked the patient who he was. He answered with his correct name. He also correctly identified his spouse by name. But when asked where he was, the patient gave a long and incoherent response. After this initial screening, doctors at the hospital evaluated the patient for a stroke. They ruled this out as a possibility. Next, they suspected the patient&#39;s MS lesions may have contributed to his &#34;cognitive event.&#34; However, after comparing his 2018 scan to a current scan, they determined this was unlikely the cause. After about 24 hours at the hospital, a neurologist hypothesized that the patient had experienced a seizure. Another doctor at the facility concurred with this assessment. By late Friday (more than 24 hours after the episode), the patient had regained most of their cognitive functioning, though he still experienced mild confusion around the week&#39;s events (even preceding the &#34;cognitive event&#34;). Prior to now, the patient has never had a seizure before.

Within 30 minutes I had a fever of 100.9, was extremely weak and sleepy, had the worst sore throat and radiating down in my memory.  It was difficult to even speak.  I have donated blood in decades and never had an adverse event.

                                                I recieved the first Moderna Covid 19 Vaccine 1/08/2021 and there were no problems. The second Covid 19 Vaccine on 2/05/2021 went the same but after approximately two weeks I noticed soreness between my miidle and ring finger on my left hand along with soreness but thought nothing of it. the Pain eventually got worse. I went to my doctor on 3/25/2021 and was prescribed Naproxin and Voltaren Gel. The discomfort in my left had continues continues. There is selling above this area and the inside of my hand below those fingers hurts and my hand when I close it feels tight and this I atribute to the swelling. My doctor ran labs and all were negative even for Gout. There is a dense feeling in my left upper arm that comes and goes and some tingling. My left hand will have a burning feeling on the ring finger knuckle and experience pain when I fully open my hand. I have not injured my left hand in any way. I find it very unusual because I am right handed. I would appreciate any assistant if possible. I can send photographs if needed of my hand.

I knew something was wrong with my cognition but could not articulate it to my girlfriend at the time.  My memory of those conversations is fuzzy.  Symptoms lasted about three hours with no recurrence since.  Best description is that I didn&#39;t completely wake up from a dream state - could not clearly distinguish between what was real and what was left over from my dream.  Very strange; have never experienced anything like it.

A CT of the head (4/11/2021) was completed which demonstrated No acute intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection or acute territorial infarct. Suggestion of a chronic lacunar infarct involving the left lentiform nucleus. Regions of low attenuation involving the cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left, which, allowing for image degradation secondary to patient motion artifact, are likely artifactual in nature; follow-up is recommended to assess for stability/resolution.For first several days patient suffered delirium with agitation, he was disoriented to place and time.  CK on admission, 4/11/2021, was 17,086, indicating rhabdo.  Creatinine on admission was 4.39, indicating new acute renal failure. Liver enzymes were elevated with AST of 477 and ALT of 218.

Over several days his mentation improved however was noted to still need light supplemental oxygenation.  Because of the delirium a brain MRI was completed on 4/13/2021, which demonstrated acute ischemic infarcts on DWI sequence noting bilateral, right greater than left, acute cerebellar infarcts. Small acute lacunar infarcts at bilateral basal ganglia/genu internal capsule.  Due to the infarcts a stroke workup was completed. Carotid duplex was performed and notable for only small bilateral carotid plaque.  Renal ultrasound unremarkable.  A CTA of the chest was completed on 4/15/2021 for continued hypoxemia, need for nasal cannula to maintain spo2 saturation.  Findings included multilobar pulmonary embolism.  Venous duplex dopplers of the lower extremities were also completed on 4/15/2021 demonstrated an isolated left popliteal vein DVT. No evidence of right leg DVT.  Over several days CK and Cr returned to baseline / normal levels.  He remains hospitalized and is still undergoing treatment.

You just lie there, hot, and ache all over, then this wave of chills hits for maybe 5 seconds then dissipates. The 2 mins later, it happens again! And this goes on for  an hour or more! I had to pee but was worried I?d be too cold to stand still. So I waited until I could not wait anymore. OMG! Trying to stand up! It?s as if my joints no longer worked! And when I did stand up I was dizzy as hell! The next day, utter exhaustion. I am so weak, it takes effort to move. Even breathing took work! I didn?t sleep all night as every position I lay in was uncomfortable and had twinges of chills. The amount of energy it takes to physically get up and walk to the bathroom is dumbfounding! This morning I am achy, hot and cold, exhausted, and just had a bout of dry heaves. I?m hoping to be able to get some sleep today.

                                                He got his vaccine, had extreme pain in his right arm.  He went back to the pharmacy and let her know that it hurt for several days and then went away, and he is still having the tenderness in the arm.  It was so painful that he could not sleep on it due to the pain.   He then had no problems up until 5/24/21 when he noticed some swelling on his ankle of his right leg.  He put it in cold water to see if the swelling would go down and it did not.  Then he didn&#39;t think about it again until it was stiff, swollen and wanted to turn to the right side and hard for him to drive and taking his anti-inflammatories.  It progressively got worse and around 5/25/21 the swelling was severe and doubled in size and getting worse and on 6/3/21 he could not get his pants off due to the swelling and he went to the Dr. The next day.  He had pain behind the knee, ankle, pain in the leg.  He went to the doctor, and they sent him to the ER for an US which showed DVT of the right leg.  He was informed that it was large and that it was in the thigh of his right leg and not returning blood to his heart.  He was put on Eliquis 5 mg twice a day and is doing well for him.  The swelling is a little better, the ankle is still swollen, and the leg is still swollen, the top of his foot is really bad, front of his leg and thigh.  The knee does not seem to be swollen, but the thigh is.   He has no problem with the left side.  He is to follow up with his doctor on Thursday.  He is on Hydrocodone as well for the pain as needed for his neck pain and lower back.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

I called them and they had me marked down for no show but once I explained they set up another follow up appointment.

                                                The night of my vaccination I went to bed early. I was tired and a little achey. I woke up about 2:00 AM with significant discomfort in my chest. My chest felt heavy and when I inhaled it felt like someone was squeezing both lobes of my lungs. I got out of bed and went to the bathroom to urinate. I went back to bed and tried to get back to sleep. The discomfort in my chest continued and seemed to get worse. I got back out of bed at about 2:45 AM and went downstairs where I walked around my living room to see if that would help me feel better. I continued to feel severe discomfort in my chest and lungs. I did not otherwise feel bad. I was not congested. I could  still take a deep breath but it hurt to do so.  I took my temperature and I did not have a fever. At about 3:00 AM I woke up my wife and she drove me to the emergency room at Medical Center. On the car ride to the hospital I started to feel much better. By the time I checked into the emergency room most of my discomfort had dissipated and only a very slight feeling of heaviness remained in my chest.

While in bathroom, became dizzy, broke into sweats, and felt I was about to faint. I went to my knees holding onto counter. My wife came in to help me in bathroom. She observed I was incoherent but uttering moaning sounds and breathing heavily. She called 911. While on phone I came to and vomited into sink. It appeared I had not digested anything from dinner that night. After vomiting (1x) I felt much better.  First responders reported normal vital signs. I did not go to E.R. that night but went to Urgent Care later that morning and all seemed fine.

On Monday, March 1st I went to my primary doctor and gave Prednisone, Gabapentin and Meloxicam tablets then I was given 9 days off from work. Up to the present, I&#39;m under physical therapy  and I still have on and off pain on my left leg.

These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

Approx 10 hrs post-vacc, sore arm &amp; feeling that my body was &#34;fighting something&#34; (much as after other vaccs/inf post-BMT (shingrix, reclast). At 12 hrs post-vacc, feeling feverish, chills, body aches, trouble sleeping, temp=98.6, pulse=72 (unusual for me. Normal vitals: temp=97.2 to 97.5, pulse=55-62). Trouble sleeping throughout the first night, only 5 hrs sleep maximum. Next morning, at 23 hrs post-vacc, continued trouble sleeping, body aches, chills, sore arm, temp=99.7, pulse=90 (at complete rest, very unusual for me). FYI, i was well hydrated. At 27 hrs post-vacc all same symptoms plus headache, significant malaise, brain fog, remained in bed all day, temp=99.5, pulse=75. Fever.....Fever broke at aprox 35 hrs post-vacc, began to feel a bit better, temp=98.7, pulse=78.  At 38 hrs post-vacc (4/10 at 2:00am), i got up from bed to pee, feeling alot better &amp; vitals approaching normal, temp=97.8, pulse=58.  At 43 hrs post-vacc (4/10 @ 9am), feeling tired but otherwise recovered, vitals back to my normal ranges: temp=97.2, pulse=56.  FYI, after dose #1 of Moderna covid-19 vacc, i had sore arm, mild feeling that my body was &#34;fighting something,&#34; and trouble sleeping the first night, but NO fever and no other adverse symptoms.

Starting starting 54 hours after the vaccine, chills began to recur, accompanied by severe indigestion and gas.  In the evening of the third day after the vaccine, chills were extreme and excessive stomach gas and bloating was experienced, with occasional sharp gas pains in the abdomen.  While the gas symptoms moderated overnight, they returned in the afternoon and overnight of day 4. Experiencing fatigue, but this could be related to lack of sleep due to the symptoms. This is day 5 and the gas and bloating remain but appear to be moderating.

                                                a 62 y/o M  who presents with concerns for an allergic reaction to the second dose of the Covid vaccine.  According to him he got the vaccine around 8:45 AM.  He has a history of anaphylactic type reactions with a swelling and urticaria in the past but has not had any symptoms in the last 5 years.  He felt sudden onset pit in his stomach, tingling and warm sensations over his face and some chest tightness.  He denies all the symptoms currently.  He did get medications prior to arrival but states his symptoms were already getting better before he been given anything.  He was given epinephrine as well as Benadryl beforehand.  He denies any symptoms currently.  Denies headache, change in vision, difficulty swallowing, lightheadedness or vertigo, chest pain, sore throat, wheezing, cough, nausea or vomiting, rash, falls or injuries.  Denies any recent foreign travel or sick contacts.  He did work a full shift yesterday and was coming off a 24-hour shift prior to getting his vaccination. He denies any significant reactions to the first vaccine.   Medical Decision Making  On initial presentation is an overall well-appearing 62-year-old male who has normal vital signs without fever or tachycardia.  He is presenting with concern for allergic reaction of the field to a recent vaccination.  The vaccine was given roughly 1 hour prior to arrival. He was given epinephrine intramuscularly as well as IV Benadryl.  He states he is currently feeling mildly tired from the Benadryl. He denies any other recurrent symptomatology and feels better.  Examination is not concerning for anaphylaxis at this time, no evidence of airway involvement or multisystem involvement.  No evidence of local allergic reaction.  Low clinical concern for occult infection, metabolic abnormality, ACS or arrhythmia for a cause of his symptoms.  He is overall very well-appearing.  Labs have been obtained as part of screening for reactions to the vaccination per CDC recommendations including a tryptase and C4 complement.  They were drawn over an hour after the vaccine was administered. ECG was within normal limits.  After observation patient remained asymptomatic.  Did offer steroids, however he wanted to hold off on them as he just got his vaccination which seems appropriate at this time.  He was sent home with a new EpiPen.  We also gave him follow-up in the allergy clinic.  He has any worsening symptoms we do recommend he use the EpiPen as well as call 911.  He is understanding.  At this point he stable for outpatient management.  I did tell him he should expect to feel aches and potentially have inflammatory response to the vaccine, he is understanding of this.  Pt was discharged home/self-care. Pt provided strict return precautions, including but not limited to, any worsening symptoms or any new concerning symptoms. Otherwise, Pt instructed to see PCP on an as needed basis.

The chills lasted approximately 3 hours.  The body aches were not severe but lasted 24 hours, as did the shortness of breath.  I did go to work on the the 18th (the morning after the shot), but had to leave work early because I was too short of breath to stand up for very long and I also had trouble focusing on my work.

I needed to take Tylenol through the night which did help with headache.  The symptoms were significantly decreased by 6 pm that day (Feb 24th).

Next day was again extremely achy and that night i went to bed right after supper and slept 12 hours,  Again very achy and again sweat the bed all night and woke up on Monday just fine.  Aches are gone but have continued to sweat the bed each night.  Not dramatically but just slightly these past 2 nights

                                                I had the Covid virus early in November 2020 I had a bad reaction to my 1st Covid shot and wanted to ask if I should get the second one? I was able to get an appointment for a Covid vaccination thru store/pharmacy. I had the shot about 4:00 on Friday. On Saturday about noon I started not to feel right; head ache and stomach. About 4:00 I started to get an increase in my temperature. At 5:30 I started getting uncontrollable shaking. Over a span of about 30 minutes I had 4 or 5 episodes that lasted 30 - 45 seconds. I had a temperature at one point that reached 102.3 I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen every three hours before falling asleep for the night. On Sunday morning I still had a slight temperature (99.9), but it seemed like all my body joints ached. I ended up feeling better about 4:00 on Sunday. Reply

I was unable to sleep due to the symptoms the first night.   I convalesced the entire next day and tired easily for the next two days after that.  Here&#39;s the unusual side affect:  I had uncontrollable and very painful leg cramps, that I could not relax. I had to take a muscle relaxer.  That was the night of the second vaccine.  The cramps were abated thereafter. I am reporting them because I saw them as a side effect no where online.

                                                About 14 hours after I received my second injection of the Moderna vaccine, I woke up feeling a little feverish and quite achy all over. I felt worse over the next hour or so, got out of bed and stayed up for about four hours, feeling chills, headache and the body aches (which centered on my bad back). I took half of one of my pain pills (acetaminophen and oxycodone), and half of a Acetaminophen p.m., and I dozed off for an hour or so. When I awoke from my short nap, I felt better - just exhausted from lack of sleep. The entire episode of side effects lasted only about six/seven hours, throughout the overnight. After that, I was only tired. the rest of that day. Thanks for all you are doing for so many of us out here who believe deeply in science and medicine. Stay safe!

Worked that day and went home, woke up around 2 am with sweats and nausea and headache which became progressively worse through the day prohibiting any activity. Dry heaves and severe headache with dizziness lasted until 4 pm or so. I did take Ondansetron at 12 noon to limit nausea. Worked the following day with few physical symptoms but very irritable. The next day (Saturday) woke with headache and slight nausea which became worse as the day wore on, limiting activity but I was able to get chores done, though I was very lethargic. The next day was much better. Worked on Monday the 12th of April and felt well. Fell ill again with similar but less severe symptoms, though marked nausea and dry heaving again. Slept until approximately 2pm and started writing this report. 4/13/2021

Headache off and on started Sunday 3/21/2021.  No medication taken for headache.  On Tuesday evening 3/23/2021, driving home from work had a sensation of something being wrong.  After arriving home at 7 pm had a short term memory loss.  Could not remember details of the day, for instance, or that he&#39;d already had the Moderna shot three days prior.  Was driven to the emergency room at about 9:30 pm.  Memory gradually improved over the hours following the spell.  They kept him in hospital until 3/25/2021, doing tests to rule out stroke, seizure, brain tumor etc.  All tests came back negative.  Was diagnosed with Transient Global Amnesia.

He came inside to sit in his recliner with his feet elevated for almost an hour.  At approximately 9:40 am, his wife observed that patient suddenly stiffened without warning and cried out. His arms stretched over his head in the chair and his legs stiffened like a board. His body was visibly contracted.  He continued to cry out. His eyes were closed, he was salivating, and his forehead was sweating.  His wife watched him move his arms suddenly to his lap, however, his fists were clenched tight.  She tried to get his attention by calling to him. She noticed his lips were turning blue. She continued shaking him, shouting and then slapped him. Patient did not respond.  She called 911. After 7 minutes, he finally relaxed some and started snoring loudly in the chair. He continued sleeping soundly for about 10 minutes while she waited for EMS to arrive.  The wife did elevate his head , as she was told by 911 to do so.  She was not able to wake him up during this time period. When the EMS arrived, he was just starting to move. They got him up to stand and he was able to verbalize his need to go to the restroom.  They arrived at the hospital at approximately 10:25 am and was released after testing at approximately 2:30 pm.

                                                I had a (first ever) stroke. I was attempting to take Flecainide for atrial fibrillation to reduce palpitations, the week prior and during the day of the stroke. I tried to take Flecainide twice before in the past few months, but I was unable to tolerate it. When I had the stroke, I didn&#39;t realize I was having one since I&#39;m in very good health. I emailed my electro-cardiologist about my symptoms that day and found it difficult to use the appropriate words and reading the email later, I could see a number of mistakes. My ability to comprehend spoken language that day was impaired. I could only keep a few sentences in my head at a time and my attention span was poor as well, like having significant ADHD, which I don&#39;t have. I was unable to retain simple amounts of information the day of the stroke. I didn&#39;t seek treatment on the day of the stroke since I felt it was more of the side effects I had been experiencing from Flecainide. After going to the hospital I felt good and much improved, cognitively. An ER neurologist said that my stroke was a 2 on a scale of 1 to 42. Over the remainder of March and until this day (April 16, 2021), I have made steady and rapid improvement. I attribute my recovery to the lower level of stroke damage and the fact that I worked out every day with physical exercise and I worked out cognitively by doing a series of activities that I chose myself: reading out loud, reciting poetry and tongue twisters, playing logic and puzzle games on the PC, returning to my writing tasks for work, practicing grammar, and speaking at length with family and friends as a way to practice speaking. I had one appointment with an occupational therapist and two appointments with a speech therapist and have completed assessment. I now feel I am nearly completely recovered with an odd sense of some improvement in certain areas such as heightened mood and quicker connections for noticing practical matters.

                                                Shot given at 9 am. Chills, body aches, headache, and 100.6 fever started at 9 pm. Temp went up to 101.6 at 10 pm. Chills stopped about midnight, headache persisted, temp dropped to 100.6. Did not sleep well. The next morning about 6 am, temp dropped to 99.9, headache persisted. Temp normal 24 hours after shot, headache went away, body aches subsided. Never took any pain medication, though I knew I could. I do take excedrin migraine about 5x per week normally. Was happy about side effects as it confirmed my immune system strong. Symptoms tolerable and subsided after about 24 hours. Spent most of day after shot in bed. Arm did not get that sore (Shingles shot 2 much worse). All side effects gone after 48 hours. Glad I resisted temptation to take pain meds though I know it would have been ok to take after shot. No side effects after Moderna shot 1, except for a sore arm.

                                                Several days prior to the shot, I had been experiencing sore, muscle-related pain in my neck, especially the left side and shoulder area, making it difficult to turn my head to the left. I was still experiencing this pain at the time of the shot. The evening of receiving the shot, I awoke at about 11:30 p.m. with extreme pain in my left shoulder (would describe as 8 on scale of 1 to 10)...not sure I could even get out of bed. Was able to &#34;walk it off&#34; and went back to bed, but had the same pain and difficulty getting out of bed twice more that night. Once prone, the pain would eventually subside. Went to work that morning (the day after receiving the shot) but returned home after an hour as I had a mild fever (100.1) and chills. I took 2 Ibuprofen and slept for about 2 hours. I awoke with temperature down to 99.7 and less pain in the left shoulder/arm area. Throughout the day, my temperature continued to go down and the chills lessened. Two days later, I have no fever and mild pain at injection site.

                                                Initial presenting symptoms upon awakening four days after his shot were muscle spasms, &#34;felt things in his chest,&#34; and dark urine. Within 48 he was confused and was unable to state his last name, which progressed to unresponsiveness by ~7 days after the vaccine. He has since become comatose and his brain MRI is notable for hyperintensity involving the deep gray nuclei as well as the periventricular and subcortical white matter diffusely, bilaterally. The etiology of his comatose state is still under investigation, but a detailed infectious, autoimmune, and malignancy work up at 2 different medical centers and have since been unrevealing as to alternate causes.

                                                My arm was very sore to the touch and hurt to move. I developed symtoms like a bad flu withou chest and nasal symptoms. I had a bad headache. Severe fatigue and body aches. Ran a temp of 99.1 for about 12 hours. Took no reducers.  From the night of the shot to mid-day (48 hours later) I slept 30 hours. I woke up to use the restroom. I drank a lot of water. After 48  hours and all that sleep and water, I felt better. A little fatigue for a couple of days more.

                                                1) After midnight, I began to get what felt like the shivers, but they were unlike anything I had ever seen or experienced, as I could not stop shaking, feeling like I had to try to get warm.  I had a heat pack under my back, and no temperature, but for 25 minutes, kept shaking. 2) At 10am in the morning, I began hallucinating, which has never happened to me before, and I only recognize because when my Dad was dying of prostate cancer, they had him on morphine and he began to see things.  It was a very specific hallucination, of being in a specific from in front of a specific computer talking to a person.  I feel quite reluctant to share this.  This lasted for somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes. 3) I&#39;ve vomited once, and had diarrhea, drinking lots of water, and only using Tylenol.  I did not take the Tylenol until after I stopped shivering.

A day or two later things would show up, got fatigued, headache seemed to be the main thing, nausea without vomiting, chills and no fever.  The symptoms are moving around the body with body aches.  This morning when he got up he was very nauseated, and not feeling well.  Did not go to work as not knowing if he had the flu or anything else.

                                                Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the medical floor with altered mental status, placed on empiric Rocephin/Zithromax for presumptive bacterial pneumonia.  It was later revealed that he received his 2nd Moderna COVID19 vaccination on 5/18, having recovered from COVID19 in Dec 2020.  This certainly raises the question as to if his symptoms are related to immune-response to the vaccine.  He certainly seems to think so, based on timing of his symptoms and being in his usual state of health prior to getting it.  Nonetheless, he is being treated initially for presumptive straightforward community acquired pneumonia.   Quite unexpectedly, within 24 hours of his abrupt decompensation, he has returned to baseline.  Off O2, mental status sharp and at baseline, no further fevers.  This rapid improvement confirms suspicion that his presentation is likely adverse effect/immune mediated response to the 2nd COVID vaccine (Moderna).  He became acutely ill within 24 hours of vaccine and resolved almost exactly 48 hours afterwards.  Creatinine has returned to baseline 1.9-2.0 after IV fluids.  Cultures remain negative.

                                                On Saturday 01/23/2021 morning when I got out of bed I experienced difficulty maintaining my balance. I had to use a wall to be able to stand. I did not fall. I stumbled into the bathroom, still unsteady. I urinated sitting down, still feeling unsteady, head spinning. I took my blood pressure 130/70, which is normal. Was feeling steadier. Was able to walk down stairs to ground floor of home. Still not felling normal, but steady on my feet. After eating breakfast, no additional symptoms through day. I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages over the past week. When I went to bed Sat night, lying in bed I was light headed. Sunday morning same problems. I performed some vehicle maintenance and would get down on the ground. Head would start spinning, everything would return to normal once standing. At bedtime same feelings when lying down in bed. Monday morning (today) same problems.

Medical history included treatment for tuberculosis and dialysis. Concomitant medication included calcium acetate, Renvela, glipizide, omeprazole, aspirin, vitamin D, losartan, furosemide, rifampin, and Sensipar.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 030L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13 Jan2021, the patient tested negative for COVID-19). On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, and feeling weird/funny.

No death certificate was issued at the time of the report but the reporter believes it will list cause of death as COVID complications.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events of limb discomfort, feeling abnormal, dyspnea, fatigue, swelling, unresponsive to stimuli, body temperature abnormal, was fatal.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient was died. Cause of death was COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events developed on four days after first dose of mRNA-1372. Dyspnea, unresponsive to stimuli, and death were consistent with infection in pandemic set up confounded by age of patient and refusal of dialysis Cause of death was reported as COVID-19.

When I got under covers and warmed up so chills subsided and breathing returned to normal it felt like I was being squashed in a Panini press. Every cell in my body felt like it was vibrating in pain. I had to get up ever hour or so to urinate. I would be back in sever chill mode before i made it to the bathroom and it took about 5 minutes back in bed for chills to stop and breathing back to normal. I was also nauseous the whole time but did not vomit Then. The room temperature was 72F. This continued for 12-14 hrs.  I then tried to drink cranberry juice and eat 3 bites of a banana which  I immediately regurgitated. The rest of the day I was drained of energy. No sleep 48hrs. 3 days

                                                About 24 hours later I felt weak and had a fever and had little shivers that went thru my joints to the top of my head. It almost like little shocks going thru my body. I had a video appointment with my Dr. and he prescribes doxycycline and prednisone.  The next day the fever went away and started to feel better (48 hours later).  I also tested positive for Covid on 12/24/20, I didn&#39;t wait 90 days before I got my vaccine.  I felt awful with the second dose, almost worse than being in the midst of Covid. I&#39;m currently on Workman&#39;s Comp. I&#39;m constantly out of breathe and have no energy, I use to have tons of energy. From my atoms apple to my sternum I have tons of pain. My lungs feel like I&#39;m smoking and have tons of pressure.  My Dr. ran test because I have the worst head aches. I&#39;m like slow motion.

                                                In November of 2020 I was diagnosed with COVID 19 and subsequently recovered.  This was my first Moderna shot.  I took the shot in the right arm and completed my work day with no side effects.  I went to the gym that night - as usual - and wanted to &#34;work that arm&#34; a little.  I had a good workout, no issues.  Went home, ate and went to bed.  About 1 or 2 am I woke up with the hottest raging inferno flu-like fever I can recall having as an adult.  I did not want to alert my wife, so I simply stayed in bed and did not measure my fever level.  My guess is it was &gt;102.  Fever continued until a.m. and deep body pain hit me.  At dawn my fever measured 101.  I took acetaminophen and took a cold shower.  Fever subsided for a short while.  Then it came  back.  I felt weak and flu-pain so I stayed home from work and simply slept it off.  Symptoms slowly subsided by 7pm day 2.  Day 3 I was not 100% but I went to work and was fine.  No other symptoms since.

I&#39;m taking  Orencia and was taking that at the time of the outbreak (I forgot to put that in the medicines that I take) that&#39;s given to me by my rheumatologist. He also prescribed lorazepam to deal with the excessive itching. Then I saw a dermatologist he gave me some shots in my skin, but there was so many of them it couldn&#39;t continue I would be a pin cushion. He also gave me some cream that really isn&#39;t working. Seems like it&#39;s getting worse instead of better.

                                                Between 36 and 40 hours after shot (early Saturday AM), my RIGHT arm began to itch in the unhairy area to a degree that disturbed my sleep.  I applied cortisone cream.   About two hours later, BOTH arms were itching in the hairy areas.  I applied cortisone cream to affected areas.  A seeping sore eventually developed on each arm, and I started applying Clobestasol Propionate (leftover from prior eczema treatment) to those spots twice daily in addition to cortisone on other arm areas.  After contacting my doctor&#39;s office via email, I was advised to continue with my self-administered treatments (but not use Clobestasol for more than two weeks and schedule doctor visit if rash/sores do not subside), and suggested I take antihistamine such as Zyrtec shortly after second vaccine shot to possibly prevent recurrence of reaction.  Not yet recovered from rashes/sores, but treatments greatly alleviate symptoms.

These are chronic conditions for the patient but per wife they were notably worse following vaccination.

                                                My left hand was in severe pain for maybe two hours. I took three Aleve to try and stop the pain. I could not close my hand into a fist, nor could I hold anything in my hand. No grip at all. My hand remained like this for most of her night. Today it is a little better, I can close my hand and make a fist, but I am unable to close tightly and grip anything. I feel as though the strength in my left hand is gone for now. No pain today but the muscles in my wrist and in my left hand are still somewhat tight  and present what feels like muscle tightness parallel to a pulling of the muscle. I rode my motorcycle to work yesterday, the morning ride was good, on the way home, my hand started with the pain thing. It was severe enough to prevent me from using the clutch lever properly. Presenting a lot of pain squeezing the lever to engage the clutch.

Always been rock solid at 98 with maybe a 97 every two months.  This is really an outlier event.  Reading taken on six different fingers with one monitor reset.  Returned to 98 following day.  Other expected symptoms:   Temp 99.8  (generally 97.6 - 98.0).  Injection shoulder sore, felt puffy (but no visual difference).  Medium &#34;Brain Fog&#34; (senses seemed disconnected, lack of concentration).  Lethargic legs (not sore or weak, just slow to respond).  Left neck and ear aches.  Slept about 14 hours day after shot.  No symptoms other than sore arm the day of shot.  BP and blood sugars up, but at higher end of my normal ranges.  BP 175/93  (16th).  (at 149/93 on 17th). Blood stick reading 198 (16th).  (at 158 on 17th)

                                                I received my second dose of Modena vaccine last Thursday (4/15) morning at 9am.  No initial reaction occurred.   Later that Thursday my arm got the expected tenderness, muscle ache. Towards evening, I got pretty tired and was starting to get some body aches, took 2 tylenol and went to bed at 9pm. Slept in late and was tired. Started to feel like mild flu which is what I expected.   Friday took some naps and continued mild flu symptoms. Went to bed about 8pm and got up at 5:00, feeling a bit better.   Saturday I continued to improve, arm was much better, less flu symptoms, didn&#39;t need tylenol, had turned the corner.  Cont&#39;d... Saturday evening was going to go to bed at 10pm and noticed my left cheek was kind of pressing against my gums - it was swollen. It continued to swell some but was not hindering my throat or breathing.   I decided to stay awake, keep an eye on it and if necessary would go to an emergency room. The swelling increased only slightly more over the next couple of hours to the size of maybe a golf ball (a bit less) on the left side and a much smaller amount on the right side. No airway effects. I did apply some ice but not sure if that had an effect. I slept for a few hours.   Sunday morning I did not take my medications as a precaution.   Sunday the swelling was slightly less and seemed to be going down a bit. I took 2 Benedryl at 11:00 am which really knocked me out, slept. Sunday evening the swelling was noticeably improved but not gone. Took 1 Benedryl at 10:00pm bedtime.   Monday still had a bit of swelling on left and right swelling is nearly gone.  No other symptoms.

By nighttime, had severe shaking, chills, profuse sweating &amp; unable to sleep.  We didn?t take temperature, but he finally stopped shaking mid-morning the following day.  Was weak and very fatigued two full days.  It was like an instant flu, but it was only the first jab and most reports of reaction seem to follow the 2nd.  Think it may be due to presence of antibodies post-COVID.

                                                He got his vaccine, he had no reactions.  The next morning he woke up his arm was sore, and it was that was for 2 days.  Then his breathing starting getting worse.  He started coughing, couldn&#39;t lay down, could not sleep due to that.  He went to the ER and they told him that there was nothing wrong and that it was just allergies.  They told him to go home and take some OTC cold medicine and that everything would be okay.  A week later he went to another ER for the same thing as he continued not to be able to breath, they did a bunch of tests and said that nothing was wrong and that it was just a call.  He then went to Hospital ER and they released him stating it had just a cold.  He then called his cardiologist and they told him to go back to Hospital, was admitted on 5/11/21 and they did more tests and said that he had a blood clot in his left lung and said that it had nothing to do with the vaccine.   He was discharged on 5/13/21.  They put him on Heparin while in the hospital and sent him home as a disgruntled patient.   They also told him that he had fluid around his heart and gave him medicine to get that taken away.  They sent him home on Lasix and Eliquis.  He then went to another hospital on Friday 5/14/21 as he was going crazy about the blood clot and went there and was kept there for 3 days and discharged on 5/16/21 with the same medications, Lasix and Eliquis.   He was also told that he had fluid around his heart again.  Before the vaccine he was very healthy, and was able to jog around his neighborhood and now he&#39;s not able to do so, and they told him that he was now having heart failure and is having trouble breathing because his heart is swelling up.  He went to see his cardiologist last Friday and that&#39;s when she told him about his heart failure.    ADMISSIONS:  ADMITTED 5/11/21 TO 5/13/21; 5/14/21 to 5/16/21.

                                                Serious lower left back which I believe was my left kidney. The serious pain problems started the day after receiving the shot and lasted for at least two weeks.    As the kidney pain started, my fingers started to feel numb and they have felt numb ever since.  Left hand is a little worse then my right hand.  Want to get second shot but?? I have walking pneumonia since 1973, since I was 15 years old, and will die if I get Covid 19.  I need help to know what happened to me, and maybe monitor me during second shot.  I am open research person. I am a 64 year old man that has had walking pneumonia since I was 15 years old in 1973.  I know that if I do get Covid-19 I will quickly die.  I need vaccination from Covid-19.    I received my first Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on Thursday March 18th, 2021 after 3 PM and immediately had problems.  I had problems in my left lower back which I believe was my left kidney. The serious pain problems started the day after receiving my first Covid 19 Moderna shot and the pain lasted for at least two weeks.  Immediately as the kidney pain started, my fingers started to feel numb and they have felt this way ever since.    This lead me to the situation of &#34;I am damned if I do and damned if I do not&#34;.  I want to get the second Covid-19 vaccine shot because I am truly scared to die if I do get Covid 19.  But if I do get the second shot, what will happen to me?  I am scared that it may have the kidney pain again, may worsen my numb fingers problem, and/or do other damage to my body.  It may already have caused other problems?      In summation, whether I get the second Covid-19 vaccination shot or not:  Get the second shot: 1. Everything could be OK?   2. I could have Kidney pain again, possibly doing damage or more damage to my body, even my numb fingers could get worse!  Not get the second shot: 1. Be lucky and not get Covid-19. 2. Get Covid-19 and die.  I want very much to get the second Covid-19 shot, but I am scared and I find nobody cares about what had and has happened to me regarding my kidney pain and my fingers becoming numb, and any future consequences to me if I get the second shot.  I do not know what to do.  My current and main concern to me, for now, that if I do get the second Covid-19 shot I will get that kidney pain and may do worse damage to my fingers feeling numb or possibly other damage to my body.  I am not sure what happened, as a non medical person I can only guess things like maybe I have blood clots that reduce the circulation in my hands.  I just recently got on government assistance only because of this Covid-19 problem and I had a very hard time trying to find a job, I had no choice.  I have not been on government assistance long enough to get financially stable to afford medical insurance, but I plan to do so as soon as I can.    I tried to tell my doctor, but she kept telling me to go to the emergency room.  So, I finally went to the Hospital on Friday April 16th.  They checked my bloodwork and told me I was OK and OK to get the second shot, but I had really no explanation as to what had happened to me, my kidney, or my still numb fingers, or most of all, what might happen if I get my second shot.  I am hoping to get help, for someone to care about me, my health, and my future health.  The numbness in my left hand has been a little stronger than my right hand.  I had the shot in the left arm and my left kidney had the pain, if any of these matter. The left kidney problem was very painful within 2 days.  I could not do anything due to the pain.  I could forget about dealing with my feet in any way, such as to tie or untie shoes, put on or remove socks, getting out of bed, and just about anything I did, any movement at all was very painful.    What has me very worried is the continuous numbness of my fingers.  I want to get back to work and my profession involves computers and keyboards, and my numbness in my fingers bothers me, even having problem feeling the raised bump on the f&#39; and j&#39; keys.  The most immediate problem is trying to untie shoestrings, which I cannot feel to do due to my fingers feeling numb.  This problem with my fingers affect my life in many ways continuously everyday.  I cannot feel zip lock bag openings.  I have had a left kidney problem once before over 2 years ago, which I believe was a result of doing Benicar for my blood pressure. I have only had that problem that once and I got off Benicar and have never had the problem since, not until a day after I had my first Moderna Covid 19 vaccine shot March 18th.    For both of these times, the left kidney pain I immediately stopped all of my medicines and after a few weeks the pain went away.  This time was muc worse than the first time. I have high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol and take medicines for these.  I resumed these medicines after the pains went away.    As to the fingers feeling numb, I have never had this problem in my life.  My left hand fingers are a little worse than my right hand fingers.  They feel as if they are very cold for frozen, or I have burnt my fingers.  I have never felt this feeling ever in my life.  At the beginning of, January 1st to be exact, when I was 15 years old and in the 10th grade, I came down with pneumonia and was very sick.  It was not until the middle of March when my mother took me to the emergency late at night when she got a doctor to see me on the side.  The doctor gave me prescriptions of antibiotics, cough syrup, and Guaifenesin (which was a prescription in 1973 and is the main ingredient in Mucinex).   For the next 2 weeks I came home from school and laid down on the sofa and filled up about a third to a quarter of a medium size mixing bowl with phlegm from my lungs.  After that doctors have told me I ruined my lungs and I will have walking pneumonia for the rest of my life.  I have lived with this problem and have had to pay special attention to my lungs my whole life.    When I saw on TV a report on the second e-cigarette and what if did to the lungs, I said that looks like what happened to my lungs when I was 15 years old.  I recently saw news that someone had a similar problem.  However, because of my walking pneumonia I need to get the second shot or vaccinated in whatever way, I want to live.  Please help!

                                                Roughly 24 hours after injection, I experienced confusion. I had an appointment with a client, I&#39;m a Mental Health case manager. The appointment was at 4:00pm.  I left at 3:45 to go pick her up.  Around 4:30pm I knew that I was lost and had no idea where I was at. I finally came across a main highway that took me to my targeted location. I went into a store to ask the clerk directions. I&#39;ve lived in town for over 46 years, yet I had no idea where I was at. Very scary.

The itching made sleep very difficult for the next two nights.  The itching was decreased somewhat by the use of 1% hydrocortisone cream and moreso by 10 mg of Loratidine. The severity of the urticaria has decreased somewhat over the last 3 days since onset but is definitely still present.

I couldn&#39;t sleep, my thinking patterns were little confused, I was confused. I was also having adverse dreams.  By Monday the fever went down, and the body aches and tiredness went down some. On Monday I went and got a COVID test and got a positive. Up to time of vaccination I have tested negative. The place that gave me the COVID test said it could be a false positive due to recently being vaccinated. The person from the COVID test said it was safe to get the 2nd dose. I feel okay right now and I am out and about.

Upon talking to patient and monitoring patient for an additional 20 minutes heart rate was at 70 and patient was feeling better and felt good enough to leave with his adult children for lunch. Water, deep breathing, and time were the only treatments administered, no epinephrine or diphenhydramine were administered. Followed up with the patient later that day, approximately 4 hours later and he was felling better. During monitoring patient did mention that he had a similar reaction to Miralax in the past but not Go Litely. Upon looking at the screening form this was not noted in the allergy field. This patient may have a concentration dependent sensitivity to polyethylene glycol, suspending agent or major component in the moderna vaccine is not diluted in any volume. Talked to supervisor to add a potential field of propylene glycol for the screening from.

This side effect has continued a second day causing me to notify my primary care provider and preparing this event report.  Other side effects experienced after the second vaccination were soreness at the injection sight, mild fatigue, and slight fever which were all anticipated. These side effects have passed.

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

I went to the patient and found him unconscious and unresponsive. I told the technician to call 911 for EMS and I proceeded to remove the Epinephrine emergency pen from the emergency bag. The patient regained consciousness, I did not administer the epinephrine emergency pen. I remained with the patient. The patient complained of feeling hot, nausea and tired. Patient also appeared confused. Patient&#39;s head was cold to the touch. EMS  arrived and took the patient&#39;s vital signs. The patient&#39;s awareness  and tiredness appeared to vary from feeling fine and alert to confusion.  After about 15 minutes with EMS the patient choose to go with EMS to the Hospital Emergency room for observation. The patient walked about 15 steps then chose to go on the gurney with EMS.

                                                Received vaccine approx 11:20am, no issues until 10:30pm when I started to feel chilled. I took my temp with a forehead thermometer and it read 98.x. I put the thermometer on my nightstand thinking it prudent to have it handy. In bed under covers I kept feeling cold and started shivering/teeth chattering, within an hour or so my forehead thermometer read 102. My recollection of the time between midnight and 2 to 3am is vague as I was very disoriented, I recall taking my forehead temp several times during those hours - that took a lot of effort, and I saw several readings of 105 and I believe one over 106. I remember thinking I should be in the ER, then thinking how could I get there, then thinking I would call 911 but that I could probably not get my mind/body to be able to physically make a phone call. I believe that during this time span I had brief periods of consciousness when I was somewhat aware that I was having a high fever event, but that there wasn&#39;t much I could do about it (I live alone). By 4am I was more aware, forehead temp reading was 102.something - I got up and made my way to the kitchen, I was unsteady on my feet and remember telling myself to be careful and not to fall. Temp gradually dropped throughout Tuesday, mostly back to normal on Wed.

Fourth day also had chills, sneezing and runny nose.  Brain fog, fatigue and lack of coordination improved over the following days.  The second dose receive 4/13.  First day fatigure, chills, lack of coordination and muscle aches along with a lot of soreness at the site of the injection.  Second day also had dizziness, mild abdominal cramps and mild headache.  Could not eat until midday.  The third day dizziness, brain fog and lack of coordination continue.  Close to a point of seeking medical care but probably worth filing a report.

                                                The next day, I started to feel really weird. I had no energy and my head felt really strange. About a week and a half later, around 5am, the left side of my body started going numb. My wife took me to the ER. My BP was super high. About 6 hours later, the numbness started to go away. They performed various tests, but couldn&#39;t find anything wrong. They think I had a TIA, which is a blood clot that resolves itself. For the following month or so, I was just extremely tired and felt really crappy.

Rec&#39;d shot Saturday morning, pain started Sunday evening and ended Wednesday morning.  Pain was enough that it woke me up Sunday, Monday and Tuesday nights.  I treated the pain with ice and ibuprofen, but still very painful to move and to touch.  Wednesday it got better about as quickly as it started on Sunday.  I did not do any physical activity that would have triggered such sever pain.  The only thing that was different is that I received the Moderna  vaccine.  By Thursday my knee was back to normal.

Began to have a fever which over the 24 hour period went from my normal of 97.6 to 101.2 at 10:30pm the second night. Throughout the period I had a mild headache and significant fatigue. I woke up this morning at 12:30am with the sheets, pillow and pajamas very wet (from sweat). I checked my temperature and for the first time in 24 hours, it had dropped (to 99.2). When I got up at 6 this morning, my temperature was 98.6 (still a little elevated for me). My wife experienced practically the same thing 4 days earlier without the urinary symptoms and temp not quite a elevated. We had the vaccine at the same time(s). I&#39;m still fairly fatigued at this time (and my wife a little).

His wife joined him to help at about 12:15 AM and she found him to be disoriented and confused. He has no memory of what happened during the preceding 45 minutes. No indication of any fall or injury. He had no preceding medical problems. No medications. Had received his 1st Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at about 5:30 PM on 2/13. His wife took him to a local ER. No focal findings on neuro exam. His confusion gradually improved over the next 24-36 hours but he still can?t remember what happened at the beginning of the episode. Head CT revealed an incidental 6 mm colloid cyst in the 3rd ventricle. Transferred to Hospital for further evaluation and monitoring where seen by Neurosurg and Neurology. Had MRI and EEG. No arrhythmia on ECG or telemetry. Neurology felt the episode was due to transient global amnesia. Discharged on 2/16.

I had no idea it was in the vaccine, although a smaller amount than I had taken before. I started experiencing severe and awful anxiety and panic that night I got the vaccine. I had other minor side effects that were expected but they went away within a day. Several days later, I began experiencing pain in both my bilateral Achilles tendons and bilateral knee pain. A physical therapist examined both and said that I was swollen. I have had both of those problems under control for a very long time. I am improving somewhat  but nearly 2 weeks later I am still having some repercussions. I am now scared and don&#39;t know if I should get the second injection done because the previous adverse symptoms were awful. Thank you.

                                                Nausea, muscle ache, chills, arm soreness and head ache.  I would describe my symptoms as serious, not mild or moderate.  I felt that I was extremely ill for the first 45 hours.  I ate very little and I could not bathe.  I stayed in bed, leaving only to go to the restroom.  On the 3rd day, I was much improved and I would characterize my symptoms as moderate.  I was able to get up for short periods and I was also able to bathe.  On the 4th day (today) I believe that I am symptom free with the exception of continued arm soreness at the injection sight.

                                                Woke to profound chills and shaking despite no appreciable moisture present on skin. This subsided in appx. 30 minutes however I suffered a very poor night?s sleep. Following day, Feb 20, 2012, I felt as though I had a very mild virus with achiness in neck and shoulders primarily with lesser discomfort in back and legs. Was a mildly fatigued with mild headache as well. Did not check temp but never felt feverish.  On 2/21/2021 I felt symptom free until evening when a slight trace of achiness returned. I slept very well that night and woke symptom free, encountering  no further reactive symptoms.

Ended up going to bed very early that evening (7:30) I woke up in the middle of the night covered in sweat, a fever of 101.4 degrees.  I woke up at 10:00am the next day still running a fever but on 99.4 but still ackey and tired throughout the whole day. I took a short nap in the afternoon. I woke on the 3rd day after my shot and all I have now is a little soreness in my armpits, fatigue and aches are gone.

                                                3 days after second injection of Moderna COVID vaccine my tinnitus increased in volume to a level I could barely hear and never experienced before.  It was difficult to sleep.   By morning the ringing had decreased in volume, more like I normally have.  I thought it might have been a coincidence, however my wife has now had a similar reaction to J&amp;J vaccine and I have seen others reporting the same issue. My prior reaction to the first and second shots were soreness at the injection site which resolved after 4-5 days.

                                                Prior to the vaccine on 2/13/21, He was a healthy 65 year old active college professor.   32 hours after the vaccination on 2/14/21, He had acute pancreatitis, which led to  septic shock and respiratory failure, and he was placed on a ventilator at  Hospital.   On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

Per clinic notes: &#34;Brief summary covid vaccine 1/21 with side effect within 12 hr lasting 3 d By around 1/26-1/29 had cp w/ exertion and sob TST 2/2 w/  Minor ekg changes and min workload per pt (mod workload per note) nuc study pending.  Cough and sob worse over the last 5 d or so, sleeping in recliner, and having trouble sleeping.  Though no desat on march test, he has freq intermittent coughing and he was tachycardic to 110 on exam this am.&#34;   Pt states symptoms worsening over past week. No symptoms at rest. With exertion has anterior chest tightness and dyspnea. No radiation of pain or migration. He can walk usual distances but much slower. Improved at rest. Cannot lay flat at night. Cannot sleep much at night. Dry cough. No wt changes or LE pain/swelling. No f/c. No ill contacts. No chest pain currently. Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis. Patient got 2nd COVID19 Moderna vaccine as outpatient on 2/27/21.

                                                Seen at the walk-In clinic on 3/9/2021 where he presented with complaints of right leg weakness, numbness, and tingling.  He was transferred to ER for further evaluation and management.    The symptoms (numbness in his hip and thigh) began around 1400 while he was working.  He went about his day. The symptoms progressively worsened while he was ambulating around the hardware store. In the ER, his sensation of his right leg was dulled as compared to the left. The numbness extended from his hip to his toes. Felt a pressure-like sensation in his thigh and calf.  Denies pain. Felt as though his right foot is floating 2 inches off the ground when standing with both feet on the ground. Reported his right leg is 1-2 inches shorter after a femur fracture many years ago. Nothing made his symptoms better or worse.  Did have an episode of feeling generally hot and then cold the evening prior to admission. Denied any trauma.     Denied any dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in stools, urinary habit changes, hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, myalgias, arthralgias, recent illness, or fever.   MRI showed T2 changes on the right side of the cord down of the thoracic spine concerning for her transverse myelitis.  Patient did have Covid vaccine 7 days prior to onset of symptoms, one dose mRNA vaccine.    He is on day 3 high-dose methylprednisolone thousand milligrams IV ×3 days.  He has noticed an improvement in the pressure sensation from the knee up the thigh on the right, no longer having tingling in the right lower leg or the left foot.  He is still having numbness over the anterior right thigh.  Yesterday when he went to bear weight on the right heel, he had a sharp pain with increase in weakness.  That has since settled down.  He did have a few involuntary myoclonic movements as described yesterday.  This writer reached out on 3/22/2021 for information on his Vaccine lot number. He stated &#34;At this point I am attending physical therapy, I am walking with the aid of crutches or a walker. There is improvement in the foot and lower leg regarding the numbness, but the upper thigh is still pretty much completely numb yet.&#34;

Unable to lay down as it made his breathing worse.   The next day, he did a nebulizer treatment and that helped his symptoms.   Unfortunately, he has had an acute asthma attacks nearly every day since.  Starting 1 week ago, symptoms have gradually improved.  He is still having to use his nebulizer, but not as often, as his usual inhalers have not been ineffective.

                                                Patient presented to our facility due to progressive swelling of his LLE. Patient is an avid cyclist and reports he began training again for the spring season approx. 1 mo ago.  He had L calf tightness present for a few weeks as well as slightly painful knees which he attributed to his age and mild deconditioning over the winter.  He traveled with infrequent stops on 4/2/2021 to visit family.  He continued to have discomfort and increasing ankle pain, thus presented to ER.  LE ultrasound venous dopplers performed showing extensive DVT: L femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal veins.  CT also demonstrated acute PE w/in distal R and L main pulm artery and w/in bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulm arteries involving all the lobes.  Patient had remote history of LE DVT in 2017 after  mild bumping of leg and placed on Xarelto for 6 mo. Had genetic testing completed at that time which was negative. He has had no clotting issues since. ( Received Moderna COVID-19 vaccines on 2/3/21 and 3/3/21. Reports brain fog and fatigue approx. 20 hours after vaccination followed by the above.) Patient discharged on rivaroxaban.

Sought no medical care. Routine labs were obtained on 2/23 which demonstrated new-onset transaminitis and hyperferritinemia (ALT 2366, AST 1260, alk phos 362, ferritin 32,000) and was admitted to hospital for evaluation. No etiology for acute liver failure identified, including comprehensive evaluation for viral hepatitis and other common causes of hepatitis common after transplant. Concern raised for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) due to extreme hyperferritinemia, although bone marrow biopsy negative. Ultimately transferred to another hospital for further care at patient&#39;s request. No specific treatment was given and transaminitis ultimately resolved. Soluble IL-2 receptor (CD25) level checked on 3/2, at time of admission, markedly elevated at 2338.6, consistent with diagnosis of HLH. Pt discharged on 3/5. Ultimately readmitted on 3/9 and found to have rapidly progressive Legionella pneumonia and died on 3/16. Two events felt to be unrelated and pneumonia not felt to be cause of HLH due to patient&#39;s status at time of initial admission.

The patient was in his normal state of health until he got the 2nd dose of the moderna covid vaccine two days ago; since then he has been somnolent, weak, not eating or drink much, and slid out of his bed and woke up on the floor once. He came to the ED because he was so weak that he couldn&#39;t walk. He furthermore endorses suprapubic and generalized right-sided abdominal tenderness that started after two episodes of nonbloody emesis and chills while waiting in the ED. He denies fevers, chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity swelling, palpitations, brbpr, melena, dysuria, rash, easy brusing/bleeeing, headache, vision changes, and sensory changes.

Date and time of vaccination: (list both if they received both shots): 1st dose 1/29/2021 ~1300-1400. 2nd dose 2/26/2021 ~1300-1400. Pt reported ~3-4 days post-vac of 1st dose, pt experience ache and pain in every joints &#34;joints felt like I was crippled&#34;, reports his whole body was in agony only with movement but not at rest. Pt reported that these symptoms did not subsided and the 2nd shot seems to make the symptoms worse per had lots of muscle pain and he could not move, had to have his wife help him in and out of the bed. Pt reported he took extra strength Tylenol on 2/27/2021 after his 2nd shot for a duration of 3-4 days which provided no relief. Pt reported that just approx. a little over a week prior to his scheduled orthopedic surgery (2/18/2021 - for an microscopic surgery for his torn MCL in his left knee), pt was seen by his orthopedic surgeon because his left knee had puffed up on the side, as a result his doctor drained his left knee and gave the pt a cortisone injeciton in his left knee to reduce inflammation. Pt reports that after rcvding cortisone injection he felt great and all his ADEs from the Moderna vaccine subsided. Pt reported that his orthopedic surgeon had adv that his ADEs of joint and muscle pain and achiness may be vaccine related. Pt reported doctor prescribed him Methylprednisolone 6 days dosing regimen approx. 1 month ago, and while taking pt reported he felt great and all symptoms subsided. Then approx 3-4 days post last Methylprednisolone dose was taken pt reports all his symptoms came back again. Pt reached out to his orthopedic surgeon again and got another prescription for Methylprednisolone and just completed his last day of dosing today and reported no pain again while on the treatment. Pt have another follow up appointment with orthopedic surgeon on 5/4/2021.  Recommend pt to monitor if any of those symptoms occur again, and if so discuss with doctor and contact MD for further evaluation.  5/5-Patient does not have any pain at this time, he went to see orthopedic surgeon yesterday on 5/4/21  to get another Methylprednisone script just in case of relapse since the steroids significantly helped with pain in left knee. Ortho surgeon did not refill Methylprednisone script. Patient is upset and is at primary provider&#39;s office today to get another script.

He does have a heart condition.  He feels that he was coerced to get the vaccine, and informed that if he did not take it that he would be moved to an area where he would not have privileges for visitors, etc., and then found out a week later that was not the truth.     He got his vaccine, he has more shortness of breath, bad pain in his joints, lots of confusion with his brain, blood blisters on his hands that are oozing on his fingers.  Sick for 2 days on the 2nd vaccine, but he continues with joint pain, oozing, and brain fog.   He has an injury to his knee and he cannot get to the infirmary and cannot buy Tylenol in the canteen.

The day of the vaccine I started to have tightness like a Broncho Spasm in my chest 30 minutes after the vaccine.. My co-workers told me I was flushed. I was a little short of breath and my pulse was elevated.  It seemed to improve after a little time. I started to feel worse on 01/12/2021. Ten days after the vaccine I tested positive on 01/14/2021for Covid-19. I had serious symptoms with the Covid-19. After five months I have been unable to work as a Physician and I am still having. I recently got tested for Polyethylene Glycol and I tested positive on a skin test. I am unsure whether to get the second dose. I also have headaches and memory defects muscle aches weakness and a weak left arm. My headaches happen daily and they vary in severity. I am scheduled to have a Bifrontal MRI tomorrow. I started to have problems with concentration within a week of the vaccine and I am still having problems with that. I experience muscle and body aches as well as neck and shoulder problems. My energy level is improved but still very low. I am scheduled to see a Neurologist. My left arm is very weak from the shoulder to the forearm since that time Radiculopathy.

                                                Woke up the 2nd morning and tried to stand up, I immediately fell back onto bed and the room was uncontrollably spinning very badly. Tried to call out but was unable to due to the dizziness. after about 10 min the dizziness subside enough to call out and get help. was unable to lift my head off bed without uncontrollable dizziness. stayed in bed the entire day with 1 trip to bathroom. The trip to the bathroom I basically crawled since I was unable to stand up. The dizziness lasted for about 5 week. Unable to look up due to dizziness coming back. I lost 7 days of work and was extremely cautious of falling over going to work. Loss of appetite, balance, and a feeling of nervousness lasted for many weeks. Visited by family doctor and said it was nothing and not related to corvid injection. Visited neurologist and said it was not related to corvid injection. N one seemed to know what the problem was except I know it was caused by the injection.

The jittery feeling subsided in about an hour. The chills remained and I got flushed and felt like i had a temperature. My joints in my hands felt very sore and during the night my body muscles felt wore out. My left shoulder at the site of the shot was throbbing  bad. For some reason I had to urinate every hour for the next five hours of the night without ingesting any more fluids. By 7:00 AM I got to feeling progressively better and by 9:30 AM I felt like I had just had a very poor nights sleep. No more chills, fever, being flushed and the pain in my arm subsided substantially.

Almost an hour later he was still grocery shopping in the store  he stated he very rapidly became dizzy almost like vertigo, began to feel shaky and sought a chair to sit down.  He quickly became  very nauseous and found a nearby trashcan to vomit but states he could only dry heave 3 or 4 times.  He became quite pale and sweaty.  He was observed by his wife accompanying him who is an RN.  After appoximately 15 minutes the patient began to feel somewhat better.  He was given a bottle of water to drink and he could sip it successfully .  He was able to stand successfully and walked back to the pharmacy where I checked his blood pressure (136/86) and pulse (68).  He refused a 911 call and said he felt about 95/100.  Will check on patient again later this afternoon.  Patient will check with his doctor before getting the second vaccine.

                                                I started by getting a modest headache in the early afternoon.  About 3 PM feeling fatigued.  About 5 PM I began getting chills. By 7 PM headache became a bit stronger, and loss of appetite; becoming more fatigued; generally just feeling &#34;crummy&#34;. About 8 PM I took prescribed amount of regular strength Tylenol, and went to bed, easily falling asleep. Woke about 7 AM next day feeling noticeably better. I took another dose of Tylenol, just as a precaution. I would say by 11 AM all illness was gone.

                                                I had very severe cf starting in 1996.  It remained severe for approximately 5 years after which it was semi acute for another 5 years.    After that i would have periodic relapses several times a year for varying lengths of time.  For the last 10 years irt has been much better with occasional symptoms.  However i received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine on february 23, 2021 and had a strong flu like response.  I am now experiencing a mild to moderate relapse of my cf.   brain fog, difficulty tracking with my vision, chills, etc.  when i had severe cf i had this symptom where my scalp would feellike it was in a spasm.  That has returned.  I have dealt with tcf long enough to know when it occurs and this is definitely a response to the covid vaccine.

The site where the injection was given had bruised and is now fading and is a yellowish color.  Directly below the injection site and its bruised area is a hot feeling, itchy red rash.  Through the course of the day, the red rash has increased in size, approximately 3.5 inch in diameter.  The same day around 5:30 PM I begin to feel a pain/ache in right shoulder and up into my neck on the right side.  The pain level gains and the level of pain reaches 5 in about two hours.  The aching seems deep beneath the shoulder bone and into the spine of the neck.  The rash and pain remain to present, 2/28/2021 Sunday.  The rash maintained the same side and began to slowly disappear yesterday, 2/27/2021 Sunday late evening.  The pain was at it&#39;s worst with arm and shoulder movement but was worse, even without movement of the arm and shoulder between 2/26/2021 Friday and 2/27/2021 Saturday, even when in bed, interrupting my sleep.  On 2/27/2021 Saturday evening the red rash had noticeable fading and the pain level began to decrease.   Today 2/28/2021 the red rash is almost goin and the neck and shoulder pain is no worse than level 1.

Imaging studies showed a lesion in the left frontal lobe and neurosurgery was consulted. Neurosurgery believed lesion was possible an acute/subacute infarct however morphology was unusual. Patient&#39;s symptoms resolved and he was discharged, instructed to follow up with neurology and PCP. Per the EUA, hospitalizations are to be reported irrespective of attribution to vaccine.

The pharmacist was called and the patient reported feeling  light headed and dizzy. While talking the pharmacist the patients eyes rolled back in his head. The pharmacist held his shoulders and his hand and continued to speak to the patient. He regained consciousness. The patient was able to move to his knees and then to lie on his back on the floor with his feet elevated. The injection site was clear and smooth. He had no fever. After resting 15 minutes his color improved and was conversing well. He was able to sit up and his blood pressure was taken. His blood pressure was within normal range. He sat for another 15 min and drank some juice. He was feeling well enough to go home in the care of his wife.

                                                My left arm is in excruciating pain I cannot use nor could I sleep first night. Arm is almost dead in some ways. I cannot life past my mouth as cannot even extend very well.  Severe pain, aching also pain down shoulder into right hand. I have tried icing, heat, applied Cold spray. It is slightly painful 2 days later but still lots of pain. I cannot use arm to do chores. Even brushing teeth was hard. Arm was fine till 10 hours later then became worse and worse. Plus have little strength in arm. I cannot use arm to dry myself after shower.  Arm continues to be painful, aspirin does nothing to alleviate pain.  I regret getting vaccine and have doubts to complete series as I heard second shot worse.  I have not sought treatment yet but may go see my PCP this week.

Not that high I know but for me it is and gave me a very bad headache and body aches.  I did not feel good enough to try to sleep until about 1:00 am after using a heating pad and hot tea to try and chase the chills away and Ibuprofen for the aches.  My shoulder was so sore from the shot that I could not lay on my left side.  The following day I was about 50% better. No more chills but still slight fever and no appetite.  Didn&#39;t feel good enough to do anything except take a nap.  The following day I was pretty much back to normal.

Then sleep interrupted by chills, and then sweats (so much so that  had to lay down a towel and another towel for my pillow). The next day was dominated by body aches and headache (I rarely get headaches). Loss of appetite.  This general condition of malaise lasted all day (the day after injection) and it was at times horrible. The symptoms  started to subside by the evening hours and I was able to have a better night sleep. By the next morning I felt better.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

                                                I developed severe tinnitus after receiving the second Moderna vaccine and it has not subsided. It&#39;s interfering with my daily life and has adversely affected the quality of my life. Today I&#39;m going to see an ENT doctor for evaluation. Now I see and hear that many people are experiencing the same loud ringing tinnitus after receiving the Moderna vaccine.  I can only make the correlation that the loud ringing that goes on 24/7 began after getting the vaccinations.

On 3/27/21, he got a fever that ranged between 99.7 to 102.6.  He could not eat and thinking about it made his stomach upset.  Every bone and joint in his body ached, even his skin hurt and he had a bad headache.  Tylenol did little to alleviate any of these symptoms.  His fever  broke on 3/27/21 about 11 pm.  He still did not sleep well and slept until noon on 3/28/21.  His symptoms persisted except for the fever, though he still had chills that night.  He still did not feel well throughout 3/29/21 and 3/30/21 and he still ate very, very little until 3/31/21.  On 3/31/21, he was able to eat and went to the grocery, but it wiped him out and he slept for a couple of hours in the afternoon.  He still has a dull headache and very little energy that is keeping him from doing his daily activities.

                                                He got the vaccine and began with chills, body aches, joint aches, complete brain fog (out of it), fever to 100 (normal is 95.5), extreme fatigue (could not get out of bed) which lasted for 3 days.  After 24 hours he continued with the nausea, body aches and cannot shake the brain fog feeling.  Had lingering effects of nausea for 10 days, now being the 15th day he is still tired, still has body aches not his usual symptoms and feels a little out of it, brain fog.  Not back to where he was before the vaccines.  He took Tylenol for his symptoms.  He did call his cardiologist who informed him that they would go away, which was over a week ago.   He took a long bike ride 2 days ago, 4/7/21 but he was extremely fatigue other than his normal and not able to function the next day.

                                                About 14 hours after receiving my second shot of the vaccine, I awoke being very cold and began to shiver and shake almost violently after getting out of bed to urinate.  Also my back, hips and knee joint were aching when I moved about any at all.  I was able to fall back to sleep and in the few time I awoke during the rest of the night, I didn&#39;t experience the shaking, however, with the aching and feeling cold, it was reminiscent of times when I had a fever.  Unfortunately, I do not have a working thermometer, so I could not check this, but I suspect I did have a fever.  I was also experiencing a sort of mental brain fog of confusion and lack of full consciousness (felt like I could not bring myself awake enough to do much of anything).   The following morning, I was barely able to become awake enough and clear headed enough to send an email to my boss about having to miss work.  Except to get out of bed for a short time to use the bathroom or get something to drink, I slept most of Friday until late afternoon.  Then I was slightly more coherent and was able to get more to drink and eat.  But still sleepy and went back to sleep. I awoke in a sweat (not experienced before this time) and felt a little clearer in my mind and not as achy.  Slept again later through the night, but continued to wake up in a sweat during the night.  Finally this morning when I awoke, I felt more normal again.

                                                I had almost identical problems even after the first injection which lasted 2 1/2 days that time. This time, the second dose, affects were even worse. Injection site was sore almost immediately and started to get muscle pain in back of neck,gradually started aching with headache over time. About 8hrs after injection temperature started,my normal temp is 97-97.6 it went up as high as 102.8 &amp; stayed above 99.4  for approximately 36hrs. Also had swelling of left side of face,left had noticeable swelling under it. At same time aches &amp; pain got worse including chills &amp; sweating which made sleeping impossible. Took aspirin to break fever which didn?t come down till 2 days after shot. By third day was still achy and extremely rundown. Will absolutely NOT go through this ever again:especially with the Moderna vaccine!

                                                Possible COVID Vaccine Reaction  Introduction I am writing this because I think all of the issues described under the ?Current Situation? section may somehow be tied to an adverse reaction to my second COVID shot.  Until today, I had thought they were separate incidents with no common thread.  I now can see the possibility that they may be related.  I am asking for competent and engaged medical help to determine whether this is so, and if not, what the causes are for my issues.  I will give a brief medical history to give some current perspective.  Health History Current Vital Statistics ? Age: 66, Gender: Male, Height: 6?3?, Weight: 245  Hemorrhoidectomy ? In 1999 I had a hemorrhoidectomy to stop episodes of severe bleeding.  Heart Attack ? In August 2000 I had a heart attack, diagnosed as unstable angina, while on vacation.  They did further tests, found blockages and inserted stents in two arteries.  I was sent home with instructions to contact a cardiologist.  AICD ? After returning home, my new cardiologist did further tests and found evidence of ventricular tachycardia.  I was sent to a specialist who did an electrophysiology study and immediately implanted an AICD.  I have had it replace twice, with the latest one in April 2012.  It has never gone off.  There are close to five years left on my current battery.  Knee Replacement ? In January 2015 I had a total knee replacement of my right knee.  That was a result of several injuries and four surgeries, which left the knee without cartilage.  The knee replacement has worked flawlessly, and I am able to pursue athletics, especially playing tennis, without limitation.   Current Situation February 23 ? Received my first shot of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm.  Other than minor soreness around the injection site, I had no other reaction.  March 29 ? Received the second shot of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm.  Again, there was minor soreness around the injection site.  April 2 ? Had major pain in my tightness in my chest and major pain starting in my left shoulder and radiating down my left arm.  It caused significant discomfort, and I was awake a large part of the night deciding whether I need to call 911 for a possible heart attack.  I decided against that and instead went to urgent care in the morning (April 3).  My EKG was normal, my blood pressure was elevated (158/96 sitting, 157/91 standing).  Doctor could find nothing to suggest heart attack.  Prescribed a course of Prednisone for the shoulder/arm pain.  Had blood work ordered, which all came back normal.  April 5 ? Played doubles tennis as usual.  Noticed some weakness in my left shoulder and arm but played through it successfully.  The pain level was very low.  April 10 ? Played doubles tennis again.  From the first ball I hit I was aware of major weakness in my shoulder and arm.  They had no power at all, and I was almost unable to get my serve over the net.  I played through it again and played very poorly.  The interesting thing was that the pain and weakness did not worsen during the play or afterwards.  The pain remained after I had finished playing.  April 11 ? Chatted with the athletic trainer while I was officiating their women?s tennis match to look for clues as to what might be wrong.  He suggested in may be a shoulder impingement.  April 15 ? Had a phone consult with my primary care doctor.  I suggested the possibility of the shoulder impingement and he was willing to start there since this was a phone visit.  He referred me to orthopedics and physical therapy and prescribed meloxicam for pain.  The pain has continued unabated during this time.  April 21 ? Pain level was very high to the point where I was unable to work.  Went home and slept most of the day.  Meloxicam was not having much impact on the pain compared to my usual regimen of both acetaminophen and ibuprofen (which I had stopped using when I was taking the meloxicam).  After this I stopped the meloxicam and went back to the other drugs as required.  I had an initial visit with the physical therapist that afternoon.  She did not find anything which would suggest a rotator cuff or labrum injury.  Range of motion was normal.  She noted weakness in my left side compared to my right, which is unusual since I am left-handed.  She gave me three exercises to do daily.  April 23 ? Pain had been back to a more tolerable level.  I had a COVID test in the morning for a treadmill test I have next week, and also got an x-ray of my shoulder as requested by my primary care doctor.  After I went to bed, I had an incident of severe incident of chills which left me freezing and short of breath even with sweats on under my bed covers.  I called my wife in to check my vitals.  My blood pressure was a bit higher than normal but not critical.  My blood oxygen was 98 and my pulse was 70.  My temperature was 99.7 with an oral thermometer.  We called the after-hours nurse hotline and spoke with a nurse.  By that time, it had been about 30 minutes of chills and they were subsiding.  She said she would have a doctor call in the next couple of hours.  The doctor called back, and after going over everything, said to come in if the symptoms reoccurred.  Thankfully they did not.  All the while I am still having the pain in my left shoulder and arm.  April 24 ? Again, slept most of the day due to being worn out from the previous night issues and lack of sleep.  No change in the pain and discomfort.

Very extreme fatigue and I am not able to sleep well which is causing me to be really tired. This started as a pain in my arm couple of hours after vaccination and by the next morning all these symptoms  started. These symptoms are causing me to not be able to function. I have no appetite.  I have spoke to my doctor on the phone  Monday evening 02/08/2021, doctor said to drink fluids and take ibuprofen and it will probably go away.

I got to the bath threw up &amp; kept dry heaving. Sitting on the floor, I phoned Hospital,  and spoke with an ER nurse.  I reported my vaccine, my symptoms and told her I could not drive the 1 mile to the ER.  She indicated these may be some of the serious side effects of the Moderna Vaccine.  At 6am I crawled back to my bed &amp; woke at 9:30 am.  I called store &amp; spoke to the pharmacist who vaccinated me.  He concurs w/the ER nurse.  I am still very weak, still slightly dizzy, and very concerned.  I am a healthy 67 year old, lives by himself &amp; this episode frightened me.

                                                About ten days after the first dose I began to have &#34;brain fog&#34;. When I arrived at the donor center to give a monthly platelet donation my blood pressure was extremely high, 184/104.  My average blood pressure varies with an average of 135/80.  Never above 150/90.  It has stayed relatively high, though a late-day glass of red wine seems to bring the blood pressure lower.

Began experiencing steady pain and stiffness in left shoulder injection site within an hour of injection and continued throughout rest of day, night and next day (2/25/21).  Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).  Very lethargic when woke up on morning of 2/25/21 and had slight fever.  Laid in bed for 2-3 hours after woke up; did not get up until 12:30 PM due to no energy.  Not nauseated, but have no appetite.

                                                One week post injection, on February 18, I developed  chills and a fever starting around 9 PM. I experienced diarrhea starting around 10 PM. Fever was approx 100.4 F and was accompanied by a splitting headache and significant body aches, to the point where I was unable to get any sleep that night. I noticed Covid arm the next morning. Fever, headache and body aches continued until Monday morning. I took only Extra Strength Tylenol. Most of the time Tylenol was effective only for the first 2-3 hrs before the discomfort overcame it. I was tested twice for COVID, both Friday AM and Monday AM. Both came back negative. Starting Monday the body aches and fever began to subside but I was left with a feeling of exhaustion and required continuous sleep.  Today is the first day I feel back to normal. I still have a large Covid arm rash, two weeks post injection. It causes no discomfort whatsoever.

                                                The morning after first  vaccination I noticed tightness and inflammation in the lymph  nodes  in my underarm area.  Days  later muscle inflammation  throughout my arm  progressively worst  accompanied by occasional tingling  in the fingers,  After the second week  I had a virtual  office visit with  my PPC doctor who said  this was a common side effect and so I just let it take its  course.  After my second shot  (2/15/) the same  feelings have occurred but  even more acute.  Keeping me awake at night etc.

                                                When I got home around 5:30pm on Saturday I had a 5 minute coughing fit (dry cough) which seemed to come out of nowhere.  I was fine for the rest of the evening and when I woke up Sunday morning my arm was sore (from the shot) but I had no other side affects other than coughing occasionally.  I noticed my throat was raw.  I ran 3 miles, did my stretches and carried out my day without any apparent side effects.  I slept poorly but that is not that unusual, doing a full exercise routine Monday morning.  Other than the cough and raw throat, I seemed fine until the late afternoon (48 hour after the vaccination) when I started to ache all over--including a mild headache (which I rarely get) with the cough continuing and my throat raw.  I went to be early last night in the hopes that it would be over by morning, but it wasn&#39;t.  I still ache all over, including the headache, am still coughing a bit, my throat is still raw, and I feel completely dragged out.

He feels as if they went too deep in the arm and it may have went through the muscle or got into a vein.  Within a few hours his left arm became incredibly painful.  One of the worst pain he has ever experienced and almost called the ambulance.  His pain was so intense he went to bed but was unable to sleep or get out of his bed for about 24 hours.  On 3/25/2021 pt is still in a lot of pain but it is getting some better.

                                                I was very tired the night of 2nd vaccine, aside from that absolutely no side effects, hardly any arm pain, so all well.  I actually felt great for about 9 days.  Then on 3/22/21  I was suddenly awaken by an intense, and peculiar, bout of vertigo.  I am familiar with vertigo from ear infections in the past (last one about 15 years ago and the one prior about 22 years ago).  For me vertigo is a generally mild sensation that stays with me until it clears up.  This was, and is, much different, it ebbs and increases during the day, if I concentrate on a physical task it sort of diminishes, then comes back, at times it goes away completely for an hour or two then comes back strong.  At same time that this started my thoughts and mental acuity started to suffer kind of a &#34;brain fog&#34; is the best explanation I can give.  I also have a slight headache at the back of my head wrapping around to the temples, I don&#39;t know if I can link the headache to the brain fog since my neck often gives me trouble.  I have ruled out ear infection by purposefully spinning myself around to see if I would lose balance, did not affect my balance.  I can also walk a relatively straight line of about 20&#39; with my eyes closed without stumbling.  It feels like a kind of vertigo, but much different than any I have experienced in past and much longer lasting.

Impossible to sleep despite Tylenol to try to relieve the pain.  By morning, 30 March, the pain subsided to a 1 on the same scale, but my arm swelled up from my bicep all the way to my hand and today, 4 1/2 days later, it is still swollen.  My primary care doctor is sending me for a sonogram on Monday or Tuesday to discern if there is any underlying damage.

Toes felt like each were exploding for several hours Fatigue  Ache around brain At 6:00 a. m. I took one acetaminophen 500 mg At noon on that Saturday, April 3, I took one more acetaminophen 500 mg   Remained in bed all day except small meals  Tired with some aches on Sunday, April 4. Interesting: during late Saturday and some on Sunday a random, joint ached suddenly fired then ceased: example right elbow, left ankle, single disk in spine.  About 4:00 p.m. April 4, Easter Sunday my energy was back and I felt better and resumed a couple of activities spraying pollen off my porches, off car, and off the garage floor.   Monday: awakened with slight headache, disappeared after breakfast.

                                                He started developing right shoulder pain a week after the 2nd dose of the Moderna shot in his right arm. The pain persisted for another month and spread to both shoulders, both hips, and the muscles of his arms and legs. Tylenol and flexeril did not help much. He went to the ER on 3/15/21 where he received an IV fluid bolus and had his levothyroxine dose lowered a little. Since discharge from there, he then followed up in clinic on 3/23/21 where he said his pain and weakness were bad enough that he was having difficulty lifting his arms, grabbing objects especially at/above shoulder level, and holding objects in general to perform his daily activities of living. He was placed on a 2-week tapered course of prednisone on 3/23/21 and again required another 2-week course on 4/8/21 because when the prednisone wore off he was back to having pain and weakness.

At around midnight I told my wife I can&#39;t sleep and don&#39;t feel right, hot. She turned on the light and i was bright red. took my temperature, it was 101.2. Took Advil to quell fever, .After 5 hours it was back up and I was still red as hell. Was urinating a full bladder every 1/2 hour. Was drinking water, but not that much. Also had a headache from hell, hurt to blink. While Advil was working I was able to get an hour or so of sleep. At about 5am that morning, I woke up soaked from sweating.  Fever down to 100.1 to 99.8.  Kept up with Advil all day .Fever normal by noon.  Headaches persisited until next evening.  REALLY bad feeling for 12 hours or so. Day two I still do not feel 100%, but ok.  In the midst of all this I got a half hour of moderate chills

                                                Malaise beginning ~10 hours after injection. Finally able to sleep at 8:00 next morning. Woke at 11:00 disoriented, blurred vision. EMT took me to stroke center. They determined probably not a stroke, sent me to Hospital (cardiac). I was told the MRI there showed no evidence of stroke. I do not know the results of the other scans/tests. Felt better after 24 hours. Mostly recovered after 72 hours. Now (28 days later), have some residual problems with right eye, become out of breath after moderate exertion (%SpO2 95 or above).

No Medical History information was reported.    On 09-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 14-Mar-2021, the patient experienced COVID-19 (Covid 19 positive) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CONFUSIONAL STATE (confusion) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), COUGH (cough) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), PYREXIA (fever) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and MYALGIA (body aches) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized on 14-Mar-2021 due to ASTHENIA, CONFUSIONAL STATE, COUGH, COVID-19, MYALGIA and PYREXIA. At the time of the report, COVID-19 (Covid 19 positive), CONFUSIONAL STATE (confusion), ASTHENIA (weakness), COUGH (cough), PYREXIA (fever) and MYALGIA (body aches) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 14-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test positive: positive (Positive) Positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment information not reported. No concomitant medications reported.  Company Comment - Based on the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. However, the events of confusional state, asthenia, cough, pyrexia, and myalgia maybe related to COVID infection. Further information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                On Saturday, May 15, while sitting with his wife, &#34;froze&#34; for a short period of time, approximately 1-2 minutes. His wife did not know what was wrong and urged him to go to the hospital. His son brought him to the hospital, he presented with elevated blood pressure, a slightly asymmetric smile, and black tongue. He was admitted to the hospital and multiple tests (brain scans, electrocardiogram, etc.) were run to try to diagnose what had occurred. On the afternoon of Sunday, May 16, in the midst of being discharged from the hospital, pt had another &#34;episode&#34; which was later categorized by physicians as being a partial complex seizure, where he &#34;froze&#34; and became unresponsive for approximately 1 minute. During the event, he was wearing a heart monitor, which showed no unusual heart activity, but his blood oxygen level dropped during the event. On Sunday, May 16, pt had a second partial complex seizure (third seizure over the 2-day period). This seizure was timed at being approximately one minute in duration. Following the seizures on 5/16, patient was given Ativan and also a 1500mg loading dose of Keppra. On Monday, May 17, patient had a EEG administered, which indicated that there was no unusual activity occurring in the brain during the test. He was advised to continuing taking Keppra at 750mg/day. Pt does not have a family history of epilepsy, never played contact sports, and has not suffered brain injuries such as a concussion.

                                                Felt fine after injection, walked 5 miles home &amp; assured loved ones before going to bed that vaccination went fine with no side effects. After midnight I woke in the dark with many of the same symptoms as when I had COVID in March/April 2020: extreme allover body aches, terrible thirst, extreme weakness.  Next day (Wednesday) symptoms continued; too weak &amp; achy to watch all but the core parts of the inauguration; too uncomfortable to read or to concentrate on music or anything else.  Absolutely no appetite so I didn&#39;t eat.  Wednesday night I tossed &amp; turned all night with a chill that I couldn&#39;t lose even with the heaviest down comforter &amp; supplementary blankets.  That night &amp; the following day I also noticed a distorted sense of time, where hours seem to pass v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y.  On Thursday night two more symptoms appeared: a tremendous cough that I couldn&#39;t stop or assuage with the normal remedies (e.g., lozenges, tea with honey), and that kept me from falling asleep till dawn; and diarrhea (which was limited because I hadn&#39;t eaten since Monday dinner so I didn&#39;t have much food in my system).  The cough felt like it might develop into a sore throat (which had been my first symptom when I had COVID) but it never did.  Yesterday (Friday) I felt as if my symptoms (other than residual weakness) were abating, and Friday night I got a full night of unbroken sleep.  I awoke on Saturday morning with no symptoms, and felt well enough to challenge myself by attempting my usual 90-minute yoga/stretch workout, which proved to be no problem.  Now, at 4 pm on Saturday--about 100 hours after my shot--I feel fairly normal &amp; seem to have no further symptoms.  I do plan to lie low &amp; take things easy, and to have as little outside contact as possible between now and my second shot (scheduled for 2/16) in order to minimize the possibility of re-infection.

After 2 weeks my GP prescribed a medrol dose pak that got rid of symptoms immediately and for the duration of the treatment. When the meds were over the symptoms came back to a lesser degree. The symptoms are persistent to this day. I presently take 2 tylenol usually twice a day and I am comfortable but still have slight malaise. I am due for second shot on the 29th. A little worried

The next time I have any memory of anything is Friday morning at 1 or 2 am. I am trying to remember how to use my eye drops (for glaucoma) and I am trying to remember my dogs name. My wife said I was acting strangely because I was trying to use my eye drops but I didn&#39;t have any eye drops in my hand. I woke her up and she was trying to figure out what I was doing. No memory from  1 or 2 am on Sunday until early Friday morning.  I did not see my doctor but will be contacting my doctor to see if I can be seen.

My wife had to help me get out of the recliner and get dressed for our trip. Also I was very confused. I was a bit nauseous and did not want to eat.  My blood sugar was 226.  For the next 6 hours as we traveled, I had to pee every 30-45 minutes. I needed help getting in and out of the rest stops and the vehicle.  As we traveled I mostly slept. I did drink a little diet soda, but did not eat.  After the 6 hours of travel I felt a stronger and was able to get out of the car and into the houses by myself.  For the next 24 hours I felt week, ate very little and sugers ran high.

Very much like a severe case of the flu. They subsided somewhat today, but to the loss of being able to sleep pretty weak today.

                                                Neck pain near the top of the neck at the base of the skull slightly to the right of the center began around Feb 1. Began taking Ibuprofin, but it did not go away.  Thought I had muscle strain, but surprisingly there was no stiffness or loss of motion. Tried massage, heat, and cold packs with limited relief. Began interfering with sleep over the next few days. On the evening of Feb 4, I noticed a strange sensation on the right side of my tongue as if I was losing taste or feeling there. At 3 AM got out o bed due to neck pain and noticed right eye felt strange and was drooping. When I got up at 8 AM I saw eye droop and smile was only on one side of mouth. Called my doctor and was directed to an advice nurse who told me to go to the ER right away, since this could be a stroke or Bell&#39;s Palsy. Went to ER and was diagnosed as Bell&#39;s Palsy after blood tests, EKG, CT scan, and tests of limbs. Given medications and and released with prescriptions sent to CVS for prednisone and valacyclovir.

Feb 3 about 13.5 hrs after second dose Moderna (3 AM), I showed no symptoms from getting shot at 1:30 pm Feb 2 until going to bed, but at 3 AM woke due to significant headache and arm soreness.  Laid there about an hour until I got our of bed at 4 AM, got Tylenol from hall closet and went in bathroom to take Tylenol.  I was fine until I tried to open Tylenol, and suddenly started sweating, dizzy, feeling faint.  Managed to get to floor with my wife&#39;s assistance, lay for awhile but couldn&#39;t get up to walk so crawled back to bed.  Had severe chills for over an hour until fell asleep.  Spend next 36 hours in bed due to headache and dizziness, very fatigued napping off and on, but chills never returned.  By evening of Feb 4 I felt stable enough to walk around the house and eat dinner meal at dining table.  Saturday, Feb 5 stayed home fatigued napping off and on.  By Sunday morning Feb 6 I felt good enough to play a round of golf without incident and felt 100% recovered by Sunday afternoon

                                                I started feeling fatigued on Sunday Feb 14. I started feeling this way in the afternoon. Next I felt like I had indigestion so I took some tums. At about 1:00am on Monday morning I woke up and felt really bad and thought I had indigestion so I tried to take some more tums and vomited. I was really weak and short of breath. I laid back down and tried to go to sleep but my heart felt like it was racing. Within an hour I was back up vomiting again with shortness of breath, weakness, heart racing. I tried to lay back down but within another hour I vomited again. This went on until 8:30am Monday morning. My pulse was everywhere. 97 to 112bpm. I was having chills all day and weak. I slept a lot Monday and also had diarrhea on Monday morning. I couldn&#39;t eat all of Monday and finally ate some soup on Tuesday. I am feeling much better today but still a little fatigued.

But his memory was a bit off for the next 6 hours. It took him 3 tries to get his wife&#39;s name correct. Briefly he didn&#39;t know where he was and did not recognize his cat. So he went to the ER.

A few days later the redness traveled down to his forearm and a bumpy rash also appeared from the injection site to the forearm. The client reports that his arm is so itchy that he has not slept much since 01/28/2021. The client sought medical attention on 02/17/2021 and was put on a prednisone taper. The client indicates he feels the rash and itchiness is &#34;a little better&#34;. The client&#39;s medical provider told him to RTC if symptoms were not improving. The client reports that he feels they are improving and he is not going  to see his medical provider at this time.

                                                Symptoms:  2nd dose of COVID dose received on 4/2/21 at noon. He reports the following day early in the morning his symptoms started. They are very similar to the symptoms he had after his first vaccine. He reports body aches and upset stomach as his main symptoms. Also reports mild dizziness but that is improving. He states he at times is feeling anxious which makes his heart race and feels mildly short of breath. Denies new SOB with activity and is not feeling SOB right now. Does have medication to take for anxiety and this does help. He also states he is having bouts of confusion with what day it is, where he is, etc. RN notes pt does not sound confused on the phone and was able to verbalize name/DOB and answer questions appropriately. Advised to call 911 but patient declines. He states symptoms are worse at night and he would prefer to be seen in the office.

I took ibuprofen several times during the day and next day was feeling better.  Since then I have had daily wooziness/fogginess to varying degree, accompanied by headache which comes on late in the day.  I am using ibuprofen to alleviate the symptoms, but which does not reduce the fogginess/wooziness.

Wife had left him in the morning to go shopping and when she returned he had urinated on himself and was wandering around. He was taken to the ER that afternoon. Upon arrival to the ER, patient was noted to have mild confusion, tachycardia, and a mild fever of 100.8 F. Symptoms improved with Tylenol and IV fluids. His chest x-ray showed bilateral mid and lower lung interstitial airspace opacities, concerning for interstitial pneumonia and/or edema.

The ER doctor felt the chest x-ray findings were likely chronic changes from COVID, however, he was started on treatment for possible pneumonia. Patient was stable in the ER, so we was discharged.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                The morning after the vaccine I started getting chills, fatigue and a headache (which I was pretty much expecting) but then in the afternoon I was converting face to face appointments to telephone appointments, and suddenly I couldn&#39;t remember how to do it.  It took about 15 minutes to do the first one (which I can usually do in 2 - 3 minutes) and about that long to do the next one.  After that, it came back to me, but it was a bit scary.

Unable to sleep, no matter what medication given.   At beginning had high blood pressure which is unusual for me and heart palpitations.  Had two trips to the ER , 1-13-21  9:00 PM, released  and  1-15-21 10:00  PM and admitted, kept for one day.   Heart palpitations decreased within the first week and blood pressure came down to normal.    Unable to sleep, after being given Hydroxyzine Hydrochloride-25mg and later Alprazolam-.5 mg.   Tried taking herbs before taking Alprazolam due to the addiction factor.  Took Kava , Deep Sleep and CBD.  Took Alprazolam after herbs didn&#39;t seem to help but it made me feel bad and didn&#39;t help with the sleep so went to over the counter sleep aid.

                                                Couple days after slight pain in arm at injection site. Three days after, had bumps on my head / scalp that were sensitive to the touch and a mild headache started. The headache continually got worse , starting evening of Tues Feb 9 to Thurs afternoon Feb 11 was a constant severe headache. Could not sleep, got some relief by placing cold ice pack on back of neck and on forehead.  Headache is now subsiding slowly.  No energy.

It is worse at night and I sometimes have trouble sleeping because of the pain.  I keep thinking it will get better, but so far it has not.  I do not have any trouble using the arm, but there is always a dull pain in it.

                                                Because of the absurd character limit in this field, I am putting my adverse reaction statement on the continuation page. About 10pm, about 9 hours post injection, I was feeling weak and fatigued.  I went to bed and was starting to feel chilled, but not shaking.  I hopped into bed and turned on my electric blanket in a room that was 75° (from passive solar house heating during the day) and wearing only a T-shirt, sweat shirt, and sweat pants.  The first post-vaccination symptom I experienced was when I laid down and my right upper arm (at the point of the injection) was very sore; it was too painful to lie on my right side.  The injection area felt hard. I fell asleep about 11pm and woke up about midnight; I am generally a very light sleeper, rarely sleeping more than ~3± hours (most less than) at a time.  At 1:30am, I could not sleep so I watched a recorded movie.  All the while, I was feeling progressively worse.  About 2:30am, I felt really chilled, so I cranked up the electric blanket to its highest setting and put on some heavy wool socks, a pair of long-johns under my sweat pants, put on another heavy sweatshirt over my existing sweatshirt, and placed another blanket on top of my electric blanket: very cold / chilled but not shivering.  The movie ended about 3am, and my stomach was excruciatingly aching.  I did not feel I could eat anything which I really felt a need to do, but was concerned that I would just vomit.  However, I did take two, 500mg Tylenol tablets with a half a glass of water.  I might have slept for an hour or so, but was quite restless.  I remember looking at the clock at 4:00am.  By 5am, it was considering calling 911; my stomach ached so badly.  It was then, that I had the feeling / recollection I had this &#34;illness&#34; before.  About 5:30am, my stomach symptoms started to ameliorate; by 7:30am, they were gone.  However, I still felt miserable.  I then wondered whether my stomach symptom was just a concomitant bout with &#34;stomach flu&#34; where I experienced (severe) abdominal cramps and pain; nausea; and low-grade fever.  I have had the stomach flu a limited number of times before and, after 6± hours, it all went away: I just had to suck it up in the meantime.  Before I filled out this report, I wanted to consider whether my stomach flu was a reaction to the vaccination or incidental to the vaccination.  However, after talking with my neighbors and my sister&#39;s friend, who also had the Moderna vaccination, three of the four &#34;victims&#34; had similar symptoms to me.  Thus, I deduced I did not have a bout with stomach flu.  Additionally, a dog walking partner, who is a rescue worker, also noted folks she knew also had similar symptoms with the Moderna vaccine.  I then started wondering what kind of artificial cocktail, a.k.a.: antifreeze, was the suspending medium for the vaccine.  If this has to be stored at absurdly low temperatures I commonly have negative reactions to artificial chemicals.  The minor surgeries I have had are uneventful but for the anesthesia chemical concoction I am given.  I commonly takes me more then 2-3 days to detoxify that and feel normal.&#39;  As in this case, I pretty much laid in bed for the next 2½ days, with no energy or desire to attend to personal issues, including walking my dogs.  However, my subclinical temperature was pretty much gone after the second day.  The notable soreness in my arm was mostly gone after two days, but the injection point was still sensitive to pressing on top of the injection site: I could still feel it.  I have a very high tolerance for pain and have never experienced anything like this.  &#34;Pain&#34; from flu, etc., shots rarely, if ever, lasts more than 10-15 minutes post injection.  There was definitely something in the suspension media that reacted with my body chemistry / biological processes.  I am NOT looking forward to the booster shot; most seem to have a reaction to the second shot that is worse than the first  unless their first shot was uneventful and the second shot had considerably milder reactions than my first shot.  The next time I will definitely have a bowl or two of jell-O in the refrigerator to help quell any (expected) gut reactions; jell-O has always been a comfort food for me in those situations. What a horribly designed survey.  This is next to impossible to complete online.  After timing out twice, I had to start over and opted to download the fillable form PDF.  Even then, I am not given the option to select the subdirectory _where_ it should be downloaded.  Fortunately, I saw the option to open it directly. If you are going to make the &#34;adverse reaction&#34; field so limited, relative to field size and the absurd online time limit, how can you expect meaningful, complete reporting of post-vaccination reactions?  This form CANNOT be fully completed in the time allotted without timing out.  This is, most certainly, a deterrent to adverse reaction reporting.  One has to wonder how many folks just gave up after getting timed out the first time. With this kind of disincentive, how good or complete or meaningful is the adverse data collection procedure?  Have you purged all the supporters?  They do not like real, accurate, objective data, particularly information that is not consistent what they want to believe or the narrative they want to spin.  No respectable scientist or decent journalist would accept third-rate data.  How can public interest decisions be made with a shoddy data collection effort?

                                                Have had tinnitus for a number of years, but the volume has always been at a reasonable level such that it was never disabling.  I was awakened on the morning of March 24th by considerably louder tinnitus ringing in both ears and was unable to sleep thereafter.  This condition persisted throughout the day, causing significant stress and anxiety and making normal function extremely difficult.  That night, I was unable to sleep at all.  Though the volume has diminished somewhat, it is still close to being at a debilitating level, making normal function exceedingly difficult.  Receiving the vaccine was the only change in my normal routine, so I am attributing this condition to that.At this point, I have determined not to get the second dose of the vaccine.

Felt like I&#39;d broken my arm in several places.    Barely slept after that; resolved to call doctor on Monday.  At 1 pm on Sunday, fever spiked to 100-101, slept four hours.  Pain reduced.  Went to sleep at 10 pm.  Awoke with some soreness in left arm but pain absent.  no fever.  Took it easy today.

He awoke from his sleep with palpitations and chest pain.  He said he maybe  breathing was affected. He arose from his bed, sat in a chair, and sipped warm water with easing of discomfort. Although he had a NTG, he did not choose to take any, nor did he check his pulse.  Not wishing to repeat the experience, he refused a second vaccination.

By about a week and a half out from his vaccine he states he was &#34;sleeping all the time.&#34;  At 2 weeks he had a bad nose bleed that lasted an hour and was extremely hard to stop.  A week later he had another bad nose bleed and couldn&#39;t stop it so went to the ER where they treated it with a &#34;plug.&#34;  The next day the ER removed the plug because it was bothering him so much.  Mid week on the 4th week he had another bad nose bleed and saw an ENT who cauterized it.  ENT advised he not receive dose 2 of the Covid vaccine in case the vaccine contributed to his severe nose bleeds.  No history of nosebleeds.

He states that he really didn&#39;t do anything for a couple days and his mental capabilities were affected. He states he received his vaccination thurs and fri morning he called his friend to have him check on him every couple hours since he just didn&#39;t feel right. His friend told him by 2pm that he had a hard time having a conversation with him as he was only able to get out a few words and they didn&#39;t make sense. He had shaking, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, staggered when he walked and really doesn&#39;t have much memory of friday. He states his friend called the walk in clinic to see if he should go in and was told those were just normal side effects. Patient believes he had covid in the past month as he had altered taste and his friend had covid and was hospitalized with similar sx. He states his sense of taste is back to the saltiness that it was when he had covid. He reports that still on day 4 post vaccine, he doesn&#39;t feel he is mentally at baseline and is struggling to pull words out. He plans to make an appointment to see his physician today.

After that it was just full body tension and sense of nervousness.  But the real problem is that it brought back a relapse of MS symptoms that were under control for 20 years.  Weak, burning heavy legs. This has been steady for 10 days now.  This has made me trepidatious about the second dose.

                                                I woke up approximately Wednesday midnight with a tummy ache. I got out of bed a little woozy and proceeded to kitchen to have a bicarbonate of soda and blacked out and fell to the floor for a few seconds. I crawled to the bathroom for a bowel movement. I then went back to the kitchen for the bicarb walking at this time. Still a little woozy but okay. Went back to bed, realizing the area of the shoulder was very sore. Much more so than 1st shot. Very restless night. No treatment necessary.

                                                2 weeks after 1st dose on 4/13, pt had itchy red rash all over body (scalp, arms, legs, inner thighs, back, a little bit on chest, a little bit on stomach). Described as very itchy little red bumps in small groups/clusters. Maybe only one or two dots on chest/stomach, but was severe everywhere else. Rash started about mid day, kept the patient from sleeping that night from the itchiness, and lasted until evening the next day. No change in diet or soap/detergent/lotions, no new outside exposures. She used coconut oil 2 - 3 times throughout, helped soothe a little bit, but rash eventually disappeared evening of the next day (4/14)

Likely a &#34;self inflicted&#34; situation by unknowingly sitting in chair in a daze ultimately developing blood clots (pulmonary edema), blood clots in legs, leading to mild heart attack, hospitalization.  I believe there may be a direct connection to a medical procedure (vedolizumab (Entyvio) 300 mg intravenously infusion) that preceded the vaccination on the previous Friday (2/19/21).

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Limbic encephalitis in September 2020.   On 09-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 09-Feb-2021, the patient experienced LIMBIC ENCEPHALITIS (Recurrence of Limbic Encephalitis/Progressive Limbic Encephalitis) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (inattention) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), AMNESIA (short term memory loss) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), APRAXIA (apraxia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and COGNITIVE DISORDER (slow cognitive speeds) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On 22-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Progressive Limbic Encephalitis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, LIMBIC ENCEPHALITIS (Recurrence of Limbic Encephalitis/Progressive Limbic Encephalitis), CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Progressive Limbic Encephalitis), ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (inattention), AMNESIA (short term memory loss), APRAXIA (apraxia) and COGNITIVE DISORDER (slow cognitive speeds) outcome was unknown. Not Provided      mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosing remained unchanged.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient was treated with Plasma Pherisis x7 exchanges plus IV methylprednisolone followed by Prednisone taper.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The events are probably related to the patient&#39;s comorbidities.

                                                I started feeling bad the Sunday afternoon after the Friday afternoon injection.  Slight fatigue.  By Monday afternoon, I was feeling very light headed, very tired and very spaced out. I took my blood pressure at home.  It registered 205/105.  I immediately went to the ER near my home.  There the doctor tried to reduce my blood pressure with oral medication.   The doctor was not successful in reducing my blood pressure. After 6 hours in the ER I was transported and admitted to Hospital, for observation.  I was given an IV blood pressure medication prior to the  ride over to the hospital and it did come down with the top line at 150.  I was observed until 6 pm the next day.  Two hours before release my blood pressure was hovering around 180/95.  I had a number of test in the hospital.  Full blood workup, CT Scan, MRI of my brain and an Echo Cardiogram with a Saline IV solution.  All the test came back with a good result.  I have continued to have problems with balance, memory loss and concentration up to this day, 06/10/2021.  I have made a conscious decision not to take the second due to what I perceive as a dangerous reaction to the first vaccination.

                                                Took 600mg of Ibuprofen (200mg x3) orally at 7:45AM, 30 minutes later while viewing a medical webinar at my desk at home, I suddenly noticed significant itching of my entire hands which quickly became reddened and progressively swollen as the itching sensation become more generalized within 10-15 minutes. I got up from my chair to go tell my wife but as I walked a few paces, I became extremely weak with visual &#39;closing in&#39; as I barely prevented myself from collapsing to the floor / losing consciousness. At the same time my tongue was now thickened and malfunctioning making my spoken words to my wife almost unintelligible - all consistent with a CLASSIC ANAPHYLAXIS REACTION.  My wife helped me to the couch to recline where I carefully swallowed CHLORPHENIRAMINE 8MG, FAMOTIDINE 20MG; and 15 minutes later DIPHENHYDRAMINE 50MG (I did not have any Epinephrine available from prior &#39;bee sting kits&#39;). At no time was my breathing impaired nor was there any audible wheezing or dyspnea. After ~45 minutes I was improving noticeably, and after ~2-3 hours I had made a 100% recovery with no sequelae thereafter. Although I had taken my routine morning medications several HOURS PRIOR, nevertheless, (after purchasing several vials of Epinephrine 1mg/1mL for protection in case of another reaction), after this event and over the succeeding days I re-added each of those medications separately / one-at-a-time to ensure that NONE of those was the offending agent - NO problems ensued. For obvious reasons, I have 100% AVOIDED ingesting Ibuprofen or other typical NSAIDs since this episode (although my routine single daily aspirin tablet has presented no problems). BOTTOM LINE: DESPITE HAVING USED IBUPROFEN 400MG OR 600MG PERHAPS 1-2 TIMES WEEKLY AS NEEDED FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT OVER MANY YEARS, NEVER UNTIL THIS ANAPHYLACTIC EPISODE 11 DAYS AFTER MY SECOND DOSE OF MODERNA&#39;S COVID-19 VACCINE HAD THERE EVER BEEN ANY TYPE OF ADVERSE REACTION TO IBUPROFEN WHATSOEVER.

Tylenol was finally able to reduce the fever, but the next day it rose to 102,  and the following day also to 102, still having pains in his legs. On day 4, his oxygen level dropped to 80 (he did have congestive heart failure exactly one year ago, but it was corrected in ten days and his oxygen level had been perfect until the vaccine). We are now on day 6 and his oxygen is slowing improving after increasing Lasix. His body had an awful shock with this vaccine which medical people feel contributed to him almost sinking to congestive heart failure again. Even with all his medications he presents as a healthy individual usually.

                                                On the evening of the 15th day after my vaccination and a couple of hours after reporting once again that I was perfectly fine, I had a sudden shaking of my body which lasted about 30 minutes. it was so bad I couldn&#39;t hold a glass of water without spilling it. I got up and walked around, did some deep breathing, tucked my hands under my armpits and tried to resume watching TV. After about 30 minutes it calmed down but did not go away. I wasn&#39;t chilled. my temp was 100. I took to Tylonal and went to bed, shivering. Earlier this same day, around 4pm, I had started dry coughing quite bit but didn&#39;t think much about it. In the morning, after a restless night, my temp was 99. I felt sluggish, and weak but not sick. No activity, no walking that day of Saturday. Took 2 more Tylonal mid day. Temp was down to 98. That night, temp 98, I took Niqual and slept soundly. Sunday morning temp was 97.3 and I was feeling a lot better and continued to feel better to normal by Monday morning. A reaction to the drug 15 days after I thought was strange. I had no vaccination site redness or pain t any time. I wondered if I had actually contracted the virus. I&#39;m ok now. Did not call for medical help. I have never been tested for he Covid 19 virus.

Commonly known as  SIRVA. shoulder injury related to vaccine administration I had pain within 6 hours of the injection that was severe and was unable to sleep for control of pain for a good 48 hours.  I had loss of strength of my arm on abduction and continued to have pain and weakness in my left arm nearly 6 weeks from the first injection.  I have had my second Moderna vaccine subsequently at 28 days.

After vaccination (roughly 45 minutes), felt &#34;foggy&#34; feeling, akin to being drunk.   After looking for possible links to vaccine, and given that the reaction seemed like a strong reaction previously attributed to  MSG, searched the ingredients listed by the caterer and found that a side dish listed MSG.   ~~  Drove home without incident.  &#34;Foggy&#34; feeling dissipated after a few hours.   No significant reaction to the vaccine itself except slightly sore arm.

I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.  He was told to go back on Mycophenolate which he started on Friday. Left hand pain from palm to wrist on Saturday.  Some shoulder pain on the left and right side.  Sunday pain got worse.  Went to the ER at hospital yesterday.  Dx&#39;d with carpal tunnell syndrome and gave him a wrist brace. He is taking tylenol/ibuprofen (200mg two tabs q 8 hours) as directed. Temp was 99.8 yesterday.  Temp is 99.5 this morning altho he is taking ibu/tylenol as directed. His wife reports he has traveling pain.  Today is pain is in the Right hand and right shoulder.  No left sided pain today.  Today he is able to hold a spoon in the left hand. He had a &#34;real rough night last night&#34;, didn&#39;t sleep much. She has called Rheum but hasn&#39;t heard from them. Okay to put him in with NP? For ER follow up?  Or should something else be done? 2/19/2021: Call to office PCP/DR.

While on the toilet I felt a little nauseous.  For a minute or so, I thought I was going to throw up as well.  The nausea passed after a few minutes, but I felt very fatigued.  Got home and have been laying down.  It&#39;s now 5:20pm, 3 hours later, I&#39;m feeling better, but still a little tired.  I have a slight &#34;flu like&#34; feeling that I feel &#34;off&#34;.  I blessed with good health but I feel a little &#34;off kilter&#34;.  I thinking I&#39;ll feel better tomorrow.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Early Sunday afternoon about 19 hours after the shot, I was reading the paper, and every time I read an article, it was as though it was totally different, but I couldn?t quite remember how. I truly read one article five times, and each time it was as though I was reading something completely new. It unnerved me a bit, so I unloaded the dishwasher without any problems, spoke aloud to myself and was coherent, and looked in the mirror to be sure my face wasn?t lopsided. You can see what I was thinking. My wife was downstairs, so I thought I?d probably better let her in on this. She immediately suggested taking my blood pressure (a very good idea), and it was perfectly normal. I took a nap that was about three times longer than any others (I rarely take one at all), but not before I worked a simple crossword puzzle to reassure myself. Woke up, read the same article twice with a five minute interval between, and sure enough?it looked like the same article. It was not simply being fatigued, at least not like any fatigue I have ever felt before. It was temporary, I was fine later Sunday and have been fine today (Monday).

My primary care phuysician recoemneded that I go to ER on 2/23/21 to have Cat Scan (negative), EKG (normal), blood work (normal except high glucose reading). ER doctor diagnosis was peripheral vertigo not central and discharged me with recomendation to take OTC meclizine twice daily. The spinning side effect has virtually disappeared, still some lightheaded feeling and persistent equilibrium./balance problems exist that prevemt from me driving and performing most daily activities. My Chiropractor has prefromed the  Epley Maneuver twice now but has had very little impact on my equilibrium and balance issues, I have an appointment with a specialist Nuerotologist on March 10, 2021

                                                After an adverse reaction to the Covid 19 Vaccine, the emergency room Doctor suggested I contact you for a follow-up visit.   Dateline and symptoms:  03/01 Received first Moderna Covid Vaccination at 3:45 p.m... 03/02 No symptoms until 6 p.m. When blood pressure started to go up from my normal level of 116/68 to 179/82 by 10 p.m..  During this time I had what felt like mild electric currents from the left side of my chest down my left arm and into my hand.  These systems subsided around 11 p.m. and by midnight my blood pressure was almost back to normal. 03/03 Felt sluggish all day but no blood pressure problems. 03/04 Felt great all day then around 6 p.m. my blood pressure started to rise, by 9:30 p.m. it was 190/90.  At this time I started to feel like my body was shutting down, my face felt flush, and experiencing long distant vision problems, so I had my wife take me to the emergency room. At 10:00 p.m. I went to the emergency room  EKG  showed no heart problems, the blood test showed no heart problems, and after 11:30 p.m. my blood pressure started going down and I was released at 1:30 a.m..  Blood test did show high levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen 26.0, Bun/Creatinine Ratio 33.0, Aspartate Amino Tranf (AST/SGOT) 43, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) 59 and Alkaline Phosphatase 189, all of which are higher than my last blood test on 10/22/20. 03/05  As of 10:30 a.m. my blood pressure is 126/62.  I feel fine except I&#39;m very tired from not much sleep last night.  1p.m. Starting to feel some more chest and arm symptoms as described before, blood pressure now 146/66. Events happened twice, 2 days apart.

                                                Severe fatigue, severe muscle aches, severe to moderate periodic itching\ pin prick sensations especially in palms of hands, soles of feet, and occasionally elsewhere on my body (e.g., inner ear, trunk, arms). The muscle aches and pin prick sensations have awakened me repeatedly for the past two nights, resulting in poor sleep. After 2 1/2 days, the fatigue and muscle aches are mostly gone, but the itching\pin prick sensations (somewhat like the sensations one gets with a case of shingles, which I had once 25&#43; years ago, or when warming extremities after being exposed to extreme cold) are still intermittently present.

Around the 4th day he started having a tickling  and numbness around the mouth area.  On 3/1/2021 he felt a difference and could tell something was going.  He went to see his PCP on 3/2/2021.  He was diagnosed w/ Bells Palsy.  He did not give him any meds that day.  When he got home his symptoms got worse.  He contacted his PCP which then prescribed steroids and baclofen.  Pt is applying warm compresses and messages.  He has also had acupuncture.  His left eyebrow is downward and the left side of his mouth is drooping.  He feels like he has sand in left eye.

                                                On 3/24 by 9:25 PM I had mild shakes. At about 10:00 PM my lips stared to tingle and become numb. Subsequently I began to have difficulty swallowing as well as experiencing some sub sternal pain. Went to get my Epipen and put it beside me in bed. Difficulty swallowing got a bit worse but as I was not experiencing shortness of breath I held off the Epinephrine injection. (What on earth was I thinking?!)The &#34;semi anaphylaxis&#34; was self limiting and by 11:00 PM symptoms had subsided completely. But by approximately 11:30 MP I had severe rigors lasting about 3 - 5 minutes. On 3/25 I developed a severe headache and a low grade T (T-max 99.9). Took Tylenol 825mg with good effect. The following night I had severe night sweats, drenching 3 sets of pajamas. Today, on 3/26 I have been experiencing several cold sweats and I am altogether feeling &#34;strange&#34; (can&#39;t put my finger on it - maybe dehydration?). Have vegan to aggressively hydrate. Notified my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office. Agreed to &#34;ride it out&#34; for now. Shall see my PPP on

                                                How the Vaccine affected my Sleep Apnea  Diagnosed: Severe Sleep Apnea Obstructive &amp; Central 2 ½ years ago with 55 events/hour Machine: BiPap ResMed AirCurve 10 ASV with Memory Foam Full Mask  Vaccine: Moderna  My first shot had little effect with minimal soreness in my arm and a slight headache. The second shot had much more effect on me. I was very active the day of the second shot and the next day. Then it hit me hard. One of the greatest benefits of my Bi-Pap is how it works on my depression and anxiety. I was really sick with headaches, fever, no energy, body aches and really being in bed all day. Unfortunately the depression hit me also. It is like a lead blanket (like the dentist uses for x-rays) over you as you ball up in bed as your mind thinks why do I exist and how to end it with more feeling of anxiety. It really felt like I would die but knew from my experience that it may pass. Luckily it did but it took 10 days before feeling alive again. I also wondered why my events/hour increased at this time and concluded that the vaccine affected my Sleep Apnea.  My Data:  30 day average: 6.34 events/hour  90 day average: 4.64 events/hour 365 day average 3.89events/hour  As you see I have a good events/hour average but it has really increased this month since I got the Vaccine. Here are my numbers.  First Vaccine February 2021 18th  3.0 events/hour (day of shot) 19th  8.6 events/hour 20th  5.2 events/hour 21st  3.1 events/hour 22nd 2.2 events/hour  Second Vaccine March 2021 18th 4 events/hour (day of shot) 19th 6.8 events/hour 20th 15.5 events/hour 21st  5 events/hour 22nd 7.1 events/hour 23rd  5.3 events/hour 24th  5.2 events/hour 25th  6.9 events/hour 26th  3.6 events/hour 27th  2.9 events/hour

Patient received his COVID vaccine yesterday and since then, patients wife is concerned he is not behaving himself and appears confused. Wife is also concerned he has a deceased appetite and decreased PO intake. Patient has no complaints at this time. Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain and back pain. HPI is limited due to patients mental status.&#34;  4/3/2021 when being scheduled for follow-up dose on 4/7/2021 his wife informed us &#34;He had a bad reaction  to the first dose of the vaccine, had to go to the hospital, was admitted and had to stay for 3 days does not want the 2nd dose.&#34;  4/3/2021 Dr (one reporting) checked system and talked to wife to obtain this history. Agreed with her that he should not receive the second dose due to how badly he felt after the first. In addition, his prior history of COVID likely gives him sufficient protection against COVID-19.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (no medical history provided.).    On 15-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DIZZINESS (dizziness) and NAUSEA (nausea). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body) and RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department), HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure), DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), DIZZINESS (dizziness), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body), RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck) and NAUSEA (nausea) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   A pharmacist suggested the patient take Children&#39;s Benadryl followed by Zyrtec to help with the itching. These medicines have not helped alleviate his intense itching. On 1Apr2021, the patient collapsed and was taken to the emergency department. The patient was treated at the emergency department after he collapsed from low blood pressure. He was prescribed Hydroxyzine HCI 10mg for the itching by the emergency room physician, but the medicine has done nothing to alleviate the patient&#39;s symptoms.  Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Ras and nausea are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Following the injection, and within 24 hours, I began experiencing severe vasovagal, with severe bloating, severe headaches, severe weakness and mental cloudiness.  It is difficult, and at times virtually impossible to urinate and defacate.  Any tissues with columnar linings are severely swollen, from the eustachian tubes to trachea and esophagus, including all intestinal organs.  In fact all organ systems are involved.  It is very painful, and has forced my retirement from practice, as I cannot provide the care that is needed for my patients.  Severe fatigue continues, with severe headaches, cloudiness, inability to concentrate.

All these symptoms continued for up to 2-3 days as heavy as, then gradually moved to my &#34;normal health&#34; after almost 7-days. During this period I took only Cetamol tablets based on the advice of my primary care physician on phone mesaging. Nowadays, I witness symptoms of tinnitus which appeared directly after the 2nd vaccine. The tinnitus was a wavy (up-down) case but it now a serious and continuous issue. This is something I did not witness or suffer from in the past. The tinnitus is impacting me a lot, and sometimes I can&#39;t sleep well.

                                                He got the vaccine, he came home and was very weak, maybe a little bit of a low grade temp.  Went to bed, got up the next morning and felt okay other than weakness and had to get a caregiver to help take care of his wife as he was not able to.  Had a temp last night of 101.9, weakness to the point that he is falling over, no equilibrium at all, not able to get himself up from the couch last night.  Very active gentleman for his age, so this is very unusual for him and it scared him that he was not able to get up.  He has a severe headache since having the vaccine.  He does have a large knot where he got the vaccine, as well as redness and soreness.  He is still feeling the same today, very very weak, no temp though.  4/22/21.  He did take 2 Advil for his temp yesterday and hasn&#39;t had anything today.

Was helped to the bathroom, but was unable to get back to bed on his own.  Fell on his bottom.  I had to call our son to come pick him up and help him back to bed, unable to hold his own weight..  Had trouble sleeping.  Abt 1 pm needed help getting up again, same disorientation, also fell off the toilet and needed help getting back to the bed, unable to hold his own weight.  Finally fell asleep.  Next day seemed fine enough. Tuesday night, became ill again, went to bed.  Got up to go to the bathroom, was wobbly, but able to make it.  Was helped back, wobbly but able to walk. Trouble falling asleep, fever, chills.  Finally fell asleep at 3 am Wed morning.  I had to go to the doctor early, so left him sleeping in bed.  When I came back around 11 am, he was still sleeping, snoring loudly.  Became concerned.  Wouldn&#39;t wake up.  Called Paramedics.  CT scan at the hospital revealed a brain bleed.  Transported to hospital. Put on support for almost 2 weeks.  No progress, no response.  Finally support was discontinued and he died April 19th at 7:52 pm.

                                                Patient became unconscious the evening of 4/14/21.  This event occurred five days after his second Covid vaccination. Patient had just gotten up from a living room chair and was walking over to the stairs to go to the second floor when he became rigid, lost consciousness and fell backward.  911 was called by his girlfriend.  He was unconscious for a couple of minutes.  When EMT&#39;s arrived he was conscious but very groggy.  His blood pressure was 250/157.  He knew his name and year and SSN but did not correctly answer several other questions.  He was taken to ER.  After numerous tests over the course of several days, he was diagnosed as having a stroke.    In the ER, they performed CAT scans, EKG, blood work, urine test and chest xray.  Blood pressure remained high.  Complained of headaches.  Patient was also having trouble voiding urine in the ER so a foley catheter was inserted.  He was admitted to the hospital.  After admission, an MRI, echocardiogram and EEG were performed.  The MRI showed three small blood vessels had burst in his brain.  Echocardiogram showed functions were normal.  The EEG showed some slowing but no signs of seizure.  The conclusion was a stroke.  Physical and occupational therapy examined patient.  No need for further therapy.  Blood pressure remains slightly elevated but he does not appear at this time to have lost any physical or mental functions.  Patient does NOT have a history of high blood pressure or heart issues.  Tests showed his heart was functioning properly.  Per his family doctor, his BP ran approximately 124/64 when tested during the previous 12 months.

Also, painful red raised bumps appeared on front of leg just below left knee.  Pain made it difficult to sleep for two nights from onset.  Joint pain in hip, knee, and ankle are still persisting to the present time, with pain intensity going from moderate to more serious.  Painful red raised bumps on lower leg are still present but are not as painful to the touch.  Joint pain in the left leg improves when I walk around, but gets worse with being seated or lying down for any length of time.

I hobbled/hopped to the hall calling out to my wife and  slid along the wall to the floor rubbing my leg and calf. After a few minutes I regained mobility and have not had that same experience. I have hadintervals of sharp aching in the hip joint and calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to experience a numbness/tingling from the injection site to my elbow as well as along my left leg and a general weakness in my left arm.

Was confused , trying to give me his remote to do what with I wasn&#39;t sure.  He had trouble with getting ideas across.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal for him.  However, we called him this morning at 8:45 am and he was lucid, he stated that when he went home around 4 pm , his left arm , hand and face were numb.  He stated that he could not pick up his cap with his left hand.  Today he woke and feels normal.  He was lucid and able to present ideas in a normal manner.  He vaguely remembers coming back to the clinic yesterday.

He couldnt put words together to make a sentence.  He got up to go into the kitchen and then urinated all over himself.  He was worried about falling sleep, scared he would die in his sleep.  The 3rd woke up and was feeling some better but still foggy headed.  Pt went to the ER about 5 days later.  They did a CT and blood work.  He thinks the tests results came back negative. They wanted him to stay longer and maybe see a Neurologist but since there wasnt one available to see at that time the pt decided to go home.  He has blood work and urine labs to be done at the facility on 2/23/2021.  Pt states he is feeling better at this time.

Sitting at home talking with my wife ant two friends and started feeling &#34;dizzy&#34;. They said I started shaking and head rolled back and I was out for a minute. I did not know anything had happened when I opened my eyes.  They insisted that I go to the hospital.  EMS came and tested me on the way to hospital- all tests good. Same at the hospital- you may have the results.   Not a seizure, no high blood pressure, maybe vaccine reaction? they weren&#39;t sure what it was, and wanted to keep me overnight and I said no thanks. Home about 5 PM I feel fine.  Please let me know if you want to go over.

But by the next morning, March 7th, the fever was completely gone as well as other symptoms.   CDC info suggested that side effects might appear up to 7 days after injection.  I was at or just beyond that time.

                                                felt so bad; severe chest pain; Chest pain and arm pain; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning her husband, a 71-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced abnormal feeling, severe chest pain,  and arm pain.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included the patient had a heart attack on 26 May 2020 and on October 2020 the patient had five bypass, two arteries they took. Since October the patient&#39;s condition was stated to be great. Concomitant medications reported included Insulin Bovine, Multivitamins [vitamins Nos], acetylsalicylic acid and Medication related to patient&#39;s heart attack.  On 12 Feb 2021, unspecified days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:007M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Feb 2021, post receiving mRNA-1273, the patient had no reaction and did not feel bad.  On unspecified day in Feb 2021 one week prior to the reporting the events, the patient experienced chest pain and arm pain, minimum that lasted for 10 minutes. 3 or 4 night prior reporting the event, the patient was feeling abnormal, went to ER and was hospitalized with severe chest pain. The patient was in a regular room and was transferred to ICU. Next day, Cardiac catheterization was performed to see the patient&#39;s heart and found that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing.  Treatment for the event, severe chest pain included morphine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event of arm pain was considered Recovered/Resolved.  The events, abnormal feeling, severe chest pain were considered as unknown. The patient is still hospitalized.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old, male patient, who experienced severe chest pain, feeling abnormal. Cardiac catheterization was performed which showed that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack (May 2020) and bypass (October 2020) confounds the causality. Further information has been requested.

The next day on March 11, 2021 3:00 pm  I had a bad reaction to the Moderna vaccine which was sudden onset of loss of mental clarity. Could not remember how old I was or even what decade I was born in, could not remember my passwords, what TV show I watched last night, the name of the place where I got vaccinated. I have never experienced loss of mental clarity before. The physical symptom was a sore arm. I went to bed early and woke up fully recovered, mentally restored and normal.

Developed bad headache which prevented sleeping. The next day, it seemed this was over, but still had no appetite and in the evening the shaking and shivering resumed. Developed another bad headache that prevented sleeping again. Next morning  (today) still no appetite and continued to feel cold. Have eaten some even with no appetite, so I could take ibuprofen which seemed to help a bit.

Couldn&#39;t sleep or get dressed.  Pain gradually subsided but 6 weeks later I still have some residual stiffness.  Reported to Publix corporate office who did not take the information.  They had me call the store directly.  Evidently there is no corporate follow-up for problems.

First noticed it 3 weeks or so after the first injection. Treated with benadryl spray/cream topically and oral to help with sleep. Not painful at first, but did develop an itching and painful area after a few days. It is now March 16th and right  arm pit is STILL red.  I had thought it was an insect bite, but did not act like that and it has  eased up, bit not gone away.  It was not until a week AFTER the Second Moderns shot in the opposite left arm  that a rash developed on the LEFT armpit/axilla area did it occur to me that it may be vaccine related and should be reported.  I have pictures.

I took the 2nd dose of the Moderna covid-19 mRNA vaccine with no immediate reaction 4 weeks later on 19 Feb 2021.   However, after approximately 14 days of receiving the 2nd vaccine, I noticed that the skin on my back began to break out with raised red spots and was accompanied with continuous itching.  As the days went by, the itchy rash got worse and spread to multiple places on my upper chest area, back, upper arms and face.  The itching became more intense as each day progressed and was constant in duration.  It also interfered with my normal sleep.

In AM extremely unsteady ; difficulty eating due to severe tremors. As the day progressed; became disorientated; confused. Needed assistance with everything. Could not walk without assist. Not aware of date or day or where he was. Went to ER per direction of the Clinic to rule out CVA due to symptoms. Blood work; urinalysis and CT of the head done- all negative. MD in the ER felt that it was related to the Covid vaccine that had been administered the day before. Slept almost entire day of 4/2/21.Walking better 4/2/21. He had absolutely no recollection of what had occurred the day before 4/1/21. Did not know he went to the ER or what occurred there.

This was basically one very bad day -- the day after the vaccination, which was my second vaccination.  The night sweats and nightmares went on for 4-5 nights after the vaccination.  Everything is OK now though.

Ambulance arrived and determined to take me to hospital after having 2nd syncope in their presence.  Remained in hospital overnight.  All vitals, heart and bloodwork were fine as seen by cardiac doctor and  determined it was dehydration.  Followed up with primary physician and told him I was urinating excessively.  He put me on Flomax 0.4 mg.  I had the 2nd Moderna shot on March 23rd and again was taken to the hospital on March 31st with same symptoms and near syncope and again was told it was clinical dehydration.  They told me to drink a combination of pedialite and water which I have been doing and I am still experiencing the dizziness, lightheadedness and weakness.  Woke up on April 4th and felt like my soul was being ripped from my body.  I honestly thought I was going to die. Looked on line and found forums of people experiencing similar symptoms.  Went to pharmacy and they recommended meclizine and have taken a clonipin for anxiety.  I am feeling better now, but worried about how long I will be experiencing these symptons.

They tend to be long in endurance, the first one took 5 hours to stop.  The others tend to last about an hour and have made daily functioning difficult.

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

Have to use a cane with 3 feet for stability. I was undergoing severe pain throughout this time. Pain from my lower back, left hip and left leg to left knee.  Was given physical therapy through the VA for 6 weeks and that helped loosen my leg up, but still in serious pain. After 2 months i am still in moderate pain but it is slowly lessening. VA has precsribed both Chiropractic and Massage treatments for me in the future.  I have lost 2 months of work and hit hard financially.

He felt okay for about 2 weeks then on January 29, 2021 he felt intense chest pain. Concerned it was a heart attack, he was brought to the hospital. He stayed one night and the hospital ran several tests like EKG, stress test and others. Found his results to be normal and was released on January 20, 2021. Even the moment he was released, he felt very dizzy but hospital was not concerned and thought maybe side effect of medication. He continued to feel dizzy, fuzzy brain and hard time staying awake during the day and sleeping through the night for the rest of the week. He passed sometime in the early hours of February 6, 2021. Doctor&#39;s suspicion is a blood clot. He has no history of blood clots, heart problems or any health issues.

                                                This patient received his second vaccine on 2/24/2021 and subsequently developed fatigue, altered mental status, and fever of 101.6.  He was taken to the ED on 2/25/2021 by his son and needed supplemental oxygen at that time and had an increased respiratory rate.  He was fairly high functioning prior to his second vaccine and has been in and out of 2 hospitals and the rehab facility several times since 2/25 and has never fully recovered.  Palliative care has been discussed.  He has had extensive work ups.  I spoke to our covering physician prior to submitting this report and she agreed that I should submit it due to his huge decline and the timing of his vaccine.

HOWEVER, 48 HOURS AFTER 2ND  INJECTION (MODERNA 027B21A% 04/02/21), BOTH KNEES STARTING HURTING. DIFFICULTY WALKING AND SLEEPING. TO DATE 6/11/21, (69 DAYS) PAIN CONTINUES. SOME OSTEOARTHRITIS HAS BEEN DETECTED IN BOTH KNEES (6/10/21). THEORY IS THAT THE 2ND VACCINE OVERSTIMULATED IMMUNE RESPONSE AND HAS CAUSED ARTHRITIS FLARE UP IN BOTH KNEES. NOTHING HAS RELIEVED PAIN TO DATE.

She was worried about an allergic reaction.  He did seem a little shaky.  They had him sit on a bench outside for fresh air.  He said this was helping.  I took his radial HR.  It was regular, 70 bpm.  I was unable to get his blood pressure due to a broken cuff.  He was feeling much better at that point.  He did eat breakfast.  He said his arm felt fine.  No rash or hives observed and no shortness of breath.   His case worker brought him some water.  We sat there for about 15 minutes.  He felt much better and the case worker said he seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.

(I tested positive on 12/22/20 with symptoms  starting 12/19/2020 and quarantined with a back-to-work date of 12/29/20.  The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..  Made me react to steady myself for just a second.

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

Want to know if this is a side effect I didn&#39;t see listed or the possiblility of coincidentally acquiring the virus. I had no symptoms prior to the injection.

                                                Dear Sirs,  My family doctor suggested I contact you regarding my unusual side effect from the second Covid-19 injection I received recently.  History:  I am a 72 year old male.  I have high blood pressure treated with 25 mg Atenolol.  I have had repeated operations for skin cancer on my face and head.  I have had pre-cancerous polyps removed through my anus.  My doctor can provide a much more detailed history if required.  First Covid injection of Moderna:  This went well and the only side effect was a sore arm.  I only noticed it if I touched it, otherwise there was no pain.  It went away in a few days.  Second injection:  I was anticipating additional side effects after reading up on the subject.  I was not surprised when my arm hurt.  It was constant and worse than the first time, but not alarming.  I also had a headache which did not surprise me from the research I had done.  The headache felt like my brain had ballooned inside my head and was in compression.  It was uncomfortable, but not painful.     Now to the matter that concerned me:  I was unable to sleep.  This was not something I had read about anywhere in my research.  Being very tired and knowing how important sleep is I decided I should go to the Emergency Room of the local hospital to be looked at.  They told me that none of the doctors, nurses and technicians had ever heard of this effect.  A technician said he would do a world-wide research on the subject and get back to me.  3 hours later he said that he could find no reports on the subject.  They conducted blood and urine tests that they said returned results showing everything normal.  They told me that they did not want to prescribe sleeping drugs because they can be dangerous and were also concerned about any side effects that may result from interactions with the Covid injection that were unknown.   They suggested I talk to my family doctor and then released me.  After 40 hours (yes forty) of being awake I broke out in a profuse sweat.  I reduced the heat, removed clothing and put a fan on.  The next thing I was aware of was 4 hours later when I awoke from sleep.  The sweating had stopped and the headache had stopped.  Purpose:  I have two purposes for writing to you.  First, because my doctor had recommended it.  Second to offer myself as a research subject in the matter.  I recognize that the world is suffering terribly and is trying to understand everything about the pandemic in order to better deal with it on a continual basis.  To that end I recognize the value of research and want to help in some small way.  Thank you.

                                                Almost exactly 48 hours after the injection, I felt pain behind my left ear, extending down my neck to my jaw and up to the side and back of my head.   The pain was so severe (maybe 3 or 4 on a 10 scale) that I was unable to sleep much for two nights.   It has now been 4 days since the injection, and my jaw area aches.  The paid behind my ear has subsided somewhat and I was able to sleep some during the day today.   My wife received her second injection at the same time as mine.  She experienced pain behind both her ears on the second day but it went away after 24 hours and she now has no symptoms. If this discomfort continues for another day or two, I wonder if I should go to a medical clinic or emergency room.

On Thursday the knee didn&#39;t get any worse but my lower back and shoulders were sore. On Friday, there wasn&#39;t much change. On Saturday the knee seemed to stabilize and the back and shoulders were tolerable. On Sunday, my stomach was queasy. On Monday, sore joints and queasy stomach. On Tuesday, sore joints especially anything injured back in time, diarrhea started. On Wednesday upset stomach, just a piece of toast to eat, diarrhea, chills, sore joints everywhere, miserable. Thursday was the same as Wednesday plus I vomited twice in the evening with sweats and a 101.1 temperature which went back down. I was miserable. I slept well last night and feel better this morning. The diarrhea seems be abating. I feel like I&#39;ve turned the corner this morning but wanted to mention due to the vaccine shot as a possible cause.

She states he is completely different and now has to walk with a walker and confusion persists.

                                                Complains of right hand pain, the meat part of the thumb.  Says it is difficult to pick up heavy items and do daily activities.  Aleve helps relieve the pain as does soaking the hand in warm water.  He does take medication for Gout and also has arthritis in his back.  Has not gotten any worse but not necessarily better.  Has not seen a medical doctor.

                                                Patient woke up at 2:00am, approximately 14 hours after dose #1. Patient states he got up and went to the bathroom, got out of the bathroom took 3-4 steps and his legs from his knees down went weak, and he went down in slow motion, could not hold himself up. He could not get back up onto his feet, so he crawled back to bed and got up into bed. Then around 5:00 got up and went to the bathroom again, and walking was hard, but he used a cane, the same thing happened again, and his legs went under him and he fell backwards and ended up on his back. He laid there for a bit and got legs straightened out and his arms had not a lot of strength from elbows down. He crawled back into bed again and about 8:00 am got up and had trouble walking and had to use a computer chair to steady himself. Then sat for a while. Had trouble getting his lower body dressed and about 10:00 am felt as if he had no strength and was going to fall again so he called his doctor. He talked to the nurse who told him to take some Tylenol and see how he was in a couple hours. He said he could get around with a walker but felt as if his legs would not hold him up. Patient states he has stiffness in his legs, but not weakness. By that night was using the walker ok, by the next morning he stated he was walking fine and did not need a cane or walker.

He had a clot in his brain and underwent brain surgery. He experienced seizures after the surgery, but it was ultimately reported the surgery went well. He remained intubated and on a ventilator after surgery. He developed complications of his lungs and kidneys while on the ventilator. Ventilator was removed 3/16/2021 and he passed away that day. The hospital providers thought the clot in the brain may have been from hitting his head over a month ago. From my understanding he was A&amp;O, independent with ADLs, and lived in his private residence prior to these complications.

                                                PLEASE HELP.  I have had moderate to severe pain at upper left arm injection site starting approximately 1/15/2021, a day after the injection, until the present.  It manifests itself mostly during sleep and awakes me with significant constant pain while in a reclining position.  When I sit up, it is somewhat alleviated and I have to take extended release tylenol (650mg) to get back to sleep.  I wake up most mornings with the same left arm pain at the injections site.  On March 16, 2021, my internist examined it and found the same bump in my upper left arm and said it is definitely from the 1st vaccination.  He suggested heat on and off for 20 minutes.  I tried it two evenings in a row and the pain got worse in bed.  Since I cannot take any NSAIDs due to my aspirin regimen for Coronary Artery Disease, there seems nothing else to do, but I am worried that some long lasting detriment is happening to my body.  PLEASE HELP.  I did not have any such symptoms from the second Moderna vaccine received 2/11/2021.

Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

By the end of the day, I had some fairly extreme pain in my left thigh and knee.  I have a orthopedic implant screwed into my left femur.  The pain level was about a 8 out of 10.  It was barely tolerable and seemed to mitigate over the next 7 days.  I still today have a pain level of about 2 out of 10 that I treat with an NSAID.  My knee is still sore.  No orthopedic implant in this knee however.

                                                Moderna COVID19 vaccine EUA Woke up at night to go to the bathroom.  Had trouble getting out of bed and walking.  Joints were stiff.  Strangely my right hand was frozen open.  Was unable to make a fist or grasp a water bottle.  When I tried to close my right hand I had a weird sensation in my hand.  It felt like electricity flowing down my hand and into my 4 fingers.  Left hand was not effected.   Had the same effect when I woke up a couple times during the night.  When I got up on Saturday morning the problem with my hand was gone.  Still a bit stiff, was fatigued, headache and body aches.  Sore arm for a few days.

He sent me straight to the Emergency room.  They gave me the clot buster for my left arm. I was in there for 3 or 4 days. I was discharged. I have blood clots in my lungs. I had a follow up appointment.  I also started seeing a new doctor, a pulmonologist,  for the blood clots in my lungs. I lost a lot of weight, 32 pounds.

                                                MY REACTION TO THE FIRST DOSE: In March of 2020 I suffered Covid pneumonia and was on oxygen and too weak and short of breath to work for three months.  It took over seven months to return my breathing and strength to baseline. I just checked my lab and I still have IgG antibodies and a negative nasal screen for the virus. One month ago at 9 AM I received the Moderna Vaccine.  About 12 hours later I developed shaking chills and a fever of about 103, pain in my arm from the injection, and severe cough and a VERY WATERY RUNNY NOSE with severe post nasal drip which caused aspiration of the discharge.   I took Tylenol, Afrin Nasal Spray, and a Dulera inhaler and fell asleep.  I woke up at 3 AM and felt well, but at 4 AM I developed an intolerable intractable cough and severe watery nasal discharge lasting about two hours and severe dry heaves from the aspiration.  Afrin nasal spray helped somewhat but I was absolutely miserable for  two hours.    Three days ago I received the one month booster for the Moderna Vaccine at 10AM.   My arm began to become painful but it was tolerable and not relieved by Tylenol. Every time I rolled over at night the pain woke me up but I was able to tolerate it.  Yesterday I woke up with severe constant chills but my temperature was normal.  I felt very hungry and diaphoretic and felt like I had a low blood sugar,  and ate a bowl of rice chex cereal. I felt a little better but a half hour later VOMITED everything up.  I then felt somewhat better and went to the hospital to make rounds.  The nursing staff reported that about half of them called in sick due to the vaccine with severe fatigue, fever, joint pains and headaches.  One nurse reported that all her joints felt like they were on fire.  Four nursing supervisors also called in sick that day.   I then went to my office and my staff said I looked GREEN and insisted I go home.  I did not eat anything but while resting I again had SEVERE VOMITING of my breakfast at about noon.  When I felt stronger I drove home at about 1:30 PM and fell asleep until about 5 PM, still not having eaten anything nor taking fluids. My arm pain went away.  By 7 PM I finally drank some tea and felt stronger and felt like I was not going to die.   It seems that those of use who had the Covid in the past do not tolerate the vaccine and suffer severe reactions. I was unable to find any studies with the vaccine given to patients who already have antibodies.  This lack of data is a real problem.

                                                Received injection at 3:30 Tuesday 2/9. By early evening I felt symptoms - fatigue and general muscle aches. By Wednesday morning (2/10) the symptoms persisted, but I went to work. By noon   I had many of the same symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID in December (9th). Headache, body aches all over, severe fatigue, loss of appetite and chills. Only this time it was worse than I remembered from December. I went home at noon, went to bed. Got up around 6PM and tried to eat, but had no appetite at all. I went to bed at 6:30 PM Wednesday and woke up at 7:00 AM Thursday with only a couple of bathroom trips. Today (Wednesday) symptoms have subsided significantly. Almost gone. Will work tomorrow.

                                                After receiving the vaccination her husband met with his son.  He reported that his dad did not know anything.  His wife told the son to bring him to Hospital.  They brought him to the hospital and got there and his son said that he had called the daughter and he did not know the day, month, his grandson&#39;s name, like he wasn&#39;t there.  He had a funny look on his face that he was &#34;out of it&#34;.  Asked simple questions about pet at home, favorite and could not remember the name of the cat.  He then came out and said that he was fine. They ran tests for a mini-stroke, CT scan, blood work.  They had a consult with Neurology, virtual.  The neurologist did some questioning, and by 3:00 they felt that it was like a mini-stroke, and she said that she felt it was from the vaccination as it occurred right after the vaccine.  She took him home, and told him to take a nap.  By 4:30 PM she woke him up and said that they were going to eat, she was getting things ready.  He was sitting on the couch about 5:00 PM and had that blank stare again.  He went walking through the house walking aimlessly and started fumbling through papers .  She called 9-1-1 and within 10 minutes they took him to the ER.  It took her an hour to get to the hospital, his daughter met them at the ER.  He told them that he was fine, and they knew that he was not.  By 7:00 PM they were going to do an MRI and wanted to admit him to the hospital.  All of a sudden at 9:00 he was having another episode.  She got the nurse and they watched him and decided that he was having a seizure, (agitation, not making sense.).  The entire episode lasts for about 30 minutes.  They did an MRI and an EEG, which she does not have the results of.   On 2/11/21 she talked to the neurologist who insisted it was due to the vaccine.  He has now settled down and has not had another seizure since 9:00 PM the night before.   He was discharged yesterday at around 1:00 PM, he slept, got up and is fine this morning.  He was diagnosed with seizures, and to FU with Dr. in Epilepsy clinic, and prescribed Keppra, which he has not taken as he feels it was due to the vaccination..   He does not remember the events that took place.

                                                The 2nd day after the injection, I got severe tinnitus.  I&#39;ve had tinnitus before this for a couple years, but it was at a minimum very tolerable level until the covid shot.  It&#39;s been 2 weeks and it&#39;s very difficult to sleep because of the unbearable increase in loudness in my tinnitus since the 2nd day of my shot.  I got a hearing test this week (Friday Feb 19th) and my audiologist said I had NO loss of hearing from the shot.

Neck pain that goes down my arm (R), extreme fatigue and achy. I&#39;ve lost 5lbs in 3d.&#39; MEDS UTD  History of Present Illness     &#34;I had that COVID shot Thursday (l arm).  Friday I started having cramps in my neck--base of my skull, R arm, into the base of my jaw.&#34;  Worse with laying down, sleeping on L side.  &#34;Hurt too much to get up&#34; (had wife help him up to bathroom).    Tried?  Bayer back and body only.  Tried some topical ben gay (made worse), vibration therapy.  Hot shower seemed to help.  Review of Systems     &#43; for chills, HA, diarrhea.  Worst yesterday.  Missed work yesterday.  Had been eating/drinking well until recently.    Assessment/Plan      1. Adverse reaction to vaccine T50.Z95A    2. Myalgia after COVID-19 vaccination M79.10     1.  Adverse vaccine response will be reported.  This seems to be fairly significant due to being 5d after.  2.  Will try Tyl 1000mg up to tid and Ibu 400 up to tid-qid for next 3 days--try to get dose of each at hs tonight.  Push fluids.  Prednisone 20mg/d x 5d.  Call report tomorrow on status.  3.  At this time, will likely avoid 2nd Moderna covid vax in this pt due to reaction.  4.  Note provided for off work yesterday through tomorrow.

I also quivered lightly for about 30 minutes. The painful burning and discoloration began fading at two hours and was mostly gone by the third hour. #3 On March 9 at 11:20 AM the same event reoccurred, exactly as the previous day. #4 On March 14 at 8:30 AM I had the third attack, which was similar to the first two. #5 I would not call this a rash. It did not itch. There was a burning, buzzing feeling. I did not touch my skin. I called many phone numbers to see if I should take a Benadryl tablet, but none of the numbers we knew or were given provided any medical expertise. #6 We have photographs on these events.

V Safe stopped communicating by Friday, 3/19. I&#39;m trying to make the CDC aware that they are missing reportable adverse react because of limited follow-up. I developed itching at the injection site on 3/20 in the a.m. I note approximately a 15 cm area of erythema around the injection site. On 3/20, after a 5 mile walk I felt similar symptoms that I had in the first couple of days after the injection of lightheadedness and felt poorly enough to have to rest the remainder of the day. I am better today and was able to function, but not ready to resume exercise. How many others have had a delayed reaction that is being missed because V Safe stops the follow-up when initial signs &amp; symptoms disappear?

Patient describes the pain as a throbbing sensation that occurs in the upper earlobe.  It interferes with his sleep. Improves with heat, aspirin/ibuprofen/Tylenol. Aggravated by swallowing.Gradually this has improved over the weekend and until today.  He has not needed any ibuprofen over the past week.  He does endorse having other side effects associated with the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, including back pain and myalgias; these completely resolved within several days. Patient denies any associated headache.  He denies any jaw claudication symptoms.

                                                Patient woke up around 3:30am feeling extremely nauseous, shaking, drenched in sweat but with a normal temperature (97.6, which is normal for him), and feeling overall terrible.  Food had tasted weird to him the day before, but he still ate. At 3:30am, he felt like he was having a major allergy attack - lots of phlegm, runny nose and eyes. He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black &#34;coffee grounds-like&#34; fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE). After getting through with that (about 15 minutes), he wretched up more thick mucus with a few flecks of black cells in it. After awhile, he felt okay enough to go back to sleep.  Around 6am, he had another major allergy-like attack, but did not vomit.  Around 8am, after being awake for awhile, he vomited again with more black liquid, about 50mL this time. He felt weak and horrible and was shaking. At the recommendation of the advice nurse, he was taken to the ER by ambulance. Upon arriving, he waited around an hour for an ER bed.  They put him on an IV, did a physical inspection and did blood work. His sodium was a bit low, but in normal range. Potassium levels were fine. He was mentally clear the whole time, but physically very weak.  He was kept overnight after a hemochrit test in the afternoon showed low levels of hemoglobin. He was stabilized in the morning, but was barely able to eat anything the whole time. He was meant to get an endoscopy, but they decided to allow him to eat and sent him home after noon bc they hadn&#39;t yet been able to schedule him for it and he was in pain and massively hungry.  When he got home, he still barely ate,  and still isn&#39;t eating almost anything a day later. His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).  They believe that he may have bleeding in his stomach or upper GI or esophagus, but we are waiting for an endoscopy later this week.  He is still very weak and frail and fatigued.

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

I had no idea what had transpired since about mid-afternoon including whether I had eaten, or taken my medication.  I could not walk in a straight line and had to hold onto things to maintain my balance.  I tried to fix my medications for the weeks and became totally confused.  It was a small task that I simply could not comprehend.  I was not nauseous and was not dizzy.  I. finally ate something because I knew I should.  I felt totally wiped out.  It was as if I was having a stroke. I went to bed and by morning the symptoms had abated except for being tired and achy and a bit of a headache (which is not unusual).

As the rash spread across my chest (left side) and blisters appeared, I went to my physician&#39;s office on March 9. Dr. diagnosed &#34;shingles&#34; and recommended OTC meds for pain and itching. In following weeks, the rash started healing, but the pain persisted which was not relieved by Tylenol or other OTC drugs. I could not sleep, and with strong pain and upset stomach went to the ER on Sat. March 27, I was seen. I was treated at ER for pain and nausea; Gabapentin was prescribed for nerve pain.

Moderna second dose 3/16/21 - same as with first dose for first week.  About 10 days after second dose hallucinations (?); 5:00 am got up, dressed, and walked downstairs asking if I had called the police, because he said I had told him to get up and come downstairs so I could call them.  There were not problems needing the police.  We took it as a very real dream and he went back to bed.  Over the next few weeks, he experienced weakness and dizziness/vertigo  causing three falls.  Went to primary care physician who prescribed Antivert and is sending him for a CAT scan and to a neurologist for further evaluation (vestibuar neuritis?  labyrinthitis?).

Secondary to that is a day of mental confusion one week out from the injection after each shot.

                                                Serious skin rash over much of my body: face, trunk, arms, scalp, groin and neck. The most serious and troubling area is around the neck where t-shirt collar contacts the skin. Some areas don&#39;t itch, but the head and neck do. Facial areas that are normally oily are now very dry, scaling and itching. Pre-existing skin problems are now heavily exaggerated. Dry areas on the fingers are worse. Dandruff is much worse. First noticed as an irritation around the eyes. Tears were burning my face, as if acidified. Then I noticed the rash on my arms. Further inspection revealed it on my face, neck, trunk and groin area. There is dryness, scaling and flaking around the eyes, nose, mouth and ears. The neck is most troubling with heat, itching and burning causing lack of sleep. It is not abating and appears to be getting worse. I will be seeking medical attention for the first time this week. If this is related to the vaccine, I want to make that known. I had the second of two shots on the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (lot #047B21A), on May 07 at noon, meaning I was fully antibody protected on 05-21, immediately before the rash was noticed. A bad body rash is associated with this vaccine, but I find no documentation that it has been observed this long after vaccination. Just the same, I am reporting this today in part because I want this to be documented as a possible reaction to the vaccine. Other possible causes have been ruled out. Currently taking Benadryl, NSAIDS, moisturizing cream, and hydrocortisone cream.

No muscle ache. After vaccination I lifted weights, stretched arm and took very cold and very warm showers on the area. My theory was dispurse the concentration to avoid the muscle ache. Maybe so. But it may have lead to full body adverse event.  I call it &#34;corona light.&#34;   yesterday I rec&#39;d 015M20A. so far left arm site slightly swollen, aches, small pain with light touch (avoiding any movement of arm). so far so good.

                                                Extreme sensitivity / intolerance to  loud sounds.  During the cleaning of  my house by people who have been doing it for years I found that the sounds of a vacuum cleaner working and normal conversations between the cleaners and my wife and daughter became almost intolerable.  I was unable to concentrate on work I was doing and had to go to a room where those sounds were significantly less.  I have never before experience this intolerance to customary sound levels.  The intolerance passed within about three hours of when I noticed it.

                                                About 8:00 pm the day of the injection I had trouble staying awake. I ended up sleeping almost continuously until about 9:00 pm of day two. I was awakened perhaps 20 times to urinate throughout that time, which is extremely often compared to my normal. I would lay back down and be asleep almost immediately. I tried to eat and drink during one of my awake times, but I had no appetite and no desire to drink. Throughout day two I had a fever. I was totally unable to function on day two. About 10:00 pm of day two my appetite returned. About 11:00 pm I returned to bed and had a full night&#39;s sleep.

                                                On 2/15/21 I began to have difficulty understanding something that I was reading. I turned to tell my wife and was unable to speak clearly. Went to ER on 2/16 and was attended a neurologist. He believed that the dx was likely &#34;recrudescence stroke&#34; was the symptoms were very similar to the previously noted stroke from 2016. All testing (CAT scan, EEG, MRI, MRA, echo cardiogram, and blood work was all normal/negative).  I&#39;ve been a licensed physical therapist for over 50 years but had never heard of a recrudescence stroke.  After reading about the signs, and symptoms I believe it was exactly what happened and was correct when he called it a recrudescence stroke

                                                On February 21 I had my first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. The next morning I experienced a mild 24-hour flu with low fever, fatigue and diminished appetite. My left arm, where I had the injection, was mildly sore. The following day all was fine. At 10:40am March 21 I had the second Moderna vaccination at the same location. By 7pm that day I began to feel flu-like symptoms. By 9pm I had a fever of about 102 degrees, moderate chills and sweats. By midnight I could barely sit up in bed to go to the bathroom, and had to steady myself on the walls as I walked. At one point during the night I began gasping for air and breathing hoarsely. I woke up hourly all night. Throughout Monday the weakness continued. I was slightly nauseous, developed mild diarrhea, and emptied the bowels. Zero appetite; drank lots of cold water. Slept the same as Sunday night with occasional chills and sweats. No more gasping episodes though. Tuesday ? Thursday I improved very gradually. Ate small amounts of plain yogurt, then plain toast. A low-grade fever came and went. I rested in bed all day and slept fitfully. Still very weak. Fast forward to March 31, 10 days after the shot. My appetite is OK now, no fever for several days, energy level about 85% of normal. I am very appreciative of getting the vaccine. The intense reaction to the second injection was startling, as my health has generally been excellent. I have masked and kept socially distant since last March.

Unable to sleep further. at about 4:00 AM got up for bathroom break and      My eyesight was unfocused (and remained so until the afternoon)      I had trouble moving my eyes; stiff; strange      My equilibrium was very poor and unsteady. Had to touch walls, etc      I was generally very weak and had trouble walking and sitting down, and then getting up At about 7-8AM, wrote my new PCP and as I was writing, I started to get intensley hot, sweat like I had malaria (I&#39;ve never had), my heart was REALLY racing, and my skin under my t-shirt became so sensitive I felt like the t was pricking me. Very strange. Started to minimize reactions about 6-8 hours after waking up. I was unable to do my morning PT because of the weakness. I typically go to bed around 23:30, but on the 26th I went to bed at 21:00 and fell right to sleep. Next day (today) was back to 99.9999% normal. Did my morning PT (about 20 minutes plus 10 minutes on the bike). What I have is still soreness in knees. Luckily my pacemaker/defib didn&#39;t get set off by my heart incident. Feel free to call me, if you want.

The blisters appear one at a time, usually 3-5 a day, every day. They are on my lower and upper legs, my torso, back of my neck, arms, in my hair and on my face. Itching, OMG they itch.   I have tried Triamcinalone, Benadryl spray &amp; tablet, CBD cream. Each gives a little relief but nothing long term. The itching is so bad it will wake me up in the middle of the night.

Extreme confusion and some memory loss continued for almost 24 hours.  He was taken to  Emergency Room because of the fear that it was a TIA or seizure.  All test preformed at  hospital came back normal (CT Scan, Extensive Labs, EEG, Echocardiogram).  He was kept overnight to make sure the event was not a precursor to a stroke.  He was released on 2/9/21 and told to make an appointment with his family physician and seek a neurological consult.

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

Some discomfort but not real pain in upper arm throughout the day, but became really tired later in the day and went to bed early. Got up to use the bathroom at about 11:30pm.  Swung my legs out of bed to the floor and went to stand up but fell forward to the carpet.  I had no strength in my legs or arms.  I laid on the floor about 10 minutes and could not roll over or sit up or get up to my knees.  My wife came around and helped me get up and back on the bed.  She then helped me down the hall to the bathroom, then back to the bedroom.  She helped me back to the bathroom one other time that night.  I stayed in bed for several hours and was very week and mostly sat all day,  I regained my strength over the next three days to where I could stand and walk, although I was very fatigued.  I am now about 9 days later and feel pretty much normal but get fatigued and my balance is not normal.

                                                Injection was given into the deltoid at an almost vertical angle.  After about two hours, and lasting five days, the left arm was extremely sore to the point that assistance was needed to don and remove clothing.  This is considered adverse as compared to the initial injection into the left bicep which resulted in absolutely no side effects.  I believe the location of the second shot drastically effected the outcome.

After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?

                                                Felt pretty good for almost 24 hours. Then, extreme fatigue set in and felt like my face was really flushed, but it wasn&#39;t. No temperature, but skin was highly sensitive to clothing like when you have a high temperature with the flu.  Worst side effect, though, was a highly exacerbated episode of my restless legs syndrome. Even though I was on the verge of exhaustion and desperately needed to sleep, it made the restless legs so bad that I couldn&#39;t stay in bed. Sat up half the night trying to sleep in a chair. This was the worst RLS episode I&#39;ve ever had by a factor of about 10.

                                                My Mom the next day, Saturday 3/20/22 had short term memory loss for a couple of hours.  My parents drove to the grocery store on Saturday afternoon.  After a few hours at the grocery store, my Dad went outside to the car and waited for my Mom while she pays for their groceries.  After waiting an hour, my Mom still hasn&#39;t come out so my Dad called her.  She told my Dad that she has no idea where she is.  My Dad went back to check on her and she said that she has no memory of her putting items in the car or talking to their friends earlier.  My Dad took her home to get some rest.  After a couple of hours, my Mom is still experiencing short term memory of not knowing what happen earlier as she kept going back to the car to check on their groceries, she kept saying &#34;its 6 pm? where has the time gone&#34;, and she kept saying am I going crazy I can&#39;t remember what happen.  My Dad and their friends verified these events happen while she has no idea.  We told her to  just get a good night of sleep that night.  The next morning, she was feeling better and coherent remembering what happen last night and during the day but she still can&#39;t remember what happen in the few hours they were at the grocery store.  Today 2 days later, March 22 she is back to normal.

                                                Initially after the second vaccine he had typical myalgias/arthralgias, especially shoulder/neck. On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.

                                                After the first dose of the vaccine, I had a mild rash on the upper part of my  body. It was very itchy. I was prescribed a steroid and after the full course of five days. Nine days after the second dose I broke out in a rash and it was very itchy. The rash went from my upper legs to my neck. I was covered in hives, they were not raised. I got a Steroid pack because I was so itchy that I couldn?t sleep. I had to visit the doctor again because the oral steroids did not work. I got a steroid shot and took Benadryl. I went back two days later and had another steroid shot and a Benadryl. I had the rash for seven days and the intense itching for five days. The doctor has recommended that I do not get another RNA vaccine.

                                                He got his vaccine, and first his body hurt everywhere.  It was very painful and felt like everything in his body was hurting, aching.  He felt nauseated, had a bit of fever 100 degrees, and normally his temp is 97.5  He was miserable.  He couldn&#39;t do anything as he hurt so bad.  He felt that it would go away and waited 2 days and it didn&#39;t go away and was not able to get up to get anything to eat or drink.  called the neighbors who called 9-1-1 and the EMT&#39;s and took his VS and took a blood sample for his diabetes and said that his VS were normal and asked if he wanted to go to the hospital, and they did not see anything wrong with him and he declined and they left.  He thought that he would feel better, and started to, not nauseated.  He was also very dizzy and really could not walk.  His neighbor brought him a walker so he could get around otherwise he would fall down into a chair.  Finally after a couple of weeks felt like he would be able to stand up without falling down.  Now every time that he stands up he gets light headed, and is able to get around without any problems, and take care of himself, but has to be real careful with the vertigo that will not go away completely.  It&#39;s been 7 weeks and it&#39;s not completely gone and wonders if it&#39;s going to go away.   He has noticed that the more he gets up that it does improve.

Three days after the 2nd vaccine dose, patient had severe fatigue and some joint aches, this got much worse one week later with severe right hand synovitis, diffuse muscle and joint aches. He tried ibuprofen on 4/7/2021. this did not help. He came to see me 4/19 with severe pains. CBC, CMP, ESR, and CK levels were normal. CRP was elevated at 123. and I put him on a 12-days prednisone taper which made him feel better. He stopped that taper on May 1 and within one week his symptoms had returned in full force, this time with fever. I saw him again 5/14 and again he had elevated CRP level and also elevated ferritin level. other rheumatologic labs were normal. he still had right hand swelling and synovitis. He is miserable.
