At that time VS were stable, equal hand grasp noted, and no further concerns. Around 3pm resident became flaccid on the left side of his face and speech became mumbled. Hand grasp was equal at that time and VS were stable, but B/P was elevated compared to previous recordings earlier in the day. Family did not want him sent to the hospital and asked for comfort cares. Hospice referral obtained and he will be admitted to hospice in the near future. Resident&#39;s left side of face has improved within the last 48 hours. He remains total assist with all cares.

                                                This was dads 2nd vaccine in the Moderna series. He experienced arm soreness and fever up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit for 48 hours including chills, fatigue, and lethargy. Since that time he has experienced confusion, loss of mental acuity,, loss of appetite, confusion, loss of short and long term memory. His ability to provide for his needs on his own have greatly diminished. Prior to the second injection my dad was fully supportive of his own care and mentally sharp. He does seem to be recovering at times, is once again able to take care of his personal needs, but doesn?t eat and is still confused. He doesn?t want to leave his chair..

                                                My birthfather had an adverse reaction after he got his 1st Moderna COVID vaccine.  He lives alone and was doing well with some underlying conditions. The day of the shot was fine.  The next AM, he had vision changes and sudden numbness in his R arm/leg and fell after getting up.  ?The numbness went away pretty quickly, but the visual changes remained.  He refused to go to the ER/Dr.  The next week and a half, he was weak, tired, and couldn?t think as clearly.  ?He was brought to the ER? on Wed, 3/3/21 at Hospital.  He was found to have a low oxygen level, possible a-fib, fluid retention, emphysema, and aortic stenosis, in addition to his other health issues.  ?The Dr said his symptoms the day after the vaccine were a mini-stroke..  He was released from the hospital on Friday, 3/5/21.  On Saturday, Hospice came to see him, since nothing can be done for his medical conditions; however, they decided not to sign him up yet, since he I was told they didn&#39;t feel he needed to, at this time.  One of my sisters is staying with him during the day until he builds his strength back up.  Do you think his Mini stroke and health changes had anything to do with the vaccine? He will not be getting the second COVID shot.   ?We?re all caught between a rock and a hard place as far as what to do, esp for older folks.

                                                My Dad found he could not sleep that night until nearly 6 am. He tossed and turned but only slep a couple of hours. Mind racing, but no restless legs syndrome. The next day, he had no soreness at all, but he woke up constantly all night and couldn?t settle to sleep. That happened for the subsequent  5 nights after the vaccine, he just got short naps. On Tuesday the cardiologist said he could safely take melatonin ( he also tends to low bp) and he took 10mg tap(last 5 mg time released). He woke up frequently but was able to get back to sleep. He has been taking that tablet most nights and sleeping better.

                                                Hi, my name is, I&#39;m a RN and am submitting this report about my grandpa.  I took him into the VA to get his second covid vaccine on 2/17/21.   At that time my grandp lived semi-independently in a house between my parents and my uncle .  He didn&#39;t get out very much but with some help of grocery shopping and organizing his medication he was still able to live alone and function well independently.  My mother reported to me on 2/18/21 that my grandpa was confused, weak and tired.  My grandpa has never had any signs of dementia.  At this time he developed a delerium that waxed and waned.  He complained of headache, no appetite and extreme weakness.  On 2/23/21 he fell down in his house and we decided to move him into my uncles spare bedroom to keep better eyes on him.  The delerium persisted and on 3/5 he was taken to Hospital for a workup for his delerium and weakness.  There he saw Dr. an internal medicine doctor at hospital.  The workup showed an elevated BNP (probably baseline but I&#39;d have to look at previous lab results) but nothing further.  We opted not to do further imaging and instead take him home.  It became obvious to me that this was the end of his life and so I requested a hospice referral from Dr. My grandpa died on 3/24/21.

He did take some Tylenol and gargled with salt water but lumps were still there. He also complained of some chilling but stated that went away. His daughter took him to his primary care doctor on 2/4/21. He stated the doctor told him to continue taking the Tylenol, gargling, and encouraged him to keep walking. He is supposed to contact his PCP if needed.

He was miserable all day.  I called his physician and we decided to keep him comfortable at home and give him the BRAT diet which seemed to be helping with the pain and vomiting.  Dad never got out of bed again.  On February 4th, Dad was placed on Hospice and died on February 7, 2021.
