At that time VS were stable, equal hand grasp noted, and no further concerns. Around 3pm resident became flaccid on the left side of his face and speech became mumbled. Hand grasp was equal at that time and VS were stable, but B/P was elevated compared to previous recordings earlier in the day. Family did not want him sent to the hospital and asked for comfort cares. Hospice referral obtained and he will be admitted to hospice in the near future. Resident&#39;s left side of face has improved within the last 48 hours. He remains total assist with all cares.

                                                This was dads 2nd vaccine in the Moderna series. He experienced arm soreness and fever up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit for 48 hours including chills, fatigue, and lethargy. Since that time he has experienced confusion, loss of mental acuity,, loss of appetite, confusion, loss of short and long term memory. His ability to provide for his needs on his own have greatly diminished. Prior to the second injection my dad was fully supportive of his own care and mentally sharp. He does seem to be recovering at times, is once again able to take care of his personal needs, but doesn?t eat and is still confused. He doesn?t want to leave his chair..
