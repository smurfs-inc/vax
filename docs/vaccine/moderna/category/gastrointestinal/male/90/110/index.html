He vomited both of these up and retemp check was done and it was up still, but then went up as high as 101.5. Tylenol was given again and this time he was able to keep it on his stomach. Fever was finally reduced and has not returned to that extreme. He was weak and a fall rick, so a sitter was placed in the room with him to keep him safe from falling. He would not wear his normal CPAP machine during sleep time. Feeling much better today.

                                                Stomach bleed from blood thinners; Tested positive for COVID-19; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 91-year-old, White, male, patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced a positive Covid-19 test and the serious adverse event of stomach bleed from blood thinners.    The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included dialysis three times a week with a port in his left arm, broken hip, and stomach bleed. No medication allergies reported. Concomitant medications reported included acetylsalicylic acid and multiple medications not otherwise specified.    On an unknown date prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient began to experience stomach bleed. He was hospitalized and discharged before the vaccination.  On 30 Dec 2020, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 025J20A, expiration date 29 Jun 2021) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Dec 2020, after the injection, the patient was tested for Covid-19, and the results were positive.   On an undisclosed date purported to be two weeks after vaccination, the patient was hospitalized due to a stomach bleed from blood thinners, and an unknown blood vessel procedure was performed.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, tested positive for Covid-19 and stomach bleed from blood thinners, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 91-year-old, White, male, patient, with medical history of dialysis three times a week with a port in his left arm, broken hip, and stomach bleed, who experienced a positive Covid-19 test and the serious event of stomach bleed from blood thinners. The event of positive Covid-19 test occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 025J20A, expiration date 29 Jun 2021) and stomach bleed occurred on an unknown date after the vaccine administration. Treatment for stomach bleed included blood vessel procedure. Based on the information provided, there is not a definite association between the vaccine administration and the reported events. Use of blood thinners could have contributed to the event of Stomach bleed, also confounded by the patient&#39;s medical history of stomach bleed and concomitant use of acetylsalicylic acid. COVID positive test was obtained on the same day as vaccination and unlikely to have resulted from mRNA-1273 administration.

He realized the right side of his neck was swollen and his throat was swollen as well. He was having trouble swallowing, talking and his breathing felt obstructed. He tried to awaken my Mother but she couldn&#39;t understand what he was saying. He finally managed to get up with on walker and make his way to get a drink of water. After that his throat seemed to loosen up some and by later in the morning  the swelling had subsided. He did not inform me until I called later in that morning to check on them and he did not feel he needed to see a doctor.

                                                Hi, my name is, I&#39;m a RN and am submitting this report about my grandpa.  I took him into the VA to get his second covid vaccine on 2/17/21.   At that time my grandp lived semi-independently in a house between my parents and my uncle .  He didn&#39;t get out very much but with some help of grocery shopping and organizing his medication he was still able to live alone and function well independently.  My mother reported to me on 2/18/21 that my grandpa was confused, weak and tired.  My grandpa has never had any signs of dementia.  At this time he developed a delerium that waxed and waned.  He complained of headache, no appetite and extreme weakness.  On 2/23/21 he fell down in his house and we decided to move him into my uncles spare bedroom to keep better eyes on him.  The delerium persisted and on 3/5 he was taken to Hospital for a workup for his delerium and weakness.  There he saw Dr. an internal medicine doctor at hospital.  The workup showed an elevated BNP (probably baseline but I&#39;d have to look at previous lab results) but nothing further.  We opted not to do further imaging and instead take him home.  It became obvious to me that this was the end of his life and so I requested a hospice referral from Dr. My grandpa died on 3/24/21.

He was miserable all day.  I called his physician and we decided to keep him comfortable at home and give him the BRAT diet which seemed to be helping with the pain and vomiting.  Dad never got out of bed again.  On February 4th, Dad was placed on Hospice and died on February 7, 2021.
