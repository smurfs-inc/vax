Resident began to run a fever of  99.7, by 18:45 it was 100.3, and then he was administered tylenol and nausea medications since he was vomiting. He vomited both of these up and retemp check was done and it was up still, but then went up as high as 101.5. Tylenol was given again and this time he was able to keep it on his stomach. Fever was finally reduced and has not returned to that extreme. He was weak and a fall rick, so a sitter was placed in the room with him to keep him safe from falling. He would not wear his normal CPAP machine during sleep time. Feeling much better today.

He realized the right side of his neck was swollen and his throat was swollen as well. He was having trouble swallowing, talking and his breathing felt obstructed. He tried to awaken my Mother but she couldn&#39;t understand what he was saying. He finally managed to get up with on walker and make his way to get a drink of water. After that his throat seemed to loosen up some and by later in the morning  the swelling had subsided. He did not inform me until I called later in that morning to check on them and he did not feel he needed to see a doctor.

                                                Hi, my name is, I&#39;m a RN and am submitting this report about my grandpa.  I took him into the VA to get his second covid vaccine on 2/17/21.   At that time my grandp lived semi-independently in a house between my parents and my uncle .  He didn&#39;t get out very much but with some help of grocery shopping and organizing his medication he was still able to live alone and function well independently.  My mother reported to me on 2/18/21 that my grandpa was confused, weak and tired.  My grandpa has never had any signs of dementia.  At this time he developed a delerium that waxed and waned.  He complained of headache, no appetite and extreme weakness.  On 2/23/21 he fell down in his house and we decided to move him into my uncles spare bedroom to keep better eyes on him.  The delerium persisted and on 3/5 he was taken to Hospital for a workup for his delerium and weakness.  There he saw Dr. an internal medicine doctor at hospital.  The workup showed an elevated BNP (probably baseline but I&#39;d have to look at previous lab results) but nothing further.  We opted not to do further imaging and instead take him home.  It became obvious to me that this was the end of his life and so I requested a hospice referral from Dr. My grandpa died on 3/24/21.
