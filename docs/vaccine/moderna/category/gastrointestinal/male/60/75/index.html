Meclizine and Ondansetron was used immediately.  Scopolamine was prescribed by the physician on 01/08/2021,  picked and used on 01/09/2021; felt better . Residual dizziness remains after use.     P.S. I do have a medical history of BPPV for the last 2-3 years and have been treated for it. Generally speaking my BPPV symptoms resolve themselves quickly after treatment. This current episode has lasted  forthree days.

Insomnia that night accompanying whole-body aches/pains/malaise.  Pain most notable in extremities. Nausea more significant at 12 hours (i.e. 6AM) but no vomiting. Significant lethargy all day 1/22/2021. Pain/nausea gone by 6PM but lethargy remained.  Slept most of the day. Symptoms gone by following morning (1/23/2021), so roughly 36 hours.   Overall these were symptoms consistent with a really bad case of the flu, minus the respiratory symptoms.  I often work through illnesses like the flu.  Couldn?t work through this.

                                                After second Moderna shot, Pt developed nausea, headache, extreme fatique, and bad back and leg cramps/spasms to the point where he couldn&#39;t walk.  These symptoms lasted for 48 hours and gradually subsided.  His wife (me) was so frightened that I will not be getting the Moderna series since it&#39;s so dangerous and will caution friends and family as well.

I remained in bed until about 4pm 2/5/21 &amp; soaked in a hot bath which relieved the joint pains.  Headache, nausea &amp; weakness continued 2/6/2021 &amp; 2/7/2021 with the headaches coming if any sudden movements such as coughing or standing up too fast &amp; nausea irritated by eating anything but saltine crackers.  Today is 2/7/2021, took sick days from work 2/5, 2/6 &amp; 2/7.

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

                                                Evening after 2nd injection (Friday, March 6, 2021): severe, debilitating pain, specifically in the area of the heart. Went to ER and was given EKG, Chest X-Ray, and blood tests to check for heart attack. Symptoms subsided after a bit. Labs were inconclusive. Sent home. Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

Uncomfortable but never to the point of difficulty breathing. ~08:30, BP 128/99 (I think) Systolic up only a bit.  Diastolic very high for me sent to urgent care part of clinic.   Monitored BP, oxygen, did EKG (normal), symptoms started easing ~ 09:40.  Sent home. Attending PA though it might just be a Vaso-Vagel response, but, after hundreds upon hundred of needles, I&#39;ve never had such a response, and, my symptoms did not involve a low BP, fainting or nausea, rather I remained conscious, had throat constriction with increased BP and a narrowed pulse pressure  range.

On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), PURPURA (Purpuric rash) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), NAUSEA (nausea) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools), PYREXIA (Fever) and CHILLS (Chills). The patient was hospitalized for 3 days due to ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION, ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE, NAUSEA, PURPURA, RASH and THROMBOCYTOPENIA. At the time of the report, RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine), THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia), PURPURA (Purpuric rash), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation), NAUSEA (nausea), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools) and CHILLS (Chills) outcome was unknown and PYREXIA (Fever) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In February 2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Negative COVID-19 test. In March 2021, Alanine aminotransferase: 90 (abnormal) 90 U/L. In March 2021, Aspartate aminotransferase: 196 (abnormal) 196 U/L. In March 2021, Bilirubin conjugated: 5 (abnormal) 05 mg/dl. In March 2021, Blood albumin: 1.9 (abnormal) 1.9 gm/dl. In March 2021, Blood alkaline phosphatase: 216 (abnormal) 216 U/L. In March 2021, Blood creatinine: 3.2 (Inconclusive) 3.2 mg/dl. In March 2021, Blood lactate dehydrogenase (122-222): 381 (High) high. In March 2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) Findings consistent with pulmonary edema.. In March 2021, Glomerular filtration rate: 19 (Low) eGFR - 19. In March 2021, International normalised ratio: 1.13 (Inconclusive) INR - 1.13. In March 2021, Platelet count: 84000 (Low) 84000/uL. In March 2021, Serum ferritin (24-336): 2400 (High) 2400 mg/ml. In March 2021, Ultrasound liver: abnormal (abnormal) Ultrasound of the liver confirmed liver cirrhosis..     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter considered THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia) and PURPURA (Purpuric rash) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation), NAUSEA (nausea), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools), PYREXIA (Fever) and CHILLS (Chills).    Concomitant medications were not provided.  Hepatitis panel showed a heavy viral load of more than 11 (no reference range was provided).  Per reporter, on presentation to the emergency room the patient was afebrile, had a blood pressure 183/106 mmHg, pulse rate of 82 per minute and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Treatment included anti-hypertensives and intravenous diuretics. On day 3 of hospitalization, patient left the hospital against medical advice.  Based on reporter&#39;s causality, the event purpuric rash is assessed as possible related to mRNA-1273. However, the reporter also indicated it could have been precipitated by the underlying thrombocytopenia, liver cirrhosis and Hepatitis C infection. Very limited information regarding the other reported events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality, the event purpuric rash is assessed as possible related to mRNA-1273.

                                                I haven?t had the chills like that in forever! It came in waves. You just lie there, hot, and ache all over, then this wave of chills hits for maybe 5 seconds then dissipates. The 2 mins later, it happens again! And this goes on for  an hour or more! I had to pee but was worried I?d be too cold to stand still. So I waited until I could not wait anymore. OMG! Trying to stand up! It?s as if my joints no longer worked! And when I did stand up I was dizzy as hell! The next day, utter exhaustion. I am so weak, it takes effort to move. Even breathing took work! I didn?t sleep all night as every position I lay in was uncomfortable and had twinges of chills. The amount of energy it takes to physically get up and walk to the bathroom is dumbfounding! This morning I am achy, hot and cold, exhausted, and just had a bout of dry heaves. I?m hoping to be able to get some sleep today.

Was admitted to the Neuro-Neurosurgery Unit.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

Took Tylenol  and slept throughout the day.  Got up around 12:30pm, felt better, did decide to go for a jog to get body temperature  up.  Jogged for 60 minutes, returned, ate and rested again.  4th day, felt much better, no dizzyness, still a little tired but maybe 85% energy level.  5th day back to normal.

                                                Had COVID vaccine on 02.11.21. States the next morning his anxiety was very high. States he did not know who he was. Still experiencing a lot of anxiety at night. Admits to heart palpitations and hard time breathing. Can&#39;t sit still. Reports manic episodes and cycles of depression over the course of hours. Patient states it has gotten a tiny bit better. Tried trazodone which helps temporarily. Denies chest pain. Patient states he has no appetite. Palpitations resolved pretty quickly. Shortness of breath is described as tightness that comes with anxiety feeling. Resolves with shoulder massage. Occurring three times per day. Also admits to dry mouth. Patient admits to needing to sleep with multiple pillows or feeling like he had to sit up and couldn&#39;t lay down as shortness of breath would get worse.  EKG in office on 2/24/21 showed ST-T changes and given symptoms patient was transferred to emergency room via ambulance.  Work up in hospital was unremarkable and patient was diagnosed with pericarditis (unknown etiology) and prescribed NSAIDS from ER and discharged.  Admission not required.   Patient followed up to us as outpatient on 03.02.21.  Patient felt much better and had not take motrin for 1 day.  COVID testing obtained at this point (unclear why ER did not send it).  Patient referred to outpatient cardiology given risk of cardiovascular disease, stress echo, and event monitor.

We recommend that they be evaluated in an ER because this a/e is not common with the vaccine and there is need to rule out other causes of patient&#39;s symptoms such as appendicitis or other abdominal emergencies. Pt went to see doctor today as we rec&#39;d and MD thinks is gallstones and patient will be having an ultrasound tomorrow.

( Pepto bismol, charcoal capsules, imodium, rice, tumeric, and Xifaxin)  Imodium would stop the cramping but not the wateriness of the stool.  Unlike any diarrhea over the course of my life. I will not be taking any booster shots.

While in bathroom, became dizzy, broke into sweats, and felt I was about to faint. I went to my knees holding onto counter. My wife came in to help me in bathroom. She observed I was incoherent but uttering moaning sounds and breathing heavily. She called 911. While on phone I came to and vomited into sink. It appeared I had not digested anything from dinner that night. After vomiting (1x) I felt much better.  First responders reported normal vital signs. I did not go to E.R. that night but went to Urgent Care later that morning and all seemed fine.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and a few weeks later he noticed jaundice and hematuria. He was admitted to the Hospital, and was noted to have dramatically elevated eosinophils (26.29 k/uL), elevated creatinine (2.36 mg/dL) and elevated LFTs (AST/AST/Alk Phos/Tbili all up, mostly direct). His eosinophils improved with pulse dose steroids and the diagnostic work up continues. There is diagnostic uncertainty about what caused this dramatic increase in eosinophilia, but it appears temporally related to getting the vaccination. Our working diagnosis is autoimmune vasculitis, but he is also being treated for possible parasitic infection, and will require very close follow-up. 61M with PMHx HTN p/w generalized fatigue, L flank pain, and decreased UOP.   He was in his usual state of health until 5 days prior to admission with onset of general fatigue/sluggishness. This was followed by a few days of dull abdominal pain, watery bowel movements, and increased frequency which spontaneously resolved, though the fatigue persisted. Yesterday evening, he noticed new L flank pain, red urine, and decreased UOP associated with mild dysuria (he describes it as needle-like pain in his urethra) which prompted him to call EMS. Denies fevers/chills/night sweats, myalgias, respiratory symptoms, melena/hematochezia. He&#39;s never had pyelonephritis or kidney stones before, no recent urinary instrumentation, antibiotic use, or hospital stays.    He recently received the first COVID vaccine and is due for the second COVID shot on Monday. He lives with his sister and works as a mechanic. He is not on any other medications or supplements. Not currently sexually active.

Notably has been afebrile and fairly well appearing. Symptoms were preceded by several days of watery diarrhea, cough with sputum production and subjective weight loss. Recently received moderna vaccine, and he was concerned it causes his symptoms.  Underwent extensive workup as below with involvement of multiple services including Renal, Pulm, Rheum, Allergy, ENT, and Cardiology. Had one nasal lesion biopsied by ENT, which was non-diagnostic. Renal bx prelim without clear e/o vaculitis, although obtained after steroids. Negative testing for primary hypereosinophilic syndrome. Extensive w/u notable for ANCA positive at 1:80 with  MPO only slightly elevated (20, uln 19) and PR3 wnl.  cMRI with eosinophilic cardiomyopathy, for which cards was consulted as below. Additionally, toxacara ab positive and schistosoma ab indeterminate, although per ID both schistosomiasis and toxacara infection unlikely. Per rheum, overall felt presentation 2/2 hypereosinophilic syndrome, potentially the eosinophilic stage of EGPA (given low &#43; ANCA, low &#43; MPO) vs.  End organ effects of idiopathic eosinophilia. Briefly received CTX 2g IV qd (4/10 - 4/12) until diagnostics returned. Treated with solumedrol 1g qd x3d (4/11-4/13) transitioned to prednisone 60 mg qd (4/14-) to be continued until rheum f/u, with rapid decline in eosinophilia. Received pre-treatment with PO ivermectin 20 mg before steroids. Treated with flonase nasal spray, symbicort and albuterol for respiratory symptoms. Deferred cyclophosphamide, with consideration of IL-5 or IL-5R targeted biologics as an outpatient. Treated with atovaquone for PCP ppx. Per ID, treated with praziquantel (for schistosomiasis) and albendazole (for toxacara) out of an abundance of caution, although low c/f visceral larva migrans given lack of compatible imaging findings and no known exposure to dogs and cats or schistosomiasis given remove travel history.

Baseline Cr unknown but Cr was 1.5 (OSH BI) and urine alb:Cr was elevated to 36 in 6/2018, at which time CKD was thought to be 2/2 untreated HTN. Now presented with persistent hematuria, HTN and proteinuria with UCx without e/o infection, all favoring nephritic process. Renal and urology consulted MALB/CCR 994.5. CT scan with hydronephrosis, felt to be eosinophilic pyelonephritis. Pt underwent uncomplicated renal bx 4/14 (after steroids) which showed preliminary very mild focus of interstitial nephritis with scattered eosinophils and immunofluorescence evidence suggestive of a mild immune complex-mediated disease without current activity. EM pending. He was treated with sodium bicarb 1300 mg bid. Hematuria improved but did not resolved by time of discharge. Cr on discharge 1.6, close to baseline of 1.5 in 2018.    #Sclera Icterus #CBD Dilation on CT #Elevated LFT Sclera icteric and CBD dilation on RUQUS to 1.8cm with gallbladder sludge and small gallstones. MRCP with diffuse intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation to the level of ampulla, with associated ductal and gallbladder wall edema, complex material in the gallbladder lumen and CBD, and confluent periportal lymphadenopathy. No obstructing stone or discrete mass. Findings likely represent cholangitis such as eosinophilic cholangitis in light of severe eosinophilia.. No documented LFTs here, but OSH (BI) records indicate normal LFTs and viral hepatitis studies in 6/2018. Repeat Hep B non-reactive non immune, HCV non immune, HAV non-reactive.  BIli remained stable and ALT and AST continued to rise after initiation of steroids. GI was consulted. RUQUS 4/15 with dopplers with persistently dilated CBD to 1.4 cm with sludge in CBD but with patent portal vein and hepatic veins. Anti smooth muscle ab positive on day of discharge; antimitochondrial ab pending. LFT uptrending at time of discharge, although patient declined to stay inpatient for further workup. LFT at discharge ALT 194, AST 114, ALP 262, TBili 6.3, DBili 5.3. ERCP to be considered as an outpatient.     #HTN SBP on admission 160-180. History of HTN, not on any home anti-hypertensives. Per BI records, he was prescribed amlodipine 10/valsartan 160 in 6/2019, but pt reports self-discontinuation after ~2 doses. BP remains poorly controlled. Likely related to potential nephritic syndrome or renal infiltration by eosinophils, likely with contribution of high dose steroids. While inpatient, treated with hydralazine, labetalol, carvedilol, and amlodipine. BP regimen on discharge amlodipine 10 mg qd, carvedilol 25 mg qd. Avoiding ARBs and ACEI per Renal, although will likely need to add once AKI resolved.    #Microcytic Anemia Patient with drop in Hct from 14.1 on admission to 11.4 4/14. Continues with hematuria, but denies current hematochezia. Suspect combination of blood loss and hypopoliferation given RPI 0.29, likely anemia of inflammation/acute illness given ferritin 1.010. Vitamin B12 &gt;2000, Folate 11. Iron 151, unable to calculate TIBC. Noted to have persistently low MCV in low 70. Hemoglobin electrophoresis ordered.    #Vitamin D deficiency #HyperPTH 25-OH Vitamin D 6. No e/o hypocalcemia. Phos slightly elevated on admission, but subsequently downtrending, likely iso renal dysfunction. Treated with ergocalciferol 50,000 U weekly x12 weeks   #Right mandible lesion Sclerotic changes of the right mandible near the condyle noted on CT scan. Surgeon recommends outpatient follow-up, although patient declined.    #Hematochezia #Hemorrhoids Patient with new bloody diarrhea 4/11. Some e/o hemorrhoids on exam. CBC stable. Treated with tucks pads, dibucaine ointment and hydrocortisone cream.   #Little Medical Follow-up Pt reports that he has not seen a doctor in ~3 years.Cholesterol 124l LDL 73, HDL 10. HgbA1c 5.2. Will join Dr&#39;s panel on discharge   #CHIP mutation  RHP with DNMT3A mutation at low VAF. Will follow in cancer precursor clinic

                                                After my second shot after approximately 8 hours I got a severe headache perfuse sweating and vomiting, this went on continuously until Monday when I went to a family practitioner, she blew off my symptoms and sent me home where I continued to have these symptoms on and off. When on I was completely disabled. I filed a complaint they called on 4/15/2021, and told me I should go to ER, I told them I was flying the next day to see my mother who is passing away. I promised if my symptoms were still there in morning I would go to ER. I woke up feeling great and then I had a bowel movement my headache was so bad I thought I was having a stroke, I started sweating bullets and vomiting. it was so bad the only thing I can compare it to was when I had  Tick fever in the early 90&#39;s. I called 911 at hospital I was in a dangerous arrhythmia throwing PAC&#39;s and going in and out of 2nd third degree heart blocks. They can not figure out why, the neurologist I saw theory is the same I had, a severe inflammatory reaction to the 2nd moderna shot. He put me on a 3 day course of prednisone which helped a lot in my recovery. I am currently on a heart monitor to see if the heart block was just temporary. I see the neurologist again in 3 weeks.

                                                I had the Covid virus early in November 2020 I had a bad reaction to my 1st Covid shot and wanted to ask if I should get the second one? I was able to get an appointment for a Covid vaccination thru store/pharmacy. I had the shot about 4:00 on Friday. On Saturday about noon I started not to feel right; head ache and stomach. About 4:00 I started to get an increase in my temperature. At 5:30 I started getting uncontrollable shaking. Over a span of about 30 minutes I had 4 or 5 episodes that lasted 30 - 45 seconds. I had a temperature at one point that reached 102.3 I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen every three hours before falling asleep for the night. On Sunday morning I still had a slight temperature (99.9), but it seemed like all my body joints ached. I ended up feeling better about 4:00 on Sunday. Reply

                                                On Friday (05.19.2021), fourteen days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (on 03.05.2021) at pharmacy, I began experiencing body aches (mostly leg cramps) followed by nausea, headache, and fatigue. They continued through  the next 36 hours. Today (Sunday, 03.21.2021) the headache subsided, but the nausea and fatigue remain, albeit less so than yesterday. I had similar symptoms in the first 24 hours of receiving the first dose but understand that to be a very common experience.

Between 5-10 minutes after injection, I just passed out (don&#39;t recall that happening).  Woke to 2 EMT&#39;s by my side asking to check my blood pressure..  I don&#39;t recall the numbers however they stated I &#39;bottomed out&#39;.  shortly after gaining consciousness, I became nausea loosing contents of stomach twice.  Remained under observation for 30&#43; minutes, then wife drove me home.  Slept until 5:00 when I was steady enough to walk unaided, and finally eat some dinner.

No productin of saliva was happening making swallowing difficult. Additionally eyes felt dry/itchy. Tongue and lips also felt swollen but didn&#39;t appear swollen. I was able to work up a slight amount of saliva after few minutes and swallow with moderate difficulty. Purchased a bottle of water and had no difficulty swallowing that. Did not seek assistance as my heart rate was normal, no difficulty breathing, no outbreak of hives or swolllen face/extremeities. Departed store at 25 min. as symptoms get worse.  Symptoms gradually abated by 12 hour mark.

I couldn&#39;t walk (well, I could with great difficulty leaning on furniture) and was very dizzy and felt like I would throw-up.  I moved to a reclining chair and stayed there 20&#43; hours (it&#39;s 20 now)... I got up to go to the bathroom and not much more.  I had a difficult time even making it to the bathroom.  Never had a fever (that I know of... I don&#39;t have a thermometer but didn&#39;t feel feverish or chilled), but I felt dizzy and nauseated all day and could hardly move from the recliner except for extreme need.

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

                                                Approximately 5 days after receiving 1st dose of vaccine, patient woke up from nighttime sleep feeling &#39;itchy&#39; all over body. Found approximately 10 red, raised spots or &#39;welts&#39; on skin that he had never seen before. They were sporadic, NOT clustered. He described as not quite hives. He checked bed for &#39;bugs&#39; but didn&#39;t find anything. He had taken metaxolone for only the second time in his life before bed. Prior use did not elicit any type of &#39;rash&#39; as described. He applied no topical nor ingested any oral medication at this time. He mentioned he has IBS and also had 1 instance of diarrhea. He then took 1 imodium. He was able to eventually fall back asleep. When he awoke the next morning, all but 1 spot were gone and no indication this had ever happened. He has experienced a mild headache off and off since injection, but nothing significant that keeps him from his normal business.

When I got under covers and warmed up so chills subsided and breathing returned to normal it felt like I was being squashed in a Panini press. Every cell in my body felt like it was vibrating in pain. I had to get up ever hour or so to urinate. I would be back in sever chill mode before i made it to the bathroom and it took about 5 minutes back in bed for chills to stop and breathing back to normal. I was also nauseous the whole time but did not vomit Then. The room temperature was 72F. This continued for 12-14 hrs.  I then tried to drink cranberry juice and eat 3 bites of a banana which  I immediately regurgitated. The rest of the day I was drained of energy. No sleep 48hrs. 3 days

His symptoms persisted throughout the night into the next day (3/10/21), and he went to his primary care physician. He vomited multiple times in transport and at the physician&#39;s office. Due to the nature of his symptoms and his concurrent hypertension there was concern for stroke and he was taken to the emergency department at Medical Center for evaluation around 4pm. Stroke was ruled out, and he was sent home with a prescription for meclizine with a presumed diagnosis of vestibular neuritis. 3/11/21 patient did not leave the bed except to use the restroom, however vomiting controlled with meclizine. 3/12/21 symptoms persist and patient has not yet improved.

Nausea and slight headache during the  night at about 3:00 AM that went away in a couple of hours. Arm pain persisted the next day. The following day the pain also involved the armpit, possibly lymph glands. Lesser pain at the injection site and arm pit areas the following day and was very slight the third day after the injection. Can?t wait for my second dose and despite the side affects will happily stand in line for my next dose.

Later that night my arm started hurting and I felt a sharp pain in my forearm, my fingers felt like millions of needles were picking them in both hands, and I had severe abdominal pain just below the belly button. The abdominal pain was so severe that I was screaming out in pain and my wife had to hold me. I took three ibuprofen, still have the pain, but fell asleep. The abdominal pain went away the next day. The other symptoms took a few days to get rid of.

                                                ADVERSE EVENT REPORT: MODERNA VACCINE 1 of 2 Dates: Feb. 17 to March 16, 2021  1. I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks. At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

Approximately 8hours later I had a 103 temperature and was vomiting most of the night and suffered the chills which made me shiver uncontrollably.  I was feeling terrible the whole next day but the vomiting had stopped.  The headache and fatigue  along with more than usual muscle aches. The next day the headache stopped but the fatigue and muscle aches slowly diminished.  Today I am back to about 80 percent of being normal still am a little fatigued.

                                                Found dead at home slumped on the floor; Loss of appetite; Body aches; Feverish; A spontaneous report was received from a physician, concerning a 65-years-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced feverish, body aches, loss of appetite, and death.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia. Concomitant medications reported included metformin, glimepiride, lisinopril, atorvastatin, aspirin, methimazole, propranolol, and cilostazol.   On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 037k20a) for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On an unknown date in Jan 2021, some time after receiving the vaccine, the patient was feeling feverish with body aches and loss of appetite.  On 09 Jan 2021 at approximately 21:30, the patient was found dead at home slumped on the floor. According to the paramedics, the patient was dead longer than when his wife found him, and no resuscitation was performed.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, feverish, body aches, loss of appetite, was considered resolved. The patient died on 09 Jan 2021. The cause of death was not reported.  The reporter assessed the event, death, as not related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine. The reporter did not provide assessment for the events, feverish and body aches, in relation to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 65 year old male patient with medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia, who experienced the serious unexpected event of death, non-serious unexpected event of loss of appetite, and non-serious expected events of fever and body pain.  The event of death occurred 5 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. The events of fever, body pain and loss of appetite occurred an unspecified period of time after the first dose of mRNA-1273.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Definitive causal association is confounded by age and medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia.

Threw up before exiting building in rest room.Needed to get out of building ASAP fast for fresh air . Breathing-20 degree fresh air maskless helped but still felt weak so wife and medical aids brought me inside to isolated area on a cot to rest and take vitals .  When I was sick with COVID-19 in September 2020 I had same issues with heightened smell and taste before I lost them for three months.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

I felt that I was extremely ill for the first 45 hours.  I ate very little and I could not bathe.  I stayed in bed, leaving only to go to the restroom.  On the 3rd day, I was much improved and I would characterize my symptoms as moderate.  I was able to get up for short periods and I was also able to bathe.  On the 4th day (today) I believe that I am symptom free with the exception of continued arm soreness at the injection sight.

I remaining in bed off and on for about 36 hours and then worked my way back to eliminate most of the symptoms.  However, after that and continuing at this time, i continue to be achy, particularly in my joints and my hands, fingers and neck, and I find that my lower jaw seems to be moved forward when I awake in the morning.  The achiness is particularly acute when waking in the morning, particularly in my fingers..  The pain is by no means debilitating, but it is noticeable.  I would rate the pain 3 or 4 when waking and 2-3 throughout the rest of the day.     I have not sought any treatment.

                                                On February 19th, one week after shot I woke up with severe dizziness and nausea. Room was spinning and would only stop by sitting up. Eventually dizziness subsided but had mild nausea all day. Dizziness returned each morning for following week but not as severe as on the 19th. Went to an urgent care where they gave me rapid and pcr covid tests. Both came back negative. Also checked heart and blood pressure multiple times. Everything was normal. Reported everything to my doctor. On March 6th, woke up at 7am with severe dizziness and nausea again. Dizziness is subsiding and nausea is gone. Seeing doctor on March 10th and will discuss then.

                                                Prior to the vaccine on 2/13/21, He was a healthy 65 year old active college professor.   32 hours after the vaccination on 2/14/21, He had acute pancreatitis, which led to  septic shock and respiratory failure, and he was placed on a ventilator at  Hospital.   On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

                                                I developed a hive/rash below and above my waist line on my stomach area.  I also felt bloated in my lower stomach.  I noticed it when I was undressing for bed. It was a mild reaction that came and went quickly once I laid down to go to sleep.  Some belching relieved the bloating in my stomach.

Diarrhea is not a common health event for me.  It is not listed as one of the common side effects so I thought I should report it.  I have not been been feeling ill.  Event came on very sudden.  I had eating lunch between vaccination and diarrhea.  Only side effect from first shot was a sore shoulder for two days.

By 7 PM headache became a bit stronger, and loss of appetite; becoming more fatigued; generally just feeling &#34;crummy&#34;. About 8 PM I took prescribed amount of regular strength Tylenol, and went to bed, easily falling asleep. Woke about 7 AM next day feeling noticeably better. I took another dose of Tylenol, just as a precaution. I would say by 11 AM all illness was gone.

                                                About six hours after receiving the Covid Moderna vaccine I quickly began constant tremors that was strong enough that I could not walk or stand. I did not have a thermometer but I?m certain I had a fever. This lasted throughout the night. The following morning I was bedridden, unable to eat and had flu like symptoms. This is continued for three days now. I am slowly Beginning to gain strength but I?m still bedridden.

Okay next day and night but then next two evenings chills (not lasting as long) with eventual headache (more treatable). Okay again today, and will contact Clinic about it in case they want me to get a Covid test before the second vaccine. Concerned that the &#34;reactions&#34; have been so long after the vaccine, and that it was only the first vaccine. Can find no info matching this course of events....

                                                Fairly strong headache in the middle of the night. Took 500mg acetaminophen, which worked well. Awakened Saturday morning to the call of diarrhea. After four additional visits to the toilet in the next two hours, I started keeping track of these episodes. Over a period of 24 hours (Sat 8am-Sun 8am) I HAD to visit the toilet 31 times. Each episode was accompanied by a serious need to evacuate my bowels. Lots of pressure and pain in my intestines, every time. The first 4-5 sessions had considerable content, but after that, the almost-liquid movements could have been captured in 2 tablespoons (not a lot of content). After about 12 visits, which required vigorous wiping to remove the gelatinous remains, my long-dormant hemorrhoids started bleeding bright red and rather profusely. By the 18th visit they had reduced to pinkish smears, and remained that way until the present. I also became very tired and sluggish after about 8 hours of repeated toilet visits. The diarrhea episodes continued all night, allowing me only short cat-naps in between episodes of gnashing pain. After 24 hours (Sunday morning), the diarrhea episodes reduced in intensity and frequency, but the near-liquid consistency has remained through till just now (Sunday evening) where the content is slowly growing (about 1/2 cup) and beginning to have a little more solid appearance. I have been napping all day.

                                                Within 12 hours of my second shot I experienced the typical symptom cluster, headache, fever, aches, and fatigue. I then experience stomach cramps and a brief bout of diarrhea. All of the above symptoms resolved within three days, however the stomach discomfort and cramping persisted for more than a week. Upon going to my local ER I was subsequently diagnosed with appendicitis. I am suspicious that this was triggered by the vaccine, as there is growing evidence that the appendix plays a role in the immune system, the response of which was exploded by the second shot. I have never had stomach issues in the past, confirmed my medical exams and preventative colonoscopies. I am extremely healthy, eat well and my bowel habits are quite regular and reliable.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after receiving my first Moderna vaccine I developed a cough, fever, chills, runny nose. I assumed these were  some of the symptoms as a result of the vaccine. I monitored my fever for several hours. The cough persisted for the next 9 plus days and I didn&#39;t have any desire to eat or drink liquids. I lost my taste and smell during this 9 day period. On February 25 my wife and I took a Covid-19 self test at pharmacy. Also on this same date I went to urgent care My wife was concerned about my labored breathing.  My vitals were checked and I requested a chest xray. I was given 2 prescriptions. 1 for Prednisone 20mg and Ventolin.

                                                By 9:00 pm the evening of my vaccine I was having chills and a fever of 100 degrees. Not that high I know but for me it is and gave me a very bad headache and body aches.  I did not feel good enough to try to sleep until about 1:00 am after using a heating pad and hot tea to try and chase the chills away and Ibuprofen for the aches.  My shoulder was so sore from the shot that I could not lay on my left side.  The following day I was about 50% better. No more chills but still slight fever and no appetite.  Didn&#39;t feel good enough to do anything except take a nap.  The following day I was pretty much back to normal.

Then sleep interrupted by chills, and then sweats (so much so that  had to lay down a towel and another towel for my pillow). The next day was dominated by body aches and headache (I rarely get headaches). Loss of appetite.  This general condition of malaise lasted all day (the day after injection) and it was at times horrible. The symptoms  started to subside by the evening hours and I was able to have a better night sleep. By the next morning I felt better.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Approximately 16 hours after the injection, I felt tired. As the day progressed (within 2-3 hours), I experienced a feeling of malaise and body aches and no appetite and a slight runny nose.  I took two (2) OTC Tylenol to relieve the pain (worked very well!) and consumed two (2) 12 oz cans of ginger ale over the next 8 hours.  Upon waking up (about 40 hours after the injection), I felt rested, alert and about 95% of great. No symptoms or other side effects whatsoever since.

He has an already scheduled appt w/ his Diabetic doctor and will discuss his symptoms with him to see what he suggest he should do about the diarrhea.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

On 3/27/21, he got a fever that ranged between 99.7 to 102.6.  He could not eat and thinking about it made his stomach upset.  Every bone and joint in his body ached, even his skin hurt and he had a bad headache.  Tylenol did little to alleviate any of these symptoms.  His fever  broke on 3/27/21 about 11 pm.  He still did not sleep well and slept until noon on 3/28/21.  His symptoms persisted except for the fever, though he still had chills that night.  He still did not feel well throughout 3/29/21 and 3/30/21 and he still ate very, very little until 3/31/21.  On 3/31/21, he was able to eat and went to the grocery, but it wiped him out and he slept for a couple of hours in the afternoon.  He still has a dull headache and very little energy that is keeping him from doing his daily activities.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (10 day hospitalization and administration of oxygen therapy) on 01-Nov-2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension and Diabetes mellitus.    On 02-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). In March 2021, the patient experienced BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to AGEUSIA, CONSTIPATION, DYSSTASIA, GAIT DISTURBANCE and POLLAKIURIA, and then from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to ASTHENIA. On 06-Mar-2021, GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) had resolved. On 24-Mar-2021, ASTHENIA (weakness), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) and AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) had resolved. At the time of the report, POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination), BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant medications were not provided by the reporter.

                                                Injection was given very close to the shoulder joint in my left arm, as a result within a few hours a very sharp pain in my shoulder caused me to be unable to lift my left arm without extreme pain, not muscle pain. By 4:00 pm I was sapped of energy. During the night I developed chills and ran a fever of 100.4 F. By Sunday morning I felt nauseous, but did not vomit. At 2:00pm 12/10/2020 my fever has lowered and the nausea has subsided, but the shoulder joint is still very sore.

                                                Had a little bit more than normal soreness in the shoulder, felt like bruising.  The day after the injection started getting flu symptoms, fairly severe, fever, coughing, runny nose, no energy at all.  Felt like he had a the worst case of flu he ever had.  He is getting better, but still has some of the symptoms.  The only thing he has taken for it is Nyquil and took a Sinutab.   Did have nausea, diarrhea, everything that comes with the flu.  Sinuses are drying up, energy is coming back and able to eat again.  He did call his doctor and he recommended that he call us and report this event.  He did have to postpone a procedure that he was scheduled for on Monday.

                                                I had a severe reaction which put me in bed for three days.  Symptoms included: fever, chills, aches, severe headache, nausea, loss of appetite dehydration due to inadequate fluid intake.  And insomnia due to fever and pain.   I receive a influenza vaccine each year and hardly notice any consequences. The symptoms I had in response to the Covid-19 vaccine were much worse than when I have had the seasonal flu.

Took another 24 hours for headache to go away. Cough still exists. Still little appetite. Things that I normally would like, I don&#39;t want or don&#39;t taste just right. Having to force myself to eat. It was worse than when I actually had Covid-19 in March 2020.

Began experiencing steady pain and stiffness in left shoulder injection site within an hour of injection and continued throughout rest of day, night and next day (2/25/21).  Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).  Very lethargic when woke up on morning of 2/25/21 and had slight fever.  Laid in bed for 2-3 hours after woke up; did not get up until 12:30 PM due to no energy.  Not nauseated, but have no appetite.

                                                One week post injection, on February 18, I developed  chills and a fever starting around 9 PM. I experienced diarrhea starting around 10 PM. Fever was approx 100.4 F and was accompanied by a splitting headache and significant body aches, to the point where I was unable to get any sleep that night. I noticed Covid arm the next morning. Fever, headache and body aches continued until Monday morning. I took only Extra Strength Tylenol. Most of the time Tylenol was effective only for the first 2-3 hrs before the discomfort overcame it. I was tested twice for COVID, both Friday AM and Monday AM. Both came back negative. Starting Monday the body aches and fever began to subside but I was left with a feeling of exhaustion and required continuous sleep.  Today is the first day I feel back to normal. I still have a large Covid arm rash, two weeks post injection. It causes no discomfort whatsoever.

He wasn&#39;t able to speak for 3 days.  On 2/17/2021 he went to the hospital.  They thought he may have Bell&#39;s Palsy so the they did a XRAY and CT.  They were not able to find anything other than facial swelling so he was discharged and told to come back if he did not get better and they would make him an appt w/ an ENT.  He started taking Aleve.  He no longer has constant pain but his mouth still hurts when he opens it.  He will contact his PCP to let her know what happened and to let her know that he will not be taking his 2nd covid vax dose.

                                                Nothing at all for 14 hours...not even a sore arm. Around eleven that evening, severe headache; nausea; muscle aches arms &amp; legs; and most serious two seizures (spasms??) about 5 seconds apart.  I?ve only had a few muscle cramps in my life so the seizures were unusual to say the least. They started in my lower abdomen (seemed like a small band going full circle around my body) and moved incrementally up towards my shoulders.  Rapid movement upward...kinda like squeezing a tube of toothpaste. Each one was only about two seconds long but fairly violent. If I had anything in stomach, it would have been on the floor.  Everything was gone (except the sore shoulder) by five in the morning.

                                                I suffered a heart attack on March 11, 2021, at approx 145pm, while sitting at my desk - WFH.  My symptoms were sweats, nausea, followed by chest pains beginning on the left side of my chest; sweats and nausea subsided for approx 1 hr, returning again, followed by chest pains radiating  the across the full chest approx.  I left my desk at the onset to wash my face, returning to my desk to talk a scheduled phone call at 2pm, lasting until 3pm.  I left desk to walk outside to take in some fresh air, my wife ask me if I was ok, I said no.  She ask if I was having a heart attack, to which I replied, I don&#39;t know.  shortly there after we left for the ER at arriving approx 4pm.  At that point ER staff did a quick assessment, taking my to an ER patient room where i was advised by the attending Dr that they thought I was having a heart attack.  Shortly thereafter I was taking to the Cath lab where a stent was insert and then taken to ICU.  Where I remained until I was released on 3/12/2021 at 3pm.  There was no detectable heart damage and I was placed a regime of blood thinner, a beta blocker and cholesterol med.  I do not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or history of heart problems.  My last physical was Feb 2021.

Wednesday temperature fluctuated between 101º and 104º with chills off and on and no appetite. Thursday temperature stayed about 1º above normal all day, but my appetite came back in the afternoon. Had the runs that evening and night - a lot of water came out. Friday temperature back to normal and no runs. Treatment was to take Tylenol, turn up heat, get under extra blankets and sleep/rest as much as possible. Only drank water and grapefruit juice, and only ate clementines (didn&#39;t want to eat anything else until Thursday afternoon).

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                A week after my second Moderna vaccine shot, I started to experience pain in my abdomen area  under the skin surface.  The pain became progressively worse. I thought I had shingles but no rash or blisters.  I took a blood test on 3/30/21 and it was negative on shingles.   I was examined by a doctor on 3/31/21 and she is scheduling  an appointment with a neurologist at the local hospital, due to inflammation of my spinal chord.  She said she wants to rule out transverse myelitis.

I had little or no side effects with pain at  the exception of pain at the injection site, and minor body aches for two days.  My second Covid-19 vaccination was on March 5, 2021. I experienced a terrible headache, nausea, bodyaches, slight fever, and chills. These symptoms lasted for 3-4 days.  A couple days later I began to hear a hissing sound in my right ear. There is nothing I can do to eliminate  it, and it continues today.  Sometimes it?s soft, and sometimes it?s very loud, but always constant. I reported it to my family doctor on March 23, 2021.

                                                DEATH!  About 24 hours after getting his 2nd Moderna Covid-19 shot, patient got deathly ill with explosive vomiting and diarrhea. Not long later he was passing out.  Paramedics were called, and he was taken to the hospital where he passed away from a massive heart attack. The doctors gave him clot-busting drugs in an attempt to save him.  He has never had problems with blood clots in his life.  He was the healthiest one of us all,  and was almost never sick. The doctor said that it was probably no coincidence that he died so soon after receiving his Covid shot. I am convinced that they are connected.  A healthy man suddenly gets blood clots in his heart 24 hours after getting his shot?  Not a coincidence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

                                                Felt fine after injection, walked 5 miles home &amp; assured loved ones before going to bed that vaccination went fine with no side effects. After midnight I woke in the dark with many of the same symptoms as when I had COVID in March/April 2020: extreme allover body aches, terrible thirst, extreme weakness.  Next day (Wednesday) symptoms continued; too weak &amp; achy to watch all but the core parts of the inauguration; too uncomfortable to read or to concentrate on music or anything else.  Absolutely no appetite so I didn&#39;t eat.  Wednesday night I tossed &amp; turned all night with a chill that I couldn&#39;t lose even with the heaviest down comforter &amp; supplementary blankets.  That night &amp; the following day I also noticed a distorted sense of time, where hours seem to pass v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y.  On Thursday night two more symptoms appeared: a tremendous cough that I couldn&#39;t stop or assuage with the normal remedies (e.g., lozenges, tea with honey), and that kept me from falling asleep till dawn; and diarrhea (which was limited because I hadn&#39;t eaten since Monday dinner so I didn&#39;t have much food in my system).  The cough felt like it might develop into a sore throat (which had been my first symptom when I had COVID) but it never did.  Yesterday (Friday) I felt as if my symptoms (other than residual weakness) were abating, and Friday night I got a full night of unbroken sleep.  I awoke on Saturday morning with no symptoms, and felt well enough to challenge myself by attempting my usual 90-minute yoga/stretch workout, which proved to be no problem.  Now, at 4 pm on Saturday--about 100 hours after my shot--I feel fairly normal &amp; seem to have no further symptoms.  I do plan to lie low &amp; take things easy, and to have as little outside contact as possible between now and my second shot (scheduled for 2/16) in order to minimize the possibility of re-infection.

                                                My symptoms started at 1:15 am. I woke up with chills, shivering. I have an infrared thermometer to check temp,  no fever. I have an oxygen/pulse thing. My pulse was very high for me, it was in the high 90s and then it would occasionally go to 100-105 to 115 but then would go back down into the 90s and it stayed that way for approximately for 60-65 hours after the shot. It was all over the map, I even had some heart rates in the 40s-50s. Finally it broke after about 60-65 hours and it returned to normal. My normal resting heart rate is in the 60s-70s and occasionally in the 80s but never the 90s. On Saturday approximately 9:30 I had no appetite, I didn&#39;t want to eat anything, I felt like I was going to vomit and didn&#39;t eat anything but just felt nauseous.

My wife had to help me get out of the recliner and get dressed for our trip. Also I was very confused. I was a bit nauseous and did not want to eat.  My blood sugar was 226.  For the next 6 hours as we traveled, I had to pee every 30-45 minutes. I needed help getting in and out of the rest stops and the vehicle.  As we traveled I mostly slept. I did drink a little diet soda, but did not eat.  After the 6 hours of travel I felt a stronger and was able to get out of the car and into the houses by myself.  For the next 24 hours I felt week, ate very little and sugers ran high.

                                                Beginning about 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I started having really bad headaches, behind my eyes radiating to the back of the head. At about   15 hours post vaccine I had chills, fever. The chills and fever were bad enough that in addition to sleeping under two blankets I had to put on a thick fleece ?hoodie? and pulled the hoodie over my head. I developed about 48 hrs of nasal congestion, and some retrosternal chest pain. I had one episode of nausea with vomiting about 8:00 am the next morning. I had to take two 325 mg Tylenol every 4-6 hrs to deal with the headache and fever. The most severe symptoms of  headache and fever subsided in about 24 to 36 hrs after the vaccine was administered. I had a lot of fatigue for several days, along with aches and pains. It took me about 5 days to really start feeling normal again, but the fatigue lingered for a few more days.

                                                I started feeling fatigued on Sunday Feb 14. I started feeling this way in the afternoon. Next I felt like I had indigestion so I took some tums. At about 1:00am on Monday morning I woke up and felt really bad and thought I had indigestion so I tried to take some more tums and vomited. I was really weak and short of breath. I laid back down and tried to go to sleep but my heart felt like it was racing. Within an hour I was back up vomiting again with shortness of breath, weakness, heart racing. I tried to lay back down but within another hour I vomited again. This went on until 8:30am Monday morning. My pulse was everywhere. 97 to 112bpm. I was having chills all day and weak. I slept a lot Monday and also had diarrhea on Monday morning. I couldn&#39;t eat all of Monday and finally ate some soup on Tuesday. I am feeling much better today but still a little fatigued.

                                                Approximately 7 hours after vaccination, suffered an almost immediate nausea, weakness and dizziness which lead me to pass out for several minutes; these symptoms passed within 24 hours.   Had pain in the right lower jaw below a dental implant and pain below the hip in the right ischium (in the hip with an artificial hip replacement).  The jaw pain disappeared in 2 weeks, and the hip pain still evident after 3 weeks.  X-ray of right hip revealed no abnormalities.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

I must have slept at least 3 times my usual 6hrs/night both days. Also Friday and increasingly Saturday,  the injection site got much more swollen, hot and stiff than any other vaccination I have ever had. I wish I had been warned of this probability, I need to sleep on that arm due to reflux issues. Sunday morning I awoke with all health and energy back to normal. I will be sure to get my (reluctant) 2nd shot in the other arm.

I got things under control by increasing the TEGRETOL dosage and adding gabapentin.  BP 125/75 P69 T99.0.  I have controlled this disease for 20 years and I never have had an event like this. I can only assume the inflammatory component of the reaction to the vaccine activated the neuralgia.

                                                patient states that immediately following administration of covid vaccine on 2/5  he began to experience profuse sweating, dizziness and nausea. He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

                                                Chills beginning 4 hours after 2nd dose. Extreme swelling in right lymph node in neck. Severe rash up neck, over the right ear, across right cheek, around right eye and across right side of nose. Our family doctor examined patient on Thursday, 2/25 and said it would get better on it&#39;s own. It continued to worsen and he was very ill with vomiting, low grade fever and chills. On Monday 3/1 he went to the ER was put on Kefflex antibiotics. The diagnosis was cellulitis.  After 7 days of treatment he is much better, the rash has dried up and only red scabs are left to heal.

                                                Approximately 10 days after the vaccination I began to develop muscle and joint pain on my left side. two days later I started to have problems breathing and the muscle pain, all on my left side, worsened. A day or two later I developed a fever of 102 and the muscle and joint pain became worse, again all on the left side of my body. To treat the fever I took Motrin, this also helped with the headache. I also had a lose of appetite as these symptoms progressed and lost about 7 pounds. I developed a cough that persisted for about 7 days. These symptoms were intense for about three days and persisted at varying intensity for about 10 days.

                                                Because of the absurd character limit in this field, I am putting my adverse reaction statement on the continuation page. About 10pm, about 9 hours post injection, I was feeling weak and fatigued.  I went to bed and was starting to feel chilled, but not shaking.  I hopped into bed and turned on my electric blanket in a room that was 75° (from passive solar house heating during the day) and wearing only a T-shirt, sweat shirt, and sweat pants.  The first post-vaccination symptom I experienced was when I laid down and my right upper arm (at the point of the injection) was very sore; it was too painful to lie on my right side.  The injection area felt hard. I fell asleep about 11pm and woke up about midnight; I am generally a very light sleeper, rarely sleeping more than ~3± hours (most less than) at a time.  At 1:30am, I could not sleep so I watched a recorded movie.  All the while, I was feeling progressively worse.  About 2:30am, I felt really chilled, so I cranked up the electric blanket to its highest setting and put on some heavy wool socks, a pair of long-johns under my sweat pants, put on another heavy sweatshirt over my existing sweatshirt, and placed another blanket on top of my electric blanket: very cold / chilled but not shivering.  The movie ended about 3am, and my stomach was excruciatingly aching.  I did not feel I could eat anything which I really felt a need to do, but was concerned that I would just vomit.  However, I did take two, 500mg Tylenol tablets with a half a glass of water.  I might have slept for an hour or so, but was quite restless.  I remember looking at the clock at 4:00am.  By 5am, it was considering calling 911; my stomach ached so badly.  It was then, that I had the feeling / recollection I had this &#34;illness&#34; before.  About 5:30am, my stomach symptoms started to ameliorate; by 7:30am, they were gone.  However, I still felt miserable.  I then wondered whether my stomach symptom was just a concomitant bout with &#34;stomach flu&#34; where I experienced (severe) abdominal cramps and pain; nausea; and low-grade fever.  I have had the stomach flu a limited number of times before and, after 6± hours, it all went away: I just had to suck it up in the meantime.  Before I filled out this report, I wanted to consider whether my stomach flu was a reaction to the vaccination or incidental to the vaccination.  However, after talking with my neighbors and my sister&#39;s friend, who also had the Moderna vaccination, three of the four &#34;victims&#34; had similar symptoms to me.  Thus, I deduced I did not have a bout with stomach flu.  Additionally, a dog walking partner, who is a rescue worker, also noted folks she knew also had similar symptoms with the Moderna vaccine.  I then started wondering what kind of artificial cocktail, a.k.a.: antifreeze, was the suspending medium for the vaccine.  If this has to be stored at absurdly low temperatures I commonly have negative reactions to artificial chemicals.  The minor surgeries I have had are uneventful but for the anesthesia chemical concoction I am given.  I commonly takes me more then 2-3 days to detoxify that and feel normal.&#39;  As in this case, I pretty much laid in bed for the next 2½ days, with no energy or desire to attend to personal issues, including walking my dogs.  However, my subclinical temperature was pretty much gone after the second day.  The notable soreness in my arm was mostly gone after two days, but the injection point was still sensitive to pressing on top of the injection site: I could still feel it.  I have a very high tolerance for pain and have never experienced anything like this.  &#34;Pain&#34; from flu, etc., shots rarely, if ever, lasts more than 10-15 minutes post injection.  There was definitely something in the suspension media that reacted with my body chemistry / biological processes.  I am NOT looking forward to the booster shot; most seem to have a reaction to the second shot that is worse than the first  unless their first shot was uneventful and the second shot had considerably milder reactions than my first shot.  The next time I will definitely have a bowl or two of jell-O in the refrigerator to help quell any (expected) gut reactions; jell-O has always been a comfort food for me in those situations. What a horribly designed survey.  This is next to impossible to complete online.  After timing out twice, I had to start over and opted to download the fillable form PDF.  Even then, I am not given the option to select the subdirectory _where_ it should be downloaded.  Fortunately, I saw the option to open it directly. If you are going to make the &#34;adverse reaction&#34; field so limited, relative to field size and the absurd online time limit, how can you expect meaningful, complete reporting of post-vaccination reactions?  This form CANNOT be fully completed in the time allotted without timing out.  This is, most certainly, a deterrent to adverse reaction reporting.  One has to wonder how many folks just gave up after getting timed out the first time. With this kind of disincentive, how good or complete or meaningful is the adverse data collection procedure?  Have you purged all the supporters?  They do not like real, accurate, objective data, particularly information that is not consistent what they want to believe or the narrative they want to spin.  No respectable scientist or decent journalist would accept third-rate data.  How can public interest decisions be made with a shoddy data collection effort?

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

                                                10 days fatigue has continued. My husband is a cross country and track coach and runner himself. He is very very fit so it is very unusual for him to not be outside doing major work in the yard or out running. Instead he does anything for a short period like 30 minutes and he comes in and goes to bed middle of day and retires to bed right after eating dinner even as early as 6 pm.  His appetite is less than usual.

Ten days later he awoke feeling dehydrated and drank some water which he immediately vomited back up. No food had been consumed. He then developed a cutting sore throat (as in the feeling of strep throat) and developed a fever of 101&#43; along with general joint aches. In about four hours the fever dropped abruptly along with the sore throat. Patient felt tired the rest of the day then awoke the next day feeling fine.

These symptoms began to subside the next day lasting four and a half days except shortness of breath that lingered for two weeks and still is not fully restored. As you can see  by the dates these reactions happened at two different dates.

The morning after I received the Moderna injection (Tuesday), I had a fever of 99 and diarrhea. My fever rose during the day and I had chills. By 9:00 PM my temperature peaked at 102.4. I was taking Tylenol (1000 grams?) every 6 hours. The diarrhea, chills and fever all subsided during the night, so that on Wednesday morning, my fever was back to 99. It  did not rise during the day and was back to normal Wednesday evening. The chills and diarrhea never returned.

                                                2/16/2021:  Telephone call to PCP/DR: I.  This is all a little strange. Especially with the fever. I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.  He was told to go back on Mycophenolate which he started on Friday. Left hand pain from palm to wrist on Saturday.  Some shoulder pain on the left and right side.  Sunday pain got worse.  Went to the ER at hospital yesterday.  Dx&#39;d with carpal tunnell syndrome and gave him a wrist brace. He is taking tylenol/ibuprofen (200mg two tabs q 8 hours) as directed. Temp was 99.8 yesterday.  Temp is 99.5 this morning altho he is taking ibu/tylenol as directed. His wife reports he has traveling pain.  Today is pain is in the Right hand and right shoulder.  No left sided pain today.  Today he is able to hold a spoon in the left hand. He had a &#34;real rough night last night&#34;, didn&#39;t sleep much. She has called Rheum but hasn&#39;t heard from them. Okay to put him in with NP? For ER follow up?  Or should something else be done? 2/19/2021: Call to office PCP/DR. His wife called saying that he went to the emergency room for severe pain in his left hand and swelling he could not hang on to anything.   The pain started on Friday and kept getting worse all weekend . The er told him that it was carpel tunnel and gave him a wrist splint.

While on the toilet I felt a little nauseous.  For a minute or so, I thought I was going to throw up as well.  The nausea passed after a few minutes, but I felt very fatigued.  Got home and have been laying down.  It&#39;s now 5:20pm, 3 hours later, I&#39;m feeling better, but still a little tired.  I have a slight &#34;flu like&#34; feeling that I feel &#34;off&#34;.  I blessed with good health but I feel a little &#34;off kilter&#34;.  I thinking I&#39;ll feel better tomorrow.

Rolled back onto my back, let my head clear, turned to my right, and got dizzy again.  Felt nauseous, but did not vomit.  Problem was worse with eyes closed than with eyes open.  Spent most of the day  in bed.  Vertigo slightly better on day 2 after vaccination, took Dramamine after consult with doctor.  Much better on day 3.  Essentially back to normal on day 4, but do experience slight dizziness upon waking before getting out of bed.

My primary care phuysician recoemneded that I go to ER on 2/23/21 to have Cat Scan (negative), EKG (normal), blood work (normal except high glucose reading). ER doctor diagnosis was peripheral vertigo not central and discharged me with recomendation to take OTC meclizine twice daily. The spinning side effect has virtually disappeared, still some lightheaded feeling and persistent equilibrium./balance problems exist that prevemt from me driving and performing most daily activities. My Chiropractor has prefromed the  Epley Maneuver twice now but has had very little impact on my equilibrium and balance issues, I have an appointment with a specialist Nuerotologist on March 10, 2021

Fortunately, the vomiting relieved the nausea, and Acetaminaphen broke the fever. Happily, after a very long night&#39;s sleep, the only remaining side effects are continuing fatigue and slightly sore arms.  Note: Form did not allow me to answer below about mild side effects from second shingles vaccine dose I had during the past year. Effects included chills, mild fever, headache, body aches, fatigue. The shots were given at the pharmacy in our local store, but I don&#39;t recall the date our other details.

However, every day, he got weaker and weaker. He has been treated for Liver cancer, he received his first infusion of Opdivo almost 4 weeks before the vaccination.  About 7 days after the shot, he was having trouble swallowing so he went to the ER to get a CT scan. He was found to have greatly elevated troponins, the DR was baffled he wasn?t having any chest pain; they were apparently not trending either., he has never had a heart attack or any other heart problems, takes Nadolol for high blood pressure. The CT scan showed significant growth of his tumors  which had been stable for a year and the last CT scan was the end of January; liver enzymes were also significantly elevated whereas they were stable before.  My father deteriorated rapidly, and died on 3/18/21. The day he got the shot just prior, he was hauling wood, shoveling snow and living a normal life feeling good. The day after the shot he could barely get out of bed he was so weak, until he finally died 16 days later.

He took Tylenol every 4-5 hrs. &amp; stayed in bed. By Sunday his fever slowly started to go down.  And by the following  Mon. morning, 3/8/21, his fever was gone.  He felt weak but otherwise well enough to perform normal day-to-day activities/work.  12 days after that, on 3/20/21, he developed the exact same symptoms &amp; went to bed immediately &amp; took appropriate Tylenol.  His fever, this time, only went to just under 100.  He is scheduled for his second shot on 4/2/21.  Should he get it?  If not, what does he do???

                                                Patient is a 70 y.o. male w/ h/o CHF,HTN, sleep apnea on CPAP and 2 L O2 at night, IDDM, CKD stage III-IV, prior tested positive for SARS-CoV2 (12/2020) presented to SAMC ED w/ the complaint of SOB.    Pt states he received his 2nd dose of Moderna SARS-CoV2 immunization 4 days prior to arrival and developed SOB since then. He states that the SOB progressed and included coughing productive of bloody/blood-tinged sputum. The main reason he decided to come to the hospital was because of his shortness of breath and associated chest tightness which he says radiated into his abdomen.    In the ED he was found to have new RBBB and troponin 7.2. He was seen by cardiology d/t concern for NSTEMI, started on heparin gtt, and taken to the cath lab. There he was found to have RCA lesions x2: the more proximal underwent stent placement, the more distal lesion was unable to be stented. Post-procedure pt&#39;s respiratory status was tenuous and therefore CCM was consulted. Patient discharged 9 days after admission after somewhat rocky course of recovery.

Subsequently I began to have difficulty swallowing as well as experiencing some sub sternal pain. Went to get my Epipen and put it beside me in bed. Difficulty swallowing got a bit worse but as I was not experiencing shortness of breath I held off the Epinephrine injection. (What on earth was I thinking?!)The &#34;semi anaphylaxis&#34; was self limiting and by 11:00 PM symptoms had subsided completely. But by approximately 11:30 MP I had severe rigors lasting about 3 - 5 minutes. On 3/25 I developed a severe headache and a low grade T (T-max 99.9). Took Tylenol 825mg with good effect. The following night I had severe night sweats, drenching 3 sets of pajamas. Today, on 3/26 I have been experiencing several cold sweats and I am altogether feeling &#34;strange&#34; (can&#39;t put my finger on it - maybe dehydration?). Have vegan to aggressively hydrate. Notified my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office. Agreed to &#34;ride it out&#34; for now. Shall see my PPP on

Unclear when began to feel bad. 3/11/2021  9:07 pm EMS transported to Hospital Center ED for altered mental status following vaccination. ED physician note states &#34;70 y/o male with pmhx of CAD, CVA, HTN, DM, myopathy and DVT on  Xarelto presents to ED with complaints of generalized weakness and change in mental status onset yesterday. Patient received his COVID vaccine yesterday and since then, patients wife is concerned he is not behaving himself and appears confused. Wife is also concerned he has a deceased appetite and decreased PO intake. Patient has no complaints at this time. Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain and back pain. HPI is limited due to patients mental status.&#34;  4/3/2021 when being scheduled for follow-up dose on 4/7/2021 his wife informed us &#34;He had a bad reaction  to the first dose of the vaccine, had to go to the hospital, was admitted and had to stay for 3 days does not want the 2nd dose.&#34;  4/3/2021 Dr (one reporting) checked system and talked to wife to obtain this history. Agreed with her that he should not receive the second dose due to how badly he felt after the first. In addition, his prior history of COVID likely gives him sufficient protection against COVID-19.

Pt has a sore arm, his face is  flushed, he feels tired and nauseous.  He says he feels as if he is starting to get the flu.  Pt is lying in bed today. He does not want to walk around. (He had woken up at 3am this morning and took the bandage off  because it was itching).

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (no medical history provided.).    On 15-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DIZZINESS (dizziness) and NAUSEA (nausea). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body) and RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department), HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure), DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), DIZZINESS (dizziness), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body), RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck) and NAUSEA (nausea) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   A pharmacist suggested the patient take Children&#39;s Benadryl followed by Zyrtec to help with the itching. These medicines have not helped alleviate his intense itching. On 1Apr2021, the patient collapsed and was taken to the emergency department. The patient was treated at the emergency department after he collapsed from low blood pressure. He was prescribed Hydroxyzine HCI 10mg for the itching by the emergency room physician, but the medicine has done nothing to alleviate the patient&#39;s symptoms.  Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Ras and nausea are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Had trouble sleeping.  Abt 1 pm needed help getting up again, same disorientation, also fell off the toilet and needed help getting back to the bed, unable to hold his own weight.  Finally fell asleep.  Next day seemed fine enough. Tuesday night, became ill again, went to bed.  Got up to go to the bathroom, was wobbly, but able to make it.  Was helped back, wobbly but able to walk. Trouble falling asleep, fever, chills.  Finally fell asleep at 3 am Wed morning.  I had to go to the doctor early, so left him sleeping in bed.  When I came back around 11 am, he was still sleeping, snoring loudly.  Became concerned.  Wouldn&#39;t wake up.  Called Paramedics.  CT scan at the hospital revealed a brain bleed.  Transported to hospital. Put on support for almost 2 weeks.  No progress, no response.  Finally support was discontinued and he died April 19th at 7:52 pm.

                                                Patient received first dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on 1/28/2020.  Due to his history of allergies and asthma, he took a dose of diphenhydramine 25mg (either 1 tablet or 2 tablet - patient is unsure) prior to receiving the first dose of the vaccine. He waiting for 30 minutes of observation afterwards.  He did not have any problems other than a sore arm after the dose. The patient returned for his second dose of the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on 2/25/2020.  He forgot to take a dose of diphenhydramine prior to coming in for his second dose of the vaccine.  He sat for the 30 minutes of observation with no issues.  He drove home and after arriving home, 1 hour after receiving the dose, he started having a strange feeling around his mouth and tongue which moved from the right to left side.  He then took two doses of diphenhydramine 25 mg.  Then he started having difficulty swallowing so went to a Prompt Care.  The staff there called an ambulance and he took an ambulance. In the ED, the physicians examined him and didn&#39;t find any issues with his throat.  They noticed his left earlobe was bright red.  They administered a high dose of steroid and observed him for 3 hours.  The patient does not know the name of the steroid or dose received.  The patient states that he felt normal again after 1.5 hours after receiving the steroid injection.  The patient was discharged back home and has not had any issues since.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after injection, I started to feel chilled and began shaking and shivering. No fever. Felt general malaise. No appetite. Developed bad headache which prevented sleeping. The next day, it seemed this was over, but still had no appetite and in the evening the shaking and shivering resumed. Developed another bad headache that prevented sleeping again. Next morning  (today) still no appetite and continued to feel cold. Have eaten some even with no appetite, so I could take ibuprofen which seemed to help a bit.

It settled after a while but came back somewhat less after breakfast but then resulted in vomitting. Repeat settling and return, vommitting after lunch. Found symptoms faded on and off but no more vomitting Friday. Unsteady walking due to imbalance. Saturday, more spinning but no vomiting. Sunday it seemed to resolve so long as I didn&#39;t look down or to my left while lying down. Monday mild imbalance so I visited my PCP,  who said it was likely BPPV, prescribed meclazine for the vertigo, and gave order for a physical therapist which I scheduled for Monday, 3/22/21 which was the earliest available appointment. Friday, 3/19, no problem

                                                The day following the vaccine injection, Sunday, January 24, as I was finishing a 45 minute hike I began feeling dizzy.  I made it home, then felt nauseous and threw up, more drive heaves than food.   I laid down for awhile.  Since then I have felt woozy when I get up and start moving around.  The wooziness comes and goes.   I still have the symptoms.

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

On Thursday the knee didn&#39;t get any worse but my lower back and shoulders were sore. On Friday, there wasn&#39;t much change. On Saturday the knee seemed to stabilize and the back and shoulders were tolerable. On Sunday, my stomach was queasy. On Monday, sore joints and queasy stomach. On Tuesday, sore joints especially anything injured back in time, diarrhea started. On Wednesday upset stomach, just a piece of toast to eat, diarrhea, chills, sore joints everywhere, miserable. Thursday was the same as Wednesday plus I vomited twice in the evening with sweats and a 101.1 temperature which went back down. I was miserable. I slept well last night and feel better this morning. The diarrhea seems be abating. I feel like I&#39;ve turned the corner this morning but wanted to mention due to the vaccine shot as a possible cause.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine received on 3/4/21 at 10:45 am. On 3/5/21 at 3:00 am woke from sleep with extreme chills, goosebumps on the skin, and physically shaking to warm up. I had on the bed a sheet, quilt, and heavy comforter. I used the toilet to urinate and was not sure that I could walk back to my bed due to nausea and weakness. After resting, I placed another wool blanket on the bed on top of the comforter. Eventually, I began to warm up. Nausea and fever continued.  Muscles and joints ached. I slept on and off until 7:00 am. I did not eat any breakfast due to continuing nausea. I drank coffee, sat in my reclining chair most of the morning. at 12:00 noon, I ate a bowl of potatte and chicken soup.  My tempereature at this time was 99.5. I did sleep in the afternoon. Later in the evening my temperture had gone down to 99.  Today, 3/06/21 at 8:00am, I feel normal, tired but normal.

I don&#39;t remember when exactly the fever started, but it last until the 36th hour after the vaccination.  It was 101.3 most of the time.  101.7 was the high point.  I also had stomach pain at that time.  After 3 days I was fine.  With the 1st shot I also had a sore arm, but not this bad.  I also ran a fever, but it was around 100 then.

Also had some abdominal cramping, which I often have due to colitis so probably unrelated to vaccine. Treated fever with acetaminophen at about 2 p.m., temperature went down to 98.7 but continued to have chills most of afternoon. Second morning after vaccination still have chills but milder. Temperature of 98.7 in morning. Not medicated.

It came up the day after receiving the vaccine and has lasted 5 weeks and the Valicyclovere isn&#39;t working. it went away by 03/10/2021. I also experienced fever and weakness 03/06/21 and then when it resolved the herpes came up. Went to the doctor at a walk in clinic on 02/24/21 because I had high fever and nausea and weakness for about 10 hours. I got an infected tooth(root canal and crown on this tooth) and an infected jaw. Dentist put me on antibiotics and I have to have the tooth pulled. I went to the dentist on 02/11/2021.

He got the second dose on 3/16/21 and after 10-12 hours had fatigue, myalgias and nausea which resolved within 10-12 hours.  HOWEVER, one week after second dose, on 3/23/21, my husband took a shower and noticed shortly thereafter around 8 AM a itchy rash on face and neck.  NO rash over Vaccine Site.  Over the day the rash got more intensely red and noticed blotches over his upper chest (symmetrical oval patches just beneath each nipple region).  He took 2 Benadryl Tabs at night and in morning of 3/24 the rash has improved considerably..  The rash was macular and erythematous and never raised with no blistering.   His first dose of Moderna was on 2/16/21 and lot number was 011M20M.

It is hard to do anything although I did accompany my wife grocery shopping but sat in the car part of the time.

Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous.

EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

                                                death Narrative: Patient passed away on April 13, 2021 at home at 1810 He was 72 years old had severe aortic stenosis and hypertension and had an aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at hospital on Jan 20, 2021. He was readmitted to hospital for shortness of breath which was evaluated from Feb 19 - Feb 21, 2021 I spoke with his daughter today. She was with him at home when he went to the bathroom and since he had not come out for some time, she knocked on the door and found him collapsed in the bathroom. She called 911, who did CPR, however he had passed away. He was referred to the coroner. He had his first Moderna vaccine on March 15, 2021 after which he had not had any side effects. He received his second dose on April 12, 2021 and had not mentioned any side effects other than mild abdominal discomfort. Daughter said his shortness of breath had been improving after his discharge from the hospital. He had not complained of chest pain, cough, fever, diarrhea, in the last few days. I paid condolences to daughter and told here we would be reviewing the case to see if there was any relationship to him receiving the Covid19 vaccine and that the case had already been referred to the coroners office.

                                                Got 2nd Moderna shot. 8 days later got extremely dizzy, felt pain all over body, threw up. Taken to hospital . Given blood transfusion that worked. Spent  5 days in ICU; 2 days in regular hospital room. NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT VACCINE CAUSED IT. Doctors say unlikely but possible so I felt I should report it since it was so close in time to getting vaccine and I never had those problems before. Blood pressure got so low that doctors say I would have died without the transfusion.      After 1st Moderna shot (Jan. 15,2021) had only slightly dizzy, heart rate increased significantly and blood pressure went very high. All of those 1st shot issues went away in about half an hour. Serious problems only occurred after 2nd shot. Scarred to get booster next year unless doctors find that vaccine was not the cause of problem.

                                                MY REACTION TO THE FIRST DOSE: In March of 2020 I suffered Covid pneumonia and was on oxygen and too weak and short of breath to work for three months.  It took over seven months to return my breathing and strength to baseline. I just checked my lab and I still have IgG antibodies and a negative nasal screen for the virus. One month ago at 9 AM I received the Moderna Vaccine.  About 12 hours later I developed shaking chills and a fever of about 103, pain in my arm from the injection, and severe cough and a VERY WATERY RUNNY NOSE with severe post nasal drip which caused aspiration of the discharge.   I took Tylenol, Afrin Nasal Spray, and a Dulera inhaler and fell asleep.  I woke up at 3 AM and felt well, but at 4 AM I developed an intolerable intractable cough and severe watery nasal discharge lasting about two hours and severe dry heaves from the aspiration.  Afrin nasal spray helped somewhat but I was absolutely miserable for  two hours.    Three days ago I received the one month booster for the Moderna Vaccine at 10AM.   My arm began to become painful but it was tolerable and not relieved by Tylenol. Every time I rolled over at night the pain woke me up but I was able to tolerate it.  Yesterday I woke up with severe constant chills but my temperature was normal.  I felt very hungry and diaphoretic and felt like I had a low blood sugar,  and ate a bowl of rice chex cereal. I felt a little better but a half hour later VOMITED everything up.  I then felt somewhat better and went to the hospital to make rounds.  The nursing staff reported that about half of them called in sick due to the vaccine with severe fatigue, fever, joint pains and headaches.  One nurse reported that all her joints felt like they were on fire.  Four nursing supervisors also called in sick that day.   I then went to my office and my staff said I looked GREEN and insisted I go home.  I did not eat anything but while resting I again had SEVERE VOMITING of my breakfast at about noon.  When I felt stronger I drove home at about 1:30 PM and fell asleep until about 5 PM, still not having eaten anything nor taking fluids. My arm pain went away.  By 7 PM I finally drank some tea and felt stronger and felt like I was not going to die.   It seems that those of use who had the Covid in the past do not tolerate the vaccine and suffer severe reactions. I was unable to find any studies with the vaccine given to patients who already have antibodies.  This lack of data is a real problem.

Had no side effects other than sore arm until Monday, January 4 when I had a bout of diarrhea followed by a rapid heart beat, which when checked was 146, then went to 149 and few minutes later was 150.  I became worried and called my cardiologist and the clinic was closed.  The cardiologist on call called me back.  After describing my symptoms and that I had received the Covid 19 shot several days earlier.  He advised me to monitor my heart rate and if it continued to go to the ER.  Shortly after, my heart rate returned to normal, so I did not go to the ER.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  I received a Moderna covid-19 vaccination (Lot # 007M20A)  at 10:20 AM on Monday 02-01-2021 at the VA Clinic .  Between 3 and 4 minutes later I began to experience difficulty breathing, sweating and feeling warm, and then I passed out behind the steering wheel of my parked car, while sitting with my wife.  I came to after few minutes as people were attempting to get me out of my car and into a wheelchair, but I had difficulty breathing, couldn?t move, and had to be pulled out.  After being put in the wheelchair, I passed out again and came to after I had been taken out of the wheelchair and laid on my left side on the ground by Fire Dept. EMT?s.  I then began to retch, but did not vomit.   My wife said that one of the EMT?s pumped my chest a couple of times. They lifted me onto a gurney and put me in an ambulance, hit me with an EPI pen, and placed an oxygen mask on my face, as I was having great difficulty breathing.  I was unable to move or lift my arms to help them place a blood pressure cuff on my arm, a pulse monitor on my finger, and lift my shirt to help them attach EKG pads. Atthat point I realized that I had also lost control of my bladder at some point. I continued to have difficulty breathing, and started to experience extreme shivering all the while to emergency Room. Once in the Emergency Room, I could not move myself off the FD gurney, and they had to lift the sheet that I was laying on in order to move me onto the hospital gurney. I had great difficulty helping the technicians remove my shirt so that they could administer another EKG and start an IV (LR 1,000ml bolus).   I continued to have difficulty breathing and kept shivering and sweating for some time.  I was advised that the EKG?s both appeared normal.  After a lengthy period of I gradually reached a point where I stopped shivering and sweating, and returned to almost normal breathing.  I was finally released around 1-1:30 PM.

His wife also noted some slight slurred speech.  He went to the emergency room and was told that he had a 6th nerve palsy on the left.  A scan of his head was unremarkable.  He was referred to neurology.  I saw him on February 2 and by that time he had evidence of full-blown myasthenia gravis with left ptosis, slurred speech, intermittent disconjugate gaze, some subjective difficulty swallowing.. 1 wk laterSevere dysphagia unable to swallow without puréeing food marked slurred speech and ptosis .SENT FOR EMERGENCY IVIG

By Wednesday morning (2/10) the symptoms persisted, but I went to work. By noon   I had many of the same symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID in December (9th). Headache, body aches all over, severe fatigue, loss of appetite and chills. Only this time it was worse than I remembered from December. I went home at noon, went to bed. Got up around 6PM and tried to eat, but had no appetite at all. I went to bed at 6:30 PM Wednesday and woke up at 7:00 AM Thursday with only a couple of bathroom trips. Today (Wednesday) symptoms have subsided significantly. Almost gone. Will work tomorrow.

                                                I had no issues with the first Moderna dose, but 5 days after the 2nd dose I experienced chills, dizziness and slight nausea when up and moving.  This lasted 2 days and started going away on day 3, but the dizziness is still slightly  present.  Also, during this time I?ve continually monitored my BP and pulse.  My BP has been elevated averaging around 165/95 (my normal is close to 145/85).  Pulse has been steady averaging around 66-68 which is normal for me.  Today,  my BP is around 150/90 so it?s slowly getting back to normal on day 9 (post vaccine #2).   Also, I had no other symptoms and my temperature was steady at 97 degrees since the vaccination.  Thank you

Cramping would come and go and were severe. Client states he did what he could to put up with the pain until Monday Feb 15th. He went to local ER. Client was unable to tolerate CT contrast oral liquid (caused immediate diarrhea) so an abdominal CT scan was not completed and he was discharged. Symptoms still persist and client states he lost 16 lbs so far. He has reached out to follow up with his regular HCP- VA clinic.  He is waiting for a call from them today.

Neck pain that goes down my arm (R), extreme fatigue and achy. I&#39;ve lost 5lbs in 3d.&#39; MEDS UTD  History of Present Illness     &#34;I had that COVID shot Thursday (l arm).  Friday I started having cramps in my neck--base of my skull, R arm, into the base of my jaw.&#34;  Worse with laying down, sleeping on L side.  &#34;Hurt too much to get up&#34; (had wife help him up to bathroom).    Tried?  Bayer back and body only.  Tried some topical ben gay (made worse), vibration therapy.  Hot shower seemed to help.  Review of Systems     &#43; for chills, HA, diarrhea.  Worst yesterday.  Missed work yesterday.  Had been eating/drinking well until recently.    Assessment/Plan      1. Adverse reaction to vaccine T50.Z95A    2. Myalgia after COVID-19 vaccination M79.10     1.  Adverse vaccine response will be reported.  This seems to be fairly significant due to being 5d after.  2.  Will try Tyl 1000mg up to tid and Ibu 400 up to tid-qid for next 3 days--try to get dose of each at hs tonight.  Push fluids.  Prednisone 20mg/d x 5d.  Call report tomorrow on status.  3.  At this time, will likely avoid 2nd Moderna covid vax in this pt due to reaction.  4.  Note provided for off work yesterday through tomorrow.

                                                History of Present Illness  The patient presents with weakness.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is generalized.  The degree at present is moderate.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain.  73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife. Labs are overall reassuring. His etemp is elevated but afebrile. CXR with possible atelectasis vs infiltrate but pt has no cough, no fever, and a normal WBC Coutn so I favor atelectasis. His CT head shows possibly artifact vs cortical hypodensities. Will await formal read this morning. Pts UA is clean. He is no longer shaking after a dose of tylenol and ativan. I suspect the pts generalzied weakess is 2/2 his recent covid vaccine yesterday afternoon. Despite this the pt cannot stand and move around on his own and his wife cannot care fo rhim at home given his current situation. Pt discussed with Dr and will be admitted for further care. .

                                                Immediate recurrence of GBS post vaccination.  This time around on Tuesday pt got a COVID vaccine and 6 hours after pt started feeling nauseous and 3 days after the vaccine had numbness in his feet b/l at first. Numbness travelled upwards up to the knees. Next the weakness started extending upwards to his mid thigh. Pt will not put any weight on his legs because he knows he is very unsteady.  Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there. Pt woke up this morning and went from his bed to his chair and since then pt was not able to get up from the chair.

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

As the rash spread across my chest (left side) and blisters appeared, I went to my physician&#39;s office on March 9. Dr. diagnosed &#34;shingles&#34; and recommended OTC meds for pain and itching. In following weeks, the rash started healing, but the pain persisted which was not relieved by Tylenol or other OTC drugs. I could not sleep, and with strong pain and upset stomach went to the ER on Sat. March 27, I was seen. I was treated at ER for pain and nausea; Gabapentin was prescribed for nerve pain.

                                                Patient woke up around 3:30am feeling extremely nauseous, shaking, drenched in sweat but with a normal temperature (97.6, which is normal for him), and feeling overall terrible.  Food had tasted weird to him the day before, but he still ate. At 3:30am, he felt like he was having a major allergy attack - lots of phlegm, runny nose and eyes. He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black &#34;coffee grounds-like&#34; fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE). After getting through with that (about 15 minutes), he wretched up more thick mucus with a few flecks of black cells in it. After awhile, he felt okay enough to go back to sleep.  Around 6am, he had another major allergy-like attack, but did not vomit.  Around 8am, after being awake for awhile, he vomited again with more black liquid, about 50mL this time. He felt weak and horrible and was shaking. At the recommendation of the advice nurse, he was taken to the ER by ambulance. Upon arriving, he waited around an hour for an ER bed.  They put him on an IV, did a physical inspection and did blood work. His sodium was a bit low, but in normal range. Potassium levels were fine. He was mentally clear the whole time, but physically very weak.  He was kept overnight after a hemochrit test in the afternoon showed low levels of hemoglobin. He was stabilized in the morning, but was barely able to eat anything the whole time. He was meant to get an endoscopy, but they decided to allow him to eat and sent him home after noon bc they hadn&#39;t yet been able to schedule him for it and he was in pain and massively hungry.  When he got home, he still barely ate,  and still isn&#39;t eating almost anything a day later. His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).  They believe that he may have bleeding in his stomach or upper GI or esophagus, but we are waiting for an endoscopy later this week.  He is still very weak and frail and fatigued.

At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

Wednesday 1/6/21 swelling had spread significantly to inside the right side of mouth and tongue also affecting right jaw. By 3 Pm that day my tongue was numb and swollen on the right side as well as the right side of my mouth and jaw. I could only chew, eat, and swallow effectively on the left side of my mouth using the left side of my tongue to negotiate eating.  I could only this with small amounts of food. By that evening about 4 hours later I could eat , chew etc. pretty good but the swelling &amp; discomfort remained but reduced to a functional level.  Today, Thursday 1/7/21, the soreness and discomfort remains inside throat, mouth, tongue and jaw all on the right side.

                                                I developed a previously never experienced constipation, with soft, not impacted stool. I&#39;m a physician of Internal Medicine and would equate this w/ something of an atonic colon. I self-administered two separate Fleets Childrens rectal suppositories w/o response, then repeated digital disimpaction every hour or so, for the next 12-16 hours. Began Miralax powder the evening of January 16, 2021 around 7PM and repeated full doses at bedtime, again at approximately 4AM on January 17, 2021 and a fourth full dose at 8AM. The Miralax finally resulted in a more liquid stool that morning around 10AM, w/ relief of the generalized abdominal discomfort

Three days later on Saturday morning 6 Feb 2021 I noticed a bad rash on my back, under my left shoulder, and on the middle of my chest.  I went to my doctor office later that morning and they told me I had Shingles.  They put me on an anti-viral medication called Valacyclovir.  (1 gram tablet every 8 hours for seven days.)

The entire room was spinning and I could hardly walk due to poor balance.  Every time I moved my head, the vertigo would recur.  This caused nausea and vomiting so I spent much of the day in bed.  In the late afternoon, the vertigo lessened after I took an anti-emetic drug.  I only ate clear liquids the first day.  Since then, I have improved but still have mild morning vertigo.and mild fatigue.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

It lasted about 3-4 days after the shot.  He also reported having diarrhea.  He reported these reactions when he came for his second vaccine.  He said he did not require any medical care for the side effects.   He used over the counter Cortisone to help with the rash.

I was awakened perhaps 20 times to urinate throughout that time, which is extremely often compared to my normal. I would lay back down and be asleep almost immediately. I tried to eat and drink during one of my awake times, but I had no appetite and no desire to drink. Throughout day two I had a fever. I was totally unable to function on day two. About 10:00 pm of day two my appetite returned. About 11:00 pm I returned to bed and had a full night&#39;s sleep.

                                                Saturday, Marth 5th -- day after vaccination.  Upon awakening, extreme pain head-to-toe, in muscles and joints.  Severe headache (very rare for me), Hands could barely move (like severe arthritis),  Slightly elevated temperature (98.9 when my normal is 97.8).  Overall symptoms faded slightly and then returned to full strength two or three times during the day.  Unable to eat (not nauseous, just not hungry) and only drank water.  No bowel movement and very little urination during the day.  By about 18:00, headache was gone and pain was receding .  Around 21:00 started getting very cold and could not seem to get warm.  Started shaking severely from cold.  Put on sweat suit, turned on bed heater, and added blankets, then went to bed around 22:00.    Woke up Sunday morning (March 7th feeling absolutely perfect!  None of the previous day&#39;s pain was present, no temperature, no limits to hand/finger movement, and was very hungry.  Ate a normal size breakfast with no problems, urination was normal,   It was like the reaction had never happened, but my wife assured me that it had.   Other than slight constipation, I have no had any problems since.

It was 102. that evening I was dizzy and vomiting and I was shaking terribly. My temp went up as high as 103.2. It eased with 2 tylenol  I run a temperature for 3 days. I lost my sense of smell and taste. I had not been anywhere where I could have had contact with someone who had covid to my knowledge. My sense of smell has come back but my taste of food has slowly coming back. I would rather report it here then to say anything in public. My partner can tell I was bedridden for several days and still get and stay very tired.I did not go to emergency room only called them

                                                I got out of bed at my normal time of 5 AM and proceeded to the bathroom to urinate, feeling fine. Just before starting to urinate, I started sweating profusely and shaking and so turned around and sat down on the toilet. I then sweat even more as if I was in the shower, and shook violently. I then started feeling very nauseous, but I was shaking so badly that I had to very carefully  hold the toilet  to turn around to kneel down in front of the toilet. I heaved a number of times, but nothing came up. I finally stopped shaking and sat on the floor in front of the toilet for a while, and the sweating got less. After a short time, I got up and walked slowly to a recliner, about 30&#39; away. The nausea had gone away by then and the sweating had subsided. My wife brought me blanket and I rested till 7:30 AM.  I had a cup of coffee about 8 AM, and a bowel of cereal at 9 AM. I have been fine ever since then, no more reactions, thank goodness. That one was horrible.

                                                I received the vaccine on Monday. Tuesday I felt like I had the virus again-tiredness, slight temperature, chills, intense pain at injection site, slight stomach discomfort. What surprised me and the reason I am reporting this is the symptoms, though gradually better, persisted until Friday-4 days. I was expecting to be down for a day or two, but length of the aftereffects surprised me. I had a strong case of Covid in January 2020.

Stayed in bed all day.  Was able to eat small meals, a bit queasy stomach, more loose BM.  Went to sleep 30 hr after shot.  Work up the next day without fever.  Was fatigued the entire day.    Had loose bowls/diahrea  off and on for the next 5 days.  Got back to normal BM a weeks after the shot.  Left arm soreness was pretty much gone by end of week.

The next morning I experienced a mild 24-hour flu with low fever, fatigue and diminished appetite. My left arm, where I had the injection, was mildly sore. The following day all was fine. At 10:40am March 21 I had the second Moderna vaccination at the same location. By 7pm that day I began to feel flu-like symptoms. By 9pm I had a fever of about 102 degrees, moderate chills and sweats. By midnight I could barely sit up in bed to go to the bathroom, and had to steady myself on the walls as I walked. At one point during the night I began gasping for air and breathing hoarsely. I woke up hourly all night. Throughout Monday the weakness continued. I was slightly nauseous, developed mild diarrhea, and emptied the bowels. Zero appetite; drank lots of cold water. Slept the same as Sunday night with occasional chills and sweats. No more gasping episodes though. Tuesday ? Thursday I improved very gradually. Ate small amounts of plain yogurt, then plain toast. A low-grade fever came and went. I rested in bed all day and slept fitfully. Still very weak. Fast forward to March 31, 10 days after the shot. My appetite is OK now, no fever for several days, energy level about 85% of normal. I am very appreciative of getting the vaccine. The intense reaction to the second injection was startling, as my health has generally been excellent. I have masked and kept socially distant since last March.

Patient presented to Hospital on 4/09/2021 for persistent nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria and jaundice. Patient reported a 1 month history of intermittent nausea and vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, feeling dizzy and weak, poor appetite. Patient had a colonoscopy ~2 weeks prior admission to hospital for cancer screening purposes which was unremarkable and labs done by his primary care at that time were all normal (per admitting physician&#39;s note). At hospital, patient was found to have evidence of hemolytic anemia thought to be autoimmune in nature with a positive direct antiglobulin. Patient was subsequently transferred to hospital on 4/11/2021 for further workup. Patient is still currently admitted to hospital. Oncology was consulted for workup of pancytopenia and suspected warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Throughout admission, the patient&#39;s platelets have ranged between 59-154 k/µL and hemoglobin has ranged 4.5-8.6 g/dL with no documented history of thrombocytopenia or anemia. Patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg x9 doses, prednisone 80 mg daily (1 mg/kg) x5 doses, prednisone 60 mg x1 dose, rituximab 740 mg (375 mg/m2)  x3 doses, and immune globulin 40 g x3 doses. Patient has also received 4 units of packed red blood cells. Given the timing of anemia and thrombocytopenia and unknown etiology, immune response to his COVID vaccine is on the differential.

At the time of death, PNEUMONIA (pneumonia), UNEVALUABLE EVENT (Unevaluable event), ASTHENIA (Asthenia), DIARRHOEA (Diarrhoea), THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT EFFECT INCOMPLETE (Therapeutic product effect incomplete), DRUG INEFFECTIVE (Drug ineffective), RIGHT ATRIAL DILATATION (Right atrial dilatation), AORTIC VALVE SCLEROSIS (Aortic valve sclerosis), CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (Coronary artery disease), MALAISE (Malaise), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Muscular weakness), FATIGUE (Fatigue), NAUSEA (Nausea), HEADACHE (Headache) and VOMITING (Vomiting) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 03-Jul-2018, Pulmonary arterial pressure: pulmonary arterial pressure elevated (High) Pulmonary arterial pressure elevated. In 2021, Angiogram: no evidence for central pulmonary embolus. (Inconclusive) No evidence for central pulmonary embolus. Slight interval decrease in the patient&#39;s 2 previously identified right sided pulmonary nodules. Slight decrease in the one measurable mediastinal lymph node. The patient&#39;s other lymphadenopathy is probably also improved but difficult to measure due to the technique. Worsening airspace disease in a somewhat interstitial pattern. Pulmonary edema would be the first consideration. Infection would be the second consideration. Severe centrilobar and paraseptal emphysema with basilar predominately peripheral reticular opacities consistent with fibrotic lung disease.. In 2021, Chest X-ray: no infiltrate (Inconclusive) no infiltrate. In 2021, Echocardiogram: severe right atrial ventricular dilatation with... (abnormal) Severe right atrial ventricular dilatation with reduced RV systolic function (&#34;D&#34; sign). Small and under-filled left ventricle with hyperdynamic systolic function, estimated LVEF is 75%. Minimal aortic valve sclerosis with no stenosis. Moderate mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. Estimated PA systolic pressure is severely elevated (68.6 mmHg). Compared to the prior report dated 7/3/2018; there is a worsening right heart dilatation and function. There is increased mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. No significant change in estimated PA pressure.. In 2021, Heart rate: abnormal (abnormal) abnormal. In 2021, Pulmonary arterial pressure: 68.6 mmhg (High) Severely elevated. In 2021, Ultrasound scan: no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the... (Inconclusive) No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower extremities. In 2021, White blood cell count: no leukocytosis (Inconclusive) No leukocytosis.         Concomitant medications included unknown statins. On 02-0CT-2020, Co- suspect drug chemotherapy  is given to the patient to treat small cell lung  cancer metastatic, Metastases to liver and Metastases to lymph nodes.  On an unspecified date(s) in 2021, the patient had radiation of his head and lung for his cancer. Initially  on 18-SEP-2020,the patient started with 10mg of firdapse , On 02-OCT-2020, the dose  increased to 20mg. On 22-SEP-2020, while in the hospital the patient experienced blood pressure fluctuations. the patient experienced a headache that was &#34;4/10.Treatment medications included acetaminophen; aspirin; caffeine and ibuprofen for headache, treated with prednisone 60mg and methyl prednisolone for immune mediated pneumonitis,On an unspecified date, the patient was treated with midodrine, patient was cautiously diuresed with IV furosemide bolus dosing followed by gtt (drip) given &#34;soft pressures. the patient was treated with low dose diltiazem For paroxysmal a-fib (atrial fibrillation) and MAT (medication-assisted treatment). patient was initially given amiodarone 400mg daily x 7 days for blood pressure, then the dose reduced to 200mg, On an unspecified date, patient was treated with  low dose metoprolol (12.5 mg), patient was treated with Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 15 mg daily for stroke risk reduction.On an unspecified date, the patient&#39;s diuretic (presumed IV Lasix drip) was transitioned to torsemide 5 mg, orally daily.patient  received atovaquone for PJP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) prophylaxis and treated with empiric antibiotics for CAP (community acquired pneumonia). On unspecified date, steroid regimen was increased.On an unspecified date, the patient&#39;s respiratory symptoms improved and was weaned to 2 liters of oxygen. While hospitalized, the patient received non drug treatment like PT (physical therapy) and OT (occupational therapy), the patient was treated with supplemental O2 (oxygen) and  IVF (intravenous fluids).

                                                I experienced a strong case of diarrhea starting when I got up. on Sunday Jan. 21 and had 5 loose bowels between 7am and 2:30pm. I consider this episode a possible side effect of the vaccine because there were no other factors which could explain this episode--I did not eat any tainted or undercooked food. All food was prepared at home, properly stored and cooked. Usually when I have intestinal trouble, I take 1 tablet of Imodium and that stops it, but this was such a strong case of diarrhea that it took two tablets of Imodium to stop it.

                                                On day 10,  noticed a red patch at the injection site, swollen, hard, warm to the touch. Over the following few days, the redness area gets larger and now it covers the whole upper arm. It itches may be twice a day, the swelling is reduced but the redness is persists. I am not overly concerned, but would like to know what&#39;s going on. I hope it goes back to normal over the coming few days before i receive the second dose on March 19th.

                                                One week after 2nd Moderna, started coughing periodically in day and night chest conjestion started to build at night. After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?

On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.

It ultimately got so bad that I ended up in the ER with a 104  degree temperature and bad pains on March 19th. After a series of tests it was determined to be Diverticulitis which I never had before.  I am not sure it is related to the Covid shot, but, it is interesting that it started the day after the second shot.
