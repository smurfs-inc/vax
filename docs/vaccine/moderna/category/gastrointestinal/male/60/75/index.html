Meclizine and Ondansetron was used immediately.  Scopolamine was prescribed by the physician on 01/08/2021,  picked and used on 01/09/2021; felt better . Residual dizziness remains after use.

This current episode has lasted  forthree days.

Insomnia that night accompanying whole-body aches/pains/malaise.  Pain most notable in extremities. Nausea more significant at 12 hours (i.e. 6AM) but no vomiting. Significant lethargy all day 1/22/2021. Pain/nausea gone by 6PM but lethargy remained.  Slept most of the day. Symptoms gone by following morning (1/23/2021), so roughly 36 hours.   Overall these were symptoms consistent with a really bad case of the flu, minus the respiratory symptoms.  I often work through illnesses like the flu.  Couldn?t work through this.

These symptoms lasted for 48 hours and gradually subsided.  His wife (me) was so frightened that I will not be getting the Moderna series since it&#39;s so dangerous and will caution friends and family as well.

It retuned to normal after 6 hours, and then occurred again 1 week later...for 6 hours. I took Bystolic, and about 8 hours later it returned to baseline (about 62/min.  on Sun 1/24/2021, I woke up to bloody diarrhea x several episodes...this continued until Wed 27th, at which time my son (a 4th year graduating MD student) drove me to hospital and I was seen in ER room by MD. I was admitted, and had emergency surgery 1/27/2021 straight from Er Room. I had life saving surgery the next day to stop a lower GI bleed (of unknown origin). I was discharged 3 days later, and I am awaiting more testes, appts, etc.... I have lost time, money, and work from this near death experience... and the tachycardia still needs to be followed up on . I am EXTREMELY upset by these events, as I almost died....was hospitalized, incurred a lot of expense, used up all my sick pay and personal days, and out-of -pocket to my healthcare insurer.

I remained in bed until about 4pm 2/5/21 &amp; soaked in a hot bath which relieved the joint pains.

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

But the real issue is that now for the past week I&#39;ve had diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain and cramping, and some mild nausea. I don&#39;t know if this is related to the vaccine. That is my concern.

Went to ER and was given EKG, Chest X-Ray, and blood tests to check for heart attack. Symptoms subsided after a bit. Labs were inconclusive. Sent home. Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

Uncomfortable but never to the point of difficulty breathing. ~08:30, BP 128/99 (I think) Systolic up only a bit.  Diastolic very high for me sent to urgent care part of clinic.   Monitored BP, oxygen, did EKG (normal), symptoms started easing ~ 09:40.  Sent home. Attending PA though it might just be a Vaso-Vagel response, but, after hundreds upon hundred of needles, I&#39;ve never had such a response, and, my symptoms did not involve a low BP, fainting or nausea, rather I remained conscious, had throat constriction with increased BP and a narrowed pulse pressure  range.

                                                I had my second Moderna Covid-19 vaccine at noon on Thursday, April 1. I felt lethargic evening of injection, and injection site was sore to touch for next few days with a mild case of diarrhea. Sunday, April 3 I noticed that there was a large red circle with a slight rash surrounding the injection site that hadn&#39;t been there the day before. It was gone by the next day.   The only reaction I had to the first injection was a sore arm for two days.

Dry Eyes: Onset of an intermittent feeling of very dry eyes that lasted approximately 1-2 hours at a time and continued over a period of 9 hours until 10PM on 07APR21.  07APR21, 3:30PM - Fatigue: Onset of mild fatigue that steadily increased until bedtime at 10:00PM on 07APR21; and was significantly more pronounced at 1:00AM on 08APR21 (was difficult to stand and walk 20? to closet to obtain a thermometer; could not walk straight and bumped into hallway on left 4-5 times).  Fatigue was rather frightening and severe from 3:00AM to 3:30AM on 08APR21 when I crawled to the bathroom, but could not get off my knees and collapsed on the floor until I could return to bed by crawling on the floor.  Was able to stand again at 7:00AM on 08APR21 and walked (slowly) 30? to a sofa.  Slept from 10PM on 07APR21 to 1:00AM on 08APR21; 4:00-7:30AM on 08APR21; 8:30-10:30AM on 08APR21; 11:00AM to 3:00PM on 08APR21; 7:00PM on 08APR21 to 3:00AM on 09APR21; 3:30AM to 7:30AM on 09APR21; 9:30PM on 09APR21 to 9:15AM on 10APR21; 6:40PM on 10APR21 to 7:00AM on 11APR21.  Ongoing weariness continues as I write this at 11:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Nausea: Onset of continuous nausea that lasted 13 hours and 20 minutes until 08APR21, 8:30AM. Nausea was particularly bad with intermittent dry heaves for the 7.5 hours lasting from 1:00AM to 8:30AM on 08APR21; Nausea then came in waves for 23 more hours until 09Apr21, 7:30AM when it was finally gone.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Headache: Onset of headache that has lasted 4 days (as of 11APR21, 10:30AM). Finally gave in and took one extended release tablet of 650mg Acetaminophen tablet about 25 hours after the vaccination (i.e., took painkiller at 10:30AM on 08APR21).  Took two Ibuprofen at 9:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Chills: Onset of chills that increased to intermittent shivering by bedtime at 10PM on 07APR21. Awoke at 1:00AM on 08APR21 and could not get warm.  Two hours later, at 3:00AM, I felt completely opposite and could not feel cool.  These symptoms gradually subsided and were gone by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Joint Pain and Muscle Aches: Onset of joint pain and muscle aches that occasionally became annoying with twinges of pain. These symptoms subsided by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Dizziness: Onset of mild dizziness that lasted 12 hours until 7:15AM on 08APR21.  08APR21, 1:00AM ? Measured Fever: Decided to measure temperature due to significant chills and shivering and found temperature was 101.0 at 1:00AM on 08APR21.  At 3:00PM on 08APR21, my temperature was 100.2 (this was 4.5 hours after taking one extended release tablet of 650mg acetaminophen).  At 3:00AM on 09APR21, my temperature measured 98.6 degrees and has remained near there ever since.  09APR21, 4:00PM ? Arm Rash: First noticed presence of a rash measuring about 2? x 3? on upper arm near the area that received the injection.  Mild itchiness was present about an hour later and a topical 2% diphenhydramine gel was applied.  The rash had dissipated by 5PM on 10APR21.

                                                I was extremely tired on Saturday. My shoulder hurt. About 3 pm, while urinating, I felt very light-headed as if I was about to faint. I stopped urinating and went back to bed.  That evening, about 8:30, I tried to eat dinner, but after three bites, I felt extremely tired. I leaned back in my chair, and I passed out. My wife woke me, but it took several minutes. She said my eyes rolled back in my head. She splashed water on my face. She said that I stopped breathing.  I woke up, then pushed my plate away and put my head on the table. I could not hold it up. I was sweating profusely. After several minutes, I felt that I was about to have diarrhea. My daughter and wife tried to walk me to the bathroom, but I did not have the energy to get there. I collapsed in the hall and hit my head on the door jamb. After several minute of trying , they pulled me up, and I then got the strength to walk the rest of the way. I had diarrhea, not suddenly, but it was as if my GI system emptied. It was soft, not loose, and there was a lot.  I went back to bed, and eventually slept.  I felt queasy the next day (Sunday), and I felt lightheaded at times, so I just sat or laid down. But I was feeling better. Today (Monday) I feel much better. A little tired, but much better. I went to the Pharmacy this morning, and they referred me to this website. I did not see the doctor.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Purpuric Rash and Thrombocytopenia After the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 Vaccine. Cureus. 2021;13:4     Previously administered products included for Viral hepatitis C: Interferon. Concurrent medical conditions included Viral hepatitis C, Chronic kidney disease (Stage 4, with a baseline creatinine of 3 mg/dl.), Uncontrolled hypertension, Systolic heart failure (Ejection fraction of 35%.) and Liver cirrhosis.    On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), PURPURA (Purpuric rash) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), NAUSEA (nausea) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools), PYREXIA (Fever) and CHILLS (Chills). The patient was hospitalized for 3 days due to ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION, ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE, NAUSEA, PURPURA, RASH and THROMBOCYTOPENIA. At the time of the report, RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine), THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia), PURPURA (Purpuric rash), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation), NAUSEA (nausea), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools) and CHILLS (Chills) outcome was unknown and PYREXIA (Fever) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In February 2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Negative COVID-19 test. In March 2021, Alanine aminotransferase: 90 (abnormal) 90 U/L. In March 2021, Aspartate aminotransferase: 196 (abnormal) 196 U/L. In March 2021, Bilirubin conjugated: 5 (abnormal) 05 mg/dl. In March 2021, Blood albumin: 1.9 (abnormal) 1.9 gm/dl. In March 2021, Blood alkaline phosphatase: 216 (abnormal) 216 U/L. In March 2021, Blood creatinine: 3.2 (Inconclusive) 3.2 mg/dl. In March 2021, Blood lactate dehydrogenase (122-222): 381 (High) high. In March 2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) Findings consistent with pulmonary edema.. In March 2021, Glomerular filtration rate: 19 (Low) eGFR - 19. In March 2021, International normalised ratio: 1.13 (Inconclusive) INR - 1.13. In March 2021, Platelet count: 84000 (Low) 84000/uL. In March 2021, Serum ferritin (24-336): 2400 (High) 2400 mg/ml. In March 2021, Ultrasound liver: abnormal (abnormal) Ultrasound of the liver confirmed liver cirrhosis..     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter considered THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia) and PURPURA (Purpuric rash) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation), NAUSEA (nausea), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools), PYREXIA (Fever) and CHILLS (Chills).    Concomitant medications were not provided.  Hepatitis panel showed a heavy viral load of more than 11 (no reference range was provided).  Per reporter, on presentation to the emergency room the patient was afebrile, had a blood pressure 183/106 mmHg, pulse rate of 82 per minute and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Treatment included anti-hypertensives and intravenous diuretics. On day 3 of hospitalization, patient left the hospital against medical advice.  Based on reporter&#39;s causality, the event purpuric rash is assessed as possible related to mRNA-1273. However, the reporter also indicated it could have been precipitated by the underlying thrombocytopenia, liver cirrhosis and Hepatitis C infection. Very limited information regarding the other reported events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality, the event purpuric rash is assessed as possible related to mRNA-1273.

A few minutes after taking the vaccine, blood pressure fell, dizzy with risk of passing out, weak, very rapid heart beat, nausea. Jumped up and starting moving to create energy to avoid passing out. The dizziness reduced somewhat and did not get worse, but was still present. Heart rate slowed after a significant period of time. Then symptoms resolved. No emotional triggers and no history of any such events at any time in 60 years.

You just lie there, hot, and ache all over, then this wave of chills hits for maybe 5 seconds then dissipates. The 2 mins later, it happens again! And this goes on for  an hour or more! I had to pee but was worried I?d be too cold to stand still. So I waited until I could not wait anymore. OMG! Trying to stand up! It?s as if my joints no longer worked! And when I did stand up I was dizzy as hell! The next day, utter exhaustion. I am so weak, it takes effort to move. Even breathing took work! I didn?t sleep all night as every position I lay in was uncomfortable and had twinges of chills. The amount of energy it takes to physically get up and walk to the bathroom is dumbfounding! This morning I am achy, hot and cold, exhausted, and just had a bout of dry heaves. I?m hoping to be able to get some sleep today.

                                                Vertigo for 5 days so far about 3 weeks after second shot. First day of vertigo was so bad I threw up twice and had to stay immobile to not throw up. Day 4 I had to take meclizine so I could return to work. Day 5 which is today still dizzy a little bit but not enough to make me sick to my stomach.

The right sided headache continued for days. On Saturday evening Jan 16th it became the worst headache of my life. Like a fool I didn&#39;t go to ER until Monday morning when I developed left handed weakness. I was visiting my son and presented to the Medical Center ER where I was diagnosed with an acute sub-dural brain bleed and airlifted to Specialized Hospital. Was admitted to the Neuro-Neurosurgery Unit.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

                                                Had COVID vaccine on 02.11.21. States the next morning his anxiety was very high. States he did not know who he was. Still experiencing a lot of anxiety at night. Admits to heart palpitations and hard time breathing. Can&#39;t sit still. Reports manic episodes and cycles of depression over the course of hours. Patient states it has gotten a tiny bit better. Tried trazodone which helps temporarily. Denies chest pain. Patient states he has no appetite. Palpitations resolved pretty quickly. Shortness of breath is described as tightness that comes with anxiety feeling. Resolves with shoulder massage. Occurring three times per day. Also admits to dry mouth. Patient admits to needing to sleep with multiple pillows or feeling like he had to sit up and couldn&#39;t lay down as shortness of breath would get worse.  EKG in office on 2/24/21 showed ST-T changes and given symptoms patient was transferred to emergency room via ambulance.  Work up in hospital was unremarkable and patient was diagnosed with pericarditis (unknown etiology) and prescribed NSAIDS from ER and discharged.  Admission not required.   Patient followed up to us as outpatient on 03.02.21.  Patient felt much better and had not take motrin for 1 day.  COVID testing obtained at this point (unclear why ER did not send it).  Patient referred to outpatient cardiology given risk of cardiovascular disease, stress echo, and event monitor.

We recommend that they be evaluated in an ER because this a/e is not common with the vaccine and there is need to rule out other causes of patient&#39;s symptoms such as appendicitis or other abdominal emergencies. Pt went to see doctor today as we rec&#39;d and MD thinks is gallstones and patient will be having an ultrasound tomorrow.

Daily diarrhea, watery stool, cramping and bleeding lasting one month.  Currently slowly resolving.  Treated with a variety of remedies over the month, individually and in combination.  ( Pepto bismol, charcoal capsules, imodium, rice, tumeric, and Xifaxin)  Imodium would stop the cramping but not the wateriness of the stool.  Unlike any diarrhea over the course of my life. I will not be taking any booster shots.

                                                Woke from sleep at 12:45 a.m. on 3/19 with severe pain at injection site. Got up to urinate and take Tylenol. While in bathroom, became dizzy, broke into sweats, and felt I was about to faint. I went to my knees holding onto counter. My wife came in to help me in bathroom. She observed I was incoherent but uttering moaning sounds and breathing heavily. She called 911. While on phone I came to and vomited into sink. It appeared I had not digested anything from dinner that night. After vomiting (1x) I felt much better.  First responders reported normal vital signs. I did not go to E.R. that night but went to Urgent Care later that morning and all seemed fine.

                                                I woke at 4:30 AM and spent the next SEVEN HOURS explosively vomiting and diarrheic. Muscle pain and tightness spread from my left shoulder, across my back, to my right shoulder. Lying flat gave me dry heaves. Standing up made me dizzy. I?m coughing like there is fluid at the bottom of my lungs. The base of my skull felt like it was in a C-clamp. My temples felt like they were in a vise. I have a rash on my shoulder and arm. I  smelled like rotting flesh. (To head off any concerns over lifestyle or hygiene, I have a BA, BFA, MBA, MSL, and completing my PhD.)  After two days of exhaustion, vomiting, diarrhea, pain, etc. I took a shower at 11:58 PM Saturday. When I swiped my soapy face towel over my left should, I wiped away a layer of skin, like a burn victim.  Be grateful I don?t have power. I would stop the Moderna injections until someone finds out what it is about my genetic makeup that might signal those with similar genetics to stay clear of Moderna.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and a few weeks later he noticed jaundice and hematuria. He was admitted to the Hospital, and was noted to have dramatically elevated eosinophils (26.29 k/uL), elevated creatinine (2.36 mg/dL) and elevated LFTs (AST/AST/Alk Phos/Tbili all up, mostly direct). His eosinophils improved with pulse dose steroids and the diagnostic work up continues. There is diagnostic uncertainty about what caused this dramatic increase in eosinophilia, but it appears temporally related to getting the vaccination. Our working diagnosis is autoimmune vasculitis, but he is also being treated for possible parasitic infection, and will require very close follow-up. 61M with PMHx HTN p/w generalized fatigue, L flank pain, and decreased UOP.   He was in his usual state of health until 5 days prior to admission with onset of general fatigue/sluggishness. This was followed by a few days of dull abdominal pain, watery bowel movements, and increased frequency which spontaneously resolved, though the fatigue persisted. Yesterday evening, he noticed new L flank pain, red urine, and decreased UOP associated with mild dysuria (he describes it as needle-like pain in his urethra) which prompted him to call EMS. Denies fevers/chills/night sweats, myalgias, respiratory symptoms, melena/hematochezia. He&#39;s never had pyelonephritis or kidney stones before, no recent urinary instrumentation, antibiotic use, or hospital stays.    He recently received the first COVID vaccine and is due for the second COVID shot on Monday. He lives with his sister and works as a mechanic. He is not on any other medications or supplements. Not currently sexually active.

Notably has been afebrile and fairly well appearing. Symptoms were preceded by several days of watery diarrhea, cough with sputum production and subjective weight loss. Recently received moderna vaccine, and he was concerned it causes his symptoms.  Underwent extensive workup as below with involvement of multiple services including Renal, Pulm, Rheum, Allergy, ENT, and Cardiology. Had one nasal lesion biopsied by ENT, which was non-diagnostic. Renal bx prelim without clear e/o vaculitis, although obtained after steroids. Negative testing for primary hypereosinophilic syndrome. Extensive w/u notable for ANCA positive at 1:80 with  MPO only slightly elevated (20, uln 19) and PR3 wnl.  cMRI with eosinophilic cardiomyopathy, for which cards was consulted as below. Additionally, toxacara ab positive and schistosoma ab indeterminate, although per ID both schistosomiasis and toxacara infection unlikely. Per rheum, overall felt presentation 2/2 hypereosinophilic syndrome, potentially the eosinophilic stage of EGPA (given low &#43; ANCA, low &#43; MPO) vs.  End organ effects of idiopathic eosinophilia. Briefly received CTX 2g IV qd (4/10 - 4/12) until diagnostics returned. Treated with solumedrol 1g qd x3d (4/11-4/13) transitioned to prednisone 60 mg qd (4/14-) to be continued until rheum f/u, with rapid decline in eosinophilia. Received pre-treatment with PO ivermectin 20 mg before steroids. Treated with flonase nasal spray, symbicort and albuterol for respiratory symptoms. Deferred cyclophosphamide, with consideration of IL-5 or IL-5R targeted biologics as an outpatient. Treated with atovaquone for PCP ppx. Per ID, treated with praziquantel (for schistosomiasis) and albendazole (for toxacara) out of an abundance of caution, although low c/f visceral larva migrans given lack of compatible imaging findings and no known exposure to dogs and cats or schistosomiasis given remove travel history.

Baseline Cr unknown but Cr was 1.5 (OSH BI) and urine alb:Cr was elevated to 36 in 6/2018, at which time CKD was thought to be 2/2 untreated HTN. Now presented with persistent hematuria, HTN and proteinuria with UCx without e/o infection, all favoring nephritic process. Renal and urology consulted MALB/CCR 994.5. CT scan with hydronephrosis, felt to be eosinophilic pyelonephritis. Pt underwent uncomplicated renal bx 4/14 (after steroids) which showed preliminary very mild focus of interstitial nephritis with scattered eosinophils and immunofluorescence evidence suggestive of a mild immune complex-mediated disease without current activity. EM pending. He was treated with sodium bicarb 1300 mg bid. Hematuria improved but did not resolved by time of discharge. Cr on discharge 1.6, close to baseline of 1.5 in 2018.    #Sclera Icterus #CBD Dilation on CT #Elevated LFT Sclera icteric and CBD dilation on RUQUS to 1.8cm with gallbladder sludge and small gallstones. MRCP with diffuse intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation to the level of ampulla, with associated ductal and gallbladder wall edema, complex material in the gallbladder lumen and CBD, and confluent periportal lymphadenopathy. No obstructing stone or discrete mass. Findings likely represent cholangitis such as eosinophilic cholangitis in light of severe eosinophilia.. No documented LFTs here, but OSH (BI) records indicate normal LFTs and viral hepatitis studies in 6/2018. Repeat Hep B non-reactive non immune, HCV non immune, HAV non-reactive.  BIli remained stable and ALT and AST continued to rise after initiation of steroids. GI was consulted. RUQUS 4/15 with dopplers with persistently dilated CBD to 1.4 cm with sludge in CBD but with patent portal vein and hepatic veins. Anti smooth muscle ab positive on day of discharge; antimitochondrial ab pending. LFT uptrending at time of discharge, although patient declined to stay inpatient for further workup. LFT at discharge ALT 194, AST 114, ALP 262, TBili 6.3, DBili 5.3. ERCP to be considered as an outpatient.     #HTN SBP on admission 160-180. History of HTN, not on any home anti-hypertensives. Per BI records, he was prescribed amlodipine 10/valsartan 160 in 6/2019, but pt reports self-discontinuation after ~2 doses. BP remains poorly controlled. Likely related to potential nephritic syndrome or renal infiltration by eosinophils, likely with contribution of high dose steroids. While inpatient, treated with hydralazine, labetalol, carvedilol, and amlodipine. BP regimen on discharge amlodipine 10 mg qd, carvedilol 25 mg qd. Avoiding ARBs and ACEI per Renal, although will likely need to add once AKI resolved.    #Microcytic Anemia Patient with drop in Hct from 14.1 on admission to 11.4 4/14. Continues with hematuria, but denies current hematochezia. Suspect combination of blood loss and hypopoliferation given RPI 0.29, likely anemia of inflammation/acute illness given ferritin 1.010. Vitamin B12 &gt;2000, Folate 11. Iron 151, unable to calculate TIBC. Noted to have persistently low MCV in low 70. Hemoglobin electrophoresis ordered.    #Vitamin D deficiency #HyperPTH 25-OH Vitamin D 6. No e/o hypocalcemia. Phos slightly elevated on admission, but subsequently downtrending, likely iso renal dysfunction. Treated with ergocalciferol 50,000 U weekly x12 weeks   #Right mandible lesion Sclerotic changes of the right mandible near the condyle noted on CT scan. Surgeon recommends outpatient follow-up, although patient declined.    #Hematochezia #Hemorrhoids Patient with new bloody diarrhea 4/11. Some e/o hemorrhoids on exam. CBC stable. Treated with tucks pads, dibucaine ointment and hydrocortisone cream.   #Little Medical Follow-up Pt reports that he has not seen a doctor in ~3 years.Cholesterol 124l LDL 73, HDL 10. HgbA1c 5.2. Will join Dr&#39;s panel on discharge   #CHIP mutation  RHP with DNMT3A mutation at low VAF. Will follow in cancer precursor clinic

Starting starting 54 hours after the vaccine, chills began to recur, accompanied by severe indigestion and gas.  In the evening of the third day after the vaccine, chills were extreme and excessive stomach gas and bloating was experienced, with occasional sharp gas pains in the abdomen.  While the gas symptoms moderated overnight, they returned in the afternoon and overnight of day 4. Experiencing fatigue, but this could be related to lack of sleep due to the symptoms. This is day 5 and the gas and bloating remain but appear to be moderating.

                                                After my second shot after approximately 8 hours I got a severe headache perfuse sweating and vomiting, this went on continuously until Monday when I went to a family practitioner, she blew off my symptoms and sent me home where I continued to have these symptoms on and off. When on I was completely disabled. I filed a complaint they called on 4/15/2021, and told me I should go to ER, I told them I was flying the next day to see my mother who is passing away. I promised if my symptoms were still there in morning I would go to ER. I woke up feeling great and then I had a bowel movement my headache was so bad I thought I was having a stroke, I started sweating bullets and vomiting. it was so bad the only thing I can compare it to was when I had  Tick fever in the early 90&#39;s. I called 911 at hospital I was in a dangerous arrhythmia throwing PAC&#39;s and going in and out of 2nd third degree heart blocks. They can not figure out why, the neurologist I saw theory is the same I had, a severe inflammatory reaction to the 2nd moderna shot. He put me on a 3 day course of prednisone which helped a lot in my recovery. I am currently on a heart monitor to see if the heart block was just temporary. I see the neurologist again in 3 weeks.

Morning after 2nd shot became nauseated; ran fever and ached all over.  He felt this was for 2 -3 days, and also very tired.  Still very tired on 4th day after shot, but no fever or aching. Patient did take Tylenol, didn&#39;t help so also 1 dose of Ibuprofen.  Take Prasugrel, so Ibuprofen wasn&#39;t really an option for him.

                                                I had the Covid virus early in November 2020 I had a bad reaction to my 1st Covid shot and wanted to ask if I should get the second one? I was able to get an appointment for a Covid vaccination thru store/pharmacy. I had the shot about 4:00 on Friday. On Saturday about noon I started not to feel right; head ache and stomach. About 4:00 I started to get an increase in my temperature. At 5:30 I started getting uncontrollable shaking. Over a span of about 30 minutes I had 4 or 5 episodes that lasted 30 - 45 seconds. I had a temperature at one point that reached 102.3 I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen every three hours before falling asleep for the night. On Sunday morning I still had a slight temperature (99.9), but it seemed like all my body joints ached. I ended up feeling better about 4:00 on Sunday. Reply

                                                On Friday (05.19.2021), fourteen days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (on 03.05.2021) at pharmacy, I began experiencing body aches (mostly leg cramps) followed by nausea, headache, and fatigue. They continued through  the next 36 hours. Today (Sunday, 03.21.2021) the headache subsided, but the nausea and fatigue remain, albeit less so than yesterday. I had similar symptoms in the first 24 hours of receiving the first dose but understand that to be a very common experience.

Between 5-10 minutes after injection, I just passed out (don&#39;t recall that happening).  Woke to 2 EMT&#39;s by my side asking to check my blood pressure..  I don&#39;t recall the numbers however they stated I &#39;bottomed out&#39;.  shortly after gaining consciousness, I became nausea loosing contents of stomach twice.  Remained under observation for 30&#43; minutes, then wife drove me home.  Slept until 5:00 when I was steady enough to walk unaided, and finally eat some dinner.

No productin of saliva was happening making swallowing difficult. Additionally eyes felt dry/itchy. Tongue and lips also felt swollen but didn&#39;t appear swollen. I was able to work up a slight amount of saliva after few minutes and swallow with moderate difficulty. Purchased a bottle of water and had no difficulty swallowing that. Did not seek assistance as my heart rate was normal, no difficulty breathing, no outbreak of hives or swolllen face/extremeities. Departed store at 25 min. as symptoms get worse.  Symptoms gradually abated by 12 hour mark.

I couldn&#39;t walk (well, I could with great difficulty leaning on furniture) and was very dizzy and felt like I would throw-up.  I moved to a reclining chair and stayed there 20&#43; hours (it&#39;s 20 now)... I got up to go to the bathroom and not much more.  I had a difficult time even making it to the bathroom.  Never had a fever (that I know of... I don&#39;t have a thermometer but didn&#39;t feel feverish or chilled), but I felt dizzy and nauseated all day and could hardly move from the recliner except for extreme need.

Started seeing stars, vision narrowing.  I laid down on the floor, and it seemed like I was having a hard time breathing.  The pharmacist came out and started talking to me. My wife happened to be there and was trying to calm me down.  I felt like I was passing out.  The pharmacist checked my BP and it was like 80 something.  He felt I was having an allergic reaction so gave me a show with an Eppy pen.  They called paramedics.  I started feeling better but paramedics said I should still go to ER so ambulance took me to ER.  They ran blood tests, EKG, and chest Xray.  After a few hours they released me.  They basically said that it was ok for me to get second shot, but obviously I am now extremely concerned out about getting it

                                                When I woke up, my entire body felt really bloated and soar. Moderate headache. Dizzy, could not think. Walking very slow. No desire to do anything. Sat in my recliner most of the morning with body aches and sleeping. In the early afternoon, I decided to go lay down in my bed to get more comfortable. Continued drinking water throughout the day. Woke up about 7:00 PM. As I got out of bed, I immediately noticed that I was feeling about 80-90% better. The whole body bloating feeling was gone. Body aches were very reduced. Headache was very minor. I felt like a different person when I woke up (better). Very freaky feeling! I was also able to eat some good at this time.

Worked that day and went home, woke up around 2 am with sweats and nausea and headache which became progressively worse through the day prohibiting any activity. Dry heaves and severe headache with dizziness lasted until 4 pm or so. I did take Ondansetron at 12 noon to limit nausea. Worked the following day with few physical symptoms but very irritable. The next day (Saturday) woke with headache and slight nausea which became worse as the day wore on, limiting activity but I was able to get chores done, though I was very lethargic. The next day was much better. Worked on Monday the 12th of April and felt well. Fell ill again with similar but less severe symptoms, though marked nausea and dry heaving again. Slept until approximately 2pm and started writing this report. 4/13/2021

Immediately after vaccine patient reported dizziness that persisted for about 60 min. He reports similar if less severe dizziness after flu vaccine one month ago and that he often feels dizzy after taking his morning dose of nortryptiline which he took today.            Symptoms evolved to include mild nausea, feeling that abdomen was &#34;shaking&#34;, and headache. No SOB or chest pain, feeling of throat closing, or rash. Patient AO x 3 throughout evaluation and talking throughout.             Fasting BG 234. Took basalglar 40u this AM and 5 of aspart. Drank 8oz chocolate milk 9:30am which is his typical breakfast.             He notes that his home BP this past week was elevated into SBP 170s though typically is in the 120s/70s without antihypertensive medications. Prolonged dizziness and hyperglycemia (454). Regular insulin 5u SQ administered. Patient symptoms after 60 min. Repeat BG essentially unchanged but patient symptomatically back to prevaccine baseline.   Discussed with ID on call. Plan for transport to SMMC lab for CH50 and tryptase with instructions to patient to repeat in more than 24 hours (to establish a baseline). Patient given strict ED precautions.

                                                1) After midnight, I began to get what felt like the shivers, but they were unlike anything I had ever seen or experienced, as I could not stop shaking, feeling like I had to try to get warm.  I had a heat pack under my back, and no temperature, but for 25 minutes, kept shaking. 2) At 10am in the morning, I began hallucinating, which has never happened to me before, and I only recognize because when my Dad was dying of prostate cancer, they had him on morphine and he began to see things.  It was a very specific hallucination, of being in a specific from in front of a specific computer talking to a person.  I feel quite reluctant to share this.  This lasted for somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes. 3) I&#39;ve vomited once, and had diarrhea, drinking lots of water, and only using Tylenol.  I did not take the Tylenol until after I stopped shivering.

This morning when he got up he was very nauseated, and not feeling well.  Did not go to work as not knowing if he had the flu or anything else.

I was not feeling less dizzy until Wednesday afternoon (4/20/2021) - I am still slightly dizzy if I move my head too quickly. I have an appointment with my doctor for later this week.

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

Found approximately 10 red, raised spots or &#39;welts&#39; on skin that he had never seen before. They were sporadic, NOT clustered. He described as not quite hives. He checked bed for &#39;bugs&#39; but didn&#39;t find anything. He had taken metaxolone for only the second time in his life before bed. Prior use did not elicit any type of &#39;rash&#39; as described. He applied no topical nor ingested any oral medication at this time. He mentioned he has IBS and also had 1 instance of diarrhea. He then took 1 imodium. He was able to eventually fall back asleep. When he awoke the next morning, all but 1 spot were gone and no indication this had ever happened. He has experienced a mild headache off and off since injection, but nothing significant that keeps him from his normal business.

                                                I had a nasty reaction to 2nd dose of Moderna 8-12 hours after. Began with body aches and chills so severe it was hard to breath. No fever. When I got under covers and warmed up so chills subsided and breathing returned to normal it felt like I was being squashed in a Panini press. Every cell in my body felt like it was vibrating in pain. I had to get up ever hour or so to urinate. I would be back in sever chill mode before i made it to the bathroom and it took about 5 minutes back in bed for chills to stop and breathing back to normal. I was also nauseous the whole time but did not vomit Then. The room temperature was 72F. This continued for 12-14 hrs.  I then tried to drink cranberry juice and eat 3 bites of a banana which  I immediately regurgitated. The rest of the day I was drained of energy. No sleep 48hrs. 3 days

His symptoms persisted throughout the night into the next day (3/10/21), and he went to his primary care physician. He vomited multiple times in transport and at the physician&#39;s office. Due to the nature of his symptoms and his concurrent hypertension there was concern for stroke and he was taken to the emergency department at Medical Center for evaluation around 4pm. Stroke was ruled out, and he was sent home with a prescription for meclizine with a presumed diagnosis of vestibular neuritis. 3/11/21 patient did not leave the bed except to use the restroom, however vomiting controlled with meclizine. 3/12/21 symptoms persist and patient has not yet improved.

Nausea and slight headache during the  night at about 3:00 AM that went away in a couple of hours. Arm pain persisted the next day. The following day the pain also involved the armpit, possibly lymph glands. Lesser pain at the injection site and arm pit areas the following day and was very slight the third day after the injection. Can?t wait for my second dose and despite the side affects will happily stand in line for my next dose.

I awoke to a very painful cramp about an inch below my left rib on my left side that lasted for almost 2 hours.  The more I moved, the worse it became.  I could not go to the bath room  and when I drank water, the cramp intensified.  Worse pain that I had ever experienced.  I sweated profusely.  Felt like I got kicked in the side.  I was not nauseous, a little dizzy for a moment.  My mouth was dry only because of my heavy breathing.     My second episode happened the following Saturday morning,  I don&#39;t think that it was as intense, but it felt like it was only because my left side was sour from Friday mornings episode.     My third and final episode happened again early Sunday morning.  This one was not as intense, but still woke me up and made me struggle.   I did not experience another episode on the 4 the night from my second dose.  At this time, my left side feels bruised internally and I have to change the speed of my walk.  It hurts to walk fast

                                                Patient reported soreness after 1st day of vaccination which went away within 24 hours. However, several after weeks after vaccination patient developed soreness at the injection site with a raised bump and redness surrounding the area on 4/28. There was no associated weakness in the arm except due to pain which prevented him from lifting his arm. The patient experienced diarrhea for about a week prior. He did not see a doctor for this and attributed this to a viral illness. The soreness and swelling resolved after 4 days. The patient reported the reaction on 4/28. He was given a prescription for PT, but as it resolved by the time of his appointment, he did not see PT. The patient reports that the injection was high on his shoulder, about 2.5 fingerwidths below the joint. He denies experiencing joint pain.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.       Concurrent medical conditions included Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (diagnosed with PNH 30 years ago), Blood transfusion dependent (Transfusion dependence) and Dystonia (smooth muscle dystonia). Concomitant products included RAVULIZUMAB for Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.   On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMOLYSIS (hemolysis aggravated) (seriousness criterion medically significant), CHROMATURIA (dark urine), DIARRHOEA (diarrhea), PYREXIA (fevers), VOMITING (vomitting) and FATIGUE (severe fatigue). At the time of the report, HAEMOLYSIS (hemolysis aggravated), CHROMATURIA (dark urine), DIARRHOEA (diarrhea), PYREXIA (fevers), VOMITING (vomitting) and FATIGUE (severe fatigue) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In 2021, Aspartate aminotransferase: 26u/l (Inconclusive) Pre-vaccination and 22u/l (Inconclusive) Post-vaccination (after dose 2). In 2021, Blood bilirubin: 2.4 (Inconclusive) Pre-vaccination and 3 (Inconclusive) Post-vaccination (after dose 2). In 2021, Blood lactate dehydrogenase: 305u/l (Inconclusive) Pre-vaccination and 342u/l (Inconclusive) Post-vaccination (after dose 2). In 2021, Haemoglobin: 11.9 g/dl (Inconclusive) Pre-vaccination and 7.1g/dl (Inconclusive) Post-vaccination (after dose 2).     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered HAEMOLYSIS (hemolysis aggravated), CHROMATURIA (dark urine), DIARRHOEA (diarrhea), PYREXIA (fevers), VOMITING (vomitting) and FATIGUE (severe fatigue) to be possibly related.    It was reported that the last dose of the concomitant medication ravulizumab, was given four weeks prior to dose 1 vaccination and seven weeks prior to dose 2 vaccination.  PNH Clone was reported as 99% RBC, 99% granulocytes.  A week  following the second dose, labs showed &gt;4 g/dL hemoglobin decrease from his baseline.  No treatment medication reported.

                                                I started having gastrointestinal issues. I went to see Dr.  after a week of taking Pepto-Bismol, antacid tablets and loperamide hydrochloride. He prescribed pantoprazole sodium 40 mg. After 2 weeks of using the medication, my problem didn&#39;t go away. After that I went to see Dr. he prescribed famotidine. I went back a third time and saw Dr. He ran some blood work and he told me to discontinue taking the famotidine and continue with pantoprazole. He told me that if it continues that he would refer me to a GI specialist. After a couple weeks, I was referred to a GI specialist. I am seeing Dr. I went and saw Dr. and he suggested an endoscopy. I had one done on 06/04/2021. He said it looked like there is an ulcer, but it did not perforate the stomach and he said that I have H-pylori. I had a follow-up appointment on 06/17 where Dr. prescribed me to take amoxicillin, omeprazole and clarithromycin. As of today, with the antibiotics it&#39;s causing me to have diarrhea several times a day. I am eating a lot of vegetables, fruits and only pork or beef. If I eat any fried foods or meat, it causes me to have black stools with blood in it. The doctor told me that it was my upper intestines that are affected. Dr. did advise me to not take my pravastatin while I&#39;m taking my antibiotics. I was advised by all of the doctors to stop taking the ibuprofen and naproxen and switch to Tylenol. I am scheduled for a colonoscopy 07/19.

Later that night my arm started hurting and I felt a sharp pain in my forearm, my fingers felt like millions of needles were picking them in both hands, and I had severe abdominal pain just below the belly button. The abdominal pain was so severe that I was screaming out in pain and my wife had to hold me. I took three ibuprofen, still have the pain, but fell asleep. The abdominal pain went away the next day. The other symptoms took a few days to get rid of.

                                                ADVERSE EVENT REPORT: MODERNA VACCINE 1 of 2 Dates: Feb. 17 to March 16, 2021  1. I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks. At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

Approximately 8hours later I had a 103 temperature and was vomiting most of the night and suffered the chills which made me shiver uncontrollably.  I was feeling terrible the whole next day but the vomiting had stopped.  The headache and fatigue  along with more than usual muscle aches. The next day the headache stopped but the fatigue and muscle aches slowly diminished.  Today I am back to about 80 percent of being normal still am a little fatigued.

                                                1.) Strong soreness in lower back and gut area. Hard to bend over. I don&#39;t typically suffer from back pain and didn&#39;t exert or do anything that might have strained muscles. Pain seems muscular in back and deep in lower gut/groin area in front.  2.) More concerning is the tinnitus or ear ringing I am experiencing. Very loud and unrelenting. Feels like ears need to be popped such as when air pressure changes. However, can&#39;t swallow hard or chew hard enough to clear ears. It&#39;s a bit flummoxing as it is unrelenting. Sounds like cicadas in my head.

                                                Patient sat in waiting area chair after receiving vaccine. I was notified by another customer that something appeared wrong with the patient. I went to the patient and found him unconscious and unresponsive. I told the technician to call 911 for EMS and I proceeded to remove the Epinephrine emergency pen from the emergency bag. The patient regained consciousness, I did not administer the epinephrine emergency pen. I remained with the patient. The patient complained of feeling hot, nausea and tired. Patient also appeared confused. Patient&#39;s head was cold to the touch. EMS  arrived and took the patient&#39;s vital signs. The patient&#39;s awareness  and tiredness appeared to vary from feeling fine and alert to confusion.  After about 15 minutes with EMS the patient choose to go with EMS to the Hospital Emergency room for observation. The patient walked about 15 steps then chose to go on the gurney with EMS.

Fourth day also had chills, sneezing and runny nose.  Brain fog, fatigue and lack of coordination improved over the following days.  The second dose receive 4/13.  First day fatigure, chills, lack of coordination and muscle aches along with a lot of soreness at the site of the injection.  Second day also had dizziness, mild abdominal cramps and mild headache.  Could not eat until midday.  The third day dizziness, brain fog and lack of coordination continue.  Close to a point of seeking medical care but probably worth filing a report.

Three days later, I still occasionally experience mild nausea.

The next morning he woke up with a little headache, and by that evening his stomach started aching up, having diarrhea, throwing up and bones/joints and muscles were aching and felt tired.

He continued to feel week for 2-3 more days, but then was fine.  He did call his doctor on Monday to let him know whether he should take the shot or not, which he did today, 4/23/21.

                                                Fairly strong injection site pain for several days (unusual for me as I normally have no problems with past vaccines).  102.8 fever 12hrs after 2nd dose.  Severe chills/shaking.  Fever dropped to slightly over 100 from dose plus 17hrs through 63hrs, prior to dropping rapidly to normal.  During duration of fever: headache, muscle aches, digestive tract gas and loose stools, weakness, lack of mental focus, tired, and general feeling of heaviness with  some feeling of heart palpitations (not normal for me).   Post fever, minor headache, weakness, and lack of mental focus continued through present (Dose plus 80hrs), but now almost totally gone.  Appear to be starting Moderna/COVID arm with 4in diameter, round, itchy red spot on just at and below injection site  on right bicep.

                                                3 weeks after injection: Sudden onset of hearing loss in one ear, feeling of fullness/congestion in ear. Absolutely not a bacterial ear infection - no soreness/pain, redness, or discharge. Visited an ENT Dr. and inner ear issue confirmed. Hearing test showed significant loss or hearing (loudness) and loss of word discrimination.  Fri, 2-Apr: 1st COVID shot (Moderna). Slightly sore arm, no other symptoms/side-effects, all clear in 24 hrs. Fri, 23-Apr: Relatively rapid (over an hour or so) onset of hearing loss in left ear. Feeling of fullness in left ear, thought it might be congestion.  Sat, 24-Apr: No change/improvement in hearing of feeling of fullness in left ear. Sun, 25-Apr: I started to feel dizzy. I developed vertigo, though I did not get nauseous. Slept it off. Mon, 26-Apr: Awoke with no dizziness or vertigo. No change/improvement in hearing or feeling of fullness in left ear. Dizziness returned after dinner. Vertigo followed, more severe than the previous night. Unable to walk without help. Vomited and the nausea passed. Vertigo abated a bit, though still present. Slept it off. Tue, 27-Apr: Awoke with no dizziness or vertigo. No change/improvement in hearing of feeling of fullness in left ear Wed, 28-Apr: Saw ENT. First hearing test. Test confirmed quite a bit of hearing loss in left ear and some in the right ear. Thu, 29-Apr: 2nd COVID shot (Moderna). No side-effects until evening. Slight body ache, mild headache, maybe a mild fever. Some dizziness after eating. Fri, 30-Apr: Continued mild side-effects from COVID shot. Some dizziness after eating Sat, 1-May: Side-effects from COVID shot completely gone. Left ear noticeably worse. Sounds more attenuated, speech sounded more distorted. Sun, 2-May: No improvement in hearing Mon, 3-May: 2nd hearing test. Test confirmed significantly reduced hearing (volume) and speech recognition in left ear. Agreed to steroid injections to try to clear the suspected fluid retention/swelling. Tue: 4-May: 1st eardrum injection (10 mg dexamethasone) at 11:00 AM. No noticeable effect through bedtime. Wed, 5-May: Woke up with notably improved hearing in left ear (now only 10 or 20% attenuated). However, felt dizzy as soon as I woke up. Dizziness persisted until late afternoon. Thu, 6-May: No dizziness Fri, 7-May: 2nd eardrum injection (10 mg dexamethasone) at 11:30 AM. No noticeable effect through bedtime. Sat, 8-May: No improvement in left ear hearing, mildly dizzy when I woke up, dizziness persisted until late afternoon. Hearing not great in right ear over the course of the day (maybe 20% attenuated) Sun, 9-May: Minimal improvement in left ear hearing, if any. Right ear still partially impaired. A little light headed at times, no real dizziness. Mon, 10-May: Not dizzy when I woke up at 5:30 AM. Made a cup of coffee and ate an oat bran muffin at 6:15. Felt mildly dizzy by 6:30, persisted through the day and started to abate by evening. Tue, 11-May: No dizziness when I woke up. Hearing in left ear marginally improved. 3rd eardrum injection at 4:30 PM. Wed, 12-May: Woke up with improved hearing in left ear, still some attenuation, almost no distortion, still some feeling of fullness in the ear. No dizziness. Thu, 13-May: Woke up with hearing unchanged from Wed (i.e. no back-sliding). No dizziness in AM, though slightly lightheaded. Hearing degraded as the day progressed. Fri: 14-May: Woke up with hearing worse as compared to Thursday. Feeling of congestion/fullness in ears (more on the left than the right). Slightly lightheaded, no dizziness.

                                                In March IBS started which I?ve never had before. Everything I ate turned into what felt like rocks , I got so constipated I couldn?t use the bathroom. I started to become nauseated every day. I was up every hour of the night. I tried drinking water to flush my body and stomach, I had trouble eating. I ended up losing 3lbs a week up to 20 lbs. total. I ended up in ER on March 17, 2021. I had to be wheeled in because I was so weak, I couldn?t walk. I had CT scans and bloodwork done. I was sent home after I had a bowel movement. I was also given laxative to take at home. I went to the ER again on 4/23/21 @ 5pm ( 2nd ER visit ) I had CT Scans with contrast, enema, and lab work. I was also hooked up to an IV. I had no blockages from CT Scan. The CT Scan showed impaction, I had to drink stuff in ER to flush system and was given another enema. Once I had a bowel movement I was released with laxative.  I now take generic brand laxative and generic brand of medication every day. I was advised that it could take my intestines a long time to return to normal. After following up with doctor, he decided I needed to have a scope done on my lower GI. I am still having complications.

Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Definitive causal association is confounded by age and medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia.

Threw up before exiting building in rest room.Needed to get out of building ASAP fast for fresh air . Breathing-20 degree fresh air maskless helped but still felt weak so wife and medical aids brought me inside to isolated area on a cot to rest and take vitals .  When I was sick with COVID-19 in September 2020 I had same issues with heightened smell and taste before I lost them for three months.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

I remaining in bed off and on for about 36 hours and then worked my way back to eliminate most of the symptoms.

The achiness is particularly acute when waking in the morning, particularly in my fingers..  The pain is by no means debilitating, but it is noticeable.  I would rate the pain 3 or 4 when waking and 2-3 throughout the rest of the day.     I have not sought any treatment.

                                                I developed a swollen lymph node in my right side neck just under lower jaw at rear. This presented itself as strong jaw pain like a bad cavity and soreness at the lymph node. I have a sore throat and have not been able to hardly chew or swallow without pain. This is still going on as of 3/3/21 but seems to be easing up a bit. I have a Dr. appointment on 2/9/21 to check it out.

                                                On February 19th, one week after shot I woke up with severe dizziness and nausea. Room was spinning and would only stop by sitting up. Eventually dizziness subsided but had mild nausea all day. Dizziness returned each morning for following week but not as severe as on the 19th. Went to an urgent care where they gave me rapid and pcr covid tests. Both came back negative. Also checked heart and blood pressure multiple times. Everything was normal. Reported everything to my doctor. On March 6th, woke up at 7am with severe dizziness and nausea again. Dizziness is subsiding and nausea is gone. Seeing doctor on March 10th and will discuss then.

On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

Currently I have mild vertigo 18 days after the injection. I am able to drive safely and the vertigo symptoms are reducing day by day.

                                                About 2 weeks after the second Moderna shot, patient developed dry cough and noticed a weight loss.  Patient went to Dr. to report condition.  Dr. did bloodwork, chest x-ray, and abdominal ultrasound.  All came back negative.  Patient has subsequently started taking Ensure, which has stabilized weight, but continues to have digestive issues, which is mostly stomach gas that seems to come mostly severely when sitting down.  Patient takes 1-3 Tums a day to deal with gas, but has not returned to Dr. as the situation seems manageable, though somewhat distressing as gas has never been a problem with patient before.  The dry cough, the wet loss of about 10 pounds, and the stomach gas, all seemed to develop after the second Moderna shot.  The patient did test positive to Covid in November, 2020, and had a mild case that did not require treatment.

The trip to the bathroom I basically crawled since I was unable to stand up. The dizziness lasted for about 5 week. Unable to look up due to dizziness coming back. I lost 7 days of work and was extremely cautious of falling over going to work. Loss of appetite, balance, and a feeling of nervousness lasted for many weeks. Visited by family doctor and said it was nothing and not related to corvid injection. Visited neurologist and said it was not related to corvid injection. N one seemed to know what the problem was except I know it was caused by the injection.

                                                Explosive diarrhea  occurred four and one half hours after receiving 2nd vaccination.   Single event (so far... its now 6 hours since vaccination).  Diarrhea is not a common health event for me.  It is not listed as one of the common side effects so I thought I should report it.  I have not been been feeling ill.  Event came on very sudden.  I had eating lunch between vaccination and diarrhea.  Only side effect from first shot was a sore shoulder for two days.

                                                Patient received his injection at 12:20 pm.  He was observed for 15 minutes and released.  Almost an hour later he was still grocery shopping in the store  he stated he very rapidly became dizzy almost like vertigo, began to feel shaky and sought a chair to sit down.  He quickly became  very nauseous and found a nearby trashcan to vomit but states he could only dry heave 3 or 4 times.  He became quite pale and sweaty.  He was observed by his wife accompanying him who is an RN.  After appoximately 15 minutes the patient began to feel somewhat better.  He was given a bottle of water to drink and he could sip it successfully .  He was able to stand successfully and walked back to the pharmacy where I checked his blood pressure (136/86) and pulse (68).  He refused a 911 call and said he felt about 95/100.  Will check on patient again later this afternoon.  Patient will check with his doctor before getting the second vaccine.

Had to hold shopping cart and sit down. 3 mins into dizziness I became nauseated and had to find a garbage can to vomit into. I had 4 episodes of dry heaving and was diaphoretic and sat for 15 mins and slowly the dizziness subsided. Pharmacist asked me to return to pharmacy the gave me water and took my BP. 136/86 HR68. It is now 3 hours later and I feel much better. I just ate lunch. I&#39;m very healthy with no issues and this literally floored me.

By 7 PM headache became a bit stronger, and loss of appetite; becoming more fatigued; generally just feeling &#34;crummy&#34;. About 8 PM I took prescribed amount of regular strength Tylenol, and went to bed, easily falling asleep. Woke about 7 AM next day feeling noticeably better. I took another dose of Tylenol, just as a precaution. I would say by 11 AM all illness was gone.

                                                About six hours after receiving the Covid Moderna vaccine I quickly began constant tremors that was strong enough that I could not walk or stand. I did not have a thermometer but I?m certain I had a fever. This lasted throughout the night. The following morning I was bedridden, unable to eat and had flu like symptoms. This is continued for three days now. I am slowly Beginning to gain strength but I?m still bedridden.

Okay next day and night but then next two evenings chills (not lasting as long) with eventual headache (more treatable). Okay again today, and will contact Clinic about it in case they want me to get a Covid test before the second vaccine. Concerned that the &#34;reactions&#34; have been so long after the vaccine, and that it was only the first vaccine. Can find no info matching this course of events....

                                                Fairly strong headache in the middle of the night. Took 500mg acetaminophen, which worked well. Awakened Saturday morning to the call of diarrhea. After four additional visits to the toilet in the next two hours, I started keeping track of these episodes. Over a period of 24 hours (Sat 8am-Sun 8am) I HAD to visit the toilet 31 times. Each episode was accompanied by a serious need to evacuate my bowels. Lots of pressure and pain in my intestines, every time. The first 4-5 sessions had considerable content, but after that, the almost-liquid movements could have been captured in 2 tablespoons (not a lot of content). After about 12 visits, which required vigorous wiping to remove the gelatinous remains, my long-dormant hemorrhoids started bleeding bright red and rather profusely. By the 18th visit they had reduced to pinkish smears, and remained that way until the present. I also became very tired and sluggish after about 8 hours of repeated toilet visits. The diarrhea episodes continued all night, allowing me only short cat-naps in between episodes of gnashing pain. After 24 hours (Sunday morning), the diarrhea episodes reduced in intensity and frequency, but the near-liquid consistency has remained through till just now (Sunday evening) where the content is slowly growing (about 1/2 cup) and beginning to have a little more solid appearance. I have been napping all day.

                                                Within 12 hours of my second shot I experienced the typical symptom cluster, headache, fever, aches, and fatigue. I then experience stomach cramps and a brief bout of diarrhea. All of the above symptoms resolved within three days, however the stomach discomfort and cramping persisted for more than a week. Upon going to my local ER I was subsequently diagnosed with appendicitis. I am suspicious that this was triggered by the vaccine, as there is growing evidence that the appendix plays a role in the immune system, the response of which was exploded by the second shot. I have never had stomach issues in the past, confirmed my medical exams and preventative colonoscopies. I am extremely healthy, eat well and my bowel habits are quite regular and reliable.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after receiving my first Moderna vaccine I developed a cough, fever, chills, runny nose. I assumed these were  some of the symptoms as a result of the vaccine. I monitored my fever for several hours. The cough persisted for the next 9 plus days and I didn&#39;t have any desire to eat or drink liquids. I lost my taste and smell during this 9 day period. On February 25 my wife and I took a Covid-19 self test at pharmacy. Also on this same date I went to urgent care My wife was concerned about my labored breathing.  My vitals were checked and I requested a chest xray. I was given 2 prescriptions. 1 for Prednisone 20mg and Ventolin.

Not that high I know but for me it is and gave me a very bad headache and body aches.  I did not feel good enough to try to sleep until about 1:00 am after using a heating pad and hot tea to try and chase the chills away and Ibuprofen for the aches.  My shoulder was so sore from the shot that I could not lay on my left side.  The following day I was about 50% better. No more chills but still slight fever and no appetite.  Didn&#39;t feel good enough to do anything except take a nap.  The following day I was pretty much back to normal.

The next day was dominated by body aches and headache (I rarely get headaches). Loss of appetite.  This general condition of malaise lasted all day (the day after injection) and it was at times horrible. The symptoms  started to subside by the evening hours and I was able to have a better night sleep. By the next morning I felt better.

As the day progressed (within 2-3 hours), I experienced a feeling of malaise and body aches and no appetite and a slight runny nose.  I took two (2) OTC Tylenol to relieve the pain (worked very well!) and consumed two (2) 12 oz cans of ginger ale over the next 8 hours.  Upon waking up (about 40 hours after the injection), I felt rested, alert and about 95% of great. No symptoms or other side effects whatsoever since.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

About 10 later he developed diarrhea and this has lasted 3 days so far.  He took Pepto Bismol for 2 days but this did not seem to help.  He has an already scheduled appt w/ his Diabetic doctor and will discuss his symptoms with him to see what he suggest he should do about the diarrhea.

On 3/27/21, he got a fever that ranged between 99.7 to 102.6.  He could not eat and thinking about it made his stomach upset.  Every bone and joint in his body ached, even his skin hurt and he had a bad headache.  Tylenol did little to alleviate any of these symptoms.  His fever  broke on 3/27/21 about 11 pm.  He still did not sleep well and slept until noon on 3/28/21.  His symptoms persisted except for the fever, though he still had chills that night.  He still did not feel well throughout 3/29/21 and 3/30/21 and he still ate very, very little until 3/31/21.  On 3/31/21, he was able to eat and went to the grocery, but it wiped him out and he slept for a couple of hours in the afternoon.  He still has a dull headache and very little energy that is keeping him from doing his daily activities.

On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). In March 2021, the patient experienced BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to AGEUSIA, CONSTIPATION, DYSSTASIA, GAIT DISTURBANCE and POLLAKIURIA, and then from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to ASTHENIA. On 06-Mar-2021, GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) had resolved. On 24-Mar-2021, ASTHENIA (weakness), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) and AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) had resolved. At the time of the report, POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination), BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant medications were not provided by the reporter.

                                                A few days after the normal second injection reactions of fever, chills, exhaustion, saw a rapid and extreme gastro disorder. Started with significant diarrhea for several weeks, and progressed to severe cramping and very odd lower abdominal pain, as well as generally mild nausea and lethargy. Family doctor ordered blood and stool analyses, which both came back negative. Doctor prescribed anti-diarrhea meds which worked within several days, and condition improved gradually until at this time am almost back to normal. Doc also recommended gastrointerologist(?) if conditions did not improve. Of course this entire sequence of events may have nothing to do at all with the vaccine, but it is unprecedented for me.

                                                The patient woke up on 03/22/21 at 7:30 with multiple symptoms.  He had a fever of 100.5, both hands were swollen to the point he couldn&#39;t make a fist, a rash from wrist to elbow on right arm, chills and overall hurting from head to toes.  By the evening he had a rash on both legs from ankles to hips.  He lost his appetite for two days.  Also, for two days his glucose levels were between 300 and 408.  Patient took acetaminophen but it didn&#39;t relieve his fever.  His wife called his primary care provider, on 03/22/21.  She was instructed to call a hot-line, which ended up being our county health department.  She was told by them to contact his primary health provider.  She didn&#39;t call the primary provider again.  The patient&#39;s symptoms had resolved by 03/25/22 except for the rash on his right arm.  The wife called Care physician on 04/09/2021 to talk abouth what happened to her husband.  This time provider called the state hot-line.  The state hot-line advised the patient not to take the second shot because the symptoms could be worse or fatal.

Drinking water and cold compress on forehead finally helped enough to be able to go to bed at 3:30 am and sleep.  The morning after vaccination fever gone but still had headache and some muscle aches, no appetite.  The second day after vaccination I felt pretty much back to normal except for slight headache which is still present today which is the third day.

                                                Starting the day after the 2nd dose of the vaccine, I encountered severe fatigue, which continues to this day, along with severe diarrhea.  The diarrhea lasted approximately 3 weeks before I started a regimen of Immodium, which I have continued taking daily, or every other day.  I have also started taking a probiotic supplement daily along with a fiber supplement.   My bowel movements are &#34;ok&#34; while taking Immodium, but, if I don&#39;t take an Immodium at least every other day, the diarrhea returns.  My doctor has told me there is another he can suggest or do for me.  He suggested making an appointment with a GI specialist, so I have made an appointment with a GI specialist.

                                                Next day after 2nd shot: Chills, fatigue, head ache, slight fever.   They went away by end of 3rd day.  About 1.5 weeks later all those side effects reemerged at a much greater amplitude.  Also, I had trouble breathing and was very weak.  I went to PCP and had low O2 at 92%.  He thought I had COVID,  but rapid test came back negative and chest x-ray was normal.  Based on his recommendation and my O2 staying low, I went to emergency room 2 days later.  The doctor there thought symptoms were consistent with COVID. I got another chest x-ray . It was normal.  They performed a lot of blood analysis and found nothing acute and abnormal.  They gave me a PCR test and it came back negative.  I got diarrhea constantly for about a month. I slowly got better with my O2 returning to normal range and diarrhea  over with.

At 12:40 pm he returned to the pharmacy claiming to have nausea and feeling like he is about to vomit.  He sat down.  He did not have throat swelling, flushing or paleness, shortness of breath, rash--only nausea. Pt has asthma and verified that he was not wheezing or feeling like it was any type of allergic reaction.  I took his BP:130/79. Pt reported that it usually ranges from 120-130 over 70-80.  pulse was 74 bpm.  Pt reported that he had not eaten anything since breakfast at 6 am.  I gave him some water to drink, and sitting still and drinking water seemed to help him.  I gave him a peppermint to help settle his stomach.  After 20 minutes, he felt well enough to leave.  He was accompanied by his two adult children and instructed to call if any other issues occur.  He reports that he did not have any issues after his first shot at the fairgrounds from county public health.

Patient is on nebulizer treatment of tiotropium bromide and a lot of simethicone. Patient do not know if using either medication helped or not but that was my immidiate reaction. Now patient is on prednisone and feels like he&#39;s taking it just to breathe. Patient has had to go on 24 hr. oxygen since the first shot.   Patient was negative for Covid-19 over the past 3 months at three different times. He continued to have terrible chest pain where he was grabbing and pulling at his chest, pain creeping up to his chest, could not breath or eat anything for 1 week after his first shot.  Patient was in the ER on 10Mar2021. Caller stated he has chronic pancreatitis and breathing issues for which he was prescribed steroids, his doctor told him to decrease the prednisone to 10mg for 2 days prior and day of vaccination. Caller thinks he had a week long stroke since he had high Troponin level which resulted in visit to the hospital where the doctors thought he had septicemia. Caller stated he has not been able to sleep because he keeps having attacks of chest pains that last approximately 15 minutes in the middle of the sleep which occurs 4&#43; times per night.   Kidney&#39;s have gotten worse since 1st shot vaccine. Doctors said &#34;the kidney&#39;s took a shot&#34; after the first shot of vaccine.

On 23-May-2021: follow-up appended, conmeds added, NF added to events, new events added, new allergies coded, generated narrative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a male patient of unknown age who missed second dose due other adverse events experienced post first dose of mRNA-1273. The other events show temporal association with the use of mRNA-1273 and a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, the patient has concurrent history that confounds the reported events to include chronic pancreatitis, COPD, kidney and heart disorder.  Missed dose is assessed as not applicable

Patient denies orthopnea or PND but does have some palpitations and occasional chest pain associated with increased fatigue with exertion. On evaluation emergency room patient was noted to be tachycardic consistent with chronic atrial fib, also acute renal insufficiency likely secondary to dehydration. Patient is admitted to the medical service for further treatment and evaluation. DEATH SUMMARY Date of Admission: 04/07/2021 Time of Death: 04/10/2021 at 0737 Final Diagnoses: 1. Sudden Cardiac Death 2. Acute Renal Impairment Secondary to Hypovolemia, A TN 3. Chronic Atrial Fibrillation w/ RVR, Resolved 4. Atypical Chest Pain, Resolved 5. Hypokalemia, Resolved 6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea 7. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Hospital Course: Patient is a pleasant 66yo admitted for acute renal impairment secondary to significant o hypovolemia resulting in ATN as well as atrial fibrillation w/ RVR after presenting to ER with complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, malaise, and anorexia that began after receiving his second COVID vaccine on 4/01/2021. Please see H&amp;P for full details. Patient reported that on the day after his COVID #2 vaccine, he lost his appetite and was not able to eat or drink. He continued to take his home medications as prescribed including losartan, chlorthalidone, and meloxicam. After experiencing progressive worsening of symptoms for 5 days, patient presented to ER for further evaluation. Upon arrival to ER, patient was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic. EKG showed atrial fibrillation w/ RVR. Routine labs were obtained and were remarkable for elevated creatinine and mild hypokalemia w/ normal BNP and negative cardiac enzymes. CXR showed enlarged cardiac silhouette, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or other acute abnormalities. Patient was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and medical management. He was staited on aggressive IV hydration for his hypotension and hypovolemia w/ PRN IV metoprolol as needed for HR&gt; l lObpm. He was continued on anticoagulation. Serial cardiac enzymes were obtained and were negative. TIE report from Dr&#39;s office that was performed recently was obtained and showed EF of 55-60% with Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient&#39;s wife brought his CPAP from home and patient wore his CPAP while sleeping during his hospital stay. During the course of hospitalization, patient&#39;s blood pressure &amp; HR improved, though he remained in atrial fibrillation. His creatinine continued to trend up consistent with ATN, but patient continued to produce adequate urine and he had no signficant electrolyte derangements. IVF were adjusted based on urine output and volume status. Patient had no recurrence in his presenting complaint of chest pain and he overall reported feeling better throughout his course of hospitalization despite reporting that he continued to have little appetite. Patient was monitored closely on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. On the morning of 4/10/2021, lab tech and nurse walked into the patient&#39;s room to obtain specimen for AM labs. Patient reportedly tried to get out of the bed independently, grabbed at his chest &amp; pulled off his telemetry, and fell to his knees. Staff called Code 99 and patient was placed back in the bed. He was noted to be in asystole. ACLS was performed and despite maximal efforts, patient subsequently expired at 0737. I personally called the patient&#39;s cardiologist &amp; personal friend, to discuss the events leading up to the patient&#39;s death. Upon review of the patient&#39;s course of hospitalization, it was felt that patient most likely experienced sudden cardiac death. Of note, Dr reports that the patient frequently contacts him via text message with concerns or complaints. He states that the patient did not message him during the hospitalization to report any chest pain or other concerns. Disposition: Patient Expired

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included CHLORTHALIDONE, LOSARTAN POTASSIUM, MELOXICAM, METOPROLOL SUCCINATE, PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM SESQUIHYDRATE (PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM), TAMSULOSIN HYDROCHLORIDE (TAMSULOSIN HCL), RIVAROXABAN (XARELTO), AMLODIPINE BESILATE (AMLODIPINE BESYLATE) and TADALAFIL for an unknown indication.   On 01-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. In April 2021, the patient experienced DEHYDRATION (Dehydrated) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CARDIAC DISORDER (Started having heart issues), CHEST PAIN (Chest pain), DECREASED APPETITE (Lose it&#39;s appetite), THIRST (Thirsty), DYSPNOEA (Short of breath/got very winded) and FATIGUE (Fatigue/ very tired). On an unknown date, the patient experienced CIRCULATORY COLLAPSE (Collapsed) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient died on 10-Apr-2021. The reported cause of death was Cardiac death. An autopsy was not performed. At the time of death, DEHYDRATION (Dehydrated), CIRCULATORY COLLAPSE (Collapsed), CARDIAC DISORDER (Started having heart issues), CHEST PAIN (Chest pain), DECREASED APPETITE (Lose it&#39;s appetite), THIRST (Thirsty), DYSPNOEA (Short of breath/got very winded) and FATIGUE (Fatigue/ very tired) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Electrocardiogram: inconclusive (Inconclusive) Inconclusive and inconclusive (Inconclusive) Inconclusive.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Action taken with the mRNA-1273 vaccine due to the events was not applicable.  The reporter informed that the patient had received both doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine. He first lost his appetite and started feeling thirsty on the following day after vaccination, which worsened progressively for the next five days. The patient then started having chest pain, was short of breath and experienced fatigue. He got very winded when he went to the bathroom and felt very tired for the next two days, When he went to the hospital, the doctor said that he would need to be admitted if he doesn&#39;t feel well. On a Wednesday, the patient went to the hospital and an ECG was done. The reporter informed that when the doctor compared it with an ECG from few days before, he could not believe it was of the same patient&#39;s. The patient was taken to the ER (emergency room) and was them transferred to ICU (intensive care unit) as he was dehydrated. Dehydration was treated and at the time the patient started having heart issues. By Friday, the patient started doing better and the doctor discussed discharging him. On Saturday, when the patient woke up he grabbed his chest and collapsed. The reporter informed that they were not able to get an autopsy but the death was assumed to be cardiac death. It was reported that the patient passed away approximately nine days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. The reporter further informed that the patient was in good health and had a full &#39;cardiac work&#39; prior to his vaccination.

                                                Injection was given very close to the shoulder joint in my left arm, as a result within a few hours a very sharp pain in my shoulder caused me to be unable to lift my left arm without extreme pain, not muscle pain. By 4:00 pm I was sapped of energy. During the night I developed chills and ran a fever of 100.4 F. By Sunday morning I felt nauseous, but did not vomit. At 2:00pm 12/10/2020 my fever has lowered and the nausea has subsided, but the shoulder joint is still very sore.

                                                Had a little bit more than normal soreness in the shoulder, felt like bruising.  The day after the injection started getting flu symptoms, fairly severe, fever, coughing, runny nose, no energy at all.  Felt like he had a the worst case of flu he ever had.  He is getting better, but still has some of the symptoms.  The only thing he has taken for it is Nyquil and took a Sinutab.   Did have nausea, diarrhea, everything that comes with the flu.  Sinuses are drying up, energy is coming back and able to eat again.  He did call his doctor and he recommended that he call us and report this event.  He did have to postpone a procedure that he was scheduled for on Monday.

Symptoms included: fever, chills, aches, severe headache, nausea, loss of appetite dehydration due to inadequate fluid intake.  And insomnia due to fever and pain.   I receive a influenza vaccine each year and hardly notice any consequences. The symptoms I had in response to the Covid-19 vaccine were much worse than when I have had the seasonal flu.

                                                I woke up at 5 am (2/20/20) w/my head  spinning, in a sweat, my eyes unable to focus.  Felt very nauseas w/bad case of vertigo.  I got to the bath threw up &amp; kept dry heaving. Sitting on the floor, I phoned Hospital,  and spoke with an ER nurse.  I reported my vaccine, my symptoms and told her I could not drive the 1 mile to the ER.  She indicated these may be some of the serious side effects of the Moderna Vaccine.  At 6am I crawled back to my bed &amp; woke at 9:30 am.  I called store &amp; spoke to the pharmacist who vaccinated me.  He concurs w/the ER nurse.  I am still very weak, still slightly dizzy, and very concerned.  I am a healthy 67 year old, lives by himself &amp; this episode frightened me.

Began experiencing steady pain and stiffness in left shoulder injection site within an hour of injection and continued throughout rest of day, night and next day (2/25/21).  Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).  Very lethargic when woke up on morning of 2/25/21 and had slight fever.  Laid in bed for 2-3 hours after woke up; did not get up until 12:30 PM due to no energy.  Not nauseated, but have no appetite.

                                                One week post injection, on February 18, I developed  chills and a fever starting around 9 PM. I experienced diarrhea starting around 10 PM. Fever was approx 100.4 F and was accompanied by a splitting headache and significant body aches, to the point where I was unable to get any sleep that night. I noticed Covid arm the next morning. Fever, headache and body aches continued until Monday morning. I took only Extra Strength Tylenol. Most of the time Tylenol was effective only for the first 2-3 hrs before the discomfort overcame it. I was tested twice for COVID, both Friday AM and Monday AM. Both came back negative. Starting Monday the body aches and fever began to subside but I was left with a feeling of exhaustion and required continuous sleep.  Today is the first day I feel back to normal. I still have a large Covid arm rash, two weeks post injection. It causes no discomfort whatsoever.

He wasn&#39;t able to speak for 3 days.  On 2/17/2021 he went to the hospital.  They thought he may have Bell&#39;s Palsy so the they did a XRAY and CT.  They were not able to find anything other than facial swelling so he was discharged and told to come back if he did not get better and they would make him an appt w/ an ENT.  He started taking Aleve.  He no longer has constant pain but his mouth still hurts when he opens it.  He will contact his PCP to let her know what happened and to let her know that he will not be taking his 2nd covid vax dose.

Around eleven that evening, severe headache; nausea; muscle aches arms &amp; legs; and most serious two seizures (spasms??) about 5 seconds apart.  I?ve only had a few muscle cramps in my life so the seizures were unusual to say the least. They started in my lower abdomen (seemed like a small band going full circle around my body) and moved incrementally up towards my shoulders.  Rapid movement upward...kinda like squeezing a tube of toothpaste. Each one was only about two seconds long but fairly violent. If I had anything in stomach, it would have been on the floor.  Everything was gone (except the sore shoulder) by five in the morning.

I woke up at 02:00 AM in sweat and when I tried to walk the vertigo was so bad I couldn&#39;t walk. was disoriented and very nauseous. Was not improving and was taken by ambulance to ER.  Given medication IV and orally, slowly improved enough to go home by 11:00 AM. Still dizzy on March 16th and occasional bouts of vertigo. I seem to be slowly omproving.

                                                I suffered a heart attack on March 11, 2021, at approx 145pm, while sitting at my desk - WFH.  My symptoms were sweats, nausea, followed by chest pains beginning on the left side of my chest; sweats and nausea subsided for approx 1 hr, returning again, followed by chest pains radiating  the across the full chest approx.  I left my desk at the onset to wash my face, returning to my desk to talk a scheduled phone call at 2pm, lasting until 3pm.  I left desk to walk outside to take in some fresh air, my wife ask me if I was ok, I said no.  She ask if I was having a heart attack, to which I replied, I don&#39;t know.  shortly there after we left for the ER at arriving approx 4pm.  At that point ER staff did a quick assessment, taking my to an ER patient room where i was advised by the attending Dr that they thought I was having a heart attack.  Shortly thereafter I was taking to the Cath lab where a stent was insert and then taken to ICU.  Where I remained until I was released on 3/12/2021 at 3pm.  There was no detectable heart damage and I was placed a regime of blood thinner, a beta blocker and cholesterol med.  I do not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or history of heart problems.  My last physical was Feb 2021.

Had the runs that evening and night - a lot of water came out. Friday temperature back to normal and no runs. Treatment was to take Tylenol, turn up heat, get under extra blankets and sleep/rest as much as possible. Only drank water and grapefruit juice, and only ate clementines (didn&#39;t want to eat anything else until Thursday afternoon).

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                A week after my second Moderna vaccine shot, I started to experience pain in my abdomen area  under the skin surface.  The pain became progressively worse. I thought I had shingles but no rash or blisters.  I took a blood test on 3/30/21 and it was negative on shingles.   I was examined by a doctor on 3/31/21 and she is scheduling  an appointment with a neurologist at the local hospital, due to inflammation of my spinal chord.  She said she wants to rule out transverse myelitis.

                                                My first Covid-19 vaccination was on February 2, 2021. I had little or no side effects with pain at  the exception of pain at the injection site, and minor body aches for two days.  My second Covid-19 vaccination was on March 5, 2021. I experienced a terrible headache, nausea, bodyaches, slight fever, and chills. These symptoms lasted for 3-4 days.  A couple days later I began to hear a hissing sound in my right ear. There is nothing I can do to eliminate  it, and it continues today.  Sometimes it?s soft, and sometimes it?s very loud, but always constant. I reported it to my family doctor on March 23, 2021.

                                                I should point out that I donated a pint of blood 2 hours before getting my Moderna shot. I thought it would 27 hours before the shot but after donating the pharmacy called and said they had vaccine available if we wanted to move  up getting our shots right then 24 hours before our appointment.  8 hours later,  at 3:00am I got up to go to the bathroom. I immediately started feeling nauseous and light headed. I ended up collapsing and falling flat on my back. I immediately started shivering and shaking along with the nausea. For the next 12 hours I was extremely weak and my joints severely ached. It was very hard to move.   The total experience lasted roughly 18 hours before I started feeling significantly better.  Before donating blood I asked the if getting the Moderna Covid shot 27 hours (I thought 27 hours at that time) after donating would be a problem .  They said no. We asked the pharmacist before getting the shot if donating blood 2 hours earlier would be a problem. She thought naught and said she had no guidance against it.  I?m a very very healthy 67 year old. I rarely get sick and I have no prescriptions.  Complicating my blood donation was that my pulse was 44 beats per minute but my good health allowed them to proceed.  I?m not complaining about anyone or anything. I just thought you should be advised of my experience.

                                                DEATH!  About 24 hours after getting his 2nd Moderna Covid-19 shot, patient got deathly ill with explosive vomiting and diarrhea. Not long later he was passing out.  Paramedics were called, and he was taken to the hospital where he passed away from a massive heart attack. The doctors gave him clot-busting drugs in an attempt to save him.  He has never had problems with blood clots in his life.  He was the healthiest one of us all,  and was almost never sick. The doctor said that it was probably no coincidence that he died so soon after receiving his Covid shot. I am convinced that they are connected.  A healthy man suddenly gets blood clots in his heart 24 hours after getting his shot?  Not a coincidence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

Friday evening he felt better and was oddly animated and somewhat manic.  Early Saturday morning the symptoms returned and lasted through Monday afternoon, then the manic behavior set in again along with a sense that he was better.  He wasn&#39;t; by bed time Monday he was down again.  Same for Tuesday.  Saw the doctor Tuesday at noon, was prescribed an anti-nausea medication and submitted to blood work that found nothing abnormal.  This is Tuesday evening and he is still not feeling right, day 6 of symptoms.   I have never seen him so sick and miserable and weak.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 in December 2020. Concomitant products included FLUOXETINE HYDROCHLORIDE (PROZAC) for an unknown indication.   On 19-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 23-Apr-2021, the patient experienced URINARY RETENTION (he couldn&#39;t pee) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DECREASED APPETITE (low appetite), PRESYNCOPE (he thought he may pass out), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (severe headache every time he got up), NAUSEA (feel sick to his stomach but never vomited), PYREXIA (low grade fever) and FATIGUE (tired). On 23-Apr-2021, DECREASED APPETITE (low appetite) had resolved. On 25-Apr-2021, URINARY RETENTION (he couldn&#39;t pee), PRESYNCOPE (he thought he may pass out), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (severe headache every time he got up), NAUSEA (feel sick to his stomach but never vomited), PYREXIA (low grade fever) and FATIGUE (tired) had resolved.            The reporter stated, the patient had similar side effect from what he had from the 1st dose.  Additional concomitant medications included Blood pressure pills, Cholesterol pills and maybe back pain pill. Treatment medication included Tylenol.  Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, headache, pyrexia, fatigue and nausea are consistent with the product safety profile.      Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 26-Apr-2021: An additional document received on 26 Apr 2021 has information Upgraded case to serious, updated suspect product details, concomitant medication, treatment medication and event details.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

It felt like the front door to the house was, but I was in my bedroom  and it wasn&#39;t. Then it seemed like curtains were falling around me.  Next, I thought I saw stars in my bedroom ceiling and my wife circling around, but she wasn&#39;t. This lasted about two nights.  The remainder of the symptoms I think lasted about 4 days or 5 days.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Co-suspect product included non-company product IBRUTINIB (IMBRUVICA) capsule for Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.    No Medical History information was reported.   On 10-Apr-2019, the patient started IBRUTINIB (IMBRUVICA) (Oral) 140 mg twice a day. On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 08-Jan-2021, the patient experienced COVID-19 (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Mucus discharge, Nauseous, COVID-19 recurrent) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and PNEUMONIA (pneomonia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced SECRETION DISCHARGE (Mucus discharge), COVID-19 (COVID-19 recurrent), NAUSEA (nausea), HEADACHE (headache) and MYALGIA (body ache). The patient was hospitalized from 08-Jan-2021 to 12-Jan-2021 due to COVID-19. On 13-Jan-2021, COVID-19 (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Mucus discharge, Nauseous, COVID-19 recurrent) and PNEUMONIA (pneomonia) was resolving. At the time of the report, SECRETION DISCHARGE (Mucus discharge), COVID-19 (COVID-19 recurrent), NAUSEA (nausea), HEADACHE (headache) and MYALGIA (body ache) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Computerised tomogram: normal (normal) Had CT scan 2 weeks ago, which is clean and clear.. On an unknown date, Coronavirus test: positive (Positive) Covid-19 test positive.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No relevant concomitant medication information provided.  Patient had COVID in January, was hospitalized for 5 days, lost his sense of smell and taste, which hasn&#39;t fully recovered, but is feeling better and still had fatigue. Patient had pneumonia with shortness of breath which is dissipating. Patient had taken Moderna covid vaccines, stated reactions with first time felt like he had covid again for a couple of days, and the second one gave him headaches and body aches for a day. Patient stated  his doctor says he did build up immunity from vaccine, noted from test. The medication was held when had covid for a week or two.   No relevant treatment medication information provided.  Based on the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273, the event (Covid-19) is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding these event (pneumonia and other events) has been provided at this time. However, it is not clear if COVID-19 and pneumonia occurred prior to 1st dose of mRNA-1273.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273, the event (Covid-19) is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

About three months later it was determined by cardiologists that I had suffered an SMI at that time and hadn&#39;t realized it. It was also determined that I was 80 - 90% blocked in the main artery which likely was  the culprit and two stents were implanted. I have no idea (nor do the doctors) if the vaccination was in any way related to the cardiac event, but I felt completed to report it due to the closeness in timing. I am currently on different medications and cardiac rehab therapy.

                                                Felt fine after injection, walked 5 miles home &amp; assured loved ones before going to bed that vaccination went fine with no side effects. After midnight I woke in the dark with many of the same symptoms as when I had COVID in March/April 2020: extreme allover body aches, terrible thirst, extreme weakness.  Next day (Wednesday) symptoms continued; too weak &amp; achy to watch all but the core parts of the inauguration; too uncomfortable to read or to concentrate on music or anything else.  Absolutely no appetite so I didn&#39;t eat.  Wednesday night I tossed &amp; turned all night with a chill that I couldn&#39;t lose even with the heaviest down comforter &amp; supplementary blankets.  That night &amp; the following day I also noticed a distorted sense of time, where hours seem to pass v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y.  On Thursday night two more symptoms appeared: a tremendous cough that I couldn&#39;t stop or assuage with the normal remedies (e.g., lozenges, tea with honey), and that kept me from falling asleep till dawn; and diarrhea (which was limited because I hadn&#39;t eaten since Monday dinner so I didn&#39;t have much food in my system).  The cough felt like it might develop into a sore throat (which had been my first symptom when I had COVID) but it never did.  Yesterday (Friday) I felt as if my symptoms (other than residual weakness) were abating, and Friday night I got a full night of unbroken sleep.  I awoke on Saturday morning with no symptoms, and felt well enough to challenge myself by attempting my usual 90-minute yoga/stretch workout, which proved to be no problem.  Now, at 4 pm on Saturday--about 100 hours after my shot--I feel fairly normal &amp; seem to have no further symptoms.  I do plan to lie low &amp; take things easy, and to have as little outside contact as possible between now and my second shot (scheduled for 2/16) in order to minimize the possibility of re-infection.

                                                My symptoms started at 1:15 am. I woke up with chills, shivering. I have an infrared thermometer to check temp,  no fever. I have an oxygen/pulse thing. My pulse was very high for me, it was in the high 90s and then it would occasionally go to 100-105 to 115 but then would go back down into the 90s and it stayed that way for approximately for 60-65 hours after the shot. It was all over the map, I even had some heart rates in the 40s-50s. Finally it broke after about 60-65 hours and it returned to normal. My normal resting heart rate is in the 60s-70s and occasionally in the 80s but never the 90s. On Saturday approximately 9:30 I had no appetite, I didn&#39;t want to eat anything, I felt like I was going to vomit and didn&#39;t eat anything but just felt nauseous.

My wife had to help me get out of the recliner and get dressed for our trip. Also I was very confused. I was a bit nauseous and did not want to eat.  My blood sugar was 226.  For the next 6 hours as we traveled, I had to pee every 30-45 minutes. I needed help getting in and out of the rest stops and the vehicle.  As we traveled I mostly slept. I did drink a little diet soda, but did not eat.  After the 6 hours of travel I felt a stronger and was able to get out of the car and into the houses by myself.  For the next 24 hours I felt week, ate very little and sugers ran high.

                                                Beginning about 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I started having really bad headaches, behind my eyes radiating to the back of the head. At about   15 hours post vaccine I had chills, fever. The chills and fever were bad enough that in addition to sleeping under two blankets I had to put on a thick fleece ?hoodie? and pulled the hoodie over my head. I developed about 48 hrs of nasal congestion, and some retrosternal chest pain. I had one episode of nausea with vomiting about 8:00 am the next morning. I had to take two 325 mg Tylenol every 4-6 hrs to deal with the headache and fever. The most severe symptoms of  headache and fever subsided in about 24 to 36 hrs after the vaccine was administered. I had a lot of fatigue for several days, along with aches and pains. It took me about 5 days to really start feeling normal again, but the fatigue lingered for a few more days.

                                                I started feeling fatigued on Sunday Feb 14. I started feeling this way in the afternoon. Next I felt like I had indigestion so I took some tums. At about 1:00am on Monday morning I woke up and felt really bad and thought I had indigestion so I tried to take some more tums and vomited. I was really weak and short of breath. I laid back down and tried to go to sleep but my heart felt like it was racing. Within an hour I was back up vomiting again with shortness of breath, weakness, heart racing. I tried to lay back down but within another hour I vomited again. This went on until 8:30am Monday morning. My pulse was everywhere. 97 to 112bpm. I was having chills all day and weak. I slept a lot Monday and also had diarrhea on Monday morning. I couldn&#39;t eat all of Monday and finally ate some soup on Tuesday. I am feeling much better today but still a little fatigued.

Took Tyenol and rest.  Taste and smell returned.  2/14/21 - 5 pm.  Was eating and had a sip of wine.  Felt like I was choking and had a strange sensation in the head.  Felt like I blacked out for 2 seconds and was drolling.  This is the only time that I have experienced this.

Total body aches, loss of appetite and loss of energy for next 60 hours.

                                                Symptoms:  2nd dose of COVID dose received on 4/2/21 at noon. He reports the following day early in the morning his symptoms started. They are very similar to the symptoms he had after his first vaccine. He reports body aches and upset stomach as his main symptoms. Also reports mild dizziness but that is improving. He states he at times is feeling anxious which makes his heart race and feels mildly short of breath. Denies new SOB with activity and is not feeling SOB right now. Does have medication to take for anxiety and this does help. He also states he is having bouts of confusion with what day it is, where he is, etc. RN notes pt does not sound confused on the phone and was able to verbalize name/DOB and answer questions appropriately. Advised to call 911 but patient declines. He states symptoms are worse at night and he would prefer to be seen in the office.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 in January 2021. Concurrent medical conditions included Pituitary apoplexy, Myelosuppression since January 2021, Thrombocytopenia since January 2021 and Leukopenia since January 2021. Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID), LIOTHYRONINE and CORTISONE for an unknown indication.   On 19-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (awake hallucinations) (seriousness criterion medically significant), ERYTHEMA (feet were red), CHILLS (shaking chills,teeth were chattering), MYALGIA (myalgia), ARTHRALGIA (arthralgia), NAUSEA (sever nausea), VOMITING (violent vomiting) and HEADACHE (headache). On 20-Mar-2021, the patient experienced EPISTAXIS (nose bleed when sneezed and coughed). On an unknown date, the patient experienced THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE UNEXPECTED (has not felt this good in years). On 20-Mar-2021, HALLUCINATION (awake hallucinations), ERYTHEMA (feet were red), CHILLS (shaking chills,teeth were chattering), MYALGIA (myalgia), ARTHRALGIA (arthralgia) and HEADACHE (headache) had resolved, NAUSEA (sever nausea) and VOMITING (violent vomiting) outcome was unknown. At the time of the report, EPISTAXIS (nose bleed when sneezed and coughed) and THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE UNEXPECTED (has not felt this good in years) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitants medications also included Fludroscortisone, Cabergoline, Pantoprazole, Aspirin 81mg, Testosterone Gel and Vitamin E.  No treatment information was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. This report also refers to a case of positive therapeutic effect.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

I must have slept at least 3 times my usual 6hrs/night both days. Also Friday and increasingly Saturday,  the injection site got much more swollen, hot and stiff than any other vaccination I have ever had. I wish I had been warned of this probability, I need to sleep on that arm due to reflux issues. Sunday morning I awoke with all health and energy back to normal. I will be sure to get my (reluctant) 2nd shot in the other arm.

                                                After 2 days of shaking chills, sweats, fever to 103, and myalgia, I had an acute and devastating flare of trigeminal neuralgia that left me unable to speak or swallow (due to pain) and with me dripping in sweat (again, due to the unbearable pain of the feeling of a razor blade slicing the underside and left side of my tongue) for 12 hours.  I got things under control by increasing the TEGRETOL dosage and adding gabapentin.  BP 125/75 P69 T99.0.  I have controlled this disease for 20 years and I never have had an event like this. I can only assume the inflammatory component of the reaction to the vaccine activated the neuralgia.

Sat down, and next thing I knew I has fainted (approx 7:45-8a).  Police were called, then First Aid Squad.  Very pale, sweaty and nauseous (threw up 2x).  Went to Hospital.  Was evaluated in the ED for approx 6 hrs, then transferred to a room for overnight observation.

Extreme dizziness (actually causing me to fall even when walking a few feet), extreme nausea (I think probably caused by the extreme dizziness), weakness, profound diaphoresis.  I was sick like I have never been in my life,  thought I might die, and when I was the most symptomatic actually wanted to die, I was so sick. Anyway, came on over about a 10 minute period gradually, and then was absolutely profoundly ill  for about 45 minutes. After about 1/2 hour or so was able to negotiate the 25 feet or so to my den couch, closed my eyes and lied down, with gradual relief coming and severe illness totally gone in about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. No return of any similar episode since. 24 hours later, still a little lethargic and mildly &#34;achey&#34; with some weakness, but not so bad and kind of what I was expecting.

Hepatitis; The patient presents with a low-grade temperature, which isn&#39;t unexpected given that he received his COVID-19 vaccine yesterday.  However, the patient complains of abdominal pain.  Lab work does show elevated bilirubin, alk-phos, AST and ALT.  The patient has no previous history of this.  I did obtain both CT and ultrasound imaging of the gallbladder, which shows no pathology.  Subsequently, the patient was reassessed.  He is ambulated.  He is steady on his feet.  He does not desaturate.  He has no subjective complaints while walking.  I discussed the patient&#39;s lab abnormalities with him.  The patient prefers to go home and follow up for lab retesting on Monday.  Patient was given strict return instructions.  He will return should he develop any new or worsening symptoms.  He is going to have his labs redrawn on Monday and follow shortly with his primary care provider.  Given the normal imaging studies, I do think that these findings are likely related to a reaction to his vaccination.  This was discussed at length with the patient.  Patient is discharged home in stable condition.

He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

Severe rash up neck, over the right ear, across right cheek, around right eye and across right side of nose. Our family doctor examined patient on Thursday, 2/25 and said it would get better on it&#39;s own. It continued to worsen and he was very ill with vomiting, low grade fever and chills. On Monday 3/1 he went to the ER was put on Kefflex antibiotics. The diagnosis was cellulitis.  After 7 days of treatment he is much better, the rash has dried up and only red scabs are left to heal.

                                                Approximately 10 days after the vaccination I began to develop muscle and joint pain on my left side. two days later I started to have problems breathing and the muscle pain, all on my left side, worsened. A day or two later I developed a fever of 102 and the muscle and joint pain became worse, again all on the left side of my body. To treat the fever I took Motrin, this also helped with the headache. I also had a lose of appetite as these symptoms progressed and lost about 7 pounds. I developed a cough that persisted for about 7 days. These symptoms were intense for about three days and persisted at varying intensity for about 10 days.

                                                Because of the absurd character limit in this field, I am putting my adverse reaction statement on the continuation page. About 10pm, about 9 hours post injection, I was feeling weak and fatigued.  I went to bed and was starting to feel chilled, but not shaking.  I hopped into bed and turned on my electric blanket in a room that was 75° (from passive solar house heating during the day) and wearing only a T-shirt, sweat shirt, and sweat pants.  The first post-vaccination symptom I experienced was when I laid down and my right upper arm (at the point of the injection) was very sore; it was too painful to lie on my right side.  The injection area felt hard. I fell asleep about 11pm and woke up about midnight; I am generally a very light sleeper, rarely sleeping more than ~3± hours (most less than) at a time.  At 1:30am, I could not sleep so I watched a recorded movie.  All the while, I was feeling progressively worse.  About 2:30am, I felt really chilled, so I cranked up the electric blanket to its highest setting and put on some heavy wool socks, a pair of long-johns under my sweat pants, put on another heavy sweatshirt over my existing sweatshirt, and placed another blanket on top of my electric blanket: very cold / chilled but not shivering.  The movie ended about 3am, and my stomach was excruciatingly aching.  I did not feel I could eat anything which I really felt a need to do, but was concerned that I would just vomit.  However, I did take two, 500mg Tylenol tablets with a half a glass of water.  I might have slept for an hour or so, but was quite restless.  I remember looking at the clock at 4:00am.  By 5am, it was considering calling 911; my stomach ached so badly.  It was then, that I had the feeling / recollection I had this &#34;illness&#34; before.  About 5:30am, my stomach symptoms started to ameliorate; by 7:30am, they were gone.  However, I still felt miserable.  I then wondered whether my stomach symptom was just a concomitant bout with &#34;stomach flu&#34; where I experienced (severe) abdominal cramps and pain; nausea; and low-grade fever.  I have had the stomach flu a limited number of times before and, after 6± hours, it all went away: I just had to suck it up in the meantime.  Before I filled out this report, I wanted to consider whether my stomach flu was a reaction to the vaccination or incidental to the vaccination.  However, after talking with my neighbors and my sister&#39;s friend, who also had the Moderna vaccination, three of the four &#34;victims&#34; had similar symptoms to me.  Thus, I deduced I did not have a bout with stomach flu.  Additionally, a dog walking partner, who is a rescue worker, also noted folks she knew also had similar symptoms with the Moderna vaccine.  I then started wondering what kind of artificial cocktail, a.k.a.: antifreeze, was the suspending medium for the vaccine.  If this has to be stored at absurdly low temperatures I commonly have negative reactions to artificial chemicals.  The minor surgeries I have had are uneventful but for the anesthesia chemical concoction I am given.  I commonly takes me more then 2-3 days to detoxify that and feel normal.&#39;  As in this case, I pretty much laid in bed for the next 2½ days, with no energy or desire to attend to personal issues, including walking my dogs.  However, my subclinical temperature was pretty much gone after the second day.  The notable soreness in my arm was mostly gone after two days, but the injection point was still sensitive to pressing on top of the injection site: I could still feel it.  I have a very high tolerance for pain and have never experienced anything like this.  &#34;Pain&#34; from flu, etc., shots rarely, if ever, lasts more than 10-15 minutes post injection.  There was definitely something in the suspension media that reacted with my body chemistry / biological processes.  I am NOT looking forward to the booster shot; most seem to have a reaction to the second shot that is worse than the first  unless their first shot was uneventful and the second shot had considerably milder reactions than my first shot.  The next time I will definitely have a bowl or two of jell-O in the refrigerator to help quell any (expected) gut reactions; jell-O has always been a comfort food for me in those situations. What a horribly designed survey.  This is next to impossible to complete online.  After timing out twice, I had to start over and opted to download the fillable form PDF.  Even then, I am not given the option to select the subdirectory _where_ it should be downloaded.  Fortunately, I saw the option to open it directly. If you are going to make the &#34;adverse reaction&#34; field so limited, relative to field size and the absurd online time limit, how can you expect meaningful, complete reporting of post-vaccination reactions?  This form CANNOT be fully completed in the time allotted without timing out.  This is, most certainly, a deterrent to adverse reaction reporting.  One has to wonder how many folks just gave up after getting timed out the first time. With this kind of disincentive, how good or complete or meaningful is the adverse data collection procedure?  Have you purged all the supporters?  They do not like real, accurate, objective data, particularly information that is not consistent what they want to believe or the narrative they want to spin.  No respectable scientist or decent journalist would accept third-rate data.  How can public interest decisions be made with a shoddy data collection effort?

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

                                                10 days fatigue has continued. My husband is a cross country and track coach and runner himself. He is very very fit so it is very unusual for him to not be outside doing major work in the yard or out running. Instead he does anything for a short period like 30 minutes and he comes in and goes to bed middle of day and retires to bed right after eating dinner even as early as 6 pm.  His appetite is less than usual.

Ten days later he awoke feeling dehydrated and drank some water which he immediately vomited back up. No food had been consumed. He then developed a cutting sore throat (as in the feeling of strep throat) and developed a fever of 101&#43; along with general joint aches. In about four hours the fever dropped abruptly along with the sore throat. Patient felt tired the rest of the day then awoke the next day feeling fine.

                                                Ninety minutes after the vaccination I came home and took first bite of food ( a small piece of meat). This seemed to stuck in my esophagus causing pain in the chest. I could not swallow even water and the pain (spasm) subsided in 15-20 min. I did not try to anyting else on that day and only rested. Next day (04/08/2021) a similar problem appeared when I tried to swallow the first bite of lunch. It felt as the piece got stuct in the middle of esophagus and I could not move it in any direction. The pain kept increasing for 20 min and a clear flegm came to my mouth probably from stomach and started to interfere with breathing. I managed to wash my mouth and physically remove most of the sticky flegm. I managed to rest

He states that he really didn&#39;t do anything for a couple days and his mental capabilities were affected. He states he received his vaccination thurs and fri morning he called his friend to have him check on him every couple hours since he just didn&#39;t feel right. His friend told him by 2pm that he had a hard time having a conversation with him as he was only able to get out a few words and they didn&#39;t make sense. He had shaking, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, staggered when he walked and really doesn&#39;t have much memory of friday. He states his friend called the walk in clinic to see if he should go in and was told those were just normal side effects. Patient believes he had covid in the past month as he had altered taste and his friend had covid and was hospitalized with similar sx. He states his sense of taste is back to the saltiness that it was when he had covid. He reports that still on day 4 post vaccine, he doesn&#39;t feel he is mentally at baseline and is struggling to pull words out. He plans to make an appointment to see his physician today.

                                                I woke up approximately Wednesday midnight with a tummy ache. I got out of bed a little woozy and proceeded to kitchen to have a bicarbonate of soda and blacked out and fell to the floor for a few seconds. I crawled to the bathroom for a bowel movement. I then went back to the kitchen for the bicarb walking at this time. Still a little woozy but okay. Went back to bed, realizing the area of the shoulder was very sore. Much more so than 1st shot. Very restless night. No treatment necessary.

I will not follow guidelines that are against my best judgment for right or wrong.   I knew better then to get the second vaccine so quickly.  There was no research that indicated this was the optimum time frame.   The only justification was what was done during the trials, which was to rush it to market and garner the highest efficacy numbers.   As seen here, the outcome was anything but mild side effects and they continue.

                                                02/11/2021 - Stomach upset, a change to my sense of taste in that many foods taste different than  before, some common foods now taste bad to the point of being unable to eat it anymore including some favorites, this has not returned to normal yet. 02/22/2021 Woke up to the pain of broken ribs on  right side, a pinched nerve running down right arm, shortness of breath to the point that a  moderate breath hurt. These symptoms began to subside the next day lasting four and a half days except shortness of breath that lingered for two weeks and still is not fully restored. As you can see  by the dates these reactions happened at two different dates.

                                                The day after I received the vaccine I had all the usual symptoms except throwing up.  What I want to report is this last week I had a re-occurring bout, but this time it was much worse and lasted for two days.  I had 100.5 fever, could not stand up without passing out and threw up.  In addition my blood pressure was dropping.  I was concerned about it happening again as I had not heard this was possible.  Am doing fine now.

                                                I am a Covid survivor (March 2020) still with antibodies (at least I had them last November when I donated plasm). The morning after I received the Moderna injection (Tuesday), I had a fever of 99 and diarrhea. My fever rose during the day and I had chills. By 9:00 PM my temperature peaked at 102.4. I was taking Tylenol (1000 grams?) every 6 hours. The diarrhea, chills and fever all subsided during the night, so that on Wednesday morning, my fever was back to 99. It  did not rise during the day and was back to normal Wednesday evening. The chills and diarrhea never returned.

                                                2/16/2021:  Telephone call to PCP/DR: I.  This is all a little strange. Especially with the fever. I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.

His wife called saying that he went to the emergency room for severe pain in his left hand and swelling he could not hang on to anything.   The pain started on Friday and kept getting worse all weekend . The er told him that it was carpel tunnel and gave him a wrist splint.

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the vaccine I started to feel pressure to have a bowel movement.  It came on suddenly.  While on the toilet I felt a little nauseous.  For a minute or so, I thought I was going to throw up as well.  The nausea passed after a few minutes, but I felt very fatigued.  Got home and have been laying down.  It&#39;s now 5:20pm, 3 hours later, I&#39;m feeling better, but still a little tired.  I have a slight &#34;flu like&#34; feeling that I feel &#34;off&#34;.  I blessed with good health but I feel a little &#34;off kilter&#34;.  I thinking I&#39;ll feel better tomorrow.

Rolled back onto my back, let my head clear, turned to my right, and got dizzy again.  Felt nauseous, but did not vomit.  Problem was worse with eyes closed than with eyes open.  Spent most of the day  in bed.  Vertigo slightly better on day 2 after vaccination, took Dramamine after consult with doctor.  Much better on day 3.  Essentially back to normal on day 4, but do experience slight dizziness upon waking before getting out of bed.

My primary care phuysician recoemneded that I go to ER on 2/23/21 to have Cat Scan (negative), EKG (normal), blood work (normal except high glucose reading). ER doctor diagnosis was peripheral vertigo not central and discharged me with recomendation to take OTC meclizine twice daily. The spinning side effect has virtually disappeared, still some lightheaded feeling and persistent equilibrium./balance problems exist that prevemt from me driving and performing most daily activities. My Chiropractor has prefromed the  Epley Maneuver twice now but has had very little impact on my equilibrium and balance issues, I have an appointment with a specialist Nuerotologist on March 10, 2021

However, every day, he got weaker and weaker. He has been treated for Liver cancer, he received his first infusion of Opdivo almost 4 weeks before the vaccination.  About 7 days after the shot, he was having trouble swallowing so he went to the ER to get a CT scan. He was found to have greatly elevated troponins, the DR was baffled he wasn?t having any chest pain; they were apparently not trending either., he has never had a heart attack or any other heart problems, takes Nadolol for high blood pressure. The CT scan showed significant growth of his tumors  which had been stable for a year and the last CT scan was the end of January; liver enzymes were also significantly elevated whereas they were stable before.  My father deteriorated rapidly, and died on 3/18/21. The day he got the shot just prior, he was hauling wood, shoveling snow and living a normal life feeling good. The day after the shot he could barely get out of bed he was so weak, until he finally died 16 days later.

He took Tylenol every 4-5 hrs. &amp; stayed in bed. By Sunday his fever slowly started to go down.  And by the following  Mon. morning, 3/8/21, his fever was gone.  He felt weak but otherwise well enough to perform normal day-to-day activities/work.  12 days after that, on 3/20/21, he developed the exact same symptoms &amp; went to bed immediately &amp; took appropriate Tylenol.  His fever, this time, only went to just under 100.  He is scheduled for his second shot on 4/2/21.  Should he get it?  If not, what does he do???

                                                Patient is a 70 y.o. male w/ h/o CHF,HTN, sleep apnea on CPAP and 2 L O2 at night, IDDM, CKD stage III-IV, prior tested positive for SARS-CoV2 (12/2020) presented to SAMC ED w/ the complaint of SOB.    Pt states he received his 2nd dose of Moderna SARS-CoV2 immunization 4 days prior to arrival and developed SOB since then. He states that the SOB progressed and included coughing productive of bloody/blood-tinged sputum. The main reason he decided to come to the hospital was because of his shortness of breath and associated chest tightness which he says radiated into his abdomen.    In the ED he was found to have new RBBB and troponin 7.2. He was seen by cardiology d/t concern for NSTEMI, started on heparin gtt, and taken to the cath lab. There he was found to have RCA lesions x2: the more proximal underwent stent placement, the more distal lesion was unable to be stented. Post-procedure pt&#39;s respiratory status was tenuous and therefore CCM was consulted. Patient discharged 9 days after admission after somewhat rocky course of recovery.

                                                On 3/24 by 9:25 PM I had mild shakes. At about 10:00 PM my lips stared to tingle and become numb. Subsequently I began to have difficulty swallowing as well as experiencing some sub sternal pain. Went to get my Epipen and put it beside me in bed. Difficulty swallowing got a bit worse but as I was not experiencing shortness of breath I held off the Epinephrine injection. (What on earth was I thinking?!)The &#34;semi anaphylaxis&#34; was self limiting and by 11:00 PM symptoms had subsided completely. But by approximately 11:30 MP I had severe rigors lasting about 3 - 5 minutes. On 3/25 I developed a severe headache and a low grade T (T-max 99.9). Took Tylenol 825mg with good effect. The following night I had severe night sweats, drenching 3 sets of pajamas. Today, on 3/26 I have been experiencing several cold sweats and I am altogether feeling &#34;strange&#34; (can&#39;t put my finger on it - maybe dehydration?). Have vegan to aggressively hydrate. Notified my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office. Agreed to &#34;ride it out&#34; for now. Shall see my PPP on

ED physician note states &#34;70 y/o male with pmhx of CAD, CVA, HTN, DM, myopathy and DVT on  Xarelto presents to ED with complaints of generalized weakness and change in mental status onset yesterday. Patient received his COVID vaccine yesterday and since then, patients wife is concerned he is not behaving himself and appears confused. Wife is also concerned he has a deceased appetite and decreased PO intake. Patient has no complaints at this time. Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain and back pain. HPI is limited due to patients mental status.&#34;  4/3/2021 when being scheduled for follow-up dose on 4/7/2021 his wife informed us &#34;He had a bad reaction  to the first dose of the vaccine, had to go to the hospital, was admitted and had to stay for 3 days does not want the 2nd dose.&#34;  4/3/2021 Dr (one reporting) checked system and talked to wife to obtain this history. Agreed with her that he should not receive the second dose due to how badly he felt after the first. In addition, his prior history of COVID likely gives him sufficient protection against COVID-19.

Pt has a sore arm, his face is  flushed, he feels tired and nauseous.  He says he feels as if he is starting to get the flu.  Pt is lying in bed today. He does not want to walk around. (He had woken up at 3am this morning and took the bandage off  because it was itching).

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (no medical history provided.).    On 15-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DIZZINESS (dizziness) and NAUSEA (nausea). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body) and RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (patient collapsed and taken to emergency department), HYPOTENSION (low blood pressure), DEPRESSION (becoming depressed), DIZZINESS (dizziness), INSOMNIA (difficulty sleeping due to rash), PRURITUS (felt itchy on the inside of the body), RASH (rash that covered his arms, upper torso, shoulders and went down the back/rash developing on face and neck) and NAUSEA (nausea) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   A pharmacist suggested the patient take Children&#39;s Benadryl followed by Zyrtec to help with the itching. These medicines have not helped alleviate his intense itching. On 1Apr2021, the patient collapsed and was taken to the emergency department. The patient was treated at the emergency department after he collapsed from low blood pressure. He was prescribed Hydroxyzine HCI 10mg for the itching by the emergency room physician, but the medicine has done nothing to alleviate the patient&#39;s symptoms.  Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Ras and nausea are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the reported events of vaccination site reaction, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                The day after my second shot I got a fever and felt run down through that day, that evening I developed diarrhea which lasted until the following day. All of this I expected from what I had heard that some people have after the second shot. But what I didn&#39;t expect was from then until now which has been approximately 6 weeks I am cramped and my lower abdomen everyday and I&#39;m also experiencing atrial fibrillation almost constantly which I&#39;ve never done before. All my episodes with a fib in the past were due to times when I had been very nauseous or very cramped and would go into a fib which lasted 10 12 hours but for the last 12 years I&#39;ve been on atenolol for that and it has kept me from experiencing those problems. But since the second shot I&#39;m experiencing atrial fibrillation like I said every day with the cramping which I&#39;ve never had before to that extent. I&#39;m reporting this because something isn&#39;t quite right and if this is a coincidence it&#39;s a pretty good one. Thank you for reading this and if I can be of any further help please feel free to contact me through my email.

Following the injection, and within 24 hours, I began experiencing severe vasovagal, with severe bloating, severe headaches, severe weakness and mental cloudiness.  It is difficult, and at times virtually impossible to urinate and defacate.  Any tissues with columnar linings are severely swollen, from the eustachian tubes to trachea and esophagus, including all intestinal organs.  In fact all organ systems are involved.  It is very painful, and has forced my retirement from practice, as I cannot provide the care that is needed for my patients.  Severe fatigue continues, with severe headaches, cloudiness, inability to concentrate.

On an unknown date, the patient experienced deficit in the cranial nerves 4, 6, 9, 10, 11,12 after been vaccinated with 1st dose of Moderna Vaccine and difficulty with mouth which resulted in him biting his tongue. The patient&#39;s tongue deviates to the right, double vision, difficulty swallowing (swallow test was negative). Physical Exam, CTA to rule dissection (result was negative), Stroke tests were negative. MRI with/without contrast of the brain &amp; upper spinal cord which was conducted twice and the results were normal. the patient is undergoing a neurophysiology count (result is pending)  The patient experienced CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES MULTIPLE (cranial nerve deficit  4, 6,9, 10, 11, 12) (seriousness criterion medically significant), TONGUE PARALYSIS (tongue deviation to right) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIPLOPIA (double vision), TONGUE BITING (tongue biting) and DYSPHAGIA (difficulty swallowing).

                                                This was the Moderna vaccine, which I had reaction to the first shot on 2/27/21.  I had listlessness, fatigue, cold/flu symptoms, etc.  With the second shot on 3/29/21, I didn&#39;t seem to have as much of a reaction, but then I started getting diarrhea, and a flare in my Crohn&#39;s.  Since then I have had abdominal spasms, bleeding (as if I was on blood thinners), increased bowel urgency, several bowel accidents, stomach pain, and severe fatigue.  I have contacted my doctor for assistance in my treatment but thought I should report this in case it was a response to the vaccine.

                                                Monday night pt. became ill, threw up and had a fever.  He went to bed, but around 11 pm he woke up disoriented, unable to walk.  Was helped to the bathroom, but was unable to get back to bed on his own.  Fell on his bottom.  I had to call our son to come pick him up and help him back to bed, unable to hold his own weight..  Had trouble sleeping.  Abt 1 pm needed help getting up again, same disorientation, also fell off the toilet and needed help getting back to the bed, unable to hold his own weight.  Finally fell asleep.  Next day seemed fine enough. Tuesday night, became ill again, went to bed.  Got up to go to the bathroom, was wobbly, but able to make it.  Was helped back, wobbly but able to walk. Trouble falling asleep, fever, chills.  Finally fell asleep at 3 am Wed morning.  I had to go to the doctor early, so left him sleeping in bed.  When I came back around 11 am, he was still sleeping, snoring loudly.  Became concerned.  Wouldn&#39;t wake up.  Called Paramedics.  CT scan at the hospital revealed a brain bleed.  Transported to hospital. Put on support for almost 2 weeks.  No progress, no response.  Finally support was discontinued and he died April 19th at 7:52 pm.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Gastroesophageal reflux disease in 2020.   On 20-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced OESOPHAGEAL ACHALASIA (Diagnosed with Achalasia) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ABNORMAL LOSS OF WEIGHT (He also lost about 40 pound), CHILLS (Chills), PYREXIA (Fever) and VOMITING (Throwing up Has trouble keeping food and water down). At the time of the report, OESOPHAGEAL ACHALASIA (Diagnosed with Achalasia), ABNORMAL LOSS OF WEIGHT (He also lost about 40 pound), CHILLS (Chills), PYREXIA (Fever) and VOMITING (Throwing up Has trouble keeping food and water down) outcome was unknown.            Concomitant product use was not reported. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event(s); therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event(s) is not applicable. The causality assessment was not provided.  Patient called on 03MAY2021 to report that on 20JAN2021 he received his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine and 23FEB2021 he received his 2nd dose. After the 2nd dose he experienced chills, fever and had been throwing up. He said he had been having trouble keeping food and water down and it has gotten worse. He also lost 40 pounds. Patient saw a gastroenterologist and had tests done April, 2021. The specialist said patient&#39;s esophagus is not functioning well and diagnosed him with Achalasia. Patient is scheduled for further consultation and potential surgery in August 2021 with a Specialist. Patient also stated he had GERDS Reflux about a year ago (2020).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The next morning I also began experiencing nausea accompanied by stomach growling.  For the next 5 days or so I experienced all of the above.  On day 6  the diarrhea was replaced by constipation.  By day 9 or so the diarrhea and constipation ended but all of the other symptom--nausea, mild stomach pain and stomach growling persisted.  During week number four I went to my above health care provider and also reported my vaccination reactions to the pharmacy where I received the shot (Publix).

                                                On February 8th, 2021, I developed a severe case of shingles on my right chest and back.  I visited my physician on February 11th  and he prescribed an after-the-fact  antiviral drug (10 day course of treatment).  Today, May 22, 2021, I am still experiencing residual pain from the shingles.  In addition, I have developed irritation of my stomach which has not yet been diagnosed.  It is my belief that this stomach problem is directly related to the shingles outbreak:  two days before I noticed the shingles sores, I experienced a severe stomach upset w/belching, as well as flashes of fever; this lasted approximately two or three hours.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.   After the expected fatigue, dysphoria and sleepiness from 12 hours to c. 36 hours after inoculation, I recovered in timely manner, but noticed my lower bowel with some gas, which terminated and eased with one episode of diarrhia on the third day after inoculation.  There was an unusual odor from the feces only then.  This occurred within my usual dietary regimen.  I did not experience any upper tract or gastric unpleasantness.  I did not have loss of appetite except as resulting from the general dysphoria of the immune response.        This response was mild and cleared quickly, but I thought it might be of interest; as it has never been mentioned publicly that I have heard.

                                                Patient received first dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on 1/28/2020.  Due to his history of allergies and asthma, he took a dose of diphenhydramine 25mg (either 1 tablet or 2 tablet - patient is unsure) prior to receiving the first dose of the vaccine. He waiting for 30 minutes of observation afterwards.  He did not have any problems other than a sore arm after the dose. The patient returned for his second dose of the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on 2/25/2020.  He forgot to take a dose of diphenhydramine prior to coming in for his second dose of the vaccine.  He sat for the 30 minutes of observation with no issues.  He drove home and after arriving home, 1 hour after receiving the dose, he started having a strange feeling around his mouth and tongue which moved from the right to left side.  He then took two doses of diphenhydramine 25 mg.  Then he started having difficulty swallowing so went to a Prompt Care.  The staff there called an ambulance and he took an ambulance. In the ED, the physicians examined him and didn&#39;t find any issues with his throat.  They noticed his left earlobe was bright red.  They administered a high dose of steroid and observed him for 3 hours.  The patient does not know the name of the steroid or dose received.  The patient states that he felt normal again after 1.5 hours after receiving the steroid injection.  The patient was discharged back home and has not had any issues since.

Developed bad headache which prevented sleeping. The next day, it seemed this was over, but still had no appetite and in the evening the shaking and shivering resumed. Developed another bad headache that prevented sleeping again. Next morning  (today) still no appetite and continued to feel cold. Have eaten some even with no appetite, so I could take ibuprofen which seemed to help a bit.

It settled after a while but came back somewhat less after breakfast but then resulted in vomitting. Repeat settling and return, vommitting after lunch. Found symptoms faded on and off but no more vomitting Friday. Unsteady walking due to imbalance. Saturday, more spinning but no vomiting. Sunday it seemed to resolve so long as I didn&#39;t look down or to my left while lying down. Monday mild imbalance so I visited my PCP,  who said it was likely BPPV, prescribed meclazine for the vertigo, and gave order for a physical therapist which I scheduled for Monday, 3/22/21 which was the earliest available appointment. Friday, 3/19, no problem

I did not drink enough fluids, became dehydrated, and after 5:00 pm collapsed and was taken to a hospital for rehydration and tests.  The failure to remain hydrated was my error.

I was in a hospital for two days, but mostly for testing about potential cardiovascular issues (since I have 7 stents).

                                                Intense pain in the left Kidney.  It was equivalent to the pain I suffered when I had a compound fracture of my tibia and fibula.  It was so intense that I thought I had a kidney stone or infection.  We called the ambulance and the EMT, after checking my vital signs, thought it was from the vaccine. I also throw up quite a bit.  It was the first time I threw up since 1985.  The pain was hovering between a eight to 10 for about four hours.  After applying heat to the left Kidney it subsided to a five.  It was not until 4:00 am that I was pain free though still sore in the left kidney. The soreness continues.

                                                I developed severe, debilitating vertigo (extreme dizziness and nausea ), that lasted from 5:00 PM on Sunday 3/28/21 until 5:00 AM Monday 3/29/21 . My PCP suggested that I go to the hospital ER  that morning (3/29) where I spent about three hours. I was diagnosed with benign vertigo and was found to have a low potassium level. I experienced similar, but milder symptoms for about two weeks thereafter. The mild (but unpleasant)  symptoms continue to reoccur perhaps once/week.   I experienced similar but much milder symptoms following my second Moderna shot on 3/10/21.

                                                Began having nausea / upset stomach or stomach ache, and often pain behind and/or below sternum .  The symptoms would come and go daily for about 8 weeks and last for about  one to three hours each time, sometimes before mealtimes.  Would often be gone after a meal.  As of today, 5/21 I still have the stomach ache once in a while.      The morning after the first shot, I awoke with a severe stiff neck all the way around.  I&#39;ve had the stiff neck every day so far.  After 7 weeks I went to a chiropractor for 6 treatments over about 6 weeks with little relief.  As of today the stiff neck is about 60 % better.

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

                                                Patient presented with sharp right lower quadrant abdominal pain with associated nausea and emesis beginning the day he received the COVID vaccine, after vaccine injection. He had decreased appetite and pain was made worse by eating.  He presented to the hospital 3 days (2/6/21) after receiving the vaccine/symptom onset. His vital signs were T 101.5, HR 78, BP 156/67, RR 20, SpO2 94 on RA.   As discussed below, imaging showed acalculous cholecysitis. The day after presentation, pain was more localized to RUQ.  He was treated with IV ceftriaxone and flagyl. He underwent percutaneous cholecystomy tube place on 2/7/21 with plan for delayed cholecystectomy following drain placement x 6 weeks. Bile fluid culture has been no growth. We are attempting to test bile fluid for COVID-19 via PCR.   He tested positive for COVID-19 via nasal swab RT-PCR and developed a 3L oxygen requirement and mild dyspnea. He was treated with remdesivir and dexamathasone 2/6-2/10 with resolution of hypoxia and dyspnea.

                                                I received my 2nd Covid vaccine (Moderna) on Tues 2/16. On Wednesday my left knee (the last the replacements) was very sore and felt weak. On Thursday the knee didn&#39;t get any worse but my lower back and shoulders were sore. On Friday, there wasn&#39;t much change. On Saturday the knee seemed to stabilize and the back and shoulders were tolerable. On Sunday, my stomach was queasy. On Monday, sore joints and queasy stomach. On Tuesday, sore joints especially anything injured back in time, diarrhea started. On Wednesday upset stomach, just a piece of toast to eat, diarrhea, chills, sore joints everywhere, miserable. Thursday was the same as Wednesday plus I vomited twice in the evening with sweats and a 101.1 temperature which went back down. I was miserable. I slept well last night and feel better this morning. The diarrhea seems be abating. I feel like I&#39;ve turned the corner this morning but wanted to mention due to the vaccine shot as a possible cause.

On 3/5/21 at 3:00 am woke from sleep with extreme chills, goosebumps on the skin, and physically shaking to warm up. I had on the bed a sheet, quilt, and heavy comforter. I used the toilet to urinate and was not sure that I could walk back to my bed due to nausea and weakness. After resting, I placed another wool blanket on the bed on top of the comforter. Eventually, I began to warm up. Nausea and fever continued.  Muscles and joints ached. I slept on and off until 7:00 am. I did not eat any breakfast due to continuing nausea. I drank coffee, sat in my reclining chair most of the morning. at 12:00 noon, I ate a bowl of potatte and chicken soup.  My tempereature at this time was 99.5. I did sleep in the afternoon. Later in the evening my temperture had gone down to 99.  Today, 3/06/21 at 8:00am, I feel normal, tired but normal.

I don&#39;t remember when exactly the fever started, but it last until the 36th hour after the vaccination.  It was 101.3 most of the time.  101.7 was the high point.  I also had stomach pain at that time.  After 3 days I was fine.  With the 1st shot I also had a sore arm, but not this bad.  I also ran a fever, but it was around 100 then.

Also had some abdominal cramping, which I often have due to colitis so probably unrelated to vaccine.

Temperature of 98.7 in morning. Not medicated.

Went to the doctor at a walk in clinic on 02/24/21 because I had high fever and nausea and weakness for about 10 hours. I got an infected tooth(root canal and crown on this tooth) and an infected jaw. Dentist put me on antibiotics and I have to have the tooth pulled. I went to the dentist on 02/11/2021.

He got the second dose on 3/16/21 and after 10-12 hours had fatigue, myalgias and nausea which resolved within 10-12 hours.  HOWEVER, one week after second dose, on 3/23/21, my husband took a shower and noticed shortly thereafter around 8 AM a itchy rash on face and neck.  NO rash over Vaccine Site.  Over the day the rash got more intensely red and noticed blotches over his upper chest (symmetrical oval patches just beneath each nipple region).  He took 2 Benadryl Tabs at night and in morning of 3/24 the rash has improved considerably..  The rash was macular and erythematous and never raised with no blistering.   His first dose of Moderna was on 2/16/21 and lot number was 011M20M.

Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

                                                Fourteen days after the second dose I had chills, fever, body aches, headache, and nausea followed by sever diarrhea.  After two days without much improvement I contacted  the  nurse who referred me to the on call doctor.  She recommended Immodium over the counter and GatorAde.  Also, she advised me to get a covid 19 test.  Results still unknown.   My concern is the delayed reaction and severity when the stated norm is 2 to 4 days after the second shot.

                                                death Narrative: Patient passed away on April 13, 2021 at home at 1810 He was 72 years old had severe aortic stenosis and hypertension and had an aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at hospital on Jan 20, 2021. He was readmitted to hospital for shortness of breath which was evaluated from Feb 19 - Feb 21, 2021 I spoke with his daughter today. She was with him at home when he went to the bathroom and since he had not come out for some time, she knocked on the door and found him collapsed in the bathroom. She called 911, who did CPR, however he had passed away. He was referred to the coroner. He had his first Moderna vaccine on March 15, 2021 after which he had not had any side effects. He received his second dose on April 12, 2021 and had not mentioned any side effects other than mild abdominal discomfort. Daughter said his shortness of breath had been improving after his discharge from the hospital. He had not complained of chest pain, cough, fever, diarrhea, in the last few days. I paid condolences to daughter and told here we would be reviewing the case to see if there was any relationship to him receiving the Covid19 vaccine and that the case had already been referred to the coroners office.

                                                Got 2nd Moderna shot. 8 days later got extremely dizzy, felt pain all over body, threw up. Taken to hospital . Given blood transfusion that worked. Spent  5 days in ICU; 2 days in regular hospital room. NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT VACCINE CAUSED IT. Doctors say unlikely but possible so I felt I should report it since it was so close in time to getting vaccine and I never had those problems before. Blood pressure got so low that doctors say I would have died without the transfusion.      After 1st Moderna shot (Jan. 15,2021) had only slightly dizzy, heart rate increased significantly and blood pressure went very high. All of those 1st shot issues went away in about half an hour. Serious problems only occurred after 2nd shot. Scarred to get booster next year unless doctors find that vaccine was not the cause of problem.

                                                I had the Covid-19  virus in late November until late December 2020.  I was very sick with all the symptoms and finally tested negative about 6 weeks after getting the virus and testing positive 3 times in that period.  I took my first shot in early March and had the typical side effects, but they lasted for 3 days:  After my second shot I had uncontrollable shivering, chills, headache, vomiting, nausea, weakness and fatigue for 2 days.  I was so sick from it that I was pretty scared at the time. It was the intitial reaction from it that was horrible and occurred 5 hours after the shot and lasted all night long.

                                                I had a severe reaction to the first shot.  I had Covid in Dec 2019 before it was suppose to be here.  Last summer I developed a bad reaction to bee stings.  After the first Covid shot I felt my whole body tingling after about ten minutes.  I gave myself epicenter shot when I got to my truck.  The next morning after breakfast I threw up and slept for about 6 hours.  The severe tingling in hands, feet, and necklace and face woke me up.  I gave myself a second epipen shot within 30 hours.    I called my doctor to have epipens refilled.  He told me I should have gone to hospital the next day for fluids.  My doctor told me not to take the second shot for the possibility of three days in hospital for fluids, chance of lung or brain injury or the most drastic reaction could be I would have a fatal anaphalegic reaction.  For these reasons I called to cancel my second appointment

                                                MY REACTION TO THE FIRST DOSE: In March of 2020 I suffered Covid pneumonia and was on oxygen and too weak and short of breath to work for three months.  It took over seven months to return my breathing and strength to baseline. I just checked my lab and I still have IgG antibodies and a negative nasal screen for the virus. One month ago at 9 AM I received the Moderna Vaccine.  About 12 hours later I developed shaking chills and a fever of about 103, pain in my arm from the injection, and severe cough and a VERY WATERY RUNNY NOSE with severe post nasal drip which caused aspiration of the discharge.   I took Tylenol, Afrin Nasal Spray, and a Dulera inhaler and fell asleep.  I woke up at 3 AM and felt well, but at 4 AM I developed an intolerable intractable cough and severe watery nasal discharge lasting about two hours and severe dry heaves from the aspiration.  Afrin nasal spray helped somewhat but I was absolutely miserable for  two hours.    Three days ago I received the one month booster for the Moderna Vaccine at 10AM.   My arm began to become painful but it was tolerable and not relieved by Tylenol. Every time I rolled over at night the pain woke me up but I was able to tolerate it.  Yesterday I woke up with severe constant chills but my temperature was normal.  I felt very hungry and diaphoretic and felt like I had a low blood sugar,  and ate a bowl of rice chex cereal. I felt a little better but a half hour later VOMITED everything up.  I then felt somewhat better and went to the hospital to make rounds.  The nursing staff reported that about half of them called in sick due to the vaccine with severe fatigue, fever, joint pains and headaches.  One nurse reported that all her joints felt like they were on fire.  Four nursing supervisors also called in sick that day.   I then went to my office and my staff said I looked GREEN and insisted I go home.  I did not eat anything but while resting I again had SEVERE VOMITING of my breakfast at about noon.  When I felt stronger I drove home at about 1:30 PM and fell asleep until about 5 PM, still not having eaten anything nor taking fluids. My arm pain went away.  By 7 PM I finally drank some tea and felt stronger and felt like I was not going to die.   It seems that those of use who had the Covid in the past do not tolerate the vaccine and suffer severe reactions. I was unable to find any studies with the vaccine given to patients who already have antibodies.  This lack of data is a real problem.

Had no side effects other than sore arm until Monday, January 4 when I had a bout of diarrhea followed by a rapid heart beat, which when checked was 146, then went to 149 and few minutes later was 150.  I became worried and called my cardiologist and the clinic was closed.  The cardiologist on call called me back.  After describing my symptoms and that I had received the Covid 19 shot several days earlier.  He advised me to monitor my heart rate and if it continued to go to the ER.  Shortly after, my heart rate returned to normal, so I did not go to the ER.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  I received a Moderna covid-19 vaccination (Lot # 007M20A)  at 10:20 AM on Monday 02-01-2021 at the VA Clinic .  Between 3 and 4 minutes later I began to experience difficulty breathing, sweating and feeling warm, and then I passed out behind the steering wheel of my parked car, while sitting with my wife.  I came to after few minutes as people were attempting to get me out of my car and into a wheelchair, but I had difficulty breathing, couldn?t move, and had to be pulled out.  After being put in the wheelchair, I passed out again and came to after I had been taken out of the wheelchair and laid on my left side on the ground by Fire Dept. EMT?s.  I then began to retch, but did not vomit.   My wife said that one of the EMT?s pumped my chest a couple of times. They lifted me onto a gurney and put me in an ambulance, hit me with an EPI pen, and placed an oxygen mask on my face, as I was having great difficulty breathing.  I was unable to move or lift my arms to help them place a blood pressure cuff on my arm, a pulse monitor on my finger, and lift my shirt to help them attach EKG pads. Atthat point I realized that I had also lost control of my bladder at some point. I continued to have difficulty breathing, and started to experience extreme shivering all the while to emergency Room. Once in the Emergency Room, I could not move myself off the FD gurney, and they had to lift the sheet that I was laying on in order to move me onto the hospital gurney. I had great difficulty helping the technicians remove my shirt so that they could administer another EKG and start an IV (LR 1,000ml bolus).   I continued to have difficulty breathing and kept shivering and sweating for some time.  I was advised that the EKG?s both appeared normal.  After a lengthy period of I gradually reached a point where I stopped shivering and sweating, and returned to almost normal breathing.  I was finally released around 1-1:30 PM.

I was stuck in bed and did not want to eat. I did force myself to go through the drive thru and have a COVID test. My COVID test was negative. I still have a little bit of unsteadiness, feels like an inner ear balance problem.

His wife also noted some slight slurred speech.  He went to the emergency room and was told that he had a 6th nerve palsy on the left.  A scan of his head was unremarkable.  He was referred to neurology.  I saw him on February 2 and by that time he had evidence of full-blown myasthenia gravis with left ptosis, slurred speech, intermittent disconjugate gaze, some subjective difficulty swallowing.. 1 wk laterSevere dysphagia unable to swallow without puréeing food marked slurred speech and ptosis .SENT FOR EMERGENCY IVIG

By Wednesday morning (2/10) the symptoms persisted, but I went to work. By noon   I had many of the same symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID in December (9th). Headache, body aches all over, severe fatigue, loss of appetite and chills. Only this time it was worse than I remembered from December. I went home at noon, went to bed. Got up around 6PM and tried to eat, but had no appetite at all. I went to bed at 6:30 PM Wednesday and woke up at 7:00 AM Thursday with only a couple of bathroom trips. Today (Wednesday) symptoms have subsided significantly. Almost gone. Will work tomorrow.

                                                I had no issues with the first Moderna dose, but 5 days after the 2nd dose I experienced chills, dizziness and slight nausea when up and moving.  This lasted 2 days and started going away on day 3, but the dizziness is still slightly  present.  Also, during this time I?ve continually monitored my BP and pulse.  My BP has been elevated averaging around 165/95 (my normal is close to 145/85).  Pulse has been steady averaging around 66-68 which is normal for me.  Today,  my BP is around 150/90 so it?s slowly getting back to normal on day 9 (post vaccine #2).   Also, I had no other symptoms and my temperature was steady at 97 degrees since the vaccination.  Thank you

Cramping would come and go and were severe. Client states he did what he could to put up with the pain until Monday Feb 15th. He went to local ER. Client was unable to tolerate CT contrast oral liquid (caused immediate diarrhea) so an abdominal CT scan was not completed and he was discharged. Symptoms still persist and client states he lost 16 lbs so far. He has reached out to follow up with his regular HCP- VA clinic.  He is waiting for a call from them today.

Neck pain that goes down my arm (R), extreme fatigue and achy. I&#39;ve lost 5lbs in 3d.&#39; MEDS UTD  History of Present Illness     &#34;I had that COVID shot Thursday (l arm).  Friday I started having cramps in my neck--base of my skull, R arm, into the base of my jaw.&#34;  Worse with laying down, sleeping on L side.  &#34;Hurt too much to get up&#34; (had wife help him up to bathroom).    Tried?  Bayer back and body only.  Tried some topical ben gay (made worse), vibration therapy.  Hot shower seemed to help.  Review of Systems     &#43; for chills, HA, diarrhea.  Worst yesterday.  Missed work yesterday.  Had been eating/drinking well until recently.    Assessment/Plan      1. Adverse reaction to vaccine T50.Z95A    2. Myalgia after COVID-19 vaccination M79.10     1.  Adverse vaccine response will be reported.  This seems to be fairly significant due to being 5d after.  2.  Will try Tyl 1000mg up to tid and Ibu 400 up to tid-qid for next 3 days--try to get dose of each at hs tonight.  Push fluids.  Prednisone 20mg/d x 5d.  Call report tomorrow on status.  3.  At this time, will likely avoid 2nd Moderna covid vax in this pt due to reaction.  4.  Note provided for off work yesterday through tomorrow.

                                                History of Present Illness  The patient presents with weakness.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is generalized.  The degree at present is moderate.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain.  73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife. Labs are overall reassuring. His etemp is elevated but afebrile. CXR with possible atelectasis vs infiltrate but pt has no cough, no fever, and a normal WBC Coutn so I favor atelectasis. His CT head shows possibly artifact vs cortical hypodensities. Will await formal read this morning. Pts UA is clean. He is no longer shaking after a dose of tylenol and ativan. I suspect the pts generalzied weakess is 2/2 his recent covid vaccine yesterday afternoon. Despite this the pt cannot stand and move around on his own and his wife cannot care fo rhim at home given his current situation. Pt discussed with Dr and will be admitted for further care. .

This time around on Tuesday pt got a COVID vaccine and 6 hours after pt started feeling nauseous and 3 days after the vaccine had numbness in his feet b/l at first. Numbness travelled upwards up to the knees. Next the weakness started extending upwards to his mid thigh. Pt will not put any weight on his legs because he knows he is very unsteady.  Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there. Pt woke up this morning and went from his bed to his chair and since then pt was not able to get up from the chair.

As the rash spread across my chest (left side) and blisters appeared, I went to my physician&#39;s office on March 9. Dr. diagnosed &#34;shingles&#34; and recommended OTC meds for pain and itching. In following weeks, the rash started healing, but the pain persisted which was not relieved by Tylenol or other OTC drugs. I could not sleep, and with strong pain and upset stomach went to the ER on Sat. March 27, I was seen. I was treated at ER for pain and nausea; Gabapentin was prescribed for nerve pain.

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

                                                Patient woke up around 3:30am feeling extremely nauseous, shaking, drenched in sweat but with a normal temperature (97.6, which is normal for him), and feeling overall terrible.  Food had tasted weird to him the day before, but he still ate. At 3:30am, he felt like he was having a major allergy attack - lots of phlegm, runny nose and eyes. He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black &#34;coffee grounds-like&#34; fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE). After getting through with that (about 15 minutes), he wretched up more thick mucus with a few flecks of black cells in it. After awhile, he felt okay enough to go back to sleep.  Around 6am, he had another major allergy-like attack, but did not vomit.  Around 8am, after being awake for awhile, he vomited again with more black liquid, about 50mL this time. He felt weak and horrible and was shaking. At the recommendation of the advice nurse, he was taken to the ER by ambulance. Upon arriving, he waited around an hour for an ER bed.  They put him on an IV, did a physical inspection and did blood work. His sodium was a bit low, but in normal range. Potassium levels were fine. He was mentally clear the whole time, but physically very weak.  He was kept overnight after a hemochrit test in the afternoon showed low levels of hemoglobin. He was stabilized in the morning, but was barely able to eat anything the whole time. He was meant to get an endoscopy, but they decided to allow him to eat and sent him home after noon bc they hadn&#39;t yet been able to schedule him for it and he was in pain and massively hungry.  When he got home, he still barely ate,  and still isn&#39;t eating almost anything a day later. His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).  They believe that he may have bleeding in his stomach or upper GI or esophagus, but we are waiting for an endoscopy later this week.  He is still very weak and frail and fatigued.

At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

It was red and surface was like a burning rash, not smooth. It was extremely painful, could not touch it without excruciating pain. I had to wear shorts and I fanned it and put cool compress on it. A few hours later burning sensation stopped but redness remained for days. Finally it began to shrink in size and color though still red now had a brownish tinge to it. It has shrunk in size to now about 5 1/2 inches x 2 inches and now it looks like a large birth mark and skin is dry and peeling. I have not put anything on it.

                                                I received my first shot of Moderna vaccine on February 12 and my second on March 12, 2001. I experienced very slight reactions to both injections composed of mild aching, and tingling sensation of shoulders and back and very slight soreness at the injection sight and lasting only 24 hours after the injections.  On evening of May 24, 2021, I experienced a very upset stomach followed by multiple bowel movements during the night and intense aching of the joints, fatigue, tingling sensation of my back and shoulders, chills and loss of appetite lasting through the following day and night.  I awoke on May 25, 2021 feeling better but still experiencing slight fatigue and a mild head ache.  During these days both my wife and I consumed the same foods and carried out identical schedules.  My question is: could this have been a delayed reaction to the Moderna vaccine?

Wednesday 1/6/21 swelling had spread significantly to inside the right side of mouth and tongue also affecting right jaw. By 3 Pm that day my tongue was numb and swollen on the right side as well as the right side of my mouth and jaw. I could only chew, eat, and swallow effectively on the left side of my mouth using the left side of my tongue to negotiate eating.  I could only this with small amounts of food. By that evening about 4 hours later I could eat , chew etc. pretty good but the swelling &amp; discomfort remained but reduced to a functional level.  Today, Thursday 1/7/21, the soreness and discomfort remains inside throat, mouth, tongue and jaw all on the right side.

                                                I developed a previously never experienced constipation, with soft, not impacted stool. I&#39;m a physician of Internal Medicine and would equate this w/ something of an atonic colon. I self-administered two separate Fleets Childrens rectal suppositories w/o response, then repeated digital disimpaction every hour or so, for the next 12-16 hours. Began Miralax powder the evening of January 16, 2021 around 7PM and repeated full doses at bedtime, again at approximately 4AM on January 17, 2021 and a fourth full dose at 8AM. The Miralax finally resulted in a more liquid stool that morning around 10AM, w/ relief of the generalized abdominal discomfort

I went to my doctor office later that morning and they told me I had Shingles.  They put me on an anti-viral medication called Valacyclovir.  (1 gram tablet every 8 hours for seven days.)

The entire room was spinning and I could hardly walk due to poor balance.  Every time I moved my head, the vertigo would recur.  This caused nausea and vomiting so I spent much of the day in bed.  In the late afternoon, the vertigo lessened after I took an anti-emetic drug.  I only ate clear liquids the first day.  Since then, I have improved but still have mild morning vertigo.and mild fatigue.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

I was awakened perhaps 20 times to urinate throughout that time, which is extremely often compared to my normal. I would lay back down and be asleep almost immediately. I tried to eat and drink during one of my awake times, but I had no appetite and no desire to drink. Throughout day two I had a fever. I was totally unable to function on day two. About 10:00 pm of day two my appetite returned. About 11:00 pm I returned to bed and had a full night&#39;s sleep.

                                                Saturday, Marth 5th -- day after vaccination.  Upon awakening, extreme pain head-to-toe, in muscles and joints.  Severe headache (very rare for me), Hands could barely move (like severe arthritis),  Slightly elevated temperature (98.9 when my normal is 97.8).  Overall symptoms faded slightly and then returned to full strength two or three times during the day.  Unable to eat (not nauseous, just not hungry) and only drank water.  No bowel movement and very little urination during the day.  By about 18:00, headache was gone and pain was receding .  Around 21:00 started getting very cold and could not seem to get warm.  Started shaking severely from cold.  Put on sweat suit, turned on bed heater, and added blankets, then went to bed around 22:00.    Woke up Sunday morning (March 7th feeling absolutely perfect!  None of the previous day&#39;s pain was present, no temperature, no limits to hand/finger movement, and was very hungry.  Ate a normal size breakfast with no problems, urination was normal,   It was like the reaction had never happened, but my wife assured me that it had.   Other than slight constipation, I have no had any problems since.

It was 102. that evening I was dizzy and vomiting and I was shaking terribly. My temp went up as high as 103.2. It eased with 2 tylenol  I run a temperature for 3 days. I lost my sense of smell and taste. I had not been anywhere where I could have had contact with someone who had covid to my knowledge. My sense of smell has come back but my taste of food has slowly coming back. I would rather report it here then to say anything in public. My partner can tell I was bedridden for several days and still get and stay very tired.I did not go to emergency room only called them

                                                I got out of bed at my normal time of 5 AM and proceeded to the bathroom to urinate, feeling fine. Just before starting to urinate, I started sweating profusely and shaking and so turned around and sat down on the toilet. I then sweat even more as if I was in the shower, and shook violently. I then started feeling very nauseous, but I was shaking so badly that I had to very carefully  hold the toilet  to turn around to kneel down in front of the toilet. I heaved a number of times, but nothing came up. I finally stopped shaking and sat on the floor in front of the toilet for a while, and the sweating got less. After a short time, I got up and walked slowly to a recliner, about 30&#39; away. The nausea had gone away by then and the sweating had subsided. My wife brought me blanket and I rested till 7:30 AM.  I had a cup of coffee about 8 AM, and a bowel of cereal at 9 AM. I have been fine ever since then, no more reactions, thank goodness. That one was horrible.

                                                I received the vaccine on Monday. Tuesday I felt like I had the virus again-tiredness, slight temperature, chills, intense pain at injection site, slight stomach discomfort. What surprised me and the reason I am reporting this is the symptoms, though gradually better, persisted until Friday-4 days. I was expecting to be down for a day or two, but length of the aftereffects surprised me. I had a strong case of Covid in January 2020.

Stayed in bed all day.  Was able to eat small meals, a bit queasy stomach, more loose BM.  Went to sleep 30 hr after shot.  Work up the next day without fever.  Was fatigued the entire day.    Had loose bowls/diahrea  off and on for the next 5 days.  Got back to normal BM a weeks after the shot.  Left arm soreness was pretty much gone by end of week.

                                                On February 21 I had my first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. The next morning I experienced a mild 24-hour flu with low fever, fatigue and diminished appetite. My left arm, where I had the injection, was mildly sore. The following day all was fine. At 10:40am March 21 I had the second Moderna vaccination at the same location. By 7pm that day I began to feel flu-like symptoms. By 9pm I had a fever of about 102 degrees, moderate chills and sweats. By midnight I could barely sit up in bed to go to the bathroom, and had to steady myself on the walls as I walked. At one point during the night I began gasping for air and breathing hoarsely. I woke up hourly all night. Throughout Monday the weakness continued. I was slightly nauseous, developed mild diarrhea, and emptied the bowels. Zero appetite; drank lots of cold water. Slept the same as Sunday night with occasional chills and sweats. No more gasping episodes though. Tuesday ? Thursday I improved very gradually. Ate small amounts of plain yogurt, then plain toast. A low-grade fever came and went. I rested in bed all day and slept fitfully. Still very weak. Fast forward to March 31, 10 days after the shot. My appetite is OK now, no fever for several days, energy level about 85% of normal. I am very appreciative of getting the vaccine. The intense reaction to the second injection was startling, as my health has generally been excellent. I have masked and kept socially distant since last March.

                                                Patient received first COVID vaccine on 2/6/2021 and second vaccine on 3/6/2021. Patient presented to Hospital on 4/09/2021 for persistent nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria and jaundice. Patient reported a 1 month history of intermittent nausea and vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, feeling dizzy and weak, poor appetite. Patient had a colonoscopy ~2 weeks prior admission to hospital for cancer screening purposes which was unremarkable and labs done by his primary care at that time were all normal (per admitting physician&#39;s note). At hospital, patient was found to have evidence of hemolytic anemia thought to be autoimmune in nature with a positive direct antiglobulin. Patient was subsequently transferred to hospital on 4/11/2021 for further workup. Patient is still currently admitted to hospital. Oncology was consulted for workup of pancytopenia and suspected warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Throughout admission, the patient&#39;s platelets have ranged between 59-154 k/µL and hemoglobin has ranged 4.5-8.6 g/dL with no documented history of thrombocytopenia or anemia. Patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg x9 doses, prednisone 80 mg daily (1 mg/kg) x5 doses, prednisone 60 mg x1 dose, rituximab 740 mg (375 mg/m2)  x3 doses, and immune globulin 40 g x3 doses. Patient has also received 4 units of packed red blood cells. Given the timing of anemia and thrombocytopenia and unknown etiology, immune response to his COVID vaccine is on the differential.

Past adverse reactions to the above products included No adverse event with influenza and pneumococcal. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension, Gout, Hyperlipidemia and Cardiomyopathy.    On 19-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Jan-2021, the patient experienced EPISTAXIS (ACUTE EPISTAXIS) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and PURPURA (DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS PURPURA) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 20-Jan-2021, the patient experienced IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Severe refractory immune thrombocytopenia) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 31-Jan-2021, the patient experienced MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (extremity weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ENCEPHALOPATHY (encephalopathy with facial muscle weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), FACIAL PARESIS (facial muscle weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), BACK PAIN (back pain causing inability to ambulate) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSARTHRIA (dysarthria) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CONSTIPATION (Constipation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), URINARY RETENTION (urinary retention) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and STAPHYLOCOCCAL SEPSIS (MSSA) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized for 5 days due to EPISTAXIS, IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS and PURPURA. At the time of the report, IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Severe refractory immune thrombocytopenia), EPISTAXIS (ACUTE EPISTAXIS), PURPURA (DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS PURPURA), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (extremity weakness) and FACIAL PARESIS (facial muscle weakness) was resolving and ENCEPHALOPATHY (encephalopathy with facial muscle weakness), BACK PAIN (back pain causing inability to ambulate), DYSARTHRIA (dysarthria), CONSTIPATION (Constipation), URINARY RETENTION (urinary retention) and STAPHYLOCOCCAL SEPSIS (MSSA) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 20-Jan-2021, Platelet count: 10 10^9/L (Inconclusive) 10. On 01-Feb-2021, Blood culture: abnormal (abnormal) blood culture grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). On 01-Feb-2021, Culture urine: abnormal (abnormal) urine culture grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). On 01-Feb-2021, Platelet count: 21 10^9/L (Inconclusive) 21. On 02-Feb-2021, Cytomegalovirus test: negative (Negative) Negative. On 02-Feb-2021, Epstein-Barr virus test: negative (Negative) Negative. On 02-Feb-2021, HIV test: negative (Negative) Negative.

On 02-Feb-2021, Parvovirus B19 test: negative (Negative) Negative. On 04-Feb-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) MRI revealed sever L1-5 stenosis with multi-level disc herniation and fluid collections within the lumbar, posterior and paraspinal musculature.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Two months prior to vaccination, the patient had a platelet count of 224 x 10^9/L.  No concomitant medications were reported.  Treatment for the events included high-dose dexamethasone (400mg/kg/day), five daily doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (400mg/kg/day), three daily platelet transfusions, and two weekly doses of rituximab (375mg/m^2/dose). Immune suppression with dexamethasone (20mg/day) was continued after hospital discharge. Post vaccination day ten, TPO-RA eltrombopag (50 mg/day) was initiated. On post-vaccination day 14, he received one pheresis unit of platelets and an additional dose of IVIg of 80 grams. On post-vaccination day 12, he received high dose methyl-prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) and (5 mcg/kg). The patient was given cefazolin for MSSA infection. On post-vaccination day 19, after the third episode of plasma exchange, his facial weakness improved. On post-vaccination day 22, his platelet count was 72*10^9/L, a second dose of romiplostim 5 mcg/kg was administered, and a corticosteroid taper was begun. He was transferred to a skilled nursing facility on post-vaccination day 25 with a platelet count of 173*10^9/L.

Slight interval decrease in the patient&#39;s 2 previously identified right sided pulmonary nodules. Slight decrease in the one measurable mediastinal lymph node. The patient&#39;s other lymphadenopathy is probably also improved but difficult to measure due to the technique. Worsening airspace disease in a somewhat interstitial pattern. Pulmonary edema would be the first consideration. Infection would be the second consideration.

Small and under-filled left ventricle with hyperdynamic systolic function, estimated LVEF is 75%. Minimal aortic valve sclerosis with no stenosis. Moderate mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. Estimated PA systolic pressure is severely elevated (68.6 mmHg). Compared to the prior report dated 7/3/2018; there is a worsening right heart dilatation and function. There is increased mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. No significant change in estimated PA pressure.. In 2021, Heart rate: abnormal (abnormal) abnormal. In 2021, Pulmonary arterial pressure: 68.6 mmhg (High) Severely elevated. In 2021, Ultrasound scan: no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the...

                                                I experienced a strong case of diarrhea starting when I got up. on Sunday Jan. 21 and had 5 loose bowels between 7am and 2:30pm. I consider this episode a possible side effect of the vaccine because there were no other factors which could explain this episode--I did not eat any tainted or undercooked food. All food was prepared at home, properly stored and cooked. Usually when I have intestinal trouble, I take 1 tablet of Imodium and that stops it, but this was such a strong case of diarrhea that it took two tablets of Imodium to stop it.

                                                On day 10,  noticed a red patch at the injection site, swollen, hard, warm to the touch. Over the following few days, the redness area gets larger and now it covers the whole upper arm. It itches may be twice a day, the swelling is reduced but the redness is persists. I am not overly concerned, but would like to know what&#39;s going on. I hope it goes back to normal over the coming few days before i receive the second dose on March 19th.

After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?

                                                Initially after the second vaccine he had typical myalgias/arthralgias, especially shoulder/neck. On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.

It ultimately got so bad that I ended up in the ER with a 104  degree temperature and bad pains on March 19th. After a series of tests it was determined to be Diverticulitis which I never had before.  I am not sure it is related to the Covid shot, but, it is interesting that it started the day after the second shot.

                                                On March 4 patient experienced vomiting. Early morning March 5 he fell and landed on his hip after being disoriented and experienced aches, weakness, and nausea without vomiting throughout the day. On March 6 he experienced excruciating pain in his left hip and went to the local emergency room following guidance from his primary care physician. He was diagnosed with fluid near his hip joint at the hospital and was discharged the same day. The next day, March 7 he was still in pain but able to walk with assistance. On March 8 he got an x-ray from an orthopedic physician and severe arthritis was found. March 10 the severe pain persisted, but he was able to walk with a walker. On March 12 he received a cortisone shot and required emergency medical assistance to get into a personal vehicle with a family member who drove to the appointment. The next few days, the pain persisted, became worse, and spread throughout his body. On March 16 he was transported by emergency medical services to the local emergency room for treatment and was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia. On March 18 he was still being treated when he experienced cardiac arrest while being intubated. He was resuscitated and was on a ventilator being treated for a few more days but ultimately succumbed to sepsis on March 30.

                                                Almost exactly seven days after my second Moderna shot, I had a urination which was dark blood red. It included a small blood clot, which by my estimate was at most 1/2&#34; long by 1/8&#34; in diameter.  There was no pain or burning on discharge, either with that urination, or before, or after. My next urination after that had a very small amount of dark red discoloration; and there has been no dark red in my urine after that [now six days]. Following that bloody urination, I did have a slight discomfort in the area below my belly button for several hours, but then it stopped. Since that incident, I have increased my intake of water and decreased my intake of acidic and carbonated drinks. I have not smoked in more than 45 years; and the occasional urinary dribbling I had experienced for some years before that incident has decreased noticeably. All else is OK. As a non-healthcare professional, I concluded the outcome to date is good. I have an appointment to see my doctor, on April 22.

                                                He got his vaccine, and first his body hurt everywhere.  It was very painful and felt like everything in his body was hurting, aching.  He felt nauseated, had a bit of fever 100 degrees, and normally his temp is 97.5  He was miserable.  He couldn&#39;t do anything as he hurt so bad.  He felt that it would go away and waited 2 days and it didn&#39;t go away and was not able to get up to get anything to eat or drink.  called the neighbors who called 9-1-1 and the EMT&#39;s and took his VS and took a blood sample for his diabetes and said that his VS were normal and asked if he wanted to go to the hospital, and they did not see anything wrong with him and he declined and they left.  He thought that he would feel better, and started to, not nauseated.  He was also very dizzy and really could not walk.  His neighbor brought him a walker so he could get around otherwise he would fall down into a chair.  Finally after a couple of weeks felt like he would be able to stand up without falling down.  Now every time that he stands up he gets light headed, and is able to get around without any problems, and take care of himself, but has to be real careful with the vertigo that will not go away completely.  It&#39;s been 7 weeks and it&#39;s not completely gone and wonders if it&#39;s going to go away.   He has noticed that the more he gets up that it does improve.

                                                I received the vaccine on 4/28/2021 at 10:45am. No adverse effects that day, except for minor tenderness at the injection site. On the morning of 4/29/2021, about 7:30, I woke with a fever of 102. I had no appetite, and felt general flu-like symptoms--dizziness, etc. When I took Advil, my fever lessened. At about 1 pm I ate lunch as usual, and took more Advil in the afternoon for fever. At about 5 pm, I suffered a bout of severe muscle weakness, to the extent that I could not get myself to the bathroom unassisted, and required the help of 2 people to get me out of the bathroom and back to a chair in the living room. At the same time I had dry heaves, severe sweating, and physical exhaustion. I immediately fell asleep in the chair, and slept for 2 hours. When I woke, about 7:30pm, I felt a little better. I was able to take some fluids and a little food. I was also able to stand and walk with just a little support. By 9:30 that night I could stand and walk fairly steadily by myself. I slept well, and when I woke up the morning of 4/30, at about 7 am, I felt pretty much normal. I was steady on my feet, and my fever was down. I had a little dizziness on exertion, but fairly minor, and it passed quickly.

                                                CHILLS, NIGHT SWEATS. Chills, no fever, began about 12 hours following the injection and continued periodically for 2 days. Night sweats began on 2/17/2021, 7-days following the injection, for 17 consecutive nights and then gradually less frequently until 4/11/2021. Experienced 28-night sweating episodes of varying intensity from full-body drenching/soaking the bedding to light sweating wetting the clothing. Took no additional medication or dietary supplements other than that reported in item 9. Dramatically altered eating habits, i.e., no evening meal, believing that diet could be source of night sweating episodes. The dietary changes had no apparent effect. Did not observe any physical changes such as itching, rashes, swelling, etc. In May 2021, a sleep therapist reviewing my sleep history suggested submitting a VAERS report to report the night sweating as possible COVID-19 vaccine side effects. I am a non-smoker, non-drinker, and rarely get sick. Have a history of infrequent (a few episodes annually) of night sweating but do not recall ever having consecutive night sweating episodes. In April 2019, to determine possible causes of the night sweating, primary care provider referral testing for HIV1, chest x-rays, and TB were negative. Received only COVID-19 test on 6/4/2020 which was reported as negative. Frequent dental visits and screening and never experienced nor reported any possible COVID-19 related symptoms. On 1/13/2021, received the 1st dose, Moderna lot number 011J20A, at a county public health COVID-19 drive-thru clinic, intramuscular right arm with only mild shoulder discomfort. Routinely receive the annual flu immunization which occurred on 9/2/2020, FLUAD INJ 2020-21, intramuscular right army with no side effects. Periodic blood donor with last donation on 10/9/2020.
