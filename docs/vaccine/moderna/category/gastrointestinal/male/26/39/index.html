                                                I woke up around 3 am because of body aches. The body aches worsened and i checked and had a fever of 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit. My head started to pound and my pulse was accelerated to probably 80 bpm (normally rest at 60 bpm). I felt a little lightheaded and  a bit nauseas. I took 2 200 mg tablets of EC ibuprofen and did not take Tylenol because i knew my immune response needed to take its course. it is about 3:33 in the afternoon and my body is still aching but my fever has dissipated and I still have a headache that throbs when I walk.

                                                Initially, around 1500hrs on Monday, January 4th, roughly 40 minutes after the injection, I developed a scratchy throat, a headache, and nausea.  I got home from work, and having no appetite due to nausea, I fell asleep on the couch around 1800hrs. Severe fatigue had set in. I did not wake up until 0500hrs the next morning to go to work on January 5th. I felt like I had not slept at all, however the scratchy throat had gone away. I worked all day with the nausea and headache. Throughout the day I developed chills, cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, and I felt like my mind was foggy (I had felt feverish since Monday night, but Tuesday was the first time I took my temperature that showed I had a fever.) I went home that night and slept all evening and well into the next morning. On the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, my symptoms had again gotten worse, so I called my primary care physician. He fit me in and tested me for the flu and for COVID. He prescribed me Ibuprofen for the headache/fever, and Ondansetron for the nausea/vomiting. My flu test came back negative on Thursday, January 7th, and my COVID test came back negative on Friday, January 8th. The fever finally broke on Friday evening and Saturday, January 9th  was the first day I woke up without a fever.  I still have the headache as of today, January 11th, and a low grade fever has returned. I am still very fatigued as well.

                                                Approximately nine hours after second dose, I began to feel as if a flu was coming on. Shortly after upon falling asleep, I started getting the chills and felt as though I had a fever. Waking up in the morning, I had a painful throbbing headache. My muscles ached and I felt very fatigued. I was unable to get out of bed due to said fatigue. I felt as though I had a temperature, but did not take it at that juncture. I had no appetite. When I did manage to stand, the headache would throb and I felt nauseated. Later that evening, I had a slight fever of 100.8 degrees fahrenheit. The following morning, I felt nearly recovered, but my head would still throb when changing positions, but not with the same severity as the previous day. Headache slightly persists to this day.

                                                I have felt horrible since receiving the second dose of Moderna. I felt profoundly fatigued, sore all over, and nauseated for 18 or so hours. Since then I have been feeling nauseated after I eat. I cannot eat like I normally do and it has been almost five days. If this persists through the weekend I will visit my doctor next week.

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

                                                At 3 AM, 12 hours following the vaccine administration, I awoke with severe fever/chills, body aches and severe headache, which progressed to nausea and vomiting x 3 episodes and was very sick for one day, home bound and could not work.  This reaction was due to I believe the fact I had positive antibodies from a positive infection 8 months prior.  I had laboratory evidence of a positive serum antibody titer following the infection.  Was this vaccine studied in regards to patients who received the vaccine? because I believe it needs further study before it is given to patients who have already developed immunity from acquiring the actual COVID disease.

I started Experiencing the listed side effects from the morning of January 8th, 2021 to the morning of January 9th, 2021. It started with light muscle and joint pain at 8am and progressed to sever muscle and joint pain, chills, nausea, fatigue, headaches and eventually a fever averaging at 100 degrees Fahrenheit by 1-2PM the same day. These side effects were enough to leave me bedridden for most of the 8th. most side effects were gone by the morning of the 9th, the fever eventually broke by 930Am on the 9th.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

                                                30 yo man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED for chest pressure and SOB that started this morning when he woke up. It was a constant 8/10 pressure squeezing at the sides of his sternum with the sensation of a plate pushing down on his sternum, that worsened by taking deep breaths. He had never experienced anything like it before. The pain was neither worsened with exertion nor relieved by rest. It did not change with position, and it did not radiate to his arm/neck. He denies any tenderness to palpation of his chest. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not provide any relief. At time of interview denies SOB and reports decrease in chest tightness to 2/10. CP was significantly relieved with a bolus of normal saline in the ED. Tylenol also effectively reduced his pain. Of note, the patient received the second Moderna COVID vaccine shot 3 days ago. For 2 days after receiving the second shot he experienced fevers, chills, nausea, and intermittent vomiting (10 bouts of non-bloody emesis).

First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included allergy to cefaclor and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Concomitant medications reported included desvenlafaxine succinate, gabapentin and dexlansoprazole.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 11:30 am, approximately six hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the morning of 23 Dec 2020, prior to receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt &#34;achy&#34;.  At 5:30 pm, the patient experienced chills, fever to 102, GI upset and diarrhea. At 11:00 pm, the patient reported difficulty sleeping, GI upset, LOC x 2 and pallor. The patient was transported to the emergency room via ambulance.  A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test and routine labs were collected; however, results were not provided. Treatment for the events included paracetamol, unspecified intravenous (IV) medications, ondansetron and ketorolac tromethamine. The emergency room discharge diagnosis was stomach flu.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, GI upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever, were considered resolved on 24 Dec 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 31-year-old, male subject with a medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, who experienced the unexpected events of loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, and stomach flu, and the expected events of chills and fever. The events of chills, fever occurred approximately 6 hrs. and the events of GI upset, loss of consciousness, difficulty sleeping occurred after 12 hrs. after the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The time to onset for the events of GI upset and diarrhea were unknown. The reporter did not provide the causality assessment for the events. Due to the temporal association between the LOC and the administration of the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however, the subject&#39;s medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and other concurrent conditions of GI upset, diarrhea, and stomach flu remain as confounders.

I haven?t been able to sleep since then and my fever has spiked as high as 104.5. I?m also experiencing headache, ear aches, mild sore throat, nausea, and chest tightness/pain during deep breathing. No shortness of breath symptoms though. Aleve and Tylenol do not appear to be helping. I feel worse than when I had Covid back in November.

The area around my ear remained 98.7*F. As it progressed I developed minor amounts of blotchy red areas along the hairline on the left side of my face only. Nothing occured on the right side of my body. Diarrhea developed with multiple episodes. All of this lasted approx. 3 hours before subsiding without treatment. I have had significant amount of vaccines and immunizations from the civilian and military sectors and never suffered this before.

I have not had covid and have not been sick since pandemic started. The following morning I woke up with a fever of 101 and extreme arm pain. As the morning progressed, I continued to have increasing fever even after taking Tylenol 500mg every 4-6 hours. My fever peaked at 104.7 by 3pm on 1/20, then started to come down after taking 400mg of ibuprofen. By 9pm on 1/20, my fever started to spike again and then I took more inbuprofen. As of 1/21, I am still having symptoms of being unwell and nausea, as well as low grade fever of 101. I do not have any covid symptoms (no cough, no loss of taste).

Saturdays diarrhea slowed down - and I went to ER - muscles were pushing - I felt my electrolytes were out of whack. I02 degree fever so they gave me Tylenol. They gave me two bags of fluids. My heartrate was in mid 120s when I went in and after fluids it went down to the 70&#39;s. I was discharged after that. I was swabbed for COVID - negative. Sunday I was still lethargic and fatigue; diarrhea slowed down quite a bit and I was able to eat some food. Monday I came back to work - not 100% in health but felt better.

I woke up around the10 am  the 25th.the next day. I had a migraine that wouldn&#39;t go away. I was feeling nauseous and still had a light sensitive headache. I took Migraine medication, and eventually mid afternoon the symptoms went away. Less than 24 hours later I was back to normal. March 4th I was using Gold Bond Ultimate Mens lotion and had an adverse reaction. My hand swelled up, and got red.  I took Benadryl and it went away. March 5th I used Curel lotion and the same thing happened. Did not take Benadryl.

                                                The following day I became increasingly fatigued, roughly 30 hours later I took a 2 hour nap. I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna on January 19, 2021. 48 hours later upon waking from sleep patient had myalgias, arthralgia in all distributions, and  a frontal headache. Patient was instructed to rest and increase fluid intake and Ibuprofen as this was likely a known adverse reaction to COVID vaccination. At 72hrs from vaccination patient began to have fevers Tmax 101.9 orally. Continued rest, hydration and ibuprofen, started Tylenol. At 96hrs from vaccination patient began to have a dry cough, diarrhea, severe fatigue and inspiratory chest pain. Patients myalgias and arthralgias continued, and Tmax increased to 104.5 orally. At this time bedside ECHO, iSTAT chemistry, COVID antigen, COVID antibody and COVID PCR, Rapid Flu, and Viral Respiratory Panel were obtained. Administered 1.5 liters of lactated ringers, Toradol 15mg and Tylenol 975mg  and patient was isolated.  EKG, troponin and Chest Xray were obtained 12 hours later (108 hours from vaccination) at which time the patient reported improvement  by 95%. Patient was afebrile and chest pain free. Only symptom at that time was fatigue. After  another 12 hours of rest/sleep (hour 120 post vaccination)  patient reports no symptoms and 100% well.  See below for lab/rad/test details.

This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

                                                I developed periumbilicus cramping abdominal pain, nausea for two days after first shot then it went away. After second shot, I developed the usual thing of arm soreness, fever, chills, joint pain and generalized body aches as well as GI symptoms. All symptoms went away in two days except that I have had persistent symptoms of cramping abdominal pain, on/off nausea, bloating. I still have the symptoms 4 weeks after the shot and nobody knows what is going on.  I lost around 15 lb till now and will be following with my PCP soon to see what is next.

                                                I had a sore arm almost immediately following the shot that slowly got worse throughout the evening. In the morning my arm was very sore. I woke up around 6:30 with a headache and chills. throughout the morning, my headache worsened as did my chills. I felt fatigued and noticed my lungs felt the same as they did when I had COVID. Essentially all my COVID symptoms came back I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I slept most of the morning and then felt nauseous around 3 pm. I vomited around 3:30 and almost felt completely better after that. My headache, chills, and fatigue were still present but significantly less once I vomited. In the morning I woke up with a headache that lasted through the morning the second day after vaccine administration. By the end of the second day, I felt completely fine. My arm soreness was almost completely gone. I also had some aches and chills on the second day in the morning upon waking up but those were gone by mid-day. On day three I feel completely fine.

                                                Woke up the next morning with nausea, headache, chills and muscle aches. It has been ongoing now with only relief coming from Ibuprofen for symptoms. Concerned I should have taken longer time between having COVID and getting the vaccine. It was a approximately 3 days from time of being clear of isolation and any symptoms. There was no concern on the consent form of recently having COVID just a concern if you were presently positive.

Following his initial vaccination at approx. 530pm, the patient (EMT) walked back to the ambulance in which he was working and bypassed the observation area.  He reports approx. 20min later he began experiencing the sensation that his throat was swelling and immediately began dry heaving.  He returned inside and was tachycardic on monitoring and shivering.  The patient never lost his ability to breath during his time at the vaccination clinic but ultimately received a single dose of IM Epinephrine, Zytec 10mg, and Benadryl (unknown dose) and transported by ambulance to the local ER.  no rashes were observed at the time of intial onset through the time of transport (approx. 20min)

                                                For several hours I had no side effects, including soreness at the injection site. In the evening, maybe 6-8 hours after the injection, the site became sore. After midnight, I started having severe chills and needed several layers of clothing and blankets to stay warm. I checked for a fever and did not have one. In the morning the chills were gone but I had a strong headache that lingered with varying intensity throughout the day. It is unclear if the headache was more from the vaccine or more from a lack of sufficient sleep because I couldn&#39;t sleep with the chills. The injection site has continued to be sore and seems to be increasingly sore. After waking up on 1-13-2021, I found myself feeling fatigued and lethargic, not dissimilar to the fatigue I felt when I had COVID. The fatigue has somewhat subsided over the course of the day, with lots of rest helping. The headache and soreness are ongoing, and the fatigue is present but less than earlier today. There&#39;s been somewhat of an ongoing lack of appetite, but I&#39;ve been able to eat in small amounts and keep down what I eat. The chills have come and gone a couple times throughout the day today, but that doesn&#39;t seem to last long.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine first dose. Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, i became dizzy, tachycardic and experiencing hot flashes. Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                Maybe 1 minute after receiving the vaccine I began to have a syncopal episode, the nurse practitioner thought that since I was heavy I began to have a vasovagal reaction.  From there they asked me to sit with the others waiting 15 minutes to make sure they were ok to leave. As I sat the symptoms would come and go, as if in a pattern, and then return.  The longer I sat there the more the symptoms began to grow, after sitting for an hour they decided to send me to the ER. At this time I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, sweating, I was itchy, I could not stop coughing, it was difficult to breath, and I had the worse headache.  When I got to the ER they gave me drugs to reverse the allergic reaction and told me they would watch me for a while. In the next 4 hours all of the symptoms started again and I had to get another round of the reaction drugs, I ended up going through this process 4 times before I was safe enough to go home the next day.  The provider that saw me and admitted me did not do any blood work or labs, they simply provided me with the reaction drugs when needed and my home medications.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                The evening of the vaccine it started with severe fatigue and a sore throat. The next morning I woke up with a sore throat so bad that I could hardly swallow which continued through the evening then went away. I treated it with salt water rinses and Benadryl. Over the next several days the severe fatigue continued but severe muscle and joint pain as well as intestinal upset began. On Monday 1/11 I had spiked a fever which only lasted for that day. On Tuesday night I began to vomit and on Wednesday 1/13 I had lost my sense of smell and most of my sense of taste. At this point I contacted the CDC which had me complete this form in addition to the V-Safe reports I had been doing daily and encouraged me to see my primary care. In late June of 2020 I had COVID and one of the first symptoms was loosing my sense of smell and taste completely.

I gargled salt water, and took some allergy medications including Benadryl and the sore throat went away later that day. The extreme fatigue continued and late during the day following and into the third day started extreme muscle and joint pain, and intestinal upset. On Monday 1/11/2021 I had also spiked a fever which only lasted for the day. These as of today 1/14/2021 have yet to go away as well as the extreme fatigue. The major one the made me call into the agency who had me start this report was that I lost my sense of smell and some sense of taste. I had been diagnosed with COVID in late June of 2020 and one of the first symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

He had a neurology consultation and the most likely cause was thought to be vestibular neuritis on the left side. He was treated with Zofran, Reglan, Meclizine, IV fluids, and Valium with partial relief and was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. Symptoms are unresolved at the time of this report.

Shortly thereafter a rapidly rising fever accompanied by mild nausea and severe bout of chills.  Loss of appetite, brain fog, poor concentration.  Fever lasted from 9pm rapidly increasing to a highest measured temp (oral) of 102.9F for approximately 12 to 14 hours before gradually decreasing to under 100 roughly 36 hours after onset.  Tylenol did help slightly to control fever but did not seem to lower it.  Did nothing to reduce body aches.  Significant fatigue and soreness lasted approximately 3 days after dosage.

Then within a 3 week time period I kept getting sicker then, the day after my second dose (which caused me no reaction, which I thought was weird as everyone reported that one having more side effects) I had become so sick that I went to the ER and found I had diabetic ketoacidosis.  It runs in my family to have type 2 but later in life. What was also strange is that Inhad a physical not long before the vaccine through my PCP Dr. and my A1C labs came back elevated but within normal limits....

                                                Woke up on Friday morning (3/5) with severe neck pain and vertigo. Tried to walk to bathroom and was falling over to the right side and felt very nauseous. Starting throwing up. Arrived at ER around9:30AM and was diagnosed with vertigo and discharged a few hours later. He slept most of the day but woke up for a few minutes to take medicine on Friday evening and told me his vision was blurry. He went back to sleep and slept until Saturday (3/6) morning around 9:30. He told me his vision was still really blurry so we went back to the ER. They did an MRI and MRA and saw that he had two strokes. The strokes have affected his vision and he still has blurry vision and is not able to see well peripherally.

He called his mother and told her that he was sick to his stomach with cramps and that he was throwing up blood.  The girlfriend found him on the floor on the 21st dead on the floor in his hotel room at 8:00 AM.  The girlfriend said she had spoken with him around 10:00 PM and that he said he was going to sleep on the floor in the bathroom as he was throwing up and the floor was cool.  She subsequently found out that he was throwing up blood, and autopsy report showed that his stomach was full of blood and further testing is being done to see what has caused the bleeding.

                                                Restlessness and tiredness 8 hours after. Intense Chills 12 hours after injection with 5 minutes of uncontrollable shaking. Then still chills and insomnia. Fever that persisted over the next 36 hours. Responded well to Ibuprofen 400mg for 4.5 hours until symptoms returned. Began alternating with Acetominophen 650mg for better effect. Fever was highest (recorded) at 102.2 F 29 hours after injection. Woke up 40 hours from vaccine after a night of sleep and with reduced fever. Still going up and down a bit off any medication. Last reading 46 hours from vaccine 100.6, but two hours earlier was 99.4. I?ve also had nausea, exhaustion, and tiredness. Also cold symptoms which may be related to the slight cold I had the morning of the vaccination that I didn?t think was anything to worry about - my kid is in daycare and I feel like this for a large part of the winter!

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

                                                I run twice a week. One 6-8 mile and one 10-12 mile run.  I breathe through my nose mostly and I&#39;m in very good pulmonary and cardiovascular condition.  I went for a run and 1 mile in I started drooling a lot! Spitting out mouthfuls every 15-30 seconds and I never spit.  Then my chest got tight and hurt and got irritated.  The feeling was identical to Bronchitis.  I started walking home and my breathing rate increased with wheezing. I got nauseous and was bent over with saliva poring out of my mouth.  Walking up one flight of stairs was difficult.  I have a finger pulse oximeter and it was at 84!  Breathing was very rapid and difficult. After 5 minutes it went up to 94 and then up to 98-99 after 1 more minute (when my pulse fell back under 100bpm.  Chest tightness continued for about 1 hour before I was back to normal for the most part. by today I feel 100% again.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

The right side of my bottom lip started tingling about 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I had no swelling or other impairment at the time and was released after 40 minutes of observation. A little later the entire right side of my face felt as if it had fallen asleep, approximately 1 hour later and it worsened until about 4 hours later. By the next day the nausea and lightheadedness was gone, and the tingling/numbness to the right side of my face was gone within 48 hours, improving after 24 hours.

                                                Nausea, lightheadedness, and finally numbness to right side of face, slight drooping on right corner of mouth and right side of bottom lip. It began with a tingling feeling in lip. Observing staff did not notice any swelling, or other impairments, asked me if I had anxiety, and sent me on my way. Shortly after, it felt as if I had gotten a shot at the dentist, and had the tingling numbness left over on the right side of my face. About 4 hours later, my bottom lip and right side of my mouth drooped slightly, but I could still smile, talk, raise my arm, so there was no other impairment. By the next day the numbness had mostly subsided, and the nausea and lightheadedness was gone. This vaccine was given to me at a work clinic in the administration building. I do not have contact information for them but was provided a packet with this website. I don&#39;t have any pre-existing conditions, do not have anxiety, am not a hypochondriac, did not even know about the Bell&#39;s Palsy issues in trials until after I felt numbness, and the right side of my face felt as if it fell asleep, like a foot falling asleep but it was my face. It was not to the extent of Bell&#39;s palsy, and may have even been my bottom lip swelling slightly on the right side that caused the droop. It infuriates me that this side effect was dismissed as me having anxiety because I was nervous that my face was going numb which would be a natural reaction for anyone.

At 3:00 that same afternoon, I began running a fever, which ranged anywhere from  99.8 - 102.6 over the next few days. I experienced body aches, fatigue, chills, nausea and vomiting (one episode), and headaches. I did receive a COVID (Rapid and PCR) and Flu test on the following Monday, all of which came back negative. On the 21 and 22 I woke up without a fever, but within approximately 3 hours of waking up my fever would return. Fever was treated with a rotation of acetaminophen and ibuprofen with success, however, it never dropped the fever below 99.0.

At around 08:00 pm I started to get really cold and had the worst case of the chills I have ever had. I was shaking so hard my body hurt. At around 10:30 pm I went to bend and started to get a low fever of about 101.4* and could not get warm. I started to get a bad headache and my body hurt. It was so bad I had to call in sick the next day for work. On 01/28/2021 I stayed home and had sever body aches, bad headache, the chills and I felt nauseas. From my left hip to my left knee it felt like I had a bad charley horse. That night I got another low grade fever of about 100.1*. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and still had a headache. I took some Aleve and went back to sleep. I called in sick again the next day and that day I was a little better only had a headache, a little nauseas and body was only a little sore. I went to bed and am fine today. A note I have never tested positive to COVID-19 and I test weekly.

                                                Eleven days after the vaccination the patient developed 2 days of heartburn followed by a worsening nonproductive cough, substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, palpitations, and an episode of near syncope. These worsened over about 6 days and then slowly decreased. During this time he was referred to the ED and then admitted to a civilian host nation hospital. Echocardiogram and CT scan were performed and a paericardial cyst was discovered measuring 7.4 cm. He was then referred to another facility for evasluation. The pericardial cyst was confirmed, now 6.5 cm and laboratory tests were performed on 4 FEB, but there was at that time no elevation in inflammatory markers. Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery consultations were obtained, but the consultants and the attending physician (who is an infectious disease physician by training) did not think that the crescendo-decrescendo symptoms could be explained by the pericardial cyst, which was likely an incidental finding. A milder cough may have preceded these events by up to a year, and this may possibly be related to the cyst. The heartburn, chest pain, tachycardia, diaphoresis, palpitations, and near syncope may well be adverse reactions of the vaccine.

As a result I felt the need to go to bed early at about 9:30 PM. At about midnight I woke up with severe chills and intense body aches. I didnt get much sleep but the chills went away before 6:00 AM. The achiness remained but not as intense. I then had a migraine with a lost of appetite and more fatigue most of the day on February 10. Around 4:00 PM on the 10th all the symptoms suddenly started to leave and I began to feel normal.
