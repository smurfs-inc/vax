                                                I woke up around 3 am because of body aches. The body aches worsened and i checked and had a fever of 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit. My head started to pound and my pulse was accelerated to probably 80 bpm (normally rest at 60 bpm). I felt a little lightheaded and  a bit nauseas. I took 2 200 mg tablets of EC ibuprofen and did not take Tylenol because i knew my immune response needed to take its course. it is about 3:33 in the afternoon and my body is still aching but my fever has dissipated and I still have a headache that throbs when I walk.

                                                Initially, around 1500hrs on Monday, January 4th, roughly 40 minutes after the injection, I developed a scratchy throat, a headache, and nausea.  I got home from work, and having no appetite due to nausea, I fell asleep on the couch around 1800hrs. Severe fatigue had set in. I did not wake up until 0500hrs the next morning to go to work on January 5th. I felt like I had not slept at all, however the scratchy throat had gone away. I worked all day with the nausea and headache. Throughout the day I developed chills, cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, and I felt like my mind was foggy (I had felt feverish since Monday night, but Tuesday was the first time I took my temperature that showed I had a fever.) I went home that night and slept all evening and well into the next morning. On the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, my symptoms had again gotten worse, so I called my primary care physician. He fit me in and tested me for the flu and for COVID. He prescribed me Ibuprofen for the headache/fever, and Ondansetron for the nausea/vomiting. My flu test came back negative on Thursday, January 7th, and my COVID test came back negative on Friday, January 8th. The fever finally broke on Friday evening and Saturday, January 9th  was the first day I woke up without a fever.  I still have the headache as of today, January 11th, and a low grade fever has returned. I am still very fatigued as well.

                                                Throat started to tighten about 10 minutes after shot. 50mg of Benadryl helped stop it. About 20 hours later, throat tightened again. Benadryl did not help and tongue started to swell. Called doctor and he prescribed Pepcid and Medtral dose pack. Throat still not 100 percent at time of report filing, but it is better than it is much better than before.  Vaccine also caused severe nausea and upset stomach.

On the way back to the bedroom I felt my blood pressure bottom out and lost consciousness briefly and regained consciousness lying on the floor and my wife helping me up. I was able to make it to the bathroom and lay against the toilet because I thought I was going to throw up. I had that same feeling of my blood pressure dropping and again lost consciousness and regained consciousness with my head laying on the toilet seat. I also had sever chills and body aches, particularly in the neck area. I also struggled talking and communicating with my wife. She tells me I wasn?t making sense and my words were slurred.

                                                Severe arm soreness and pain  Approximately 20 hours after vaccine administration I had the absolute worst nausea and yellow bile come up from violently, super violently having thrown up multiple times.  I woke up with an empty stomach, since I&#39;m 166 lbs and 5&#39; 11 3/4&#34; and I&#39;m very healthy in terms of all my blood tests and levels.  This nausea and full body soreness today approximately 23 hours is so severe that I feel obligated to report these serious adverse effects.

                                                Roughly 15 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started to develop muscle aches. Within 30 minutes of the aches, they became severe. Aches were primarily located in the lower back, shoulders, hips, and calves. 30 minutes following,  I started to feel very fatigued and had labored breathing. Another 1.5 later, I developed chills and had flu like symptoms. By the afternoon, I had broken into a fever and had mild nausea. Besides the muscle aches, as one symptom onset, the others seemed to fade away. By 5:00 in the evening, (roughly 25 hours after receipt of vaccine) the symptoms quickly subsided. The only residual side-effects within the rest of a 48 hour period were soreness in the area of the injection, and mild headache.

I fell asleep and kept waking up with stomach pains worsening. Around 12:45 AM on 04/29/2021 I drove myself to the Hospital and by around 3:30 AM I was told that I needed to have my appendix out. I did not have any symptoms prior to having the vaccine.  I was transferred to another Hospital to have surgery around 10 AM on 04/29/2021 to remove the appendix. The surgery was successful. I was sent home the morning of 04/30/2021.

An echocardiogram showed a mild to moderate decrease in LV systolic function with global hypokinesis.  Cardiac MRI findings were consistent with acute myopericarditis with underlying non-ischemic cardiomyopathy disproportionate to the degree of myocarditis. The patient was discharged on a beta-blocker.

The patient was told to sit down and wait for 20 minutes after administration. The patient was walking around the pharmacy and talking. The covid ambassador reinteriated to the patient to sit back down. A few minutes after sitting down, he admitted he should have listened and proceeded to tell the pharmacist of his symptoms. The pharmacist clarified if his throat was closing up or was it itchy. The patient said it was a little itchy and a little difficult to breathe. The pharmacist gave the patient 25mg of liquid benadryl. The pharmacist continued to monitor the patient. The patient said he felt chills in his hands a few minutes later but he was no longer feeling nauseous. The patient did not claim to have any allergies on his form or any previous allergies he was aware of. The pharmacist followed up with the patient 5 minutes after his claim of chills. He said he can breathe better but still had the chills. The patient sat in the chair for approximately one hour while the pharmacist monitored him. He called a relative to come pick him up. He told the pharmacist his ride was there and he felt much better before leaving. The pharmacist told him to rest and monitor his symptoms. If the symptoms came back or got worse he needs to call 911 or go to the emergency room.

Shortly after upon falling asleep, I started getting the chills and felt as though I had a fever. Waking up in the morning, I had a painful throbbing headache. My muscles ached and I felt very fatigued. I was unable to get out of bed due to said fatigue. I felt as though I had a temperature, but did not take it at that juncture. I had no appetite. When I did manage to stand, the headache would throb and I felt nauseated. Later that evening, I had a slight fever of 100.8 degrees fahrenheit. The following morning, I felt nearly recovered, but my head would still throb when changing positions, but not with the same severity as the previous day. Headache slightly persists to this day.

Once the Benadryl runs out then I start to feel an itch and the itch leaded to that whole area red and bumpy. The only thing I have gotten so far is a steroid and Benadryl. only thing that works is the Benadryl.   When I first went into the ER I went because I got hive and ive never had hives before in my life.   I went 3 days later because I had a migraine, felt sick and had trouble swallowing.

I had chills, a headache, fatigue, and nausea. The chills were severe. I couldn&#39;t get much sleep. In the morning and throughout the next day, I maintained a fever between 99 and 100 and felt fatigued and loss of appetite. I took 2 iBruprofen at 200mg each ever 4-6 hours. The fever never broke. I took NyQuil at 8PM on 4/8/21 to subdue the fever. I had night sweats and slept through the night. Today on 4/9/21 I have no fever. Although,  my arm is swollen at the injection site, red, and in pain. I am icing it and moving it around to subdue the swelling.

He states he also had significant abdominal cramping that was debilitating.

                                                Approximately two days after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine, I developed severe acute abdominal pain, and was diagnosed with an acute appendicitis requiring emergency surgery. After the surgery was completed, I was told that, based on clinical presentation, along with onset of symptoms, the infection was more advanced than would have been expected. After surgery, I developed an ileus, a systemic infection, as well as an abscess which required a drain to be placed in my pelvis. I was inpatient in the hospital for 9 days due to these complications, and it is my belief that there is not only a correlation between receiving the second dose of the vaccine and developing this appendicitis, but a causation. Though I have not seen any reported cases, I know that there were at least seven reported cases of appendicitis with the Pfizer variant, and the technologies are very similar.

                                                Friday (Day of shot): Fairly typical symptoms (soreness in arm, cough and sore throat, headache, and fatigue) Saturday (24hrs): Same symptoms as above, but slightly worse than day before. In addition, both feet (on top) began itching later into day. Sunday (48 hrs):  Typical symptoms began disappearing, itch on feet became more intense, bottoms of feet and ankles started to itch as well. Monday (72 hours): Typical symptoms virtually disappeared. Itching became progressively worse throughout the day on feet/ankles, and various small areas of body (abdomin, back of knees, inside of elbows/forearms) became itchy. Hives and rashes noticed over entire body later in afternoon. Hives/rashes were either single (unraised) isolated red dots, clustered and raised red patches, or clusters of small &#34;braille-like&#34; bumps (clusters and bumps area-size ranged anywhere from quarter-sized to palm-sized). Most noticeable areas were upper left back/shoulder, both sides of abdomin, groin, front/inner thighs, behind both knees, inner forearms, and both ankles and feet (top and bottom). Sore throat also came back on Monday afternoon, and over ~2 hr became itchy, then constricted with trouble swallowing, then restricted/strained breathing. Went to ER after noticed trouble swallowing, given epinehrine shot in  left leg. Throat slowly went back to normal over the next 1-2 hours. From 05/18 through today (3 weeks, and still ongoing),  rashes and hives have been diminished in size and amount, but are present both in pre-existing and new areas of body. Rashes/hives may last 1-2 days after developing or be on-going (feet and ankles). No prior history of allergies. No change in diet, lifestyle, soaps/detergents, environment at time of reaction.

                                                11:05- lightheaded, nausea, chills. Laid on the ground for probably an hour recovering. Once home, I noticed my chest feel a deep sore, achey. I chalked it up to the side effects, until i went mountain biking and had to turn around after there was so much resistance and pressure in my chest. I&#39;m glad I turned around when I did. It continued to be a deep constant pressure for over a week after the shot. Eventually the pressure subsided but I also didn&#39;t do any physical activities after the mountain biking experience.  As i tld the Dr.s this same story they told me I should have gone to the emergency room... Of course I didn&#39;t know, so I went about my life just reducing physical activity. I went in for my second shot today and was informed of the new possible linkage between myocarditis and vaccines. What the Dr.&#39;s described (I had two in the room this time because of the way I reacted to the first shot) was exactly what I felt after the first shot. If I was having the same symptoms, as recently discovered, but only after the first one, I wasn&#39;t going to try and find out if I would die from this second one or how much worse the inflammation would be.  I will disclose, pertinent or not, that I am a small individual at 5&#39;7, 120.

                                                From May 14, 2021, I have started experience dizziness and weakness in my body. There has been slight fever during the initial days but the weakness and mild headache is still there till today i.e. June 9 2021. I do experience a little shortness of breath and chest pain (on both sides) sometimes but that is not continuous and remains normal most of the time. I have got stomach infection and constipation too during these times and I have taken a pill of Prilosec upon prescription of doctor. Stomach looks good and bowel movement is fine as of now. I have been monitoring my blood pressure and body temp during these days and they all were normal.    Apart from that I experience chills more than anyone around me and don&#39;t know if that is related to vaccine effect.  Currently, my main concerns are - mild headache, weakness in body and dizziness which is happening for almost a month now.

                                                I started to develop the following symptoms fever,  joint pain, shortness of breathe, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain by 7:00 AM on Saturday 6th, and subsequently they increased until the only thing I could to was only lay in bed, during the night the shivering awfull, there was a point when my whole body was stiff and I wasn&#39;t able to move (or at least that was my perception at that point) the fever, joint pain, shortness of breathe, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain increased and by 3 AM I was vomiting. I took medication for the pain but the symptoms were lessened not for much, I remained in bed until 2:30 PM on Sunday 7th. I am still weakened, fatigued and with a slight shortness of breath, I am assuming by tomorrow I will be feeling better. No regrets whatsoever.

                                                I have felt horrible since receiving the second dose of Moderna. I felt profoundly fatigued, sore all over, and nauseated for 18 or so hours. Since then I have been feeling nauseated after I eat. I cannot eat like I normally do and it has been almost five days. If this persists through the weekend I will visit my doctor next week.

By 5 pm the day after I had stomach/abdominal pain aches, nausea and fatigue. The fever started at 100. That night I woke up at least once an hour from the pain. I had to throw up. The next day I woke up drenched in sweat and with the chills and a fever of 101.5, I think. And then the joint pain started. Especially in my knees. I applied icee hot and drank some pepto. And only ate a few crackers to have something in my body, tried to drink a lot of electrolytes. By Sunday night I woke up every hour from joint pain, especially my knees and lower back. I woke up in the middle of the night shivering and unable to get warm. I took a warm shower, and had to sit on the ground and just let the warm water run. My knees were in so much pain I couldn?t stand. Monday morning I woke up with a fever of 100 but tolerable joint and stomach pain. By Monday afternoon my fever had gone down, but still has abdominal pain, headache and mild joint pain.  I Was able to eat dinner chicken soup. Then Tuesday woke up fatigued and mild to low abdominal and now muscle pain.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Heavy fatigue, muscle and joint pain primarily in the back, chills, nausea and vomiting (2 instances of vomiting), and fever on and off that maxed out at 100.9 degrees. These began around 1AM approximately 9 hours after vaccination.  Side effects most strongly felt within 36 hours of receiving vaccination.  Continued fatigue, chills, night sweats and muscle pain for two additional days (Thursday 3/11, Friday 3/12) that gradually subsided over those days. Appeared to be a slight rash around the injection site for several days after. I previously had the COVID-19 virus in late March 2020.

His doctor recommended pre-medicating with diazepam 5mg to reduce anxiety and hopefully prevent  syncope.  He initially did well for a minute or two, then fainted for a few seconds, woke up, felt nauseous, vomited,  then fainted again for a few seconds.  Once he woke up, he felt much better.  He waited a few extra minutes and went home.

Vomiting and diarrhea began at the onset of symptoms as well. Vomiting stopped after 24 hours. Diarrhea continues to be an issue. Nausea continues through the entire period; however, the current nausea could be contributed to the lack of food over the last 2 days as well as dehydration. Aching joints also continue to be a problem mostly in the lower back area.   Treatment was bed rest for 48 hours as well as 1000mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours. Gatorade/Powerade was drank as could be tolerated.

                                                Patient came in to get his second dose of Moderna. After the inoculation, he was assigned to wait in the post-vaccination chair for 15minutes. After 5 minutes in, he began to feel dizzied, chill, sweaty, stomach pain, and wanting to vomit. He gave us permission to call 911 for him. We gave him a cold compressed to put around his neck while he waited for paramedic to arrived. They came and took his vital signs and asked couple questions. His vital signs were good and they discovered that he did not have lunch, he only had breakfast for the day. He felt a lot better after 20 minutes so he got released by the paramedic to go home.

                                                Injection site was left arm below the shoulder around the tricep.  The injection site began itching several hours after injection. Itching was low in intensity.  The injection site swelled noticeably.  I went to sleep but I woke around 4 AM with an intense headache, nausea, slightly blurred vision, and a fever. Throughout the remaining day my fever got up to 101F.  Other symptoms included muscle ache and fatigue.  The injection site began intermittently pulsating/twitching the evening of 5/20/21.  On Friday morning 5/21 the intermittent twitching spread to my left fingers.   The blurry vision, headache, and nausea gradually went away.  All symptoms were gone by morning of 5/22.  I did not take any medication throughout.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    In April 2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 17-May-2021, the patient experienced VOMITING (vomiting). On an unknown date, the patient experienced BELL&#39;S PALSY (might have what looked like bells palsy on one side of his face) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (second dose appointment was scheduled for 15May2021 which he missed), NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDER (neurologic spasm up and down his spine), MUSCLE RIGIDITY (serious rigid back in the middle of his back) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes along his neck/ has swollen lymph nodes). The patient was treated with CANNABIS at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, BELL&#39;S PALSY (might have what looked like bells palsy on one side of his face), PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (second dose appointment was scheduled for 15May2021 which he missed), NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDER (neurologic spasm up and down his spine), MUSCLE RIGIDITY (serious rigid back in the middle of his back) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes along his neck/ has swollen lymph nodes) outcome was unknown and VOMITING (vomiting) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 05-May-2021, Olfactory test: negative (normal) negative but it was 24 hour test.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications reported. Treatment medication not reported.  This case concerns a 28-year-old male patient who received first dose of mRNA-1273 and missed second dose (missed dose.  The patient experienced additional events after first dose for which based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. vomiting is consistent with known safety profile of the vaccine.  However, patient was on multiple concomitant medications which confounds the reported events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28-year-old male patient who received first dose of mRNA-1273 and missed second dose (missed dose.

They scheduled an ultrasound of my left breast and a CT of my lower abdomen and pelvis. I have a 3-month follow-up for the lymph nodes and they found minor prostatitis in my abdomen. I was proscribed CIPRO for prostatitis. I then had a rare reaction to the CIPRO which caused my Achilles and patellar tendons to swell and become inflamed. Now I can hardly walk. Prior to all this, I was very active.

                                                Injection arm became very sore at around 1 PM, around four hours after the injection of dose two. Around 6 PM, began noticing overall body soreness and fatigue. A headache began soon after, and remained throughout the night. I barely slept because my arm and shoulder hurt so bad, and I also was sweating and shivering. I woke up many times.   At 8am on 06/24 I woke up with a severe headache and nausea. My injection arm and shoulder was very sore. My body overall ached, joints and muscles. I almost called into work but decided to go.   I took 500mg of acetaminophen at 10:25am.  At 10:30am at work, I was still very sore and noticed I was mildly disoriented. My coworkers commented on my look of fatigue.  Around 1pm, my disorientation and fatigue began to alleviate somewhat, and my headache had resolved by that time.  Currently it is 8:51pm. I worked the whole day at work, though it was difficult with the body aches and exhaustion. I have a mild headache, general fatigue and soreness, and my  injection arm is still very sore.

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

                                                At 3 AM, 12 hours following the vaccine administration, I awoke with severe fever/chills, body aches and severe headache, which progressed to nausea and vomiting x 3 episodes and was very sick for one day, home bound and could not work.  This reaction was due to I believe the fact I had positive antibodies from a positive infection 8 months prior.  I had laboratory evidence of a positive serum antibody titer following the infection.  Was this vaccine studied in regards to patients who received the vaccine? because I believe it needs further study before it is given to patients who have already developed immunity from acquiring the actual COVID disease.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

                                                I started developing issues with swallowing six hours after I was vaccinated. This resulted in a panic attack. I was able to calm myself down and used Benadryl several hours later.  It seemed to help with the swallowing issue and I went to bed. I woke up this morning (03/06/21) feeling much better. I still infrequently have trouble swallowing liquids. I?ve continued to take Benadryl. The feeling of tightness in my throat is located in my superior throat. My breathing - to my knowledge - has remained unobstructed the entire time. If I don?t return to normal by Monday, I will be visiting the center on campus.

                                                syncopal episode- 1:33 pm individual fell head-first off from chair in observation area and hit her head. I was called over by the observation person that someone needed attention right away. I ran over the individual was lying on the floor and her husband was sitting on a chair right next to her. He said she fainted and fell forward. The individual appeared to be unconscious when I arrived and was very diaphoretic. I loudly asked if she was okay and then tapped her chest. She looked up at me and said ?oh snap.? She was oriented to person and place and her pupils were equal, round, and reactive. She denied that she had any tingling in her arms or legs. She said she heard everyone talking to her, but thought she was dreaming. She said that she has a history of passing out with finger-pricks (she cannot donate blood anymore because of this), shots, and she passed out when she got a piercing in the past. She said she felt her HR slowly starting to climb, but she felt she would be okay. She said she then started feeling lightheaded and passed out. I took HR BP at  1:35 128/74, 62 and again 5 minutes later 128/80, 62. Individual was given an ice pack for her head. She had a bump on the upper right side of forehead. She said she had not eaten or drank much before her shot. She said her stomach was a little upset. She was given water and granola bars and sat up for a while before standing up. She asked if I thought she should get her head checked out. I said it is never a bad idea to get checked and since she did hit her head hard enough for a bump to happen right away. Individual was feeling better before she left, stating just her head hurt. We told her to ice and ibuprofen or Tylenol to treat discomfort.

                                                Mild dry cough beginning Wednesday (about 24 hours after vaccination) and becoming a moderate cough on Thursday into Friday, calming back into a mild cough later on Friday and nearly gone as of now (Saturday afternoon). Throat felt dry during the same period, leading to unusually high water intake and frequent urination, and briefly some discomfort and slight pain around the front-right part of waist that I assume was due to too much water and urination. Also Thursday night, I had some potential chills ? but no fever when I checked Friday morning. Also during this three-day period I felt fatigue, and lay in bed most of the day Friday. Also during this three-day period  I was congested and had a runny nose, but I have had those for weeks presumably due to allergies  Today I feel mostly but not quite healthy.

                                                This is a secondary VAERS for the same pt. Pt originally was very anxious before the vaccine, got the vaccine and subsequently had lightheadedness and nausea. He was treated for this by laying him down which resolved his sx&#39;s almost immediately. Vitals were all normal. He denies CP, SOB, nausea resolved and so did his lightheadedness. About 6 hours after the vaccine, pt was seen in the ER for a seizure. Pt has a hx of a brain tumor with surgical removal. No sz since March 2020, per pt. He was treated for a sz and for sinusitis.

Saw Doctor on 2/3/21  Thought this was a stomach bug and took antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole), this did not work and made it worse 2 weeks after leading to heavy diarrhea.   Saw my primary care doctor 3/29/21. Ran tests and positive for C. Diff.   10 days on Vancomycin (finished 4/18/21) This seemed to help all C. Diff related symptoms, but now back to original lower left abdominal pain and stomach noises/ rumbling.

                                                30 April 2021: I had slight soreness at the site of injection that morning that gradually got a little worse overall by the evening... no other noticeable symptoms. Had a protein bar and cold brew coffee for breakfast prior to vaccination. Approx. 45 min after the vaccination I ate a donut, then an hour later a ham &amp; swiss sandwich for lunch. For diner approx. 8 hours later, I ate a KFC chicken sandwich and an order of popcorn chicken.  01 May 2021:  I woke up with it feeling a bit more sore than in the evening... still very tolerable though... 3/10 overall on a pain chart... throughout the morning through mid-afternoon I felt no other noticeable symptoms. Ate a protein bar and some cold brew coffee for breakfast that morning, but nothing else before my AE.  At 17:05 Pacific I get a work-related phone call from a client (I work in IT as an executive support specialist) and assist them for approx. 30-40 minutes. At that point I&#39;m working on my laptop sitting cross-legged in bed.  Adverse event: During that call, I start to notice that I&#39;m slightly more sensitive to motion as usual, making me dizzy if I move around too much. By the end of the call, I&#39;m feeling dizzy but I attribute it to hunger. Some time around 18:30 Pacific, I go downstairs to eat. However, by the time I get downstairs and try to prepare some sushi, I feel so dizzy I need to sit down on the couch to stop the room from spinning. I go upstairs a couple minutes later to try and sleep it off. I&#39;m laying on my back at that point. I think I rested for about 25-35 minutes with my room dark. I then get up slowly to see if things got better but everything is still spinning and is getting worse. I try to rest in bed more, alternating laying on my back and my right side but it&#39;s still getting worse. Sometime around approx. 20:00 Pacific, I go to the bathroom to puke but nothing really comes out since I hadn&#39;t eaten since the morning. I go back to my room to try and sleep it all off.  From that evening on 01 May 2021 to 04 May 2021, I&#39;d sleep 12-15 hours on average each day to get rid of the nausea and dizziness. I normally sleep 6-7.5 hours (bad sleeping habits due to work/surfing the web on phone - never resulted in these symptoms before though). It gradually went away until going away almost completely by the 04 May. However, as of 10 May I still feel like the potential for the nausea is there... just ever so slightly lingering as a slight heavy feeling in my head that feels like it will spiral out of control if I start spinning around too much. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s just due to my relative lack of sleep since 05 May (more bad sleeping habits). Otherwise, I feel back to normal.

                                                Acute localized lower back pain along with localized lower abdominal pain. Difficult to explain sensations, almost like a catch in lower-mid spine, along with abdominal pain in relatively the same area.   Feels like someone kicked me square in the middle of the spine. Possibly kidney pain? Tends to come in intense waves of pain, with a lingering dull ache seperating the more intense spasms.   The abdominal pain reminds me of a bowel obstruction I had a while back, almost like someone has taken a section of my intestines with both hands and is violently stretching it apart. No diahrrea, or constipation - as far as I can tell.  Lying down or propping and supporting the back does nothing to help with the back pain. Neither does any OTC pain relievers such as Acetaminophen or Naproxen, and as a result sleep is very difficult.

                                                A couple of days after the vaccine, my lymph nodes in armpits were swollen and neck lymph nodes were swollen for a couple days. It was uncomfortable nut not painful. No fever, no malaise. I did feel nauseous during this time. 2 weeks after my vaccine (around 05/22/2021) I had a weird sensation that my left arm went numb and I couldn&#39;t really control it 100%. I went to the ER because I thought I was having a stroke and because of my experience with Bells Palsy. They didn&#39;t do anything because I was in the lobby waiting for 2-3 hours and they seemed rushed and they told me that I must&#39;ve been sitting in weird position because my arm went numb. They didn&#39;t do any tests.

                                                I got the 2nd dose on 06/06/2021 and then for a couple days after my heart was pounding and I was just tired. I felt tightening in my chest, intermittent pain in upper back. Periodically this would come in waves. My hands felt like pins and needles kind of flushed over my body. It was mainly hands and feet but I would feel it in my face and sometimes arms and legs. I did go to the ER about a week after 2nd dose (around 06/13/2021). They told me it could&#39;ve been anxiety and stress. They did an EKG, blood work, and x-ray and didn&#39;t find anything abnormal. I did f/u with PCP and I just went last week and explained symptoms there as well and they&#39;re looking into my issues. They told me today I had a high white blood cell count and that my liver has elevated enzymes. They want me to come in the middle of July to do more fasting blood work. No fever, no malaise, but I did feel tired and fatigued and nauseous. I had bad brain fog and my body felt like it wasn&#39;t mine. It was like someone took my brain and put inside someone else&#39;s body. 1 week after 2nd dose I had bad sinus pressure behind eyes like my eyes were going to burst out of skull.

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

                                                30 yo man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED for chest pressure and SOB that started this morning when he woke up. It was a constant 8/10 pressure squeezing at the sides of his sternum with the sensation of a plate pushing down on his sternum, that worsened by taking deep breaths. He had never experienced anything like it before. The pain was neither worsened with exertion nor relieved by rest. It did not change with position, and it did not radiate to his arm/neck. He denies any tenderness to palpation of his chest. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not provide any relief. At time of interview denies SOB and reports decrease in chest tightness to 2/10. CP was significantly relieved with a bolus of normal saline in the ED. Tylenol also effectively reduced his pain. Of note, the patient received the second Moderna COVID vaccine shot 3 days ago. For 2 days after receiving the second shot he experienced fevers, chills, nausea, and intermittent vomiting (10 bouts of non-bloody emesis).

First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

                                                During the 15 minute observation period after injection, patient returned to the check-in desk complaining of dizziness. He was brought immediately to exam room where he became pale, diaphoretic, and stated he &#34;felt like he was in a dream.&#34; Seated BP was 74/palp. He was placed in supine position on exam table, cool compresses placed on forehead and back of neck. He complained of some nausea, which quickly improved. He never lost consciousness. His color and alertness improved steadily over the next 10 minutes. Repeat BP (lying) was 100/50. After a few minutes he sat up on exam table, dangling legs. BP remained stable at 110/60, HR 84. He continued to improve and stated that he felt better, drank some water and ate some goldfish crackers. Reported that he just remembered he had not eaten since lunch. After another 5-10 minutes he was alert, oriented, able to walk unassisted. Final BP 114/70, HR 80. His wife remained with him and confirmed she could drive him home. Discussed that although I feel confident this was a vasovagal near-syncope, if symptoms recur or worsen, he should go to ER for evaluation. Understanding verbalized.

The morning after, the patient had body aches and a headache, and took 500mg of acetaminophen at approximately 5am.  The patient also noticed swelling at the injection site (raised and approx 5 inches in diameter) and itching at this time as well. The patient took another 500mg of acetaminophen at 2pm, 200mg of ibuprofen at 3pm, and complained of a sensation of hypersensitivity and mild &#34;burning&#34; across the skin. These symptoms subsided by about 5pm, and patient felt well enough to stand up and have a small meal before returning to bed. At that point (~5pm), they developed a low fever (temp fluctuated between 99.5-100.6F), and took 400mg of ibuprofen and another 500mg of acetaminophen, and their temperature reduced to 98.6 at approximately 8PM. Afterwards, the patient had fatigue and some aches, and the swollen arm has not subsided at the time of report entry (~42 hours after vaccination).

                                                Patient felt lightheaded, dizzy, and nauseated within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine. He was sweating excessively and hyperventilating . He was unable to stand up, so he lay on the floor in front of the pharmacy until paramedics arrived. He was transported out of the store by the paramedics.

                                                Because of my celiac condition, I avoid eating products with wheat and gluten in them. However, occasionally it is unavoidable, such as with traveling. Typical reactions include fatigue, headache, mild brain fog, irritability, and watery bowel movements for up to 3 days following ingestion. However, since receiving the Moderna vaccine I have encountered wheat products 3 times; in all three cases the reaction was much more severe and included whole-body ache for 5-7 days, insomnia for 2-3 days, dry heaving for 24 hours, extreme sensitivity to motion/motion sickness for up to 3 days, intense gastrointestinal discomfort for up to 7 days, constipation and diarrhea, severe congestion, shortness of breath, elevated heart rate, confusion or disorientation, and an overall elevated level of symptoms lasting from 4-7 days depending on the amount ingested.

I laid down and these feelings seemed to pass after 30 min.   Later that day I started to feel a strange feeling in my head that is hard to describe. It is a combination of light headedness, slight dizziness, and general head fog. These symptoms have persisted for 7 days now. They were mild to start and have gotten increasingly worse the last 2 days. The symptoms make it hard or impossible to focus on work depending on the severity at the time. I feel these symptoms whether I am sitting down or moving around, although it seems to be most pronounced when I am moving.   Today was the first day I that I had to call in sick to work. I have not yet sought medical treatment, but as symptoms are worsening, this will be my next course of action.   I have found

All &#34;known&#34; side effects so far, but I got all of them essentially simultaneously. I didn&#39;t think I needed to report if it&#39;s under 72 hours since injection since it is all &#34;known&#34; but my mother pressured me to file a report :)  Spo2 levels 95-100, elevated heartrate (90-100), taste and smell are fine, no cough so far

On the way back He was leaning over. Our tech and I helped him. He then said his throat was closing and then he started struggling to breathe and his arms looked red and rashed. Gave dose of Epipen in left thigh and had tech call 911. His breathing got easier (just fast) Then said he felt like he was going to throw up (he did not) EMTs arrived about 1:07pm and checked him out and said everything 100%. His wife got him some food and he sat in waiting area for a bit and then was able to walk away. Did not go to hospital. EMTsaid probably not an allergic reaction just fright of having vaccine. He was smiling and laughing a bit by the time he left

                                                One week after vaccine, I became incredibly dehydrated, began vomitting and within 2hrs spiked a 104.4 degree F fever. I had uncontrollable shakes, chills &amp; hot flashes. Tylenol wouldn&#39;t reduce my fever. I was taken to the ER where I was given fluids, potassium and magnesium which eventually calmed my fever. My blood pressure was very low as well. I tested negative for COVID-19 and Mono. No clear indication of cause resulted from chest xray and CT scan. Later small nodules were detected in my lung. Doctor&#39;s referred this as a viral reaction but couldn&#39;t determine a cause. I was discharged from the hospital after being there about 6hrs. The next day I was lethargic but felt almost back to normal. Within 36 hours I felt 100% and like nothing ever happened.

                                                Patient received his first Moderna COVID vaccine. While he was waiting the 15 minutes he started to feel pressure behind his eyes, started sweating profusely, felt dizzy, and nauseous.  I had the patient go into the IMZ room where I had him sit down.  I took his blood pressure. His heart rate was 55 bpm and his blood pressure was around 110/70.  He was not having any trouble breathing or had any signs of anaphylaxis (swelling of throat, tongue, lipps, etc). I had him remain seated and talked to him for 5 minutes. He felt like he was starting to come out of it and we took his blood pressure again.  His heart rate and gone back up to 65 and his blood pressure was around 135/75.  I had the patient remain seated for another 5-10 minutes.  Took his bp again and the numbers were similar to the second one that was previously mentioned.  He wanted to stand up and see how he was feeling.  He stood up right outside the pharmacy for another 15 minutes and said that he felt back to normal.  I explained that in the previous case where this happened to a woman they recommended she have someone drive her home and I recommended he do the same.  He seemed to think he was fine and I believe he was planning to drive himself home.

                                                Migraine onset at approximately time of waking up, 8:00am the day following the vaccine dose. Migraine symptoms: sensitivity to light, facial pain at front of forehead descending into teeth/jaw, nausea when walking or attempting to use desktop computer. Combination of caffeine pills (150mg) and ibuprofen/acetaminophen (alternating every 4 hours) produced some relief. Migraine stopped causing symptoms at approximately 9:00pm the same day.

Next morning 5/5/21 had headache.  At 11am took nap and was having an episode almost like &#34;sleep paralysis&#34; where he would wake up feeling like he couldn&#39;t move and gasping for air.  He reports he did this sleeping and waking for about 1 hour (he had no problems sleeping the night before.)  He woke up after an hour and had vomited in his sleep - he thinks he choked a bit on it.  But when he woke up his breathing was normal, movement normal.   He then only experienced fatigue and headache for the rest of the day.  Then by next day felt totally normal.

Fever lasted for over 24hrs. The worst of the fever was about 12 hrs after the shot and lasted 6-8hrs. Acetaminophen 500mg helped momentarily quell the fever for about 1hr after each dose. Nausea increased as the fever decreased. As an otherwise healthy adult, this vaccine could easily cause serious complications due to high fever in others who experience the same symptoms. It is unlikely I will ever get a similar vaccine again. The effects were TERRIBLE.

                                                Reporting primary symptoms: headache, fever, lightheadedness, elevated heart rate, arm soreness, muscle soreness, back pain, nausea, suppressed appetite, anxiety, and panic attacks. (see below for more information) Initially, felt faint and lightheaded. Stood up and the feeling worsened. Within five minutes, felt nauseated and clammy. Also, appeared pale in the face. Was given instructions to sit, close eyes, and take deep breaths. Applied a cool, wet rag to the face and neck as needed. Was anxious and may have had a panic attack triggered by the experience. Heart rate had elevated, but not to a concerning level. Within 30 minutes of initial vaccine administration, face was no longer pale and heart rate was lowering. Other symptoms mostly subsided within 90 minutes of the vaccine administration. The next morning (5/19/21), woke with a mild headache, low grade fever, some fatigue, slight nasal congestion, and very sore arm. Took Tylenol for fever and it was mostly gone by the next day (5/20/21). Felt well enough Saturday (5/22/21) morning for lots of physical activity (push-mowed lawn in humid conditions) and only had a mild headache and mild fatigue afterward. No notable symptoms on Sunday (5/23/21) morning, but had indigestion, gas pain, and some soreness (back muscle) late that night. Stayed up a little later than normal. Woke a few hours early (around 4:30 am) on Monday (5/24/21) with throbbing low-to-mid, left-side back pain and worsened indigestion and gas pain. Had anxiety that led to a panic attack. Did not feel well and tried stretching, taking Tums, deep breathing, used the bathroom, and walked around. This was helpful enough to return to sleep. Woke up again at 8:45 am and had a mild headache, some soreness in neck/shoulders, and anxiety about the situation. Took a shower, did some deep breathing, and tried to relax. Drank some caffeine at noon, but the headache was not relieved. Appetite was somewhat suppressed and was mildly lightheaded. Stomach became more unsettle by night. Stopped all caffeine intake and NSAID usage (and still no intake/usage at the time of this report). At night, anxiety over the situation worsened, so tried deep breathing, talking to others about the situation, and stretching. Panic attack occurred, but was able to manage with the aforementioned techniques. Woke the next day (5/25/21) with mild headache, muscle soreness in mid-to-upper back, shoulders, and neck, suppressed appetite, and anxiety. Was able to manage most symptoms with breathing, stretching, relaxing,  and talking through the situation. No panic attack on 5/25/21. Went to bed earlier than normal (around 9:30 pm) and woke on 5/26/21 around 9:30 am. Had similar symptoms, but appetite was more decreased and worsened anxiety. Decided to see doctor that afternoon (see item 19 for more information on testing from that visit) and was told to give more time to recover from vaccine side effects. Did not give doctor information about anxiety or panic attacks at that time.  Had a panic attack (less severe than previous) Wednesday night and managed with the aforementioned techniques. Thursday (5/27/21) morning woke with no headache and no fever, but still some soreness in neck/shoulder area, suppressed appetite, mild fatigue, and mild anxiety about the situation. No panic attack on 5/27/21. Friday (5/28/21) woke with similar symptoms and decided to visit doctor again about anxiety. Was prescribed Buspar and Zoloft. After taking Buspar (first time ever) at 2:30 pm, experienced an increased heart rate up to 160bpm and a low fever up to 100.2F. Experienced another panic attack during this time. Sought medical assistance from local ER around 3:30 pm. Was seen and monitored until discharge at about 11:45 pm. During stay, tests and levels were mostly normal except during a panic attack that was triggered after blood was drawn. Treated with Vistaril around 11:20 pm and monitored for about 20 minutes before being discharged. Anxiety was relieved after deep breathing and relaxing. Did not take Zoloft. Slept and woke on 5/29/21 with mild headache, unsettled stomach, and mild anxiety. Anxiety is more manageable so far and other symptoms were somewhat improved after eating breakfast. Currently, no plans to continue taking Buspar, but will consult doctor.

                                                First dose: my face went numb and tongue felt itchy 1.5 hours roughly for symptoms.  No common side effects; Second dose: calling it a panic attack. Racing heart, felt like I was passing out, mental fogging, trouble swallowing lasted about 1.5 - 2 hours. After 2nd dose I had the normal side effects, headache, chills, body aches fatigue.. After about 2 days of common side effects I noticed I was having trouble swallowing and it felt like I was being choked pulse food regurgitation and diarrhea.  It kept getting worse and worse after a week or so of hell I get an emergency endoscopy showing I have  eosinophilic esophagitis.  I?ve been put on all sorts of meds that are supposed to be treating this but nothing is working.  It?s been near a month now and 2 weeks have been on a hard core elimination diet  symptoms are persistent and discomfort it spreading to what feels like intestines, kidneys and possibly other locations I now have to go in for a colonoscopy soon as the meds should be working and discomfort is spreading.  Loads of headaches can?t sleep with all the discomfort.  Never hungry.  Possible permanent esophagus damage maybe more everything is still being diagnosed and no one is really finding any answers why.  For the last 6 years I?ve been on a health kick working out almost daily and eating very healthy.  No symptoms no warning  signs these one or more diseases it has all just started out of the blue post vaccine nothing else in my life has changed.

                                                Immediately after injection patient stated he did not feel well and passed out. He was extremely diaphoretic and once he woke up began dry heaving and vomiting. He stated he was too dizzy to stand and just wanted to lie down. We called an ambulance to come and treat him. He explained to the paramedics he had been out drinking and partying late the night before and did not eat or drink anything before he came to get his vaccine. We determined that he was more dehydrated and hungover than having an actual reaction to the vaccine itself.

                                                Roughly 20 minutes after injection I quickly started to feel nauseous and light headed. I made me way back to the pharmacy (barely) which was around 50&#39; or less away. On my way there my vision started to fade away and go white then would come back. I made it to the counter, said I was sick, and collapsed on the ground as I could no longer stand. I quickly became more sick, became very hot, and started sweating badly. I needed to vomit but since I had not ate that day (not uncommon for me and the pharmacist was aware before I received the shot) I could not. At the same time as I was in the floor I had to put all of my concentration into not shitting my pants in front if everyone staring at me. I remember them asking me if I needed an ambulance and I don&#39;t remember responding or being able to process what was going on. They did call and ambulance and by the time they arrived I was feeling better. After collapsing they took my blood pressure while waiting for the ambulance and they told me afterward it was 81/61. When the EMT&#39;s were there they tested it several times and said it was normal. They also tested my blood sugar which was 111. They ran an EKG and said everything looked fine. They recommended I go to the hospital but I declined as I was afraid to get billed for it as well as not having a way back to my vehicle or most importantly someone to watch my dog. Though I probably should of gone. As an added possible beneficial piece of information, I went through a similar experience years ago when donating plasma.

                                                ~a week and a half after Vaccine, I experienced &#39;room spinning&#39; vertigo and dizziness at around 1am. I was sick for the next few hours, vomited for around the first hour after. Symptoms of dizziness for the next two days, then Vertigo/dizziness/vomiting again the following night. After around 3 more days, the symptoms subsided. I had my 2nd Moderna shot on 5/18/2021 (Lot 036C21A) and on 6/10/2021 the symptoms began again. After the first case, I saw online Urgent care and was referenced to an in-person visit to a primary care doctor. I was &#39;diagnosed&#39; with BPPV, which I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms of before. They ran me through several tests at the office, but by the time I got to the primary care doctor the symptoms had subsided again. I&#39;m currently still experiencing a light dizziness 24/7 since 6/10/2021.

                                                The event that I would consider abnormal (couldn&#39;t find info about it) was tachycardia. My resting heart beat when I&#39;m falling asleep is pretty low, 50s and 60s, and my heart was pounding. I have a fitbit and checked it, wondering why it felt like I had just drank a pot of coffee, and my heartbeat reached 108 at several points, including while lying in bed trying to sleep. This happened several times that day and I recall calling my doctor&#39;s office for advice. I think I was advised to come in if I felt worse or if new symptoms arose.   I also experienced: fever (99.2), aches, chills, headache, poor sleep (awake early), fatigue, arm pain and diarrhea. I took Tylenol extra strength and had to go to work as we were shortstaffed and I wasn&#39;t given much of a choice. I took some Benadryl to help me sleep and by the 30th, I was a bit tired, but my fever and the other symptoms were gone. I had some arm pain but it wasn&#39;t nearly as painful as it was on the 29th. By the 31st I believe all symptoms had resolved

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included allergy to cefaclor and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Concomitant medications reported included desvenlafaxine succinate, gabapentin and dexlansoprazole.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 11:30 am, approximately six hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the morning of 23 Dec 2020, prior to receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt &#34;achy&#34;.  At 5:30 pm, the patient experienced chills, fever to 102, GI upset and diarrhea. At 11:00 pm, the patient reported difficulty sleeping, GI upset, LOC x 2 and pallor. The patient was transported to the emergency room via ambulance.  A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test and routine labs were collected; however, results were not provided. Treatment for the events included paracetamol, unspecified intravenous (IV) medications, ondansetron and ketorolac tromethamine. The emergency room discharge diagnosis was stomach flu.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, GI upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever, were considered resolved on 24 Dec 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 31-year-old, male subject with a medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, who experienced the unexpected events of loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, and stomach flu, and the expected events of chills and fever. The events of chills, fever occurred approximately 6 hrs. and the events of GI upset, loss of consciousness, difficulty sleeping occurred after 12 hrs. after the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The time to onset for the events of GI upset and diarrhea were unknown. The reporter did not provide the causality assessment for the events. Due to the temporal association between the LOC and the administration of the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however, the subject&#39;s medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and other concurrent conditions of GI upset, diarrhea, and stomach flu remain as confounders.

The area around my ear remained 98.7*F. As it progressed I developed minor amounts of blotchy red areas along the hairline on the left side of my face only. Nothing occured on the right side of my body. Diarrhea developed with multiple episodes. All of this lasted approx. 3 hours before subsiding without treatment. I have had significant amount of vaccines and immunizations from the civilian and military sectors and never suffered this before.

I have not had covid and have not been sick since pandemic started. The following morning I woke up with a fever of 101 and extreme arm pain. As the morning progressed, I continued to have increasing fever even after taking Tylenol 500mg every 4-6 hours. My fever peaked at 104.7 by 3pm on 1/20, then started to come down after taking 400mg of ibuprofen. By 9pm on 1/20, my fever started to spike again and then I took more inbuprofen. As of 1/21, I am still having symptoms of being unwell and nausea, as well as low grade fever of 101. I do not have any covid symptoms (no cough, no loss of taste).

Saturdays diarrhea slowed down - and I went to ER - muscles were pushing - I felt my electrolytes were out of whack. I02 degree fever so they gave me Tylenol. They gave me two bags of fluids. My heartrate was in mid 120s when I went in and after fluids it went down to the 70&#39;s. I was discharged after that. I was swabbed for COVID - negative. Sunday I was still lethargic and fatigue; diarrhea slowed down quite a bit and I was able to eat some food. Monday I came back to work - not 100% in health but felt better.

He reported sudden sense of nausea, tunnel vision, headache and light sensitivity. He returned to the clinic shortly after leaving due to his condition. We had him rest in one of the outpatient rooms while monitoring his vitals, was also given an instant ice pack for his head. The pt. was prescribed Banophen (anti-histamine), Ondansetron for nausea and Ibuprofen 800mg for pain relief. He was given 6 TAB of both the Ondansetron and Ibuprofen but took 1 tablet of each of the 3 medications after coming into the exam room. Our patient relaxed in the room and was closely monitored for 45mins.-1hr. following coming back. Pt. began feeling better about 30mins. into his stay where he waited another 20-30mins. to ensure symptoms resided and he felt better. He was free to leave once better. Instructions were to contact our clinic or return if the headache or nausea returned or if his symptoms worsened.

I woke up around the10 am  the 25th.the next day. I had a migraine that wouldn&#39;t go away. I was feeling nauseous and still had a light sensitive headache. I took Migraine medication, and eventually mid afternoon the symptoms went away. Less than 24 hours later I was back to normal. March 4th I was using Gold Bond Ultimate Mens lotion and had an adverse reaction. My hand swelled up, and got red.  I took Benadryl and it went away. March 5th I used Curel lotion and the same thing happened. Did not take Benadryl.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine,  I started to feel slight pain in the injection site (my arm) reminiscent of a bruise. An hour later, I started to feel tired and weak, and the soreness in my arm worsened slightly. The pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  45 minutes later, I experienced stiffness in my neck and upper back, though that isn&#39;t unusual for me. I also started to feel nauseous and cold at that time, but the nausea subsided within an hour.  The severity of these symptoms stayed the same the rest of the evening. I went to bed at midnight, and woke the next morning at 8am. My arm where I had received the shot felt much more sore and painful, especially when I move it, and mainly when any pressure is applied to the area. I was woken by pain in my arm when I payed on that side of my body. The pain is now a 4, but a 7 when pressure is applied. It is now 12:30 pm.

                                                On the day of the vaccination, my arm hurt pretty badly. It lasted about 3 days. I pretty much had the same symptoms as the first dose: chills, body aches. headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue. It lasted for about 3-4 days. Now, I stared with bloody stools with my first dose and it never really resolved before I got the second dose. I noticed it increased the frequency, made it a little worse after the second dose. They were not so frequent anymore. I still have blood in my stool at least 2 times a week.

I also noticed the texture was a little harder and every time I went to the bathroom and had a bowel movement I had blood in my stool. I went to the walk in clinic and they did some blood work). I did not find any help and consulted with a GI doctor, (more than once) and I still to this date have blood in my stool (not as often as before but still happens).

AT 1:30 am - 4/9/2021 (14 hours after shot), I awoke out of my sleep and was freezing. I got up and layer up on clothing and drank some water. From 1:30 am - 5:45 am- 4/9/2021, I was wide awake, but tired , yawning, freezing, and had a temp of 99.9. My mouth got very dry and I was drink just a little water, but found myself having to run to the restroom once an hours. My temp slowly got down to 99.2 by 5:30am. During this time, I was also nauseous from shaking so much from being cold. I slept for another 15 minutes and then was wide awake from 6:10 am- 7:30  and then fell asleep till 9:30am. As of 12:00pm, - 4-9-2021 I have slept maybe 4 hrs, I have a headache, my arm is throbbing and I am tired. I also feel like I have a bunch of mucus in my throat (but that could be from allergies).

                                                Similar to my first vaccine dose but less severe.  I was able to report to tele-work but it was hard.  I woke up in the middle of the night after receiving the vaccine and had trouble going back to sleep.  I was having trouble regulating my body temperature, I was swinging from hot to cold all day.  I felt weak all day.  I had lower appetite.  Symptoms should get better in 36 hours.  In the end I am glad to have the vaccine and be safe, thank you for all you do.

Quickly escalated to difficult swallowing, body tingling, and extreme anxiety that almost caused a full blown panic attack. Luckily it subsided after about 20 mins of duress. Unfortunately around 12 hours after the injection at 3 AM I began experiencing quite severe flu like symptoms including nausea, extreme fatigue\weakness, occasional gagging, pain and diarrhea. Lasted until I awoke on the 12th (today) at approximately 8 am. Spent entire time in an on\off sleep also tried treating with tylenol and flu medication to no avail. Temperatures were checked twice both times results were in the high 99&#39;s.

The patient said he started feeling light headed and laid down for a little. He started feeling better and sat down. Patient stated he had not eaten anything that morning. 911 was called as soon as the patient fainted and an ambulance promptly arrived.  Paramedics checked his blood pressure and blood sugar, which was 48. They gave him glucose tabs and his sugar improved. He felt better and did not want to go to the hospital and left on his own.

He was seen in his primary office and the ED once before ultimately being admitted with a portal vein thrombosis and mesenteric vein thrombus. His only risk factors for blood clots are obesity. He has no family history of significant blood clots (except for father who had PE in setting of COVID infection). He has no history of malignancy or family history of malignancy at a young age. He is now being admitted for anticoagulation.

He awoke about 10 seconds later and was afebrile, aware of his surroundings, and showed no signs of anaphylaxis. He vomited after awakening. I asked him to sit in in the post-vaccination area for 30 more minutes while I monitored him. He refused EMS services, but I was able to get him to have a family member pick him up to take him to the emergency room.

By 7 PM, chills were extreme (shivering in bed under blankets sweating), several dry heaves thinking I might puke, but nothing in my stomach.  Went to sleep by 8 pm.  Woke up several times over the next few hours with chills and feeling queasy.  Finally down at midnight.  Felt mostly normal by Friday, with some slight stomach discomfort.  Went away by noon.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the second dose of the Moderna Vaccine on 05/12/2021 I started having chills. This progressed through the night with a fever reaching 104.2F. After taking 750mg of acetaminophen the fever reduced to around 102F. The fever persisted at 102F accompanied by heavy perspiration for approximately 40 hours with 750mg of acetaminophen being taken every 6 hours. For about 10 more hours the fever stayed around 100F with chills and constant perspiration until dehydration set in. Nausea limited the amount of water that could be consumed ultimately resulting in mild dehydration. After fever broke I continue to have headaches through filling out this form along with sharp pains in my lower left leg on the front of the leg. I also have a lot of pain in the upper right glute as if I had been hit my something quite hard. For about 48 hours while these symptoms occurred I remained in bed and tried to drink water. I spoke with the pharmacist who administered the vaccine today and she advised me to report my symptoms right away and to follow up with my doctor on Tuesday or Wednesday if my symptoms persist.

I did physical therapy to move the inner ear crystals back to where they belong. Prescribed AntiVert for dizziness and Nausea symptoms. More physical therapy to follow.

The license partner had received the report from FDA VAERS.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of HAEMATOCHEZIA (Haematochezia) in a 31-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Irritable bowel syndrome. Concomitant products included ALBUMIN HUMAN (ALBUTEIN), CLONAZEPAM and MULTIVITAMINS [VITAMINS NOS] for an unknown indication.   On 05-Feb-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 05-Feb-2021, the patient experienced HAEMATOCHEZIA (Haematochezia) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FREQUENT BOWEL MOVEMENTS (Frequent bowel movements), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in extremity), PAIN (Pain), the first episode of CHILLS (Chills), FATIGUE (Fatigue), HEADACHE (Headache) and INJECTION SITE PAIN (Injection site pain). On an unknown date, the patient experienced the second episode of CHILLS (Chills) and MYALGIA (Body aches). At the time of the report, HAEMATOCHEZIA (Haematochezia), FREQUENT BOWEL MOVEMENTS (Frequent bowel movements), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in extremity), PAIN (Pain), FATIGUE (Fatigue), HEADACHE (Headache) and INJECTION SITE PAIN (Injection site pain) had not resolved and last episode of CHILLS (Chills) and MYALGIA (Body aches) outcome was unknown.

He got the second dose and noticed increased the frequency, made it a little worse after the second dose. They were not so frequent anymore. Patient still have blood in stool at least 2 times a week.  No treatment information was provided.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  a discrepancy on onset date of PT haematochezia exists in the SD.  Concomitant medical condition could be potentially confounder for the events; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  a discrepancy on onset date of PT haematochezia exists in the SD.

I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

Patient was instructed to rest and increase fluid intake and Ibuprofen as this was likely a known adverse reaction to COVID vaccination. At 72hrs from vaccination patient began to have fevers Tmax 101.9 orally. Continued rest, hydration and ibuprofen, started Tylenol. At 96hrs from vaccination patient began to have a dry cough, diarrhea, severe fatigue and inspiratory chest pain. Patients myalgias and arthralgias continued, and Tmax increased to 104.5 orally. At this time bedside ECHO, iSTAT chemistry, COVID antigen, COVID antibody and COVID PCR, Rapid Flu, and Viral Respiratory Panel were obtained. Administered 1.5 liters of lactated ringers, Toradol 15mg and Tylenol 975mg  and patient was isolated.  EKG, troponin and Chest Xray were obtained 12 hours later (108 hours from vaccination) at which time the patient reported improvement  by 95%. Patient was afebrile and chest pain free. Only symptom at that time was fatigue. After  another 12 hours of rest/sleep (hour 120 post vaccination)  patient reports no symptoms and 100% well.  See below for lab/rad/test details.

Also lost my appetite and had a &#34;sour&#34; stomach. Not nauseus, but in the bathroom consistently throughout the day. These symptoms continued until 2 PM when the fever broke. Body aches lessened by 3 PM. Headache discomfort peaked around this time though. Worst headache I&#39;ve had in as long as I can remember. Sour stomach was resolved by 8 PM and I ate a small meal. By 1030 PM, the only symptoms I&#39;m dealing with now are a moderate headache and fatigue.

Extreme testicular pain in left testicle, I thought it was a torsion, but that was ruled out after trip to ER. It&#39;s been four days and it still feels very sensitive, but I am no longer blacking out and vomiting from the pain.

                                                I began to feel nauseous and lightheaded while brushing my teeth around 10:30 pm several hours after I received the first injection of the Moderna COVID vaccination. I sat down and started feeling very hot. I passed out a few moments later. I woke a few minutes or seconds after passing out and was evaluated by EMTs. They said my vitals looked good, but strongly recommended I go to the emergency room for further evaluation. The ER performed and EKG and bloodwork, both of which were normal. I was told this was most likely vasovagal syncope and sent home. I have had a previous history of fainting from injury or injections. This was different because the fainting has previously occurred minutes or seconds after the triggering event versus hours. Since that night, I&#39;ve  been tired and experienced occasional lightheadedness. I saw my primary care doctor today (4/21) and he advised me to fill out this report.

                                                Received my shot, talked with the nurse for about a minute or two afterwards in the back and she informed me that i needed to wait 10-15 minutes before i left. i go to the waiting room and set my alarm for 10 minutes. i texted my mother i was done and leaving  to go back home soon and that my second appt was on May 11. she texted back, i responded once again that i will call her when i get home in just over an hour.  Since i had no idea what to expect if something &#34;did go wrong&#34;, i picked up my packet of information i received prior to my shot and started browsing through. i saw the possible serious side effects column and started to go through the list. At the time, about 5-6 mins now afterwards of my shot, i had no difficulty breathing, i did have a little tingling in my tongue, i read &#34;a fast heartbeat&#34;, and put my hand on my chest and asked myself, IS MY HEART GOING FASTER? i looked at the paper again and put my hand back on my chest, and that was the last thing i remember until i was brought back to conscious by the nurses and doctors. i was told the guy in the waiting room ran after i passed out. when i came back to they walked me into the back, i was dizzy and profusively sweating and was drenched from head to toe , shirt and pants were SOAKED in sweat, they took my vitals for the next 40 minutes (3 or 4 times) i dont remember it too clearly until i started coming back to. Blood pressure was up and down and i was white as a ghost, they gave me fluids and i hung out until i felt superbly better about 40 minutes later. Then on my drive home, i had to pull over again, because i was getting light headed and felt like i was going to vomit. made it home, 90 minutes later, took a baby aspirin and slept the rest of the afternoon for about 5/6 hours before waking back up to eat some dinner.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine at 10:00am on 4/13, 28 days after my first one. On Fri, 4/16 at 4:00am, I woke up to use the restroom and voided my bladder. Shortly thereafter, I felt very nauseous and cold clammy. I had a sip of water, than sat down next the toilet since I thought I had food poisoning and needed to throw up. Instead, I passed out and fell from a sitting position against the wall. I woke up a few seconds later, to find my right ear cut and with quite a bit of blood (not sure what I cut it on, maybe my own thumb nail?). I stood up and walked to the sink, so I could bleed over it while apply pressure so I wouldn&#39;t make a mess. My wife had woken up at this point, and shortly after I got to the sink, I passed out again while standing (fortunately she caught me) and started twitching for a few seconds before coming to (I came to while still standing up). At this point, my wife drove me to the emergency room and we were admitted. In the ER from 4:15am-7am, they did a CT scan on my head without contracts, blood work, and an EKG. All three tests came back normal and I was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope. I have no history of any prior vasovagal event. At the ER they also sewed my ear up with 6 dissolvable stitches, gave me a big of IV fluids, a tetanus shot, and then sent me on my way, discharging me at 7:00am on 4/16. I then saw my primary care doctor that afternoon at 1:00pm on 4/16 who reviewed by medical records/test results from the ER, concurred with their vasovagal syncope diagnosis, checked my stitches, and said I could go back to normal activity largely unrestricted. I haven&#39;t had any issues since; so not overly concerned (other than the &gt;$2,500 of ER hospital bills that are piling up), but just reporting this so you have the data.

                                                I arrived at the ER complaining of tightness in the chest and nausea, having vomited an hour earlier. At triage, the EKG showed a weak heart rate. This was two and a half days after receiving the shot, and having had other symptoms including fever, chills, general soreness, all of which may have obscured an earlier onset of tightness in the chest. Eventually I was diagnosed with acute Pericarditis and prescribed Colchicine by mouth 2 times a day. I&#39;ll need to have follow-ups with a cardiologist, continue taking the Colchicine, and go easy on the heart for 6 weeks to 3 months. Long-term, it&#39;s expected I&#39;ll make a full recovery.

The pharmacist had me place my feet up on a chair in front of me, gave me an electric fan  to point at myself and an ice pack that I applied to my head and back of neck. As the stars began to subside I felt a lump in my throat. The pharmacist then instructed me to continue to focus on breathing. Within 25-30 minutes I was clear of all adverse affects.

A nurse and a medical technician addressed his concerns and the patient was diaphoretic, lightheaded, pale, and vomiting. We immediately provided 1 adult dose of epinephrine, laid him down with his feet elevated, and contacted EMS. Once he was stable to walk we moved him into a private room to be further assessed by EMS. Vitals were taken every 5 mins until the patient was transported to a local hospital.

                                                Body aches all over started the morning after the vaccine shot. Nausea began second day after vaccine and I threw up clear liquid that day. I?ve had no appetite and have lost about 5 lbs in 2 days from not eating.  I have dizziness as well but it is not severe enough that I cannot walk on my own. I have injection site redness as well. I am reporting these symptoms on the third day after my shot and I have improved but only slightly.

It started with abdominal pain and the next day I had a fever.  I went to the ER it was discovered that I had elevated Liver Function tests and Eosinophilia.  There was Bilirubin in my Urine.  I was discharged the next day. The fever persisted and I returned to the ER. My levels were much worse and my Eosinophil levels were climbing. I also developed a rash on my hands and feet. After extensive testing nothing definitive was found. I have not had any problems like this before.

                                                The night I got my 2nd dose I started experiencing very bad chest pains. Like it was my left lung or heart. It felt like it was being squeezed. I felt like I could barely breathe. My neck was hurting and I kept having to sleep. I&#39;ve been super lethargic, and I get pain whenever I inhale or have to swallow something. It feels either like my lung is full of fluid or being squeezed.

At about 1030AM I had a very bad headache and was extremely nauseous for about 3 hours and felt like vomiting but did not vomit. This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

                                                I developed periumbilicus cramping abdominal pain, nausea for two days after first shot then it went away. After second shot, I developed the usual thing of arm soreness, fever, chills, joint pain and generalized body aches as well as GI symptoms. All symptoms went away in two days except that I have had persistent symptoms of cramping abdominal pain, on/off nausea, bloating. I still have the symptoms 4 weeks after the shot and nobody knows what is going on.  I lost around 15 lb till now and will be following with my PCP soon to see what is next.

                                                I had a sore arm almost immediately following the shot that slowly got worse throughout the evening. In the morning my arm was very sore. I woke up around 6:30 with a headache and chills. throughout the morning, my headache worsened as did my chills. I felt fatigued and noticed my lungs felt the same as they did when I had COVID. Essentially all my COVID symptoms came back I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I slept most of the morning and then felt nauseous around 3 pm. I vomited around 3:30 and almost felt completely better after that. My headache, chills, and fatigue were still present but significantly less once I vomited. In the morning I woke up with a headache that lasted through the morning the second day after vaccine administration. By the end of the second day, I felt completely fine. My arm soreness was almost completely gone. I also had some aches and chills on the second day in the morning upon waking up but those were gone by mid-day. On day three I feel completely fine.

I continued to speak to him and he was unable to hear initially.  He did cry out and gasp and tighten then started to have a few slow jerky movements bringing both arms and body up from the chair. It appeared as if he may vomit and I repositioned to ensure he would not slide off of the chair.  The movements lasted about a minute and then he started to come to.  He described feeling dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, and sweaty.  During the event his pupils were non responsive. At 11:17 he went pale and started feeling as if he was spinning and experiencing tingling.  He was still reclined in the chair and sitting up aided with the tingling.  He was given a cold pack to help regulate and given ice water at 11:18.  He stated he had not eaten yet today as he usually doesn&#39;t eat until 11. His temperature had dropped to 96.1 vs 97.5 prior to the vaccination.  BP was checked at 11:25 and was 120/72 which is lower than usual for him and to be expected with the LOC.  After drinking his water, I had him attempt to stand while grasping the wall/table for 2 minutes to assess his steadiness, then standing unassisted for 2 minutes.  After he felt steady enough we had him walk 10-15 feet and stand for another 2 minutes.  Patient was feeling tired and instructed not to drive home.  The situation was conveyed to his wife and they were instructed to seek ER/Urgent care if any of his symptoms reappeared. They stayed in the area to eat lunch and I checked in again at 12:12pm with the patient and he is feeling better after eating but still tired.  I also recommended following up with his primary as I will be sending her a copy of this report.

                                                Patient complained of dizziness and nausea following second covid moderna vaccination. We supplied water and chair and monitored him. While interviewing patient it was announced that he had consumed several beers during lunch 1-2 hours previously. He later told another front end associate following up with him that he actually had consumed whiskey. It is strongly believed that this played a large roll in his adverse reaction. It is believed that he experienced a mild syncopal reaction that was potentiated by the alcohol consumption.

                                                I started feeling woozy maybe 30 minutes after injection. I ended up taking a big nap when I got home and woke up feeling sick. Had dinner, went to bed for the night.  I was not able to sit up straight for more than 2 minutes the next day without getting extremely light headed. I did not eat for two and a half days. Spent the next several nights freezing cold and with night sweats. I also had a deep, phlegmy cough. It all started clearing up after a few days, but I felt crummy/under the weather for a week.

                                                After vaccination, patient was fine. He sat down for observation. 5 minutes passed and I heard  &#34;SOMEONE HELP&#34;. Patient was tensing up and unresponsive (looked like a mini-seizure). Patient peed on himself and after 3-4 seconds patient was fully responsive. Patient stated he was fine and didn&#39;t know what happened. Patient did not want me to call an ambulance and person with him told me not to call. We waited a little longer, patient complained of feeling really hot. He laid down on the floor and I gave him some water and a lollipop to increase sugar levels. After 3-5 minutes patient sat down on the chair and stated he was feeling much better. After a few minutes, he complained of wanting to vomit. As soon as I was able to give him a bag, he violently threw up. Patient stated that he was now feeling much better. He went to the bathroom and cleaned up. After a little longer observation, patient said he was fine and wanted to go home. They left. I called patient an hour later and he stated he felt fine and was just resting. Will follow up with patient tomorrow.

Went to the ER on 5/23/21 was given blood transfusion and IV because hemoglobin dropped from 9.1 to 7.1 after one bowel movement. He had endoscopy and colonoscopy on 5/25/21 and was diagnosed with a colon ulcer which they cauterized and he was discharged in the afternoon due to hemoglobin being stable at 8. The next morning on 5/26/21 he woke up to use the restroom, defecated brownish-black-red stool and almost fainted and couldn?t get up from the floor.

                                                At about 4 days of fever up tp 102, tons of sweating, chills, I would sweat so much through my bed linen. I had general malaise. Day 3 or 4, I started having nausea and vomiting, I was taking ibuprofen for fever and Zofran for nausea. I was taking Emergen-C . At night I was taking Nyquil to help me sleep. After fever let up I still had body aches, I went got a COVID test, I started having swelling in my lymph nodes in my throat. My toes started getting white, my toes went numb the only way I can describe it as Raynaud&#39;s phenomenon.

                                                Woke up the next morning with nausea, headache, chills and muscle aches. It has been ongoing now with only relief coming from Ibuprofen for symptoms. Concerned I should have taken longer time between having COVID and getting the vaccine. It was a approximately 3 days from time of being clear of isolation and any symptoms. There was no concern on the consent form of recently having COVID just a concern if you were presently positive.

Following his initial vaccination at approx. 530pm, the patient (EMT) walked back to the ambulance in which he was working and bypassed the observation area.  He reports approx. 20min later he began experiencing the sensation that his throat was swelling and immediately began dry heaving.  He returned inside and was tachycardic on monitoring and shivering.  The patient never lost his ability to breath during his time at the vaccination clinic but ultimately received a single dose of IM Epinephrine, Zytec 10mg, and Benadryl (unknown dose) and transported by ambulance to the local ER.  no rashes were observed at the time of intial onset through the time of transport (approx. 20min)

                                                For several hours I had no side effects, including soreness at the injection site. In the evening, maybe 6-8 hours after the injection, the site became sore. After midnight, I started having severe chills and needed several layers of clothing and blankets to stay warm. I checked for a fever and did not have one. In the morning the chills were gone but I had a strong headache that lingered with varying intensity throughout the day. It is unclear if the headache was more from the vaccine or more from a lack of sufficient sleep because I couldn&#39;t sleep with the chills. The injection site has continued to be sore and seems to be increasingly sore. After waking up on 1-13-2021, I found myself feeling fatigued and lethargic, not dissimilar to the fatigue I felt when I had COVID. The fatigue has somewhat subsided over the course of the day, with lots of rest helping. The headache and soreness are ongoing, and the fatigue is present but less than earlier today. There&#39;s been somewhat of an ongoing lack of appetite, but I&#39;ve been able to eat in small amounts and keep down what I eat. The chills have come and gone a couple times throughout the day today, but that doesn&#39;t seem to last long.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

It seems like others are experiencing the same issue around 8 days after the shot.   I?m not sure if these individuals have reported this but I have provided a forum where people are reporting this same issue.    The vertigo was so intense on Monday 3/8/2021 at around 4:30am that I ended up getting sick and throwing up.  Symptoms are still around today 3/10/2021 but not as severe.

Pain radiating to testicles.  Entire body aching.  Couldn&#39;t find comfortable position to sit/stand/walk.   Worse than any illness I&#39;ve had, but without the brain fog Within next 48 hours: Armpit swollen on right arm (same as vaccine arm).  Pain in head persisting.  Pain behind ears.  Dizzy/lightheaded feeling. Third Day after vaccine: Armpit is still swollen.  Headache persists.  Ache in muscles and joints seem to be re-emerging.  But, overall, I&#39;m fine and can work today. Note: Pollen count high - and I typically do get headaches from pollen - so, headaches could be attributable to pollen, but timing is suspicious.

Most of these effects passed after about 30 hours. I woke up this morning with a headache and my left eye really hurts. I have a subconjunctival hemorrhage in my left eye that fills about 1/3rd of the eye white with blood..... Headache, stiff muscles and overall tiredness are the only other remaining side effects besides a blood-filled eyeball at this point.

Chills but with a high fever. Threw up 25mins after shot. Immediately after that felt really nauseous and couldn?t see straight. Vision was black and I was seeing stars. Felt like hallucinating really bad. Couldn?t focus my vision. Got home and showered with a really hot shower and immediately started feeling better. 45mins to 1 hour after shot started feeling way better! Just sluggish the rest of the night.  For some reason was fighting going to sleep and fell asleep sitting up. Next day much better!

It felt like indigestion. Pain stayed mild until Saturday evening when I started vomiting and had diarrhea and by 11:00 pm I went to the ER where they did bloodwork and a ct scan. Bloodwork showed high white blood cell count, scan showed appendicitis. After 4.5 hours there, I had to leave to go to another hospital and wait for a bed. After being in intense pain for a few more hours, I finally had the emergency surgery at 11:00 am Sunday the 9th.

                                                SECOND DOSE. (First does was fine. Minor ache on injection site with none of the symptoms below) Rash at injection site: Significant slightly elevated  red rash on triceps and deltoid near injection site that lasted from onset at 2:30 ( 14 hours after injection)  until reporting time  4 day. Minor soreness. Condition improving. Fever/Chills/Loss of Appetite: At 2:30 am (14 hours after injection) heart rate went to above 100 BPM (sometime 110-130&#43;)and started to slowly improve to 80 BPM in the morning 8am -- measured using Amazon halo heart rate sensor. While I did not measure temp until 7PM Friday the next day (101.8) during the 1st night I felt very hot and had chills.  Estimate temperature was 103-104. Difficult to sleep (0-2 hours of sleep first night). At 2pm Friday I thought I had recovered but a few hours later I entered another more mild cycle (80-95 bpm). Was able to sleep. I drank two electrolyte (generic Pedialyte from pharmacy) one after injection and the second the next day and was hydrated the full day. I took 1 generic ibuprofen the night of first symptoms at 2:30 am and a second the following night at 11pm.  Aches: Aches were onset on Saturday morning (day 2) in the back neck muscles.

                                                I am a healthy individual with no pre-existing conditions. I had Covid-19 in August of 2020. I was in bed for 5 weeks with most of the symptoms and regularly had fever exceeding 104. When I was allowed to return to work, the Dr. gave me light duty orders to not exceed 5 hours worked per day for 2 months.  After receiving the first vaccination dose, my arm became incredibly sore. These symptoms lasted for almost 2 weeks.   The morning following vaccination, my body began to ache and hurt on touch to the point where the cover woke me up in pain. These symptoms lasted nearly three days during both day and night.   I became nauseous about 24 hours following the vaccination. These symptoms lasted almost 4, 24 hour days.   I became dizzy, periodically, about 24 hours after receiving the vaccination.  These symptoms lasted for almost 7 days.   I had low grade fever on three occasions that I knew about, I treated with Tylenol.  These symptoms lasted 3 days after vaccination.   I had a horrible headache (I never have had headaches before) I could not open my eyes or expose them to light. Most of the pain was concentrated on the left side of my head. These headaches started 3 days after receiving the vaccination and lasted 5 days later until day 8. I used Tylenol, which seemed to have little effect and slept all day.

He then felt very nauseous but did not vomit. He said he felt very hot inside and was sweating very profusely. We got cold water for the patient to drink and placed some cold water on a towel on the back of his head. We then checked his blood pressure 117/68 his pulse was 65. We kept an eye on him for the next 30 minutes and he opted to leave because he said he was feeling a lot better and lived very close by. Patient ate lunch by 1 pm. We took his information to follow up and counseled him to lay down and get something to eat. He was instructed to call the pharmacy if he had any concerns or questions.

                                                The day after my 1st vaccine dose, I had chills, light fever, diarrhea, upset stomach, nausea, fatigue,  and cough. Chills and the low grade fever lasted for 7 days, but the cough lasted for 4 weeks after my 1st dose. So I went to my PCP to get a check up, they ran all my blood tests, and I was recommended to NOT receive my 2nd dose yet.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine first dose. Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, i became dizzy, tachycardic and experiencing hot flashes. Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                Maybe 1 minute after receiving the vaccine I began to have a syncopal episode, the nurse practitioner thought that since I was heavy I began to have a vasovagal reaction.  From there they asked me to sit with the others waiting 15 minutes to make sure they were ok to leave. As I sat the symptoms would come and go, as if in a pattern, and then return.  The longer I sat there the more the symptoms began to grow, after sitting for an hour they decided to send me to the ER. At this time I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, sweating, I was itchy, I could not stop coughing, it was difficult to breath, and I had the worse headache.  When I got to the ER they gave me drugs to reverse the allergic reaction and told me they would watch me for a while. In the next 4 hours all of the symptoms started again and I had to get another round of the reaction drugs, I ended up going through this process 4 times before I was safe enough to go home the next day.  The provider that saw me and admitted me did not do any blood work or labs, they simply provided me with the reaction drugs when needed and my home medications.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

At about 7:00AM while at work, I felt pain all over my body and was more sensitive to pain. Headache slowly develop during this time too. At around 3:40PM, I arrived home and checked my temp, it was 100.5. Stomachache/heartburn starting to progress also.  I started to get chills. I slept and rest and woke up around 6PM to eat dinner. I took Tylenol in before going to bed, the next day at around 4AM before going to bed, I checked my temp and it&#39;s 99.5, I took another Tylenol and felt better the whole day after.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after the injection, I awoke with a fever of 101, body aches, and severe headaches.  The symptoms progressed and my fever was over 102 most of the day and hit a max of 103.5 around 2:30pm.  Nausea started around 4pm, which I alleviated by taking Zofran.  I eventually went to bed and awoke on the second day around 4:30am with a fever at 101 still.  Then around 7:30am, the fever broke with the most intense full body sweats.    Later on that Friday, in the afternoon, I noticed a large red rash on my right arm at the injection side, it was slightly swollen and very hot.  It got bigger over the next 12 hours or so and by Sunday afternoon the swelling had subsided and now appears and feels like a sunburn where the redness turns white if you press with a finger and then returns to red and it also itches now.  I treated the itchiness with some hydrocoritizone cream.

I was able to get in to see my doctor and he prescribed Prilosec. I took this for 7 days and was able to get some relief. Still not back to baseline over 1 month later.

                                                In the 3 weeks leading up to February 10th, I became progressively more bloated with fluid in my stomach area, with an increasing feeling of fullness.  By the 10th, I felt so full that I had only eaten one meal in two days.  I had also been sleeping upright for days to attempt to clear what I perceived to be a stomach blockage and therefore was quite tired.  I walked in to the ER and the x-ray revealed the blood clot in my portal vein.  The physician immediately had enoxaparin administered to me and I was admitted.  I received another enoxaparin dose the next morning.  I was discharged on Xarelto 15mg twice a day in the afternoon of Feb 11th.  I am continuing on Xarelto as my hematologist runs various tests and I have an EGD on 4/16 due to a possible stomach ulcer.  I was diagnosed with: Mesenteric venous thrombosis Elevated transaminase measurement Fatty liver

He thanked us and left feeling pretty good.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

PCP and doctors keep denying the shot caused the issues and urged me to get the 2nd dose.

                                                Starting the day of the vaccine in the evening, I had fever, felt tired and chills. Temperature 101-102 . I  took ibuprofen and went to sleep. I had chills the whole night. I woke up the next day and had headache, dizzy, nauseated. I continued to take ibuprofen every 4 hours.  Mild fever during the day and no fever at night. Nausea was improving.  Headache was not improving. The following day, I felt a little better, a little nauseated, headache, dizziness and diarrhea and left work early to go home. Took Zofran for dizziness and it helped a little. I did a telehealth visit over the phone and I was sent to get Covid test (negative).  Symptoms did not improve so I went to ER the follow day.  I was sent home with a prescription for higher dose Zofran and was told to stop ibuprofen and start Tylenol.   I went home and tried to rest.  Symptoms are slowly improving.  I was unable to drive for a whole week.  I had these symptoms for about 7 days. Headache, diarrhea and nausea went away, but I still felt fatigued.   The fatigue lasted for about another week (total of 2 weeks).

Body aches the entire next day in addition to being extra tired and constant diarrhea.  Had to stay home from work. I haven&#39;t felt 100% since, even though it has been over 2 weeks. After my wife got her second shot, our entire household got a suspicious flu like cold, then it happened again right after my second dose. That lasted almost a week each time and just seems unlikely to be a complete coincidence.

Around 12 hours or so after getting the second shot, I had flu-like symptoms (headache, nausea, aches, mild fever). I couldn&#39;t focus and vomited water/stomach bile a couple of times. After around 12 hours of feeling flu-like, I started to feel better and could eat simple food again (Corn Chex, chicken broth). I also had soreness in the arm near the injection site. I can&#39;t remember if I had neck pain or not. After the 12 hours or so of the flu-like symptoms, I quickly recovered. I would have reported this via VAMS, but felt so bad during the first 24 hours after getting the second dose, that I was late to registering my second dose in the VAMS system and the system would not let me retroactively report my symptoms. This is why I am submitting this VAERS report in case that it is helpful.

On day 4 I was nauseous  all day up to day 9.  On day 5 I started feeling chest pain right below my ribs in the center of my chest. If I sat up it was very uncomfortable and if I layed down the pain seemed to lessen.  On day 4 it seemed to throw my stomach off and up to day 9 I seemed to me more constipated. On day 5-8 I felt extremely  lethargic and need to nap which is something that I never do

                                                Three weeks after receiving the first dose (on 02/01/2021) I woke up with extreme dizziness and imbalance, I felt as if I was constantly leaning to the right.  I would get extremely nauseous from walking, working, or just sitting and turning my head.  When I would lay down on my right side I felt as if fluid were building up and that something was going to pop.  Advil, caffeine, and alcohol made my symptoms worse.  I was able to find some relief by laying down on my left side and through sleep.   After a week, I went to see Dr. at Clinic. They were unable to figure my issue, but they ruled out BPPV.  They also did a blood and urine test at this time. After two weeks the dizziness started to fade a little, but I was left with headaches, imbalance, tiredness, and pressure behind my ear and eye.  I noticed that any kind of stress or anger would make the symptoms much worse.  I visited Dr. at ENT Clinic.  She did several tests and was unable to find any obvious cases of my symptoms.  She suggested I might have had migraines, even though I had no history of them.  She told me to give it a month and come back if I was still having problems. After one Month the dizziness was pretty much gone, but I still was experiencing imbalance, headaches, and pressure.  Instead of getting dizzy I would get sharp shooting headaches that would last a couple of seconds.  I still had what felt like pressure behind my eye and ear.  I also still was unable to lay on my right side.  I visited ENT Dr. again and we decided to do an MRI with contrast.  The MRI came back negative.  We decided to start me on vestibular physical therapy. After 3 months I have gotten to the point where I do not feel imbalance every day.  I still will have days where I feel like I am leaning to the right, but those are getting less frequent.  I still occasionally get headaches, tightness, and fullness in the area.  I would say I am about 75 percent better. I feel what happened in my head is somehow the same reaction I had in my left arm.  I reported this reaction in a different report.  I would like to point out that both times these reactions occurred I drank alcohol the night before.

                                                I am reporting this as incidence of pericarditis have been possibly linked. I do not know if this will help or not but I figure more data is important.    2 weeksprior to pericarditis incident I was ill with what I believed to be a cold.  Symptoms persisted and an urgent care prescribed antibiotics.  A week later I had food posioning and was hospitalized for this due to not being able to keep liquids down for the better part of a day.  A few days following this incident I woke early in the morning with chest pain shooting down my arm, not being able to breathe and a dry cough.   When I went to the hospital tests were run and revealed (heart markers?)

During the daytime hours of the 1/5, took Tylenol (1,000mg) every 5 hours (or so). Also had nausea (as well as had difficulty wanting to eat because I was nauseous), slight fever of 100, headache (no longer a migraine) and major body aches. Stayed home from work and relaxed on my couch (mostly). Today/currently, on 1/6 at 12:50pm, only symptoms I still have is soreness at injection site (not as sever-more of a discomfort) and slight body ache (not as sever). Last does of Tylenol was taken at 01:30am on 1/6.

                                                The night of the injection started with severe fatigue and a severe sore throat, the next day I woke up with a sore throat so bad I could not swallow. I gargled salt water, and took some allergy medications including Benadryl and the sore throat went away later that day. The extreme fatigue continued and late during the day following and into the third day started extreme muscle and joint pain, and intestinal upset. On Monday 1/11/2021 I had also spiked a fever which only lasted for the day. These as of today 1/14/2021 have yet to go away as well as the extreme fatigue. The major one the made me call into the agency who had me start this report was that I lost my sense of smell and some sense of taste. I had been diagnosed with COVID in late June of 2020 and one of the first symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

The next morning I woke up with a sore throat so bad that I could hardly swallow which continued through the evening then went away. I treated it with salt water rinses and Benadryl. Over the next several days the severe fatigue continued but severe muscle and joint pain as well as intestinal upset began. On Monday 1/11 I had spiked a fever which only lasted for that day. On Tuesday night I began to vomit and on Wednesday 1/13 I had lost my sense of smell and most of my sense of taste. At this point I contacted the CDC which had me complete this form in addition to the V-Safe reports I had been doing daily and encouraged me to see my primary care. In late June of 2020 I had COVID and one of the first symptoms was loosing my sense of smell and taste completely.

No treatment Body aches, fatigue, abdominal cramps, dry lips, dry mouth and throat, sinus pressure, nasal passage closed on one side and closing on the other, pale white skin on back of throat on the right side, chest tightness while laying face-down,  minor nausea, and very tired but unable to stay asleep all night.  Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

                                                Patient developed sudden onset vertigo with recurrent vomiting. He was brought to the emergency department and was evaluated under the stroke protocol and underwent CT, CTA, and MRI of the brain which did not reveal an etiology of his symptoms. He had a neurology consultation and the most likely cause was thought to be vestibular neuritis on the left side. He was treated with Zofran, Reglan, Meclizine, IV fluids, and Valium with partial relief and was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. Symptoms are unresolved at the time of this report.

                                                Chills/fever,  mild headache, fatigue. Vaccine was given on a Friday afternoon, symptoms presented around 2200-2300 that night and were at their peak all day Saturday. By Sunday all symptoms were still present but the fever had mostly resolved. Some fatigue persisted the rest of the week (Monday through Friday).   The following week after receiving the vaccine I experienced fever (up to 104F taken in clinic) fatigue, lack of appetite, abdominal discomfort. I was diagnosed with diverticulitis in the ER so the fever was attributed to that. Just wanted to note that I have had flare ups over the past few years but was never febrile. Also of note is that I had been taking INH and Rifampin which may have caused and/or contributed to some of the adverse effects.

Tylenol did help slightly to control fever but did not seem to lower it.  Did nothing to reduce body aches.  Significant fatigue and soreness lasted approximately 3 days after dosage.

Then within a 3 week time period I kept getting sicker then, the day after my second dose (which caused me no reaction, which I thought was weird as everyone reported that one having more side effects) I had become so sick that I went to the ER and found I had diabetic ketoacidosis.  It runs in my family to have type 2 but later in life. What was also strange is that Inhad a physical not long before the vaccine through my PCP Dr. and my A1C labs came back elevated but within normal limits....

                                                Woke up on Friday morning (3/5) with severe neck pain and vertigo. Tried to walk to bathroom and was falling over to the right side and felt very nauseous. Starting throwing up. Arrived at ER around9:30AM and was diagnosed with vertigo and discharged a few hours later. He slept most of the day but woke up for a few minutes to take medicine on Friday evening and told me his vision was blurry. He went back to sleep and slept until Saturday (3/6) morning around 9:30. He told me his vision was still really blurry so we went back to the ER. They did an MRI and MRA and saw that he had two strokes. The strokes have affected his vision and he still has blurry vision and is not able to see well peripherally.

                                                Sinus pressure started the same night as the vaccine. The symptoms gradually worsened throughout the night. He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses. Then suddenly had a significant flow of blood from his RIGHT nostril. As of this evening he still has congestion in his sinuses, and intermittent tightness in his chest.

Attempting a foam roller to stretch my muscle and release some pin to no luck. I considered going to the ER because of the pain not subsiding.   Around 2:30 AM I started throwing up, which lasted off an on for about a hour.   I returned to bed around 3:30 AM with the muscle tightness still happening. Around 4:00 I began having chills and my muscle started to relax. By 5:00 AM I was sleeping. No ongoing effective expect fatigue, and my throat was sore from throwing up.

Pain, Bloating, Feeling of extreme fullness, Nausea, constant gurgling of the stomach.  This lasted for approximately ~ 2 weeks.  These symptoms have not fully resolved but have improved 85-90%. Day 3-current: Twitching and muscle spasms began in the arm that I got the shot in.  Shoulder, bicep, and into the forearm were CONTINUOUSLY twitching all day long.  Sleep became difficult for a period of a few days due to this.   This muscle twitching then began to occur in all other parts of the body.  Eye lids, arms, legs, torso.  Everywhere.  The rate of the twitches at worst was approximately 30 twitches per minute bouncing around from one area of the body to another.  I am currently 3 weeks post vaccination and although I have seen significant improvement in the twitching, I am still currently experience this symptom.

                                                I believe I experienced multiple symptoms as a result of my vaccine. My experience matches exactly as described in the article.  ON 4/1/21 at approximately 4pm I awoke from a nap experiencing acute vertigo, nausea and headache. I also was experiencing fever and chills. I began treating with excedrine but did not have an effect. The vertigo was very acute, my eyes were skipping and I was unable to walk. Nause was so intense that any attempt to leave my bed resulted in vomiting. I was unable to eat and could barely drink for the first 24 hours. Friday 4/2 at approx 7pm I took a dose of Promethazine which began to help the nausea. Extreme headache/migraine lasted for 3 days. During this time I also experienced extreme neck pain, as well as pain near base of skull, behind my ears, and on my temples. Symptoms were steadily improving each day, so I did not seek medical care during this time. I feel I became fully recovered by 4/18. I just had my second vaccine dose on 4/21 and I am very nervous about experiencing a relapse of symptoms.

                                                First I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to light, I was also feeling light headed and dizzy on my walk back to the car. (about 30 minutes after injection). I had someone else drive because I felt like I could not drive in my condition. On the ride home, about 40 minutes after injection, I began to have an increased heart rate and had a hard time swallowing. It was also slightly difficult to breathe. I felt like my head was cloudy and I had a hard time concentrating. I felt like my brain was responding about a half a second slower to what I saw. Like if I wanted to turn my head, I would think try to turn my head and my body would react a second later. When I got home, about 1 hour after the injection, my girlfriend told me my hands were freezing cold. I was also having a hard time walking in straight because I was so dizzy. I was still having some minor trouble breathing and swallowing. It was difficult to drink water. After about 2 hours my breathing returned to normal. My mind was cloudy all day, I felt like I was drunk.  On the second day, I woke up with an intense headache. It lasted for 3 days. My arm started to hurt on the second day as well, no pain at all the first day. My head was still cloudy and I had difficulty trying to recall memories or answer questions. By the third day this was basically gone. I was extremely tired for three days total. My mind remain cloudy for about a week.

                                                Dizziness, unbalance. Vertigo was there occasionally the first couple days for hours or minutes, continues endlessly for now. I had a case of vertigo 8 or 9 years ago but no issues ever again with the ear or hearing or balance. After the first shot I twice thought I had a blockage or something in the ear. Tried drops, wax remover whatever you can find, nothing helped. Eventually it subsided but never gave real vertigo or long lasting balance issue. After 2nd shot was immediately an issue. Constant sweating and 99.5 fever for the 11th, 12th and 13th. 3 days straight of just sweating. Vomiting on around or just after midnight on the 13th, into the morning of the 14th. End of the 14th leading to the 15th the Veritgo has a light migraine attached. The migraine is mostly in the right eye has any migraine I&#39;ve had is, comes with some light nasal pressure right at the eye socket. No issues with nasal drip or stuffy nose. Slight blurred vision which either creates the migraine or is from it. I also had migraines in the past but no more than 1 a year for the last 5 years, nothing I have medication or treatment for any longer.  This vertigo has a low grade migraine with small dot of blurred vision from one eye, my right eye. I dance with my daughter which is usually holding hands and spinning until her feet come off the ground. The first recognition that something is terribly wrong in my ear was that the moment I spin I can&#39;t rotate more than once rapidly without becoming incredibly unstably dizzy. That regardless of the vertigo, migraine or anything has been true since the 2nd shot when I spin I am at a total loss of balance.  There is constant dizziness, blurred vision, migraine

T&#43;24hr: ....headache growing. Went home and found fever at 102°.  Slight chills, bit mainly just heat without sweating. Fever hit 103.2 at peak. Went through 10lbs ice to keep the fever in check. Headache from T24hr-T36HR feels like a spike through the top of frontal lobe to my left eye.  T&#43;32hr: Headache still intense. Only back pain now. Appetite slowly increasing.  T&#43;48hr (Saturday morning). Back pain persists, but mild. Headache gone. Have a relatively normal day.  T&#43;60hrs (Sat. Afternoon): Back pain increasing. Stop all unnecessary lifting/moving.  T&#43;68hrs (early Sunday morning): Go to ER with the back pain. Absolutely excruciating spasms from top of sacrum - roughly LI/12T. Lower back stiff as wood. Given shot or Toradol, dose/prescription to flexiril. I specifically request this plan because usually takes care of the spasms; basically, get me able to move and the pain/spasms will go away.   NOTE: I have a history of back issues in this area, but I have not had an episode in years and certainly never had an episode that works like this with no relief. From about 2017-2019, I r  T&#43;70-78hrs: Feel normal.  T &#43; 78-88hrs: lower back pain comes back with an absolute vengeance.  T&#43;90hrs (early Monday morning): Return to ER. Back pain worse than Sunday morning. Receive toradol shot and prescription Prednisone. Back pain gone by around 10:30 AM. Decide to take prednisone Tuesday morning as its getting a bit late in the day by the time pharmacy fills the prescription.   T&#43;90hrs: Back pain returns in similar fashion as Sunday afternoon. Still. Barely mobile.   T&#43;96 hours: Wake up with lower back pain similar to Sunday/Monday morning. Took prednisone and flexiril this morning.   Please help me.

                                                In early May my 2nd Moderna vaccine shot caused a typical flu like symptom for 48 hours and then back to normal.   About a month has passed and on June 11th I have started to feel like I had a sore throat, then the next day and since then I have an intense pain around my thyroid area  when swallowing and it feels sore to the touch.  My doctors office has taken swabs for flu and bacteria which have come up negative, and I am waiting on a Covid test which I presume will also be negative.  Currently they diagnosed me with Pharyngitis, and I believe that it is subacute thyroiditis as a reaction from the vaccine. I have not been sick or come in contact with any sick people, and have worn a mask everywhere out of my home.

                                                This morning when I woke up I had a slight headache on the back of my right side. I felt a wave within and my heart rate rose. I was really hungry and ate 3 or 4 bananas. I started to feel uneasy and felt tightness in my chest and pain below the injection site. My heart rate rose into the 100s. Normal RHR= 47-55. I was burping small burps. I was worried and started looking up ERs and contacting family. This event of immense amount tightness and uneasy feeling that lasted about 30-45. Temp was 99.4 then dropped to normal. I thought I was having a heart attack. I called my sister and my symptoms waned. I have had several &#34;cycles&#34; though out the day of feeling very uneasy and slight chest discomfort, but nothing on the level of this morning, or enough to make me go to the ER. It does seem that why I lay down or bend over when sitting down there is discomfort in my chest and I feel uneasy.

                                                3 days after the shot,  1/3, I started to feel soreness under my tongue.  I&#39;ve felt this before when starting to feel sick.  It progressively got worse, appearing to have peaked on 1/5.  It is painful all the time, but really hurts to extend my tongue and swallow.  While it hurts on both sides, it seems to be worse on the left side.  When I lift my tongue and look in the mirror, it looks like the tissue is swollen some on the left.  I scheduled a visit with the ARNP at my doctor&#39;s office, who I mentioned earlier.  She couldn&#39;t determine an exact cause.  She believed it could possibly be an immune response to the vaccine or something viral.  If it gets worse or doesn&#39;t go away after a week she asked that I call back.   The pain is unresponsive to 400 mg of Ibuprofen.  If I take 800 mg I do get some relief, but can definitely still feel it.

At the time of patient&#39;s vaccine (01/19/2021), the patient was unaware of his spouse&#39;s COVID-19 status, as they had little contact with others and thought it was a cold. Patient began having COVID-like symptoms on 01/23/2021: cough, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, muscle/body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patient has had two subsequent negative COVID-19 tests while symptomatic. Because of his symptoms, his spouse&#39;s symptoms and positive COVID status, practitioners have cautioned patient to act as if he has COVID. He is under quarantine orders per Public Health. The concern from the patient, Doctors and Public Health officials has been the patient&#39;s negative status while obviously symptomatic, and if he can pass COVID if he is symptomatic but testing negative. He has another test scheduled for Saturday 1/30/2021.

Then still chills and insomnia. Fever that persisted over the next 36 hours. Responded well to Ibuprofen 400mg for 4.5 hours until symptoms returned. Began alternating with Acetominophen 650mg for better effect. Fever was highest (recorded) at 102.2 F 29 hours after injection. Woke up 40 hours from vaccine after a night of sleep and with reduced fever. Still going up and down a bit off any medication. Last reading 46 hours from vaccine 100.6, but two hours earlier was 99.4. I?ve also had nausea, exhaustion, and tiredness. Also cold symptoms which may be related to the slight cold I had the morning of the vaccination that I didn?t think was anything to worry about - my kid is in daycare and I feel like this for a large part of the winter!

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

                                                Patient started making a funny face and contorting his mouth.  He said his tongue was swelling. We kept an eye on him for about 20 minutes, he wasnt wanting to eat his lunch.  His face was also flushed which can be an indicator that he doesn&#39;t have enough prednisone on board.  We gave him an additional dose of his morning prednisone dose, 7.5 mg.  The swelling subsided in about 30 minutes, he ate and said he felt much better.  We will double his evening dose and contact his endocrine doc for more instructions.

Took two Advil 1-10-21 at 11am got a headache  1-11-21 around 830pm shoulder and arm finally started feeling less pain 1-13-21 headache around 134.  Took Advil 1-14: arm and shoulder still cracking. Got really bad constipation. Forced it out. Hurt like hell. Tore something took 2 senna plus pills  1-15. Morning had thick and super long poop again. Forced it out a lil quicker but tore again or hemorrhoids  or both. Took 2 senna pills. Moved my neck wrong way.  All muscles are super super tight in my neck. Cracked with shoulder.  Now I can?t move my neck to the right   1-16: poop was pretty normal. Came out nice.  Still some in rectum wasn?t ready to expel. Had to use badee three or four times and lots of wiping to get clean.  1-18: right arm hurting again about half as bad. Still very painful when I lift etc.   Neck is a lot better  1-19: arm still hurts.  Can?t lift up without pain. Weak to lift other things pain actually seems to be in my shoulder and cracking a lot.  Not in my arm itself.  By the nighttime the pain became more intense in my shoulder and very difficult to lift it or move it.  Like the first day I got the vaccine.  1-20: shoulder hurts worse than ever.  Worst pain ever even if I keep it still has some pain. Horrible.    Became worse over the day  1-21:  at 330pm had loose bowels.  1-22-21 at 1118am.  Loose bowels again after an initial drop of on bowels.   1-23.  Normal poops.    2-5-21.

Sick to my stomach.  130pm or so was able to eat Mac n cheese.  Had raspberries about a half hour earlier to settle my tummy  2/7 at 122am:  laying in bed.  Got a bad headache since I got up.  Arm pain is minor. So long as I don?t touch it it?s fine.   I am tired.  Worn out. Congested.  Left arm and shoulder starting hurting around 2-15?   Once I started working out. Hurt like hell.  800mg Advil helped some but still hurt.  2-26: shoulder left still hurts and tight.  Did not take Advil.   Tried to stretch it.  Feels a little better at 9pm 2-28-21: slight nausea Again.  Still sore arm on and off.  Dried out.  Tired.  Drinking tons of water 3-3.  Last day I worked out and did cardio.  3-5.

                                                My left arm was sore about 2-3 hours after the shot. Later that evening, my arm was worse and I could not lift my arm up past my chest. Around about 11:00 p.m., I began to feel chills, aches and pains. I was sluggish, tired and had no energy. The next day when I woke-up around 10:00 a.m., I still had the aches and pains, all the way down to the bottoms of my feet. My body hurt to stand. The aches and pains continued that evening, along with diaherra and chest pains. The pains continued through Saturday and the chest pains got worse. The pain would radiate from my chest to my left arm, to my left shoulder, and into my back between my shoulder blades. Then by 7:00 p.m. or so on Saturday, my chest started to feel better and my aches and pains were not as bad. I was then woken up around 12:00 a.m. or so, on Saturday/Sunday with severe chest pains again with the radiation of pain. This also came along with the aches and pains and diahrrea. This has continued through to today, Monday. I tried to do simple putting my dishes away and loading up my dishwasher, and couldn&#39;t complete the task due to the chest pain and severe aches and pains all over my body. I have tried to treat the symptoms with over-the-counter medications which would include: Advil II, Pepto Bismal, Alka-Seltzer, hot showers, hot baths, luke warm baths, vapor bath soaks and a heating pad.

                                                An hour after injection I tried eating some food and found that if I chewed and swallowed too quickly I began to have q tickle in my throat that led to coughing and vomiting, this symptom has begun to fade. I also started having pain in my right arm after a few hours, which I expected, but at roughly 2am the night of the injection, my right armpit also started feeling painful. It&#39;s now been 2 days and while most symptoms have abated, my right armpit is still incredibly sore.

                                                Approximately 3- 5 minutes after felt strange mild sensation as if pins and needles was moving throughout my body from the injection site. I also started to breathe differently. Couldn&#39;t tell if my heart rate changed or not.   At about 5 minutes, I started to feel light-headed and nauseous as if I just had blood taken or an IV in my, likely a drop in blood pressure. I was reading a book, put it down on my lap as I couldn&#39;t focus on reading and considering to get help. At that moment, I passed out, hunched over in my chair staring at the floor.   This moment likely lasted for about 1 minute, but felt like 20. I was in a dream like state and at one point had a series of images and/or memories flash by in a sequence. Then, I felt like I was half asleep but couldn&#39;t tell what I was staring at but knew that I had to &#34;wake up&#34;.   Then , I was surrounded by people who helped me up. At this moment I felt very weak and tired and was sweating profusely. My right hand felt very weak.   About 10 minutes later, I started feeling better. I was given water which seemed to help. I would have waves of mild nausea come and go that eventually subsided. I also felt random cramping around my stomach/lower chest area and lower right side rib cage area.   At about 15 -20 minutes felt confident to walk to the bathroom and throughout the store. Eventually, I felt confident to drive safely home.  At the time of writing this (approx 2 hours later), I&#39;m feeling random sensations/feelings of itchyness throughout my body. No sign of hives.

I am going to see an allergist. I am still having difficulty swallowing - on and off.  (Note: Flu - vaccine - in December 2, 2020 - guessing at which one.)

                                                6 days after vaccine I developed painful hives along my joints, many on my hands, swollen lymph nodes, swollen tongue, both affecting swallowing, severe burning sensation on my tongue, numerous sores in my mouth including on my gums, and cold sores on my lips. As a result I?m unable to speak or eat. Recommended treatment has been Tylenol, and antihistamine. I?ve been taking probably more than recommended of both, and as of today, all symptoms persist.

                                                On first injection, after about 7 hours I started feeling extremely lethargic, next day was 103 degree fever which lasted around 5 days with chronic diarrhea, and then a futher 7 days with 100&#43; degree fever that was not reduced further by OTC treatments. Weakness continued for 10 days, followed by insomnia (2 hours of sleep or less per night) with the ability to fall asleep, but no ability to stay asleep. And lack of appitite, eating around 50% less food than was before the vaccine. 3 weeks after initial injection, PCP recommended Trazodone, which improved the sleep function to about 4-6 hours per night, but not the usual 8, has not improved food intake very much.  6 weeks later, ability to eat and sleep normally has not returned. No other symptoms other than lethargia from caloric deficit.

                                                Approximately five minutes after shot, my face began to tingle. My heart felt like it was racing. I had difficulty focusing with my eyes, it felt like my eyes were rolling.  My feet began to tingle. My spouse honked the car horn for assistance. I reached for my epi pen but did not administer it because a doctor was approaching our car. I checked my pulse rate on my iWatch, it was 168.  My throat began to feel tight. The doctor listened to my lungs and heard wheezing. A paramedic came over as well. My blood pressure was taken but I do not remember what my blood pressure was.  At that point the doctor said I should use my epi pen. The paramedic said I should use Benadryl. They were in disagreement, and the paramedic said I should take 50mg of Benadryl and had me put my car seat in recline position.  It was at the point they noticed that my face and chest were flushed.  They had me drink water.  We waited about 45 minutes. My lungs were checked again by the paramedic and I was told my lungs were clear, my blood pressure was taken second time but I do not remember my blood pressure, my face was less flush,  my pulse was in the 70?s.  I still felt tingling on my scalp and feet, my throat felt like it had a lump in it.  I Began to feel nauseous.  I was given the okay to leave and go home.  I had nausea until the evening the next day.  I did not eat until dinner time the night after my shot.  I only drank water.  The next day I experienced shortness of breath performing  duties that typically do not make me out of breath.  I had to take many breaks and used my abuterol inhaler two times.

I had 103.5F fever, nausea, body ache, and site pain. On 5/10/2021, the adverse events started. The injection site started itching, my face started itching, tingling and swelling in my face and lips. 5/12/2021, the injection site still itches, face and lips are still swollen. Took Benadryl gel capsules. I noticed as the swelling in my arm goes down, the other symptoms are going away.

                                                I run twice a week. One 6-8 mile and one 10-12 mile run.  I breathe through my nose mostly and I&#39;m in very good pulmonary and cardiovascular condition.  I went for a run and 1 mile in I started drooling a lot! Spitting out mouthfuls every 15-30 seconds and I never spit.  Then my chest got tight and hurt and got irritated.  The feeling was identical to Bronchitis.  I started walking home and my breathing rate increased with wheezing. I got nauseous and was bent over with saliva poring out of my mouth.  Walking up one flight of stairs was difficult.  I have a finger pulse oximeter and it was at 84!  Breathing was very rapid and difficult. After 5 minutes it went up to 94 and then up to 98-99 after 1 more minute (when my pulse fell back under 100bpm.  Chest tightness continued for about 1 hour before I was back to normal for the most part. by today I feel 100% again.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

                                                Nausea, lightheadedness, and finally numbness to right side of face, slight drooping on right corner of mouth and right side of bottom lip. It began with a tingling feeling in lip. Observing staff did not notice any swelling, or other impairments, asked me if I had anxiety, and sent me on my way. Shortly after, it felt as if I had gotten a shot at the dentist, and had the tingling numbness left over on the right side of my face. About 4 hours later, my bottom lip and right side of my mouth drooped slightly, but I could still smile, talk, raise my arm, so there was no other impairment. By the next day the numbness had mostly subsided, and the nausea and lightheadedness was gone. This vaccine was given to me at a work clinic in the administration building. I do not have contact information for them but was provided a packet with this website. I don&#39;t have any pre-existing conditions, do not have anxiety, am not a hypochondriac, did not even know about the Bell&#39;s Palsy issues in trials until after I felt numbness, and the right side of my face felt as if it fell asleep, like a foot falling asleep but it was my face. It was not to the extent of Bell&#39;s palsy, and may have even been my bottom lip swelling slightly on the right side that caused the droop. It infuriates me that this side effect was dismissed as me having anxiety because I was nervous that my face was going numb which would be a natural reaction for anyone.

The right side of my bottom lip started tingling about 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I had no swelling or other impairment at the time and was released after 40 minutes of observation. A little later the entire right side of my face felt as if it had fallen asleep, approximately 1 hour later and it worsened until about 4 hours later. By the next day the nausea and lightheadedness was gone, and the tingling/numbness to the right side of my face was gone within 48 hours, improving after 24 hours.

                                                My arm was sore after administration, which occurred at approximately 8:15. At 3:00 that same afternoon, I began running a fever, which ranged anywhere from  99.8 - 102.6 over the next few days. I experienced body aches, fatigue, chills, nausea and vomiting (one episode), and headaches. I did receive a COVID (Rapid and PCR) and Flu test on the following Monday, all of which came back negative. On the 21 and 22 I woke up without a fever, but within approximately 3 hours of waking up my fever would return. Fever was treated with a rotation of acetaminophen and ibuprofen with success, however, it never dropped the fever below 99.0.

At around 08:00 pm I started to get really cold and had the worst case of the chills I have ever had. I was shaking so hard my body hurt. At around 10:30 pm I went to bend and started to get a low fever of about 101.4* and could not get warm. I started to get a bad headache and my body hurt. It was so bad I had to call in sick the next day for work. On 01/28/2021 I stayed home and had sever body aches, bad headache, the chills and I felt nauseas. From my left hip to my left knee it felt like I had a bad charley horse. That night I got another low grade fever of about 100.1*. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and still had a headache. I took some Aleve and went back to sleep. I called in sick again the next day and that day I was a little better only had a headache, a little nauseas and body was only a little sore. I went to bed and am fine today. A note I have never tested positive to COVID-19 and I test weekly.

                                                Eleven days after the vaccination the patient developed 2 days of heartburn followed by a worsening nonproductive cough, substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, palpitations, and an episode of near syncope. These worsened over about 6 days and then slowly decreased. During this time he was referred to the ED and then admitted to a civilian host nation hospital. Echocardiogram and CT scan were performed and a paericardial cyst was discovered measuring 7.4 cm. He was then referred to another facility for evasluation. The pericardial cyst was confirmed, now 6.5 cm and laboratory tests were performed on 4 FEB, but there was at that time no elevation in inflammatory markers. Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery consultations were obtained, but the consultants and the attending physician (who is an infectious disease physician by training) did not think that the crescendo-decrescendo symptoms could be explained by the pericardial cyst, which was likely an incidental finding. A milder cough may have preceded these events by up to a year, and this may possibly be related to the cyst. The heartburn, chest pain, tachycardia, diaphoresis, palpitations, and near syncope may well be adverse reactions of the vaccine.

At ~9 am following day, began experiencing moderate &#43; pain in and behind right ear and into and throughout lower right jaw. Watery right eye. Some feeling of weakness in right side of face. Symptoms seem to indicate Bells Palsy but no noticeable muscle droop is occurring. Ibuprofen helps the pain but does not eliminate it. Pain persisting as of writing this at 1630 hrs 3/4/21.

Pulled over and passed out, my wife says I was shaking. Came back to and throw up a few times.  After that I was just not feeling well and had nausea. Started feeling better later that day.

I would characterize this more as spasms than chills. I experienced steady dull muscle ache with occasional sharp jolts of pain, especially in my extremities. My joints began to ache severely and I was unable to sleep.  I registered a fever of 100.3 (my normal temperature is ~97.5). Additionally, I experienced nausea and a moderate headache. I shivered most of the evening and finally got out of bed at 0700. I immediately noticed that I was lethargic and fatigued. My doctor recommended I take 1000mg Tylenol to address the symptoms. This was effective, but only for two hours. After that my symptoms returned - most notably the fever and uncontrollable shivering. Symptoms appear to be declining at this point, approximately 31 hours after injection.

                                                In addition to the (common) side effect of chills and body aches, at around 75 hours after getting the shot I developed extreme gas pains and nausea while running, and barely made it home, collapsing on our floor.  I then suffered severe diarrhea (which had not been listed as a possible side-effect).  It is now five days out, and the diarrhea appears to have abated.  But I continue to have lower abdominal bloating and discomfort.  (I also have painful swollen lymph nodes under the armpit of injection, as I did after the first dose, for at least a week.) Note: These gastrointestinal symptoms are NOT like those I suffer from with gastric dysmotility, which affects my upper GI tract.

I did that with the 1st dose too and had no issues that first time.  By 2pm I got very sleepy for no apparent reason. I took a 1 hr nap.  By 6 pm I had INTENSE stomach cramps. By 7pm I had non-stop cramps and diarrhea until 3am the next day at which point it abruptly stopped.  During that time I felt chills but I did not have a fever.  It was nothing I ate. We all practice great handwashing, hand sanitizing etc.

He replied no but he felt nauseous. I retrieved a trash can in case he vomitted but he did not. The feeling of nausea passed pretty quickly. I retrieved ice packs for his neck and wrists. he laid his head in his hand resting on the ice packs on his wrist. His first BP reading was 99/68... repeated in 10 minutes...about the same.I stayed with him &amp; had him put his feet up. We conversed through most of the event. Next reading was 110/74. His color was coming back a little but he was still hot and a little woosy. Patient gave me permission to call his supervisor.  I advised his supervisor he would benefit from going home to rest vs working the remainder of shift. I also contacted management to advise the same.  He stayed sitting for a total of @ 50 minutes. Two more BP readings were 106/74 and 108/74. I had him stand he said he was okay. He had to walk to back of store to get his belongings. I asked him to come back to pharmacy before leaving. He said he felt much better and had been okay walking  to back of the store.    I did call him # 2.5 hours later and he said he was feeling okay.  He did say that this has happened before..not always . I told him to let them know when he rec&#39;d 2nd dose.

                                                On Friday, April 2nd, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine.  Within minutes, my heart started racing and I felt faint.  Thereafter, my hands and face got the sensation of tingling.  It felt like ice was running through my veins.  My heart stopped racing approximately fifteen or so minutes after it began.  The tingling sensation in my hands and face ended approximately one hour later.  I also noticed a strange taste in my mouth during this same timeframe.  Subsequently, I had the sensation of being dizzy and lightheaded.  Importantly, I have never reacted to a vaccine in this manner.  On Saturday, April 3rd, I woke up with symptoms that were to be expected.  My arm was very sore and I felt a little achy.  However, I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded.    That evening and for the next week or so, my heart was beating rapidly, and my blood pressure was elevated.  I also had the continuous feeling of my skin crawling.  My hands and feet also seemed to be experiencing tremors and twitching.    On Sunday, April 4th, I woke up and noticed that my right eye seemed a little blurry as I read an article on my phone.  I assumed I must have slept on my eye wrong and did not pay it much attention.  I do not recall my eye being blurry for the rest of the day.  The following morning on Monday, April 5th, I woke up once again feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  As I walked to the restroom, I noticed that my right eye was blurry again.  This time it seemed to be more pronounced.  Moreover, when I closed my right eye, I could see hundreds of dots in different colors.  In addition to having blurry vision, my legs felt weak and nearly buckled as I walked.  I felt like I was intoxicated.  Upon returning to bed, my teeth began chattering and I felt like I was freezing.  I called my doctor?s office and spoke with a PA who recommended that I go to the ER.    While I checked in at the ER, I could not remember my ZIP code.  I felt like my brain was not running on all cylinders.  Upon explaining my symptomology to the ER doctor, she recommended that I have my blood drawn and that I get an MRI to rule out a stroke.  All test results came back normal.    On Wednesday, April 7th, I made an appointment with an allergist.  They tested me to see if I was allergic to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and Polysorbate 80.  For the skin scratch portion of the test, neither of the substances had much of a reaction on my skin.  I thought the Polysorbate 80 scratch had a little bit of redness to it, but it was negligible.  When the doctor injected Polysorbate 80 under my skin with a syringe, a welt formed.  I am not sure why, but PEG was not injected in the same manner.  As a result of the test, the allergist confirmed that I am allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He mentioned that there may be instances of cross reactivity to PEG for individuals that are allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He recommended that I not get the second Moderna dose unless it was administered in a controlled setting.    On Sunday April 11th, I noticed what felt like a hard vein in my abdominal fat.  It felt slightly tender to the touch.  I was fearful that it could be a clot.  On Tuesday, April 13th, I woke up and as a I stood in the shower, my foot was painful to stand on.  On top of my right foot near my ankle, I could visibly see red inflammation in a vein.  I massaged the vein and the redness and pain dissipated.  Being fearful that I did have blood clots, I scheduled an appointment with a PA at my doctor?s office that same day.  We discussed my ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and me being fearful of blood clots.  She had an EKG performed at the office and ordered a barrage of blood tests.  Everything continued to be normal.    On Sunday, April 18th, I again went to the ER, because the hard vein in my stomach became larger and more tender to the touch.  When I bent over, it felt like there was a lot of pressure emanating from the hard vein down to my groin.  Once again, blood was drawn and everything was normal.  I also had an ultrasound performed on the area that felt like a hard vein and the doctor concluded that it was most likely swollen lymph nodes.  I was diagnosed with lymphadenopathy.    On Monday, April 26th, I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to discuss the ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and pain in my stomach and groin area.  He told me that he had seen other patients that were experiencing similar symptoms and that my immune system was possibly overreacting to the vaccine.  He told me the symptoms should go away in time.  He also ordered a new blood test to check for clots.  The D-Dimer test came back normal.    On Tuesday, April 27th, I experienced a painful genital herpes outbreak.  I normally get one every year.  I had just recovered from an infection in December of 2020.  This outbreak was more intense and for the first time I had nerve pain that wrapped around my hip and down my inner thigh.  As of a week later, the infection is almost gone.      Today is May 4th, and I am still experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness.  Some days are better than others and every time I get optimistic that my dizziness and lightheadedness is finally gone, it reappears.  Being an IT consultant business owner and an attorney, I need to think clearly for my profession.  The side effects from the Moderna vaccine have made it very difficult to function.  I would like to get fully vaccinated, but I am fearful of getting the second shot.  I do not want the vaccine to cause permanent neurological damage or worse.    Finally, I am sure your organization is aware, but there are many other people experiencing the same symptoms as me.

He also states he is experiencing some balance issues/vertigo but feels it could be due to vision issue.  Patient called me at 2:25pm on 6/8/21 and was still experiencing the vision issues.  He was waiting on a call back from his physician for advisement.  He also states that he was experiencing injection site pain, diarrhea, and stomach pain but experienced these same adverse effects with this first moderna vaccine.

                                                Patient called the pharmacy  (6/5/21) to talk about his Moderna Covid vaccinations. He stated he felt drained and sluggish. He had his 1st dose on 5/5/21 and his 2nd dose on 6/2/21. In general he has had the following: Headache, dry mouth, body aches, nausea, and fatigue. I asked him how he felt  the day he called on 6/5/21 (3 days post his second dose). He stated that he still had a headache and was fatigued (he only felt like lying down). Patient is an employee here and wanted to know what he should do about returning to work. I referred him to store manager. I gave her his number and she was going to call him. He had spoken to managers before 6/5/21. I explained that these side effects are possible with vaccines and that some patients respond with more side effects than others or have a stronger response. However, I am filing  a VAERS because the patient mentioned that he had the following after his 2nd dose. He stated that about an hour after his vaccine on 6/2/21, he had hives and itching on his arms and neck and dry throat. He stated that he has used Benadryl and hydrocortisone to treat these symptoms. I asked him did he have any reaction after his 1st dose on 5/5/21. He stated that he had itching in his throat after the 1st one, but he thought it was just a dry throat and did not know if it was coming from the vaccine. As far as I know, 6/5/21 was the first day that the he had let anyone at the pharmacy know about any side effects. I told him to let his primary care doctor know this information that we discussed. I also recommended that he could take Tylenol if he wanted to do so.  Patient used a Doctor on Demand service through employee and provider prescribed aspirin 325 mg tablet once daily.

                                                On 5/30/2021 and 5/31/2021:  Bedridden with chills, nausea, tachycardia, shortness of breath, fatigue, lightheadedness, sensitivity to light and sound, loss of appetite, and altered taste.    Approximately two weeks ago (around 6/27/2021):  Sudden onset of pain in the chest, then heart felt like a clenched fist, then heart started racing.  Couldn&#39;t catch a breath and felt like passing out.  I crawled to my neighbors house and told them to call an ambulance as I thought I was having a heart attack.  While waiting for ambulance, got extreme chills and sweats.  Ambulance came and did EKG which was normal.  Gave me the option to go to hospital, but felt better so I declined.  Since I have gotten the vaccine, I have consistently struggled with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and lightheadedness, to the point where I feel like I&#39;m going to pass out, or die.

With in a 2 hour timeframe after that I started getting very very hot with profuse sweating and a severe mood change headache almost to where I could not function or think straight. Finally slowly subsided within several hours.   The few days following the shot now I have random body aches and light to moderate headaches throughout the day. With a more severe upset stomach on and off.

As a result I felt the need to go to bed early at about 9:30 PM. At about midnight I woke up with severe chills and intense body aches. I didnt get much sleep but the chills went away before 6:00 AM. The achiness remained but not as intense. I then had a migraine with a lost of appetite and more fatigue most of the day on February 10. Around 4:00 PM on the 10th all the symptoms suddenly started to leave and I began to feel normal.

WITHIN MAYBE 1-2 MINUTES, HIS WIFE CAME TO THE COUNTER AND SAID HE IS OUT, PASSED OUT.  I WENT TO CHECK ON HIM. YELLED TO MY TECH TO CALL 911. PATIENT WAS SLUMPED OVER IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS BREATHING AND HAD A PULSE, BUT NOT AWAKE. TRIED TO AROUSE HIM BE CALLING HIS NAME AND SHAKING HIS ARM TO WAKE HIM. HIS WIFE THEN WAS TAPPING THE SIDE OF HIS FACE TO WAKE HIM UP. SKIN WAS GRAY IN COLOR. SHE STATED HE IS GOING TO VOMIT AS HE WAKES UP AND NEEDED A GARBAGE CAN. I WENT TO GRAB CAN FROM PHARMACY AND RETURNED. SHE PUT CAN IN BETWEEN HIS LEGS AS HE CAME TO AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO VOMIT. HE WAS AWAKE BUT OUT OF SORTS.  AT THAT TIME THE EMT ARRIVED AND WENT TO WORK. PATIENT BP WAS LOW AND THEY STARTED IV FLUIDS. THE PATIENT WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO EMT AND ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS. THEY PREPPED HIM FOR TRANSPORT TO THE EMERGENCY DEPT FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. BY THE TIME THE PATIENT WAS BEING TRANSPORTED, HIS BP WAS BACK UP CLOSE TO NORMAL.  I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PATIENT AND HIS WIFE AROUND 5PM THAT DAY. THEY WERE LEAVING THE HOSPITAL AT THAT TIME. THE PATIENT WAS FEELING MUCH BETTER. HIS BP WAS BACK TO NORMAL, HIS COLOR WAS BACK, AND HIS VOICE WAS STRONG. THEY BOTH PLAN ON RETURNING FOR THE COVID 19 DOSE #2.

Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

Shoulders are achy.  Thoracic back still mildly painful to touch and feels like it is bruised but there is no discoloration, swelling or otherwise notable signs.  Also had abdominal muscle pain that felt like he was being punched in the stomach - still feels like he did a lot of sit ups.  Still having loss of appetite, loss of taste, and general fatigue.  He took Aleve once with relief of headache but no other doses have been taken.

Later the next day after he ate a meal he developed severe gut pain, 9 out of 10 in pain range.  This happened everyday for the next 6 days.  He contacted his gastro doctor on 3/29/21 and he was ordered to have blood work, X-rays, and CT.  He had been working w/ both his gastro and PCP to treat his symptoms.  He was prescribed Bactrim, renewed RX for diacylamine 20mg, and omeprazole. Also added proactizime, IV GARD, Gas X and Align.  His doctors believe the vax triggered his chronic conditions to flare up.  He feels some better but he still has pain and bloating after eating with vomiting and diarhea.    He says the pain is now a 4 to 5.  He continues to have to take additional medication daily.  He was told this would take weeks to recover from.

Second week I?ve been dizzy. No appetite. Face tingling and numbness. Headache. I was Covid tested which was negative. Primary doctor has told me it?s neuralgia. Still have dizziness and on and off numbness in back of head and jawline. Sometimes my tongue going numb. An hour or two later my cheek will go numb. Very strange and very annoying. I?m still fatigued with no appetite.  Really hoping it starts to get better soon.

About 10 minutes after vaccination the patient and his wife alerted me that he was feeling like he was going to pass out.  Also reported feelings of ringing in ears, nausea, cold sweats and very pale.  I had the patient sit on the ground.  I offered him water, but his wife got him a soft drink.  He notified us that he had not eaten today.  We gave his wife glucose tablets which the patient took 2.  He took the 2 glucose tablets while we waited for EMT&#39;s to arrive.  He had more color in his face after the soft drink and glucose tablets.  The EMT&#39;s evaluated him and decided to take him to hospital out of caution.

During one trip to bathroom where bladder was drained, felt nauseated and light-headed. Got into position to vomit into toilet, and upon getting up, fainted. Spent the rest of the day with high levels of nausea, soreness, and headaches. At the end of the day, with more ibuprophen and pepto bismol, was able to sit up and interact. Food body would accept without nausea was crackers/toast. At end of the night, left shoulder was swollen and red around injection site, radiating out approximately 4in.

Pain was severe enough to bring tears. Began treating with Tylenol 650mg every 4-6hrs, which seemed to help initially. Starting around 11pm, I had severe chills with uncontrollable tremors lasting next 3-4hrs. Could not stop shaking, could not get warm. Intense joint pain continued. Was able to sleep intermittently from 2-3am, but awoke with return of severe nausea and vertigo/dizziness around 3am, accompanied by profuse sweating and hot flashes. I laid on cold tile floor with ice-pack on head/chest until it passed, about 30min, and nearly called for ambulance. Treated nausea by inhaling vapor from rubbing alcohol and taking a dose of zofran dissolving tab, which seemed to help. Able to sleep 4am-9am May 15th and return to normal diet. Malaise continued throughout 15th, but gradually subsided. Rashes in armpits and hot sweats night of 15th. I appear to be mostly normal as of today, May 17th.

The headache last to Saturday night. Saturday night as the headache faded I became nauseous and vomited.   By 36 hours after the vaccine (around midnight Saturday) I felt much better and was finally able to eat after not being able to all day. On Sunday I was tired but could function, and by today (Monday), I am fully better.

                                                Patient had Ileoanal anastomosis (J-pouch) surgery in 2000 and minor corrective surgery related to the pouch in 2015.  This event required a 15 day hospital stay due to severe abdominal cramps, pain, vomiting and diarrhea.  It was a suspected Crohn&#39;s flareup with stricture or blockage complications.  Vomiting and diarrhea began late 2/24.  Patient went to emergency room next morning and was subsequently admitted.  Multiple diagnostic imaging (X-ray, MRI, CT Scans, etc) showed narrowing of the small intestines above J-pouch.  Scope was completed on day 9 of the hospital stay.  Scope showed no narrowing or blockages, root cause of vomiting, diarrhea and severe abdominal pain unknown.  Patient had been doing well for several years after 2015 surgery.

They gave me a check up. I had paralysis in my left hand and was not able to move it. I was taken to the ER and had to do motion tests. I am able to move it now, but I have difficulty. I still have pain in my hand and arm.
