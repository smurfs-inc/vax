Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                I received the vaccine 30 min. prior to starting my shift as a Nurse in the ED. About 1 hour after receiving the shot while standing I felt off balance and began to have a vertigo like dizziness. I sat down and tried to drink some water but began spitting the water back up and dry heaving after trying to drink. I did not feel nauseous if I was not drinking. I did feel the sensation of a slight lump in my throat. I did not have any shortness of breath, tachycardia,  rash or fever. I did not want to check in as a patient so I called my wife to come and pick me up from work. Before I left I had the pharmacy send me some Pepcid and Benadryl and I took 25mg of Benadryl and 20mg of Pepcid before leaving. I left work around 1400 and now at 1500 I am able to drink fluids. The slight lump in my throat seems to have improved. I still feel a little dizzy and off balance.

He pulled over and threw up. Once he got to work he vomited again. He drove to another facility for work and then threw up 3 or 4 more times. He began experiencing hot flashes at this time. He went to the hospital and was seen in the emergency room. He threw up several more times in the ER and stated that his heart was racing and that he had diarrhea. The emergency room gave him medications for the nausea and he stayed there for 2 or 3 hours. He began to feel better and was discharged to home.

                                                Around noon, my fiance doubled over in agonising pain and clutched his right side. We treated it like a stomach ache and he went through the rest of the day, even at work, in gut wrenching pain. This morning when I woke up, I noticed he was out on the couch. When I went to check on him, he was as white as a ghost and his lips were greying around the edges. I immediately told him to call into work. I thought he would say no because he has not called in in over 10 years, but to my surprise, he did so. I put him in bed and the abdominal pain is still present and now his fever is over 103!!!  I bought Tylenol and Motrin and will be alternating between the two until the fever breaks and if the pain persists by 8 pm, we will be headed to the emergency room...

Then around 8am I started to have chills which then I checked my temp and it was 101.0 degrees F. Then I started to get a headache and severe body aches. Around 3pm I tried to eat something which I then threw it up. I tried to drink water and flavored water which I also threw up the water. I also went into the bathtub 7 times that day to stop the chills. Which it did but right when I got out they started again which then I felt worse. Around 11pm 1/23/2021 I ended up going into the ER which then they gave me IV fluids and then Benadryl and Toradol by IV. After those were administered I started feeling better which then I was discharged and went home.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving my injection, I began experiencing a slight and almost undetectable headache which persisted throughout the remainder of the day.  At 3 AM the following morning, I awoke with a bad headache and body aches, unable to sleep.  The headache and body aches persisted throughout the day (2/5) and evening.  On 2/6, the body aches had subsided and only a slight headache was present, although gastrointestinal issues were present the entire day.  On 2/7, gastrointestinal issues (GI) subsided, but the headache persisted and became worst that evening, especially at the base of the neck.  On 2/8, slight GI issues, no body aches, and slight headache persist.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

I found him in the bathroom after he regained consciousness in a cold sweat, extremely pale, saying that he thought he was going to throw up.  He said it felt like food poisoning.  I got him back into bed with a cool wash cloth and he slept off and on the rest of the day.  He started feeling a bit better but struggled to comprehend simple questions and would just stare at me blankly as if he couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying.  Even though he slept most of the day he was falling asleep in his chair by about 8pm.  The paleness, waves of exhaustion, and inability to stay awake past 8:30/9pm has continued.

His arm felt sore as if somebody hit him several times, very sore.  I felt sick, felt queasy, nauseous wanting to vomit but did not.  He felt really tired, fatigued because he didn&#39;t get any sleep that night.  He went all day feeling terrible, nauseous, felt like being through the ringer an flushed, which went on for 2-3 days.  He now feels a lot better, but felt like he was getting the flu.  He did not take anything for it and did take some medicine to help him sleep and did get a lot of rest and sleep.  He did drink a lot of liquids to keep his throat lubricated.  He also did have a throbbing headache, which he normally does not get headaches and felt terrible.  He did take some aspirin for that.  The symptoms have all resolved and feels perfectly fine now.     Stated that he has never felt so bad in his life.

I am not throwing up anymore but I am still feeling dizzy and I am having trouble functioning and walking everyday. The vertigo came and went for about four weeks. I am still experiencing these side effects. Please help.

He stated in the informed consent form that he felt really dizzy on his 1st Moderna vaccine.  I administered his 2nd vaccine and told him to wait in front of the pharmacy for 30 minutes.  Approximately 30 minutes later one of the pharmacy technicians stated that the patient did not look like he was feeling well.  I imediately went out as asked how the patient felt, and he stated that he was feeling really dizzy, had fatigue land a little tingley with a mild headache, nausea and some muscle aches.  I offered to get him a wet towel and some water or anything he might like to drink.  He stated he would like some water to drink.  I asked him if he needed someone to come and get him.  He called his mother and she came to pick him up at 6:35pm.  I told him and her we would follow up with the patient tomorrow 5/19/2021 at the earliest possible time.

I was admitted to The Emergency room because of high blood sugar so I went back on Lantus and everything has normalized. I was admitted on 06/09/2021 and discharged 06/10/2021. I had blood work drawn and a COVID test. My COVID test came back normal and my blood work showed that my blood sugar was very high.

                                                Discovered a large rash/hives developed on right shin within 30 minutes of vaccination.  Rash was dark reddish color initially and slightly itchy but not painful.  Generalized joint point (left wrist/arm) and nausea also began within 30 minutes of vaccination.  Went on a run later that day, much more severe fatigue than usual.  Took a couple days off of exercise to rest.  3 days later, went running again and noticed an occasional sharp pain in left knee.  The following day, left knee was in severe pain and was unable to walk normally or flex leg fully.  Very little swelling, but pain was persistent and did not resolve with painkillers (Ibuprofen).  Stopped all running activities indefinitely, and started short walks a couple days later.  After 5 days of walking, left knee blew out with excruciating pain and swelling, like a rheumatoid arthritis flare up (I never had arthritis in my life).  Now I was completely unable to walk more than a few feet without a cane and it was excruciatingly painful.  Took vicodin for pain, but still not fully effective.  Worst pain I&#39;ve ever had in my knees, completely unable to sleep or even lie down.  Any movement was horrible.  After further rest, ice, and elevation, knee swelling slowly subsided but took many weeks to improve.  Pain continued even without swelling, and is still not fully resolved today (over 2 months later).   Left knee flexiblity is still limited and I can only do short walks with mild pain, no running or hiking.  I am effectively disabled at this time.

Patient was transferred into wheelchair and brought into an examination room with provider NP. Provider and staff collected vitals, blood sugars, and HPI. Patient reported he &#34;felt like he was going to pass out&#34; but did not actually syncopize. Patient was with staff for well over one hour for observation, and symptoms resolved within 15 minutes of the initial onset without intervention. It was deemed likely vasovagal response by the provider.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

                                                Around 11:30 pm that evening I started feeling extremely warm in my face and thighs. Figuring it was due to the shot, I decide to try and lay down to sleep it off. A short time later, I awoke freezing with chills and uncontrollable shivering. My whole body hurt especially my lower back and pressure in my head. This continued throughout the night until the early morning. As the shivering and chills subsided, extreme fatigue, body aches and head pressure continued and it was difficult to get up at points. I had no appetite and forced myself to drink to stay hydrated.  About 1:00 pm, I started to feel better, but that was short lived. Approximately 4:30 ? 5pm, the chills and shivering returned and I had 101 fever. I had some tea and toast and then went to bed for the night. When I awoke this morning, I felt a million times better. As of writing this email, I still have some slight fatigue, aches, and head pressure, but night and day difference from yesterday.

When I woke up at 5 Am I suffered from severe headache. Remainder of the day I had extreme digestive issues that continued over the next several days. At the conclusion of the second day I developed a fever of 101. Pinpointed severe pain developed at the base of my neck between my shoulder blades. That pain remained for approximately 24 to 48 hours that lead to extreme pain and stiff neck on my right side. Chills and periodic fever developed for two days past shot. By day three I had extreme right side neck pain that continued down into my right shoulder blade. By day four and five I suffered from extreme neck pain and severe headache that was focused from my right eye through my head down the right side of my neck to my right shoulder blade. By day 4 this continued with dizziness and blurred vision. I had inability to eat and strong feelings to vomit but only didn&#39;t because I hadn&#39;t consumed any food that day. I continued to suffer from extreme headaches and complete physical exhaustion with inability to stay away. In addition, I continued to have periodic chills but with no fever.  As I submit this in day 5 I still suffer from lack of energy and the stiff neck remains down through my right shoulder blade.

Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

                                                The adverse events began one day after the 1st dose of the vaccine series.  The adverse events include: diarrhea, frequency, abdominal cramping, and nausea. The patient sought treatment after 2 weeks of symptoms. The physician diagnosed the patient  with infectious diarrhea and prescribed a 3-day course of Cipro 500mg BID. The symptoms improved but the patient continued to have some GI symptoms remaining. The symptoms worsened after the second dose of the vaccine series. The patient went to the doctor on March 1st and received another course of Cipro 500mg BID but for a 5 day course.

                                                Delayed reaction occurred 8 hrs. after receiving vaccine. Felt as if I was injected with the Flu, based on the symptoms that arose: chills, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, fever, body aches, weakness, no appetite or desire to hydrate(every single symptom was severe) These symptoms lasted 12 hrs. I chose to go in to work, instead of taking the day off. I truly believe that because I pushed my body through this painful ordeal, it helped me to overcome this Flu-like feeling that I endured for 12 hours: 10 of those at my job. I also experienced a swelling &amp; pain in my right knee. The pain &amp; swelling is finally subsiding as I type this report 4 days after the vaccine.

As the next few days started to progress I started noticing mild muscle spasms all over my body, mostly in my legs; waking up in the middle of the night, dry mouth, night sweat (1 occurrence), sudden onset of rapid and irregular heart beat (1 occurrence); kidney pain (right and left), upper abdominal pain (right and left). Prior to vaccine I did not experience any of these events.

                                                Shortly after 15 min observation post-Moderna immunization, pt complained of nausea.  Pt went into  safety room and was seated when first pharmacist  arrived.  Pt said they felt cold and were shaking.  Upon touching forehead and hands, pt felt clammy.  Pt then they did not want to lie down for fear of vomiting.  Pt later said he had pain in left arm where vaccination given.  When second pharmacist  arrived, pt said his hip hurt but that was sometimes normal for him.  Pt&#39;s BP was taken at approx. 5:38pm with a wrist monitor and BP shown as 69/57 with HR of 63.  1st Pharmacist called 911 while 2nd pharmacist wrapped pt in blankets and continued to rub his back and chest to keep pt warm.  Pt&#39;s teeth were chattering and hands were extremely cold.  Pt still complained of nausea and appeared lethargic.  1st Pharmacist continually monitored pt&#39;s BP / HR with upper arm cuff while on phone with 911.  5:41pm BP was 202/123 with HR of 63.  5:44pm BP was 185/125 with 63 HR.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma and Hyperthyroidism. Concomitant products included FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE (FLOVENT) for an unknown indication.   On 22-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out to sleep at 745 pm) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 19-Apr-2021 at 11:30 PM, the patient experienced COLD SWEAT (cold sweats), ASTHENIA (really weak), DYSSTASIA (could barely stand up) and ILLNESS (sick to his stomach). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VERTIGO (head spinning), DIZZINESS (dizzy), FATIGUE (tired), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (pain at injection site) and NAUSEA (nauseas).

This lasted for over 30 minutes. I then left the store. For the next hour I felt lethargic and started feeling nauseous. After 1 hour I had severe uncontrollable nausaea and vomitting, this continued until I went ot sleep 3 hours later. After 2 hours I experienced dry heaves and could not hold down any liquids. After 3 hours I was extremely tired and needed to sleep, I slept for 6 hours until 11pm and then felt better. The following day I had a sore arm, felt sick and needed to rest, then felt better the day after that. My left arm was sore for 3 or 4 days.

He then reports over past 4-5 days has felt dehydrated, dark urine, and now with some abdominal distension, nausea, and fatigue.  Normal bowel movements.  Able to eat, no Tylenol or alcohol use.  All meds stopped by Endo due to lab results except his insulin.    Did find a note that states he received 2nd Moderna vaccine but also noted that his Endo suggested he should not get the 2nd dose.  Our Immunization system did not pull in a 2nd dose.  Also was some confusion as to whether he got Pfizer or Moderna, but the system did show Moderna given 3/30.  Plan: CT scan, stay off all meds except insulin, PharmD review of meds and report to VAERs, schedule f/u with GI (will see in ~ 2months)  CT Scan of abdomen/pelvis: no acute findings  Will continue to f/u with PCP and watch lab to be sure numbers are improving.

I nearly blacked out. I got very hot and had to take off all my clothes, then when I got up to the toilet to diarrhea again I needed to vomit, I blacked out on my bathroom floor. when I woke up I went back to bed. at the time of the occurence I was too delusional to call for help. I barely ate that day because I felt so bad. I did notice the second day I felt worse after drinking 1,000 mg of vitamin C from one of those Emercencey Packets with lots of water. and the next day I took twice as much to (knock out) what ever I was feeling.

I called for help and my son assisted me to my bed where I collapsed and could hardly move while I broke out in cold sweats and my wife monitored my heart rate and placed an oxygen monitor on my finger.  she said my pulse held steady and slow.  The event lasted about 10 minutes and I felt I must return to the toilet for a bowl movement.  I began having diarrhea and then began to throw up. After that i took a cool shower and laid in bed. I stayed in bed for about 48 hours.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

Had a glass of water and resolved. Evaluated by doctor and had pulse of 92 (high for patient) and elevated blood pressure 148/92. Rest of vitals normal. Felt anxious. Ate lunch, had about 6 more episodes of mouth drying out, last one about 10 hours after vaccine.  Resolved with water. Took benedryl 50mg. Next felt fatigue and right arm soreness. Felt normal within 48 hours.

                                                3 minutes after vaccination the patient began to feel a tingling and pain in his arm where the vaccine was placed.  Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.  The patient stated that he had been fasting for 2 days and we determined low blood sugar likely played into his response to the vaccine.  Glucose gel was placed in mouth and patient felt better within 15 minutes.

                                                On the first day I had a huge lump underneath my armpit I did not become too concerned with that I read it was something that could happen regarding the lymph node. 10 days later I woke up at 3:30 in the morning and had to dial 911 my throat felt like it was closing and my lips were both swollen. I went in the ambulance they brought me to the emergency room where they gave me Benadryl a steroid and some IV fluids. as soon as I receive the Benadryl my throat started to open up and my lips both started to go down . My lip continue to swell for the next three days on and off often on. Every time it swelled up I took Benadryl and every time sure enough it went away . The day I came home from the hospital I thought I was doing much better until that following night I became severely nauseous. I don?t know if it was something that they had given me in the hospital or still a reaction that was going on in my body, but I had some sort of stomach bug I threw up that whole day, had chills sweats  and a pounding headache that would not go away for over 48 hours .I was unable to eat or drink for 24 hours and had to go to an urgent care where they provided me with some medication for nausea. My concern right now is I am hearing that the second shot hits a lot harder than the first one and if this was a reaction to the shot I am very afraid of what will go on if I get the second one.  I cannot take a chance with my life.  I really want to shot I work in an environment where I am working with the department  which is why I was able to get the vaccine so early I feel safe being vaccinated I am very disappointed that this happened I just cannot take a chance having a family etc. Also I have very bad medical in Sherance so I am dealing with all of the bills from this hospital stay I have a  deductible which I can?t afford and then only 50% is covered afterwards. That is the reason I do not go to the hospital under no circumstance unless I am dying which that night I was that scared I felt the need I had to go.

About midnight March 16 severe chills, restlessness, headache, muscle aches, nauseous and fever of 101.  Took two extra-strength Tylenol. 3 a.m. fever broke with sweats. Headache and body ache remained, as did chills. Took two Advil when I woke up about 7 a.m. on  March 16 for a headache. But I was too tired and achy to get out of bed. The fever came back to 102 degrees. Nauseous, couldn&#39;t eat much. Headache. At 2:30 p.m. on March 16, I felt better...  I was very tired the night of March 16 and still had a minor headache and went to bed about  8 p.m. On March 17, I was back to normal with only a very minor headache and some diahreaha that morning and afternoon.  I did not take any medicine that day. On March 18 I had no symptoms at all. I am a very healthy 42-year-old adult. I would classify my reaction as significant, but not severe. I called in sick to work (and I work from home). So it was enough to take me out of a day.

Cranial pressure that felt around entire circumference of head.  Lasting over 36 hours each time that forced bed-ridden behavior, forced time off of work, and loss of appetite.  Spiked heart rate on numerous occasion throughout the following 36&#43; hours with heart rates spiking as great as 136 bpm.  I should of reported it and visited my physician, but there was nothing more they could do besides for me to hydrate, suppress with Tylenol, &amp; ride it out.  Anyone with previous decent COVID cases should be advised against receiving the vaccine.  But entities are still forcing us to have it for our jobs.  I couldn?t endure a third round.  It was a violent illness following the vaccine, which was equivalent to one of my first ?bad? days of actual COVID.

I had extreme thirst that could not be quenched and was unable to go back to sleep. The entire day after the vaccination my stomach was slightly upset, but mostly I felt bad the rest of the day due to the lack of sleep. After work that day, I came home and went to bed around 6 PM. The symptoms went away after getting some sleep and were overall minor, but the extreme thirst was something I had never experienced before.

                                                On 12/24, at 8:30a I began to get nauseated  which lasted about 2hrs. Around 1am I woke  up with SOB which continued thru the night, with off and on sleep. I woke back up at 5:45am, went to work with the SOB which lasted until 12N and resolved on its own.  Around 3-330pm I began to feel feverish and had chills and was told I was disoriented.  My temp was 100.5, HR 122 R 34 BP 170/100 O2-93%. I notified the DON of my feelings who advised me those were possible side effects of the vaccine and made me continue to work until I just couldnt take the feelings anymore and went to the ER.  I was there for about 2 hrs and my body began to calm down.  I took taken 100mg of Tylenol on my own just to help with the fever which did break shortly and I have been fine every since. I was positive for COVID 12/14.

                                                Day after the vaccine I awoke with a very sore left arm which was to be expected.  Upon moving I experienced vertigo, dizziness, headache, and extreme pressure in the left side of my face to include sinus cavities and deep inner ear pressure.  I had some episodes of loose stools, not diarrhea, but not formed stools.  These symptoms still persist to today, 1/15/2021, except for loose stool, that has returned to normal.  I had a Dr. appointment today and the doctor would not rule out post vaccine side effects. I was tested for COVID on 1/11/2021 as a precautionary measure as I was displaying symptoms, but the test result was COVID not detected.

The big change from dose 1 to 2 is muscle twitching.  The twitches coincide with the more extreme joint aches.  Sore arm  All started about 9 hours after vaccine. Sore arm was mitigated with movement and stretching (as compared to the first dose). Other symptoms have lessened since 7am (19 hours after shot), but linger.  Ibuprofen seems to lessen, but not end eymptoms.

                                                I&#39;ve lost 16 pounds in 1 month and 20 days without trying.  Moderna killed my obsession for food.  I was 268 lbs when I presented for the 1st dose of Moderna at the Robeson CRV.  Within 24 hours I was weak, cold, aching all over, and nauseous. The nausea moved over to lack of interest in food.     I&#39;ve struggled with intense craving for food non-stop for 30 years.  The cravings are gone.  By my second shot in March I was down to around 260 lbs.  Twenty days after my second shot, I am down to 252lbs.  Food is more of a necessity now rather than a constant desire.  I believe the vaccine modulated insulin/ghrelin or crossed the blood brain barrier and modulated the incessant dopamine reward signaling in the mesolimbic DA pathway when I eat food.  I reach satiety easily now.  I also have diminished need for Ativan.  I use to drink close to a gallon of water a day.  Now I have no real interest.  I might drink a couple liters a day.  To put things in perspective, before Moderna, I could eat 2 foot long Subway sandwiches, 3-6 cookies, 2-4 32 oz of soda and chips to stop my hunger for 2-3 hours.  2-3 hours later I would feel extremely hungry with a growling stomach. I could then consume 2-3 double cheeseburgers, a 20 piece nugget, 2 parfaits, and a chocolate sundae.  After Moderna, now a half a Subway sandwich and maybe a cookie are enough to last for most of the day.  The desire for food has diminished to necessity to eat and lack of interest in eating, even when my stomach is empty.  If I have a soda or sparkling water, I might have 1 or 2 and stop.  Moderna flipped some hormonal switch in my body.  It&#39;s great.  Food went from being an insatiable desire to a basic necessity.  I&#39;ve lost 16 pounds in 1 month and 20 days without trying.

I woke up the next day to go to my job and as I was standing at my closet to grab a shirt I felt like I was going to pass out. everything went black. The next thing I knew I was laying on the floor with a shirt in my hand but don&#39;t remember how I got on the floor or if I even fell.  I asked my Girlfriend if she had heard me fall, She said no. I walked into the bedroom and layed back down on the bed still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. after what felt like a few minutes, I began Heaving like I was going to throw up but I felt like it was a dream and was very slow to react until my girlfriend told me to run to the bathroom. the whole time I was coughing up a foam.

                                                Two nights in a row, 04/07 and 04/08, woke up with rapid heart rate (fluctuating from 85-110 bpm) and felt dizzy, fatigued, feverish, sweaty, shaky and about to pass out. Could have been hyperventilating in sleep because of rapid heart rate. Required about 2 hours of attention to reading, yoga and relaxation to get to sleep. On morning of 04/08, heart rate was still high (78-95) for resting, which is usually in the 50s or 60s. GI disturbance led to frequent bowel movements and the whole condition resulted in malaise and feeling of impending doom. A feedback from acute anxiety as a result of symptoms could be involved. Also involved is the diphenhydramine I took at 9 pm on 04/07 to treat hay fever and acute insomnia. Night if 04/08 was more manageable. But it interrupted sleep with strong disturbances that felt like spasms in prefrontal cortex coming out of sleep. More likely it was movement in sinus congestion that triggered a startle response while exhausted from work. It was bad timing to have the shot during a very busy work week.

                                                Approximately 14 minutes post-vaccination patient stood up from chair in waiting area complaining of nausea and GI complaints. Patient was instructed by pharmacist on duty giving vaccinations to immediately sit down. Patient described nausea and feeling a little cold. Patient&#39;s smart watch reported a heart rate of 56 bpm at around 1:18pm.  Pharmacist assessment showed that patient was cold to the touch, not dizzy, slightly uncomfortable, and after a few minutes was visibly perspiring. Patient took 1/3 of a bottle of water provided to him while waiting for Emergency Responders were contacted. Patient then noted that they had some tongue swelling and upon observation by Pharmacist on duty patient&#39;s tongue was inflammed and lightly swollen. Emergency Responders advised against further fluids or food intake so patient was denied further fluids until Emergency Responders arrived. Patient was layed flat on the floor as a precaution until Emergency Responders arrived. Patient was assessed at around 1:20pm by Firefighters who arrived on the scene first and vitals were taken. Upon instruction by Firefighters patient stood up straight and noted no signs of dizziness. Firefighters did note some swelling of the tongue and patient insisted on being evaluated at the Hospital.

All of a sudden, after about 5 minutes, I felt a rush go through my body and managed to declare &#34;I&#39;m not feeling well&#34; before I lost coherence and clarity. My wife called for help from the attendants as I started to convulse, get dizzy, start sweating, and feel like I was going to pass out. I then proceeded to throw up a couple of times and had to lie back for 30 minutes before switching to the passenger side of the vehicle for the ride home. I was completely worn out and weak, with flu-like symptoms and nausea for the rest of the day and for several days afterward.

At around 9:00 AM on Saturday 4/3/2021, I was awakened by intense pain and pressure that felt like the worst heartburn I&#39;d ever experienced. After OTC heartburn treatments didn&#39;t help, at around 11:00 AM I went to the local ER where I was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack. After being given some baby aspirin and a nitro tablet, I started feeling better and was airlifted immediately to a nearby cardiology unit at another hospital. A heart catheterization and EKGs determined that I had not had a heart attack, but instead had takotsubo cardiomyopathy. I was admitted into the cardiac ICU overnight for observation, transferred to a non-critical room the next day (4/4/2021), and released on Monday 4/5/2021.

Lots and lots of liquids from day 1; day 4 started taking minimal acetaminophen to ease pain and feelings of fever. Temperature never went above 96degrees.  Small portioned meals to get nutrients, and constant liquids to stay hydrated. This did not relieve any symptoms, until night 7 when pain started to subside. Constant stretching now to release the constricting of all my muscles and tendons over the course of side effects. Still constipated and slight nausea, still weak in strength.

Pharmacist stayed with him, placed him on the floor and gave him an icepack and a basket incase he got sick. He laid down on floor for about 10 minutes with ice pack on neck. Felt better to sit up for 5 minutes and then wanted to move to chair in post IMZ area for 5 more minutes. He felt good enough to leave after 30 minutes post vaccination. Will all tomorrow for follow up.

                                                Patient by 5/8/21 was experiencing fever to 103, lower back pain, palpitaitons, headache, nausea, left arm and neck pain and dizziness.  He was taking Advil and Tylenol to assist with symptom managment.  Left arm and neck pain persisted.  On the morning of 5/11/21 he awoke with central chest tightness, left arm/shoulder/neck achiness, nausea and headache. During ride to hospital, he had palpitations for 30 minutes.  He arrived at  Medical Center where he was found to have a positive troponin I of 4.2 (ULN of &lt;0.045).  Echo done at that time showed EF of 59% with basal inferior, anterolateral hyokinesia, basal inferolateral hyokinesia, mid inferolateral hyokinesia, diastolic LV function normal function for age and trace mitral regurgitation.  ECG showed non diagnostic ST elevations in leads II, III, AVF.  The patient was transferred to another Medical Center  for urgent cardiac cath based on resting chest, arm and neck pain, positive troponin and wall motion abnormalities seen on echo.  Cardiac cath found normal coronary arteries that were free of disease.  Troponin I at this medical center was positive 0.31 and 0.39.  Further testing ordered is a cardiac MRI to assess for possible acute myocarditis.

So much like the flu, I was very tired, nausea, fatigue, In my upper left chest the &#34;vein&#34; or &#34;arteria&#34;  was in pain ( sending shocker&#39;s like electrodes  ) it almost felt like having a stroke or heart attack ( never experienced one before though ) didn&#39;t want to move do anything I didn&#39;t continue working at restaurant hired part time there as a prep-cook. I didn&#39;t even show up.

Could only get sufficient O2 it seemed when lying on back and laying down on my side. Was every bit of all my energy to just take a shower and nearly blacked out with heart racing as I tried to breath in the shower but steam in air was too much to breathe.  Lasted for 4 days that way.  I still feel like I am constantly winded and I as of today have only regained about half the lung capacity I had prior to incident, and that is just over 1 month mark. I also now have been getting these bad facial breakouts particularly on and around my nose and forehead /;eyes area. I never ever had any acne issues to speak of prior, even as a teen and during puberty. Never had any acne ever and now its bad breakouts some appear to may even leave ling term scarring in certain spots. My day to day diet and normal habits have not been added to or altered in any way either. My heart feels like it beats twice as fast and twice as hard now and I am always short of breath now too. I do not have a family doctor to go and see and I was afraid to call for an e.m.t. or go to the e.r. at the early onset of it all. I truly hought I was a gonner a couple of times though throughout the first 4 days.

However, after getting the vaccine, I?ve had fatigue, occasional shortness of breath, increased pain &amp; anxiety, no appetite and issues with sleep. Since I don?t know if the vaccine has caused this I?m going to check with my psychiatrist (since I haven?t seen a doctor I?ll Mark none of the above below) but since it?s not improving, thought I should report it as well in case other people have had similar issues.

Hypotension, shakiness and mild nausea.  I&#39;ve never had this symptom in my life and have taken 3mg melatonin before bed for years.  (3mg, not 4mg as reported on the previous page).  I was back to normal after ~10 minutes and woke up perfectly normal. Also, minor shoulder pain.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

                                                After the first day there was the typical site injection pain. Three Tylenol on the next day seem to take care of that but the pain quickly moved to the Front and top of the right pelvic bone. No amount of Tylenol has seem to do anything with that pain. After a week it seem to start to migrate to the left front top pelvic bone. These symptoms were mild and I was still able to carry out my daily activities in law-enforcement.  Friday night January 22 is when I started to have pulsating pressure in the back of my head, chills, dizziness, excessive urination, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue. The symptoms have persisted through today but are starting to ease. I took a COVID-19 test on Sunday, January 24 the results came back today as Covid negative.

                                                An hour or so after receiving my first Moderna shot, I was aware of an unusual feeling in my lower right abdomen.  Knowing this to be a potential problem area for Appendicitis I paid attention to it for the next day and there was no change.  Two days after receiving the  vaccine shot this sensation got worse and I was visibly bloated.  I went to an Urgent Care where a doctor referred me to the closest ER due to the area of pain and bloat in my body.   After several blood tests and an MRI at the ER, it was determined that my appendix was inflamed and I was admitted to the hospital for surgery ASAP.   Luckily the appendix was stable, never burst and was successfully removed the following day in the early afternoon.   I am currently at home recovering successfully.

                                                I have experienced two episodes of dizziness with sudden onset. The first hit me suddenly while sitting at my desk and the second while I was in the cockpit of an aircraft. The second episode felt like the aircraft had fallen on its side. The second episode being more severe than the first. An immediate change in axis it seemed. Both episodes left me nauseous with mild sweating. I experienced nausea and fatigue lasting between 24-48 hours afterwards. There was no chest pain or palpitations. I did have a lingering headache after each episode of dizziness. I was evaluated at an UTC after the first episode. I was treated with Meclizine but it has not alleviated the symptoms. I followed up with my doctor who advised symptoms were not associated with BPPV or vertigo.  Requested an MRI of the brain which was completed and was unremarkable.  The dizziness has continued since the onset of symptoms above.

On the first night after the vaccination I began to get body aches.  During day 2 the body aches became extreme, where getting out of bed or moving was painful.  The body aches were less severe on days 2 and 3, but are still continuing on day 4.  I was running  a fever all of day during days 2, 3, and 4.  I was throwing up on day 3.  I had GI pain and diarrhea on day 4.  I never have headaches, but have had a headache since day 2 and it is now day 5.  I have had lower back pain since day 2 and that also continues today (day 5).

                                                Day after vaccine I developed sever jaundice including yellowing eyes.  One week after vaccine I had blood work done and my liver enzymes and bilirubin levels were.  On 3/23 I admitted myself to ER with jaundice and vomiting.  My liver levels were normal but bilirubin was still high.  At this point I had lost 30 pounds since my shot.   I was in the hospital for 5 days where the ran UT, CT, and MRI on my abdomen with none showing issues.   Jaundice and itchiness/jaundice got progressively worse.   The hospital ran multitude of blood tests to pin point the issue and even did a liver biopsy.  No tests showed anything abnormal but biopsy isn?t back yet.  At this point 4/1/21, I am still jaundiced, extremely itchiness, lethargy and a total of 33 pounds weigh loss.

                                                Following administration of vaccine patient started to have difficulty swallowing and tingling in mouth and tongue.  Patient was given liquid diphenhydramine and water and stated the difficulty swallowing improved but his mouth still had the tingling sensation.  Patient never reported facial swelling or difficulty breathing and declined an EpiPen.  After 30 minutes or so patient reported improvement and left our facility.  We reached out to the patient later that day and they had continual improvement, but felt they had experienced a possible allergic reaction.

                                                Experience chest pain on right side of chest near armpit which spread across chest one week after the first vaccine shot given on January 25, 2021.  Pain was going away before the second shot. Received second shot on February 22, 2021 and had the chest pain return, extreme fatigue, headaches, rash at injection site and all over back, achy muscles mainly in upper body, dizzy spells, nausea, and abdominal pain. All these symptoms (minus nausea) continued for three weeks and some are still present (fatigue, chest pain and periodic headaches) after six weeks.   I was tested for antibodies and the results came back greater than 400, which is the max limit for the test.  The doctor has never seen results that high and we have no idea how high my antibodies actually are.   Since my symptoms seem to be slightly improving, the doctor did not recommend further treatment.  However, I am concerned as to any possible danger of antibody levels this high.

Patient tested positive for COVID on 4/25 when he presented to the ED. However, he was sent home at that time since he was stable to go home and was not hypoxic. Pt presented to the ED again on 5/4 due to dyspnea on exertion and pain in the back of his knee. Patient was found to be positive for DVT and PE and was started on therapeutic Lovenox. Patient doesn&#39;t have a history of VTE, but he does have a family history of VTE. Since patient wasn&#39;t found to be hypoxic, COVID treatment wasn&#39;t started in the hospital.

I was feeling rather irritable, and an hour or two later I was violently vomiting.   I tried to drink some water shortly after, and that did not help.  My stomach was still rather upset and I vomited again an hour later.  I laid down on the couch the rest of the day with my stomach feeling rather upset in way I&#39;ve not really experienced before.   I was able to sleep for a few hours and I was able to drink small amounts of water by midnight.  I felt a bit cold but I don&#39;t remember anyone saying I had a fever.  I was irritable, deep breaths kinda hurt, and I was a tad dizzy most of the day.  I was able to eat and drink the next morning, but my abdomen was sore.  It still is a bit sore, but I feel almost 100%.

                                                Stomach - dull pain; I had a fever of 102 and over. It lasted a little less than 10 hours (the fever). The pain in stomach started getting progressively worse but still worse. I went to telehealth care but to be safe to go to get images. I spent the night in the hospital and they did a surgery and took out my appendicitis. I got my second shot February 12.

                                                Patient  developed episode of diarrhea shortly after 1st shot in series,  this was followed by  lower extremity swelling and mild dyspnea on exertion, that quickly exacerbated after the 2nd shot on 5/15/2021,  that resulted in severe dyspnea on exertion, severe lower extremity swelling with approximately 25 lb weight gain, orthopnea and hemoptysis. Patient reported temperatures of 99.2 F to 99.8 F.   Outside CT chest abdomen pelvis angiogram showed moderate to large acute segmental/subsegmental pulmonary emboli with trace right heart strain and right lower lobe pulmonary infarction, moderate right pleural effusion, acute splenic vein thrombosis with extension to the proximal portal vein and associated splenic infarcts, bilateral renal infarcts, and evidence of portal hypertension. He was transferred to the Hospital for further management. Upon presentation here he was tachycardic but with stable blood pressures and requiring up to 5 L by nasal cannula. Initial laboratory studies were notable for WBC 21.0, INR 1.8, D-dimer 11653, NT pro-BNP 17684, troponins 603 to 579 to 574, CRP 127. He was started on a heparin infusion. He was admitted to the MICU for further management.   Bedside ultrasound demonstrated reduced biventricular contractility. He was given two doses of 40 mg intravenous furosemide with about 3.5 L of urine output since admission (net negative 3.1 L). His oxygen was weaned to 1 L by nasal cannula. Lower extremity venous and arterial Dopplers were negative.  Subsequent imaging  demonstrated a transperineal inferior infarct with akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior and inferior lateral walls with apical and mid ventricle akinesis secondary to a complete occluded RCA.  moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade noted.  Upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated acute DVT in the lower right IJ, innominate, subclavian and proximal axillary veins.  MRI  venogram was negative for clots, but multiple acute and subacute enhancing infarcts within all 3 vasculature distributions consistent with embolic etiology were noted.  TTE showed of mural thrombus along the septal and inferior walls of the LV apex,  severely enlarged left ventricle with EF of 20%, severe hypokinesis.

After one day of pain and discomfort I woke the following morning (~44hrs after receiving the vaccine) to extreme acute abdominal pain in the lower right abdomen.  Went to Urgent Care facility and was diagnosed by CT scan as having acute appendicitis.  An emergency appendectomy was scheduled and performed for later that evening.  I stayed at the Hospital overnight on 12/24/2020 post operatively on IV antibiotics to recover from the appendectomy.  Was discharged from the hospital on 12/25/2020 and have been recovering for about 10 days now with limitted activity.

                                                More than a week after my vaccine the arm near the injection site started getting sore and my body was achy. The next morning I woke up with it swollen, red, warm to the touch, huge knot covering most of my upper arm. I was also nauseous and a little bit of body aches.  Later that day the area that was red also began getting hives. I massaged it, applied a warm compress, and took Benadryl. The next day it was still sore but the redness wasn?t as bad or the arm wasn?t as swollen.  Later that night the redness and warm to the touch was completely gone .

                                                I didn&#39;t have any adverse affects until 5 days after I received the vaccination. Early in the afternoon on Wednesday 1/20 I noticed that my lymph nodes in the armpit of my left arm and on the left side of my neck were swollen and sore. This worsened as the day went on. I also noticed a pimple had formed and came to a head in the exact spot of where the needle stick had been. It &#34;popped&#34; that day and a small amount material came out. My lymph nodes have remained sore and swollen since 1/20. On the 7th day after (1/22) I noticed a couple of smaller, dime sized red blotches/rash on my left shoulder and left side of my neck. I also noticed that the injection site on my left shoulder was sore, swollen and hot to touch. On the 8th day (1/23) I noticed that there were more of these dime sized red blotches/rash across both shoulders, my back and a small area in the center of my chest.  It continues to be like that as of today (1/25). On the 9th day, (1/24) starting just after noon, I began to feel poorly. Achy and just generally not very good. I had a few bouts of diarrhea throughout the afternoon. I also had a pretty strong headache when I awoke on the morning of the 24th. Today, (1/25) I awoke again with a headache although it was not as sore as yesterday. I don&#39;t feel great today, but I do feel better than I did yesterday. The rash looks the same and my lymph nodes seem to be slightly less swollen and less sore.

In the course of trying to bring warmth to the body, I showered and ended up having severe vomiting. The body aches, fatigue, and overall sickness stayed with me for over 48 hours. Two days post vaccination, my left arm was swollen with severe redness. I am still struggling with fatigue and body aches (4 days later) but have regained mobility and strength.

The initial symptoms were only very painful muscle pain on the injected arm, and some mild body ache and mild chills for 2-3 days but nothing major. On Monday 2/15/21 was feeling very well and had nice workout in the morning , feeling energetic .  However, in the morning on Tuesday 2/16/21, I started having very strong abdominal cramps, feeling bloated, nausea, that was lasting for several hours and increasing in pain . After 5 hours of pain, I asked my wife to take me to Hospital. There I was diagnosed with Appendicitis after a Cat Scan. My appendix was inflamed and I had to go thru surgery that same day .

Once I reached the parking lot I was belching ridiculously and started feeling like vomiting. Than my chest hurt.  Went back to the clinic and said I don&#39;t feel right.  They had me stand in line and wait to be re-admitted.  The nurse starting taking blood pressure and offered me water I could not swallow the tiniest amount.  My neck felt like I was being chocked. My fingers on my left arm started tingling and arm was getting slightly red and arm felt heavy. The nurse said my symptoms were happening internally.  The doctor had me remove my mask and looked at the back of my mouth. Than used a stethoscope on my chest and the back.  Asked  if I had asthma , said no. He Than requested epinephrine shot and a steroid. With in a few seconds I started feeling like I could breathe. He prescribed an epinephrine pen incase I had another episode. Two day later I had another visit online with doctor from about redness on left and right arm. Having another allergic reaction and possible site infection. Now I&#39;m taking 10 days antibiotics and allergy medicine.

                                                On 3/16/21, I noticed a rash which closely mirrors what is being described as &#34;COVID arm&#34; at the site of the injection.  This appeared after 72 hours of severe stomach pain and loose stool, combined with fatigue, dizziness, chills/hot spells and lack of appetite.  There has been no fever with any of these symptoms.  The other members of my family who live in my household (Spouse - who also has had one dose of the Moderna vaccine, and our children age 12 and 15) all experienced the same set of symptoms, except the rash at site of vaccine injection.  I thought we had all caught a stomach bug from each other, but now I wonder if my symptoms were related to the rash that I first noticed this morning.

                                                Body aches in left shoulder, overnight nausea.  These adverse reactions are not so concerning because I have heard how commonly these are experienced. What is most concerning is that I woke up at 3:30 AM feeling nauseous and made my way to the bathroom as a result. At some point, once entering the bathroom, I lost consciousness and when regaining consciousness saw that I had pulled the entire toilet off the floor, cracking the large reservoir and breaking the lid into several pieces. Water was spraying and leaking. Fortunately, I did not suffer a bruise or cut. I am, however, concerned whether I should expect to lose consciousness again.

                                                Other than typical sore arm at injection site, I began to experience massive body tremors and painful chills that started roughly 13 hours after second Moderna dose. The chills were so extreme that my abdomen tightened and caused pain that I could not relax along with jaw tightening and teeth chatter. Once in bed, I experienced severe sweating while trying to stop the chills, then massive chills when removing blankets and extreme all over body aches that caused me to toss and turn all night. I found myself fatigued and sleeping off and on until 5:30 pm (17 hours in bed) the next evening. Chills have since subsided, body aches remained- tiredness remained. Two Tylenol have mostly helped with the body aches, although they are definitely still present, even in my gut.

                                                I developed a rash (red splotchy marks on my skin) that started localized under my arms in the arm pit region. I noticed it during my daily shower on 4/9. It was very itchy and then overnight it seemed to spread to other parts of my body including my back, back of my legs behind my knee, upper groin area, down to the tops of my feet and even the palms of my hand were very itchy as well as between my fingers. Basically only my face/head/neck were NOT affected.   Over the next couple of days the rash continued to subside temporarily but then with itching, it would return.   Finally, I am not sure if it is related but I had heart burn like symptoms over night on 4/9 and again on 4/10. That could be a coincidence but I only suffer from heart burn about once every 3 months so it seems strange that I would have it on back to back nights.   This all occurred just over 2 weeks from my vaccination so I thought it might have another cause but I could not figure out another possible explanation for it. I also took pictures if that would be helpful to see.

                                                Soon after injection I developed soreness at injection site, and about an hour later it travelled down my arm and to my hand, with also arm stiffness.  On Monday, 4/12/2021 at 12:15am (about 6 hours after injection) I developed chills and body aches.  Throughout the night I also developed a headache, muscle aches, nausea and started sweating.  At 9am (4/12/2021) when I woke up, all the symptoms continued (chills, body aches, muscle aches, arm soreness and stiffness, headache, nausea) and also felt extreme tiredness.  My temperature at 9:15am was 100.4 degrees F.  I basically stayed in bed and slept most of the day.  I got up at 2:30pm to get something to eat and had a temperature of 101 degrees F.  After eating, which made me feel even more nauseous, I went back to bed and continued to sleep.  I woke up at 7:30pm to feed the cats.  I felt the same as I did at 2:30pm--listed above--and was up and about for 20 minutes.  I started to prepare a quick meal and fainted twice (around 8pm) within a minute from each other.  The first time I fell to my knees and the second time I felt onto my back.  I was unconscious for only a few seconds each time.  I went into bed after and placed an ice pack on my forehead.  I took my temperature after the ice pack at 8:15am and my temperature was 101.4 degrees F.   I ate soup around 8:45am and took Tylenol (1000mg) at 9:30am.  I went back to bed and slept all through the night.  This morning (4/13/2021--2 days after injection) I feel much better--only have some slight chills and arm soreness.  My temperature at 9:15am (4/13/21) was 95.7 degrees F.

Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient notified pharmacy staff that he felt dizzy and nauseous. The patient was given cold compresses for his neck and wrists. After a few minutes the patient said the dizziness went away but he still felt nauseous. He sat on the floor with his feet elevated for 10 minutes then said he felt better and wanted to go to the bathroom. Upon return from the bathroom he said he vomited a small amount and felt better. We had the patient wait another 10 minutes in the pharmacy area before the patient left to go home.

Day 2: All my muscles were in pain from head to toes.  Joint muscles in pain.   Headaches, stick neck.  102 Fever for the next 3 days Throughout the 2 weeks: Stomach pain, Rib cage pain, skin pain (burning like on fire), hives on chest, headaches, sleep issues, zero sex drive  Most of the symptoms cleared by the end of the 2 weeks. Stomach muscles and rib cage muscles for the next 6 weeks were tender.  Sex drive was also zero.  I had no interest in partaking in physical activities such as playing VR games for exercise as my torso was sore.  Finally now, it seems all my symptoms are better.  My sex drive is pretty low, but no longer zero.  I hope that improves.

                                                Within three to four hours of receiving the Moderna vaccine my stomach started to become uneasy. I thought it might have been what I ate for lunch after the shot but I started to have diarrhea and vomiting. While I was in the bathroom experiencing both I passed out and hit my head on the floor. My wife called 911 and was checked by the responding paramedics; my vitals were good and I did not feel the need to be transported to the hospital. Throughout the night I had chills and continued to throw up and experience diarrhea.

This happens few time while I was sleeping , it woke me from sleep. I used to get out the bed as I soon as eyes open but not anymore. Now when I wake up in the I spend few minutes inn the bed because if I put my feet on the floor quickly I feel like I am going to fall.  I am afraid to pickup my 2 year old daughter anymore I feel like I can drop her if I get dizzy.

Then when I woke up approximately 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt severe sinus pressure, headache, light sensitivity, body aches, slight nausea, continued fever cycling, and lethargy. These symptoms began to resolve 24 hours after they started. These were the exact same symptoms that I experienced when I had Covid-19.

                                                At 2:00 am the following morning after my 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine I started experiencing a severe headache and body pains.  My left arm was sore and difficult to lift which is the arm I received the shot in.  Throughout the day I have continued to have a headache, body pains and developed a fever up to 101.00.  I have also felt nauseous at times and at one point threw up some of the Gatorade that I had a little while earlier.  So to summarize, all in all, I feel absolutely terrible.

I also had a metallic taste.   3.  Fortunately, the chills, body aches, and fatigue went away the second day.  However, I continued to have the metallic taste for days. 4.  Also, starting the third day and I still have a cough and tightness in my lungs.  I went into a doctor at urgent care four days after the second dose (due to a concern about the cough and tightness in my lungs).  All of my vitals were normal and they attributed to side effects from the vaccine.  Also, they gave me an inhaler. 5.  The inhaler has been somewhat helpful, but I had a consistent cough as well as  some tightness in my lungs for two weeks after the second dose.  On unusually stressful days, it was even worse. 6.   The cough has improved, but I still have it occasionally throughout the day as well as the tightness in my lungs.   7.  Finally, I continue to have the metallic taste.

                                                On 4/10/21 around 2:30 pm I gave the patient his first Moderna COVID vaccine and had him sit in the observation area for the standard 15 minutes. Around 2:35 he and his family notified me that he was feeling lightheaded/faint and nauseous; he also appeared pale and diaphoretic. It seemed to be a vasovagal reaction until he said he was starting to have trouble breathing so I called 911 and got the Epipen/emergency kit ready, and monitored vitals. Then his breathing trouble resolved without needing to administer medication. EMS arrived at 2:39 pm and confirmed his HR/BP/O2 sat were normal. EMS cleared the patient to go home with his family. The patient had never had a vaccine reaction or vasovagal reaction before.

                                                He got his vaccine, got something to drink and had the weirdest feeling and was not able to remember his pin # for his card, but then collected himself.   He went to bed and at 4:00 AM he started throwing up profusely and was intense and periodic until it lasted until 8:00 AM (4 hours).   He has stomach problems, but not to the extent of this.  He has been trying to control his other problems with Alka Seltzer which normally helps with his regular stomach issues, but did take 3 of them during that 4 hour period which seemed to calm his stomach down, but normally one takes 1.   His stomach is feeling better right now other than having loss of appetite, eating small bites and minimal.   Feels he may have fever right now but not feeling well enough to get up, sweaty and clammy on the back of his neck right now.  Feeling weak due to the 4 hours of vomiting.  He has not called his doctor.

                                                I have not been sick all year.  About 12 hours after the shot, I had a fever, extreme pain and moderate swelling in left arm.  Nausea.  24 hours after vomited.  Extreme fatigue, slept 13 hours straight. 48 hours still fever and fatigue but improving. 72 hours, fever and nausea gone, but still fatigued.    96 hours later felt completely fine. .....   But here is where I find it very strange.  At 120 hours after, my 10 year old daughter develops the exact same systems.   She DID NOT receive any vaccination.  She develop a fever and vomitted approimately according to the same time frame I did.   I find this extremely strange considering we have been very viligant about wearing masks outside our home.    We asked around and we do not know of anyone who has had the flu nor come in contact with someone who had the flu.  I find it extremely bizarre that my whole family has not been sick all year and then 12 hours after I get the vaccine, I get sick and throw up and 4 days later my daughter also gets sick and throws up.    From what I understand, this might just be a bad coincidence, but I felt I needed to report it.  Thank you.

                                                The day after the shot I had a bad headache fever of 102 and body aches.  That seemed to subside the next day except for a mild headache.  The following day, or the 3rd day after the shot, I had several bouts of what I will call extreme heartburn.  Severe burning sensation across chest after eating and tingling down both arms.

                                                EXTREME chills and fever.  Alternated 4 or 5 cycles.  Woke up with having thrown off my blankets and had to get ice packs and open windows to cool down enough to sleep, a few hours later woke up SHIVERING like I never have before.  I thought I was convulsing until I realized I could control it with my breathing. I was shivering so hard that I bit my tongue several times.  I didn&#39;t have much energy so it took several minutes before I could grab blankets and even longer before I could close the window.  I was wrapped in several layers of blankets and was still shivering until I fell asleep.  I woke up again and my blankets were soaked in my sweat.  This cycle got more and more intense until the next day.  *I&#39;ve been hospitalized with pneumonia and this felt 100 times worse. The next day, I had the worst diarrheic that I&#39;ve ever had, sudden urge.. barely made it to toilet and INSTANTLY discharged what felt like a gallon of brown liquid (it was probably less but felt pretty nasty).

                                                Heart palpitations, pounding heart that feels irregular, at times. Felt nausea a couple of morning along with heart symptoms and a sensation of difficulty breathing. However, I am able to take a deep breath when feeling this way and am able to work out with no difficulty. The symptoms continue intermittently, but do not happen constantly. A Kardia Mobile device purchased and I was unable to detect irregular heart rhythms with it. I considered going to the doctor and possibly the emergency room to get it checked out, but decided against as the symptoms would stop. They still continue off and on to this day.

                                                The day after the shot I began having severe abdominal pain, muscle and nerve pain, and shortness of breath. The abdominal, muscle, and nerve pain began at around 10:00am. The shortness of breath began around 2:00-3:00 in the afternoon and lasted for 30-45 mins (longer than the 20mins listed in the attending ER physician&#39;s report), at which point my wife called for an ambulance and I was taken to the emergency room of Hospital. I was prescribed diphenhydrAMINE injection 25 mg, droperidoL injection 1.25 mg, ketorolac injection 15 mg, and another pain killer by the paramedics that I do not see listed in the record.   Although not to the same degree, I have continued to have gastrointestinal cramping since the second vaccination. This is a worsening of a condition (IBS) that I had previously, but which had mostly been in remission since beginning Mirtazapine in Fall 2019 subsequent to a heart attack on 8/7/19. I am meeting with my primary physician, Droctor, on 5/10/21 and contacted, my gastroenterologist, on 5/5/21.

I had him lay down with feet up bp 89/41/54 at 1:25pm , a few minutes later he said his visiion had improved and took some water. at 1:30 bp was 97/61 60  some improvement but felt worse a few min later 1:34 bp 94/59 60 and at 1:44 bp 97/69 57 he felt well enough to stand, walk around  at 1:49 he left with his freinds but confided to the translater that he was still nausated. (he had not eaten lunch yet) I avdvised that if he still felt bad that he should consider seeing a doctor. He and his friends then purchased some crackers and tylenol before leaving  the store.

I woke up the next day with chills, body aches and pain, chest pains, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, arm soreness and swelling, fatigue, nausea and I could not get out of bed.  I called the hospital and left a message.  The doctor called me back and advised me to go to the ER.  By the time the doctor called me back, my chest pains and heart palpitations had resolved.  The other symptoms still persisted- extreme fatigue and headache which lasted another 4 days.  I started to feel better and it took about 6  days  for all symptoms to resolve.  I did not go to the ER since the cardiac symptoms  have resolved. I am still having SOB.

                                                My blood pressure went up to 170/106 and my heart was beating over 100 about 45 minutes or one hour after I was vaccinated, and I also felt nausea. Nurse called 911, and I was transported to emergency. About 1.5 hour later, my heart was even beating more quickly, and I could hardly talked and difficult to breathe. This happened when I walked to the restroom by myself and came back. After they did some medical tests, gave me medication for allergy (the doctor gave me this since he was not sure if it was my allergy reaction to the vaccines), injected 2 IV bags and rest for few hours, my blood pressure went down to about 140/9x and heart beat back to normal. I was released from ER on the next day at 4:00am.

These feelings lasted until 10pm on 1/16/21, and then I went to bed and felt better in the morning.  I was barely able to get out of bed that day (1/16) because of how sick I felt.  Besides the sick feeling,  I had bad pain at the injection site, and had a 3cm x 3cm raised red lump at the injection site.  This stayed painful for 48-60 hours, then the swelling subsided and was left with a bruise.

Tylenol and Benadryl took care of it fairly well.  Had arm pain at site of injection, like I was hit in arm with a baseball bat.  Had some gerd too but not sure if related. Tiredness started around 9 hours after the shot, but symptoms really kicked in about 12 hours after administration.  Lasted till about 46 hours after administration, at which time I woke up from overnight sleep feeling great.  Arm still sore and there might be some lingering joint pain but nothing to keep me from doing anything.

                                                The day after the injection I had a sore arm, slight headache and slight nausea. Since that time I have had a slight &#34;pressure&#34; headache almost continuously.  Today is 2/24/21, more than 6 weeks after the first shot and the symptoms have only slightly subsided. I have decided to forego the second shot until the symptoms completely disappear. I have not sought any medical care because the symptoms are not severe enough and I am hoping they will subside by themselves. If they continue for a long period I will seek medical care but my guess is there will not be a lot that can be done.

I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

The were also muscle aches. The symptoms were severe enough to leave me stuck in bed. The symptoms persisted for 4 days and on the night of the 4th day I suddenly developed a persistent pain in my lower back. In the morning I went to the emergency room where I tested negative for Covid and a cat scan revealed that my body going through the side effects of the vaccine knocked a centimeter sized kidney stone loose. I was prescribed anti inflammatories and anti nausea meds and told to follow up with a urologist.

                                                Patient was coherent during initial injection, as I removed my gloves and asked he remain in the waiting area for 15 minutes his chin fell to his chest and he began to breath heavily. I spoke to him and there was no response. He then began making snoring type noises and lifted his head but again was unresponsive. Patient then slumped sideways in the chair. I made one last attempt to arouse him with firm strikes to the chest and calling his name. I retrieved the EpiPen from the e-kit and as I removed it from the box he became conscious. He opened his eyes and gasped and tremored slightly. He was not immediately responsive verbally. I observed him carefully to evaluate if he was going to have a seizure, but he then became coherent. He was alert and oriented to time and place but did ask how ling it had been since the vaccine. He admitted to having a problem with needles and stated that was the root of the reaction. He does not remember any reactions to previous vaccines but also could not recall his last vaccination. We brought the patient water and offered snacks while he recovered in the patient care area. Approximately 20-30 minutes after the initial event the patient began vomiting. After a few minutes of vomiting he said he felt a little better and wanted to go to his car to lay down. Multiple times we asked if we could call someone to come pick him up and offered to have him seen by paramedics that happened to be shopping in store. He declined both offers and stated he would lie down in his car and call someone if he did not feel well after awhile. Staff checked on him in his car and he was instructed to call in before leaving. Upon trying to check on him again it was noted his car was gone. I called the patient and he assured me he was ok and he was now at home.

I noticed it at first when I woke up and then it got worse after an hour.  I went back to bed and slept for 5 straight hours.  I was starting to feel better around 9 pm that night.  I had light symptoms the next morning.  Not bad though.  Just nausea and little exhaustion. The next day I felt great like nothing had happened.

He vomited once and has been nauseous since. He feels very dizzy. He was walking down hallway, and he &#34;blacked out&#34; and fell down the stairs. He said he did not hit his head, but the right side of body hurts, as well as chest, after the fall. He said this pain is causing some difficulty breathing. He said his dad witnessed the fall. When asked if the pain is severe, he said &#34;yes&#34;. He was told that if he&#39;s experiencing &#34;severe&#34; pain after a fall, accompanied with difficulty breathing, he should seek medical attention. He was told he can contact his Dr. for a second opinion first, if desired. Otherwise, it was suggested he check his BP, if possible, sit with head between knees or lay down with feet propped up and NOT walk around if feeling dizzy. He was advised to stay hydrated and introduce bland foods first to see if he can tolerate solid food. He was told he can take whatever oral pain reliever he normally takes that he&#39;s allowed to take if needed. Patient will report back to me.

We had staff sit next to him in the waiting area after his vaccination.  About 1&amp;1/2 min post vaccination he started feeling light headed and sick to his stomach.  He let our staff know and I immediately went to check on him.  He was sitting on floor, then decided to lay down because he was feeling sicker.  I took his BP and it was 100/60.  He said the top number normally runs around 160.  His skin was cool and he was sweating all over.  We called 911 to evaluate the pt.  While we were waiting we put his feet up on a pillow and got him some water.  After about 5 min he decided he wanted to try and sit when his color started coming back.  We got him to a sitting position and the medics finally arrived.  As they were checking him he felt bad again and laid on their cot.  Their evaluation was that his numbers were all fine.  He was feeling better and they got him to a standing position and he was able to walk out of the store.

I&#39;ll then feel as if I&#39;m going to throw it back up, this is every meal this occurs. At times for the past month I&#39;ve woken up around 1 to 4 am immediately throwing up, even if stomach is empty. Also a very severe case of uric acid buildup and painful GOUT in my entire left ankle joint that&#39;s had me bedridden for the last 3 weeks that started a week after my vaccination. I notice I&#39;ve also been extremely agitated, irritable, restless and not sleeping well.

                                                I had the vaccine on Saturday and Monday early morning something woke me up, I was sweating and my heart was pounding like crazy. I thought it was the side effects of the vaccine. It took 3-4 hours to stop. After 2 weeks at 4AM something woke me up again and I was sweating for no reason. The same symptoms I had after getting the vaccine. On 06/18/2021 again 4AM something woke me up and I had the same sweating and I was throwing up. I thought it was the vaccine so I did not go to the hospital. I did not think this was a heart attack since I am young, healthy, non-smoker, non-drinker. Again, something woke me up. I went upstairs with my neighbor and she took me to urgent care because she thought it was COVID and I thought it was just the vaccine and they said to call ambulance immediately because I was having a heart attack. They took me to the hospital, and they started the procedure. They said it was impossible to open here. By helicopter they took me to another hospital. I was on the doctor on Friday and they told me I still have a blood clot and they try to open but they were not able to open so they left it like clotted. Now they told me they need to do the bypass surgery. No heart attack history in my family. I am not having that surgery because doctors do not care here. I am going to another country to have surgery since they do care over there and it is less expensive. They prescribed a lot of medications for my heart.

I was still a little sore in lower back the day after the shot and was tired by the end of my work day.  3rd day back to normal.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

                                                Began to feel tired, headache and achy at noon on Thursday- over 24 hours from vaccination.  Achiness, chills, muscle pain, fatigue, headache persisted Thursday afternoon and evening.  On Friday morning, began violently throwing up and continue to throw up everything attempted to eat or drink for 24 hours.  Threw up approximately 15 times.  Could not hold food down until Saturday.  All-day Saturday suffered chills, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and began to hold food and drink down. At 12 noon on Saturday began to have excruciating joint pain that progressed in right hip to the point where I was unable to walk Saturday evening.  Took one 200 mg motrin and was able to sleep Saturday night. Woke up feeling much better on Sunday morning. Still experiencing mild fatigue and moderate joint pain in right hip.

Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

                                                About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to develop a fever.  I understand that fever, muscle aches and head aches are possible side effects of vaccinations in general and this one in particular.  Since I had tested positive for antibodies for the third time just two weeks prior to receiving this first dose of Moderna I was anticipating some reactions similar to what I have heard people experiencing for their second shot.  What followed the initial onset of fever was the worst flu symptoms I have ever experienced in my 48 years.  Fever continued to increase reaching 103 if not higher at times and staying elevated at level for over 6 hours.  Chills to the point of convulsions.  Nausea and one time vomiting.  Fever dreams (mild hallucinations), profuse sweating, intense head aches.  Muscle aches I could barely tolerate that I felt over every inch of my body.  This continued until 10am the following morning when I took some advil and finally fell asleep to the point of being virtually unwakeable until 2:30pm.  Upon waking I was able to sit up and drink water but the muscle soreness and slight fever continued throughout the day (101 fever).   I was able to eat some toast that evening.  That night the fever returned but not as high as the previous night.  The sweating was still profuse throughout the night and the muscle aches continued  but to a lessor degree.  The following day the fever subsided though muscle soreness continued.  That evening I was able to sleep regularly and now today (three full days after vaccination) I am roughly back to myself.  I understand that reading this seems as if these symptoms fall in line with what is expected and understand to be the side effects of the vaccine.  I am here today to tell you that I thought I was dying.  I have never, ever felt so terrible ever.  It was ten times worse than having covid.  I cannot imagine  anyone who is not healthy and string making through that and I can not believe I am expected to do it again to complete my vaccination.

The symptoms persisted for 30 minutes so the pharmacist called an ambulance to the store.  The paramedics checked my vital signs which were stable but recommended that I go to the nearest hospital for further examination and treatment.

                                                He got the vaccine, started to get the headache within 45 minutes, ran some errands and after a couple of hours he felt like something was burning on his buttock, and noticed a really bad red rash on the left side on the left cheek from the crack outward. It was extremely hot to the touch and very sore, kind of throbbing and swollen and progressively got worse. He was just not feeling well, nauseous and dizzy and went to sleep but when he woke up it had spread to the other cheek. It looks like he got burned or scalded red/purple in color. He has no reaction on the arm itself, but only on the buttock and a blistery, blood red, leathery feeling rash/blotch on his entire buttock to both hips on both sides. It is difficult for him to sit. He also had headache, the muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea.  He did not vomit but had not eaten anything. He has had a high fever up to 103 until this morning 4/8/21 which is about 99-100.  He woke up soaking wet today. He has not been able to turn his neck, and not able to lift his arm above his waist level since the vaccine, and not able to turn his neck to the left at all. He can turn it 5-10 degrees, but right is okay. He took some Benadryl over the last 2 days for the reaction but it has not. He also has taken aspirin/Aleve for the fever. He was so sock and had no energy and could not sleep but could not keep his eyes open either, was not able to open them. He did write his doctor when the rash was only on one side, which they did not give him any advice as he was not feeling any worse at that time. He was at 101 fever throughout the day and then at night went to 102. He was hoping that the rash would be better, but actually worse as described above. He has not had any appetite, trying to drink fluids but made him nauseous, and he normally drinks water all day long. His normal temp is 97.7. He has been taking showers to try and keep his fevers down and the water hitting the rash feels like somebody is pouring scolding water on it. He did call Moderna on 4/6/21 asking if this was a reaction that anybody has reported, and he is waiting for somebody to call him back.

Exceeded six hours without ibuprofen and fever returned 27 hours post injection. Took 400 mg ibuprofen and immediately became nauseous. Began walking up stairs and lost consciousness and seized/convulsed briefly (witnessed by my wife). Upon regaining consciousness, I was immediately aware of what happened, date, time, etc., so we did not seek medical attention. Continued ibuprofen every 4-6 hours. On two occasions post loss of consciousness, the first within an hour and the second four hours later, I felt tingly and smelled a strong scent of acetone or ammonia. Both passed quickly. Fever broke soon after second incidence. All symptoms were gone within 48 hours of injection.

Symptoms were: hot/cold flashes, sweating through clothes, loss of appetite, headache and fatigue. On 5/3, I went to the local urgent care and got a rapid COVID test, which came back negative. My symptoms have slowly started to get better, except for the extreme fatigue I constantly feel. I have very little energy and continue to experience it to this day 5/14/21. My second vaccine is schedule for 5/18/21. I sent a request to my primary care physician to see if I should have some bloodwork done.

                                                PATIENT WAS NOT NERVOUS ABOUT RECEIVING HIS FIRST DOSE. OUR IMMUNIZATION CERTIFIED PHARMACY TECH ADMINISTERED THE DOSE. ABOUT 2 MINUTES LATER HE STATED HE WAS FEELING TINGLY AND HIS EAR TURNED A WHITE COLOR. THE TECHNICIAN CALLED ME INTO THE ROOM WHERE I EXAMINED THE PATIENT. HE WAS NOT RESPONDING AND HIS EYES WERE DILATED. HE WAS TRYING TO BREATH BUT HE WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY. WE MOVED HIM TO THE GROUND AND PLACED HIM ON HIS SIDE TO MAKE SURE HE DID NOT ASPERATE. AFTER ABOUT 20 SECONDS OF BEING ON THE GROUD HE STARTED BREATHING NORMALLY AND WAS CONSCIOUS. THE ENTIRE EPISODE LASTED ABOUT 1 MINUTE (MAYBE SLIGHLY LONGER). EMS ARRIVED A FEW MINUTES LATER. HIS PULSE WAS LOW (ABOUT 50 BPM PER EMS) BUT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WAS NORMAL (UNSURE OF THE VALUE). HE SAID HE REMEMBERED TALKING TO US AND THE NEXT THING HE KNEW HE WAS LAYING ON THE GROUND. HE WAS VERY NAUSEOUS AFTERWARDS FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES (HE THREW UP TWICE). WE CONTACTED THE PATIENT THE DAY AFTER AND HE SAID HE WAS FINE AND THAT HE ONLY HAD A SORE ARM. WE BELIEVE THAT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPED TOO LOW AND CAUSED A VASOVAGAL TYPE RESPONSE.

The right hand still has constant pain in knuckles/joints especially in the center of the hand.  The pain has lessened over the weeks, but has remained the same for that last 10-14 days.

                                                About 3 days after the 2nd dose vaccine,  my whole right side including my back  lost muscle function and was in pain and I collapsed to the floor.  I was in a lot of pain.  I thought I was having kidney stones. I went to the doctor and did a CT scan and gave me a shot in my back for pain.  The CT scan did not show any kidney stones or liver issues.  I went back to the doctor and he diagnosed me with muscle inflammation.  I am a healthy person and the pain came out of nowhere. The pain is in the lower right hip side.   My whole right side is in pain and the left side of my body is fine and not in pain.  I had the 2nd vaccine in my right arm and whole right side of the body is affected.  On a scale, my pain is an 8/10.  I did get a prescription for the pain meds  but the it&#39;s not really helping that much.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was in observation area for around 10 minutes when an associate noticed he needed assistance. I went over to the patient and asked him to tell me what his symptoms were. He was nauseated and seemed to be a little confused. His head fell back onto the chair and started making small jerking movements. I asked the associate to brace him while I called for the store manager and directed someone to call EMS. His legs went straight out in front of him and he began to make jerking movements as if he was having a seizure. We got him moved to the floor while we waited on EMS and he seemed to snap out of the episode. He was still very confused, but was answering questions. He was very warm to the touch at first, but then broke out in a cold sweat. EMS arrived and monitored him until his wife arrived. The patient decided to let his wife take him home. The pharmacy followed up with him after a few hours and he said he felt okay and was going to PCP the following day. Patient later came into the store and we talked with him about the episode, he was normal at this point.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the shot, I began to feel flu-like symptoms beginning with intestinal discomfort and incontinence. Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

                                                Upon waking up felt cold sweat, nauseated and became dizzy. Within 5 min from leaving the bed I lost consciousness for 2-3minutes. Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

Symptoms began approximately 24 hours after receiving the second vaccine, and gradually subsided over the following 24 hours, with only moderate diarrhea, heart palpitations, and fatigue remaining. It was by far the worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to a vaccine The only side effects after the first vaccine were moderate fatigue the evening of the vaccine and moderate arm pain.

                                                After about 45 minutes from the initial injection he completely blacked out while driving us home on the freeway. I had to grab the wheel to keep from running off the road or into a semi truck. He said she had tingling in the shoulder and felt nauseous. He blacked out before we could switch drivers. Terrifying

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

We sat patient down to monitor and took BP and pulse rate (120/59 and 60). After a few minutes, patient stated he was nauseated and still feeling dizzy. We continued to observe patient and after a few more minutes he stated he was starting to have intermittent chest pain. We then contacted 911 to request assistance. While waiting for EMS to arrive, patient stated the chest pain was becoming more constant. At this time we also observed patient was very pale, sweaty, and his skin was cold to the touch. EMS arrived quickly and took over patient care, stablilizing him and then transporting him to the hospital. We have not received an update on his condition at this time.

Around 5PM I started to get light headed and then around 6:30 PM I started to get the chills really bad.  I took Dual Action Advil with Acetaminophen, 500 mg &amp; 250 mg respectively, at 7:00 PM.  The chills went away around 9:30-10:00 PM.  I woke up feeling ok but rested for the morning.  At 12:30 PM I went and hooked up my camper and moved it to a different location and that is when the symptoms started again.  Specifically being light headed, loss of all energy along with an upset stomach  and slight headache.

After receiving the immunization the patient  went to the waiting area to be observed. Approximately 5-10 minutes later he slid off the chair and hit  the back of his head. The observer alerted the staff and 911 was called. He appeared to have fainted and was unconscious for a few seconds. He opened his eyes and appeared to shake a little and sat up and began vomiting while 911 was on the phone. Paramedics arrived and tended to the patient and he refused further treatment.

                                                Sunday morning, around 12:10am, I started getting chills/trembling/body shakes and my muscles all over my body ached. I was so miserable all morning I couldn&#39;t hardly sleep and later that morning, I could hardly stand for more than 5 minutes. That lasted all of Sunday and I maintained a mild headache. I drank a lot of water all day and ate very little.  I thought it would pass by the next morning. At 2:30am Monday morning a 2nd wave hit me, I had more trembling/ body shakes, this time it lasted for a little over an hour. I woke up again and again through the night and in the morning I had a terrible headache and nausea and vomited to the point of dry heaving. I slowly drank water with electrolytes.  At around 6pm Monday, I am finally starting feel normal again and made a meal of eggs and bacon with toast and felt fine afterward. I have had no other symptoms since that day.

                                                Intense vertigo, similar to what I experienced during my previous vestibular neuronitis events.  It&#39;s effectively inflammation pinching the vestibular nerve, which can only be helped by reducing the inflammation with steroids.  Treatment was prednisone for inflammation, zofran for nausea, meclizine for the vertigo symptoms, and zyrtec for reducing fluid build-up due to allergies.   Extreme symptoms lasted 4 days of absolutely no movement or even open eyes, then 2 weeks of limited ability to move, now able to function, but still feel slightly dizzy.  My doctors believe the vaccination contributed with general inflammation, which, combined with the allergies, triggered the event.

                                                When I woke up this morning I could feel my throat was swollen and I had slight difficulty ingesting saliva. But I was able to drink water without too much problem. After a while when I was brushing my teeth I realized I could not gargle. I did not pay much attention. When I tried to eat breakfast I realized that I was not able to ingest any solid food at all. Then I realized my voice had become very hoarse. When I told my wife about it (she is a pediatrician) she looked into my mouth to check uvula but could not see it. She pointed out it could be an allergic reaction but was not sure of the reason. I took liquid Benadryl which we had at home and she also gave me a table of famotidine. I also had prednisone but did not take that as as I did not want anything to hurt vaccine&#39;s immunity effect. However, out of caution we drove to an ER and waited in its parking lot for an hour. Slowly I noticed that my swelling had reduced and I was able to see a little bit of uvula. So we decided to come back home. I am feeling much better now though not fully normal.

Then about 20 minutes after receiving vaccine he started to feel hot, nauseated, and DIZZY.  Checked BP 180/106, P-85, O2 99%. Patient is currently staying in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, and called their driver to transport him to the nearest emergency room.  Patient did not want to go by ambulance or have them called.  Patient was not in any distress or having breathing difficulty.  We called the facility he is staying at this morning and they stated &#34;he&#39;s fine today,&#34; and he is up doing all of his daily routine this morning.  No further information was given on condition or what treatment or tests were conducted at the emergency room.  We are under the assumption the patient actually went to the ER, but cannot confirm at this time.

                                                4 days after receiving Vaccination #2, I suffered from appendicitis.  The appendicitis caused a massive abscess that eventually created a bowel obstruction and and hospitalization.  The appendix was eventually removed as a result.  Based on the reports from the mRNA vaccinations, I read there was an increase in cases of  appendicitis in the test groups so i believe this is relevant.

It&#39;s a constant, persistent humming like a fan or refrigerator sound. It&#39;s quieter in the morning and gets louder throughout the day. It can make me dizzy and queasy while driving a car. Sometimes this sensation occurs even while walking around my house.

I ended up with excruciating pain that landed me in the hospital for two weeks for extreme nerve pain to the point I can?t walk, sit or stand for long periods of time. I was given heavy doses of steroids, pain meds, IV fluids and met with a neurologist did multiple MRI?s and I?m left with severe muscle spasms and tremors the Drs can?t seem to understand why They said this is not related to back issues however they did a steroid back injection hoping it would help with inflammation and I was sent home after two weeks in the hospital. I?m at home and dear if my life doesn?t turn around I will lose everything.  I was a athlete with no prior previous existing health issues and now I can?t even leave my house without serious tremors and muscle spasms I?m on medication for seizures, muscle spasms pain meds and have a jacuzz I can?t even raise my leg to get into This ALL HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER I GOT THE VACCINE!!!! 1st dose I did have a bad case of COVID in December for the record.

                                                The morning after I received the vaccine, I woke up and I had flu like symptoms. I had a low grade fever, some nausea, ringing in my ears and fatigue. By bedtime that night, I felt normal except for the tinnitus that stayed. I went to the doctor on 03/26, an audiologist, and she told me that it is tinnitus and she had another patient that got tinnitus after the vaccine also. I am having a lot of trouble hearing now. The doctor told me that the ringing that I hear is a short circuit in my brain. It&#39;s not so much in my ear, but from the processing of the brain. This is a habituation, which means I am listening to sounds through an app or web link to teach my brain how to ignore that sound. There is not any treatment for this condition. I will follow up with the doctor in a year.

The pharmacy manager tried to talk to the patient, but he appeared to be having a seizure (his eyes were rolled up in his head, he was shaking). When the patient came to he seemed confused about where he was. He began sweating profusely. He said he was nauseated and lightheaded.  He said he was tingling all over his body. We also noticed that he was bleeding where he hit his head on the ground when he passed out. He stayed seated while the pharmacy manager held a paper towel to the bleeding part on his head. He sipped some water until the EMS arrived and took over. The patient left to go to the ER with the EMS crew after 3:00PM.

The fever broke after about 5 hours with 800mg of ibuprofen and 1000mg of acetaminophen. The nausea subsided somewhat with 8mg of Zofran sublingual. The headache resolved about 01:00am on 01/10/2021. The dizziness and fatigue resolved significantly by 04:00am on 01/10/2021. Mild fatigue continued for another 24 or so hours, but seemed mostly resolved by 01/11/2021 and may have been exacerbated by my overnight (7p-7a) shifts.

I was just itching all over.  About 11 days later is when I came down with something else. I was having body aches and diarrhea. I was seen in the ED. By Monday late evening I was starting to feel back to normal.

Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

                                                I took the vaccine on Thursday and i slept good, like normal. when I got up Friday morning I had chills all day. I checked my temperature and it was 101 and went up to 104. I took Tylenol every 4 hours but it would not come down, I took cold shower and it didn&#39;t come down Friday and Friday night all night. It would get down to 102 or 101 but it would come right back. Saturday all day fever, nausea, and headache.  No matter the medicine I took or when I took a cold shower it would not come down.  Everything continued until Sunday all day until Sunday night, I still took medicine but i couldn&#39;t control the fever. I did not want to go to hospital. Early morning hours of Sunday I started to perspire and the fever started to come down to 101 then 99.something.

Was monitored for another 30 minutes and my wife picked me up. Took tylenol when I got home. Checked blood sugar at home and blood sugar was down to 40. I hadn&#39;t eaten before the vaccine. I ate oatmeal and went to bed. After 2 hours, I no longer had symptoms. Returned to work 1/29/2021 without any further issues.

                                                Patient had moderna covid vaccine last week. Initially he had normal post vaccine effects - soreness in the upper arm, fatigue. Over the weekend those symptoms were practically gone. Then he developed severe pain in the arm at the site of the injection followed by nausea and sweats. He is soaking thru his clothes. Not eating much. No fever, cough, sob. Just feels bad.

I had a loss of appetite, nausea, and no energy.  My fever lasted for approximately 30 hours before subsiding.  I alternated Tylenol and Alieve during my time with fever.  On Sunday, February 7, I began having mouth sores and fever blister on my lips.  For this, I used Lysine, both tablet and lip ointment.

                                                Had vaccine and had a red spot and sore arm which went away after a couple days. Four days after the vaccine a blood vessel in my hand burst (I don&#39;t recall hitting it on anything at all). It puffed up about a centimeter and slowly went away over a few days. Then a little more than a week later the red spot came back and itched very badly and was sore again. It also faded after several days. then yesterday morning I woke up and my arm was sore at the injection site again only I started having the worst headache of my life that lasted 30 hours. I started shaking, sweating massively, I felt hot and cold at the same time, felt as if I had a very high fever but my temperature was 98.4 (totally normal). I was vomiting if I tried to eat or drink. I had severe body aches and EXTREME weakness throughout my body. My heart began to race at 150-160 bpm for several hours and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It has gotten about 50%  better in the past few hours and will hopefully continue that way. I&#39;ve never felt anything like it in my life. I need to know if it is safe for me to get the second shot.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

The patient took paracetamol and naproxen for the events, which somewhat helped.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events, fever, chills, abdominal pain, anorexia/lack of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue/frequently had to lay in bed, were considered resolved on an unknown date. The outcome for the event, cellulitis on his left shin and foot, was reported as not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. Cellulitis of shin and foot is unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                Started with tightness of chest, (under the lower part of ribcage); sporadic hot flashes and dizziness; pulse going up to 95,( when normal is in the 60&#39;s).  Then sat down an hour later and almost immediately a deep tiredness.  got off work early, went home and had no other problems until I attempted to go to sleep.  Somewhere around nine o&#39;clock, I started getting muscle cramps so I went to the couch.  Shortly after, my right arm, (vaccinated arm) became extremely sore; shortly after, my total body ached; no relief from lying on my left, right, stomach or back; hurt to even sit upright.  Then, I started getting cold chills; which alternated with hot flashes and periods of nausea.  My mouth went extremely dry, so when I struggled to go use the bathroom, I would wobble my way to the kitchen and want to take a big drink of water, attempted to swallow two tylenol, gagged and started throwing up.  Went back to bed and started getting continuous headaches that would move to different places.  This happened the rest of the night and most of Thursday when most of the worst symptoms happened.  Was able to sleep Thursday  night and thought I was feeling better, until I stood up.  Today, I was not able to stand longer than one half an hour at any one point; had to lie down and rest while doing any kind of activity.  I haven&#39;t been able to keep anything down; either vomiting or diarrhea. Have been slowly feeling better with occasional headache.

                                                7pm on date of injection I got very sleepy and fell asleep.  I woke up at 12:45am sweating but chilled to the bone.  I felt feverish but was too cold to get out of bed.  When I actually got out of bed I had a very intense headache, and body aches.  I took my temp and it registered 104.  at 8am I took my dogs out but felt very old, chilled to the bone &amp;  lightheaded.  It was chilly outside.  I got back inside and got back into bed as fast as I could. The second I laid down, the sweat just poured out of my body, drenching my shirt, sheets, and blanket.  The fever lasted all day but was slowly improving throughout the day.  My arm was also incredibly sore at the injection site.  It was very sore for shot one too but the pain lasted nearly 2 weeks the first time and is already just about gone now.  Yesterday, or 2 days after dose 2 injection, the fever was gone.  I still had a headache, and body aches but also developed nausea.  I did not vomit but I did have diarrhea.  I also noticed extreme shortness of breath over very minor exertion.  I?m not sure if this was due to extreme dehydration , due to loss of fluids or if it?s associated with the vaccine.  My lungs feel clear and I deny ever suffering from a bronchial spasms..  Day 3 I?m feeling more myself but am still suffering from gastric upset.  Nausea has dissipated.

                                                Patient presented to the counsel window saying he was having trouble swallowing after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna). The patient stated he wanted me to call 911 so I called 911 and the technician called a &#34;code&#34; over the pager. I went with the patient back to the vaccine booth and got him to take a seat. The patient then stated that he had an allergy to cashews. I retrieved the emergency kit. I asked the patient if he wanted me to give him the epi pen and he said no. He asked if we would page his wife as well. I gave the patient some water while asking how he was breathing. He said it was just difficult to swallow. He said he didn&#39;t have any trouble breathing  but was noticeably shaking. Management came to check in and then went to wait for the ambulance to arrive. The patients wife also called 911 from his phone. While they were on the phone the EMTs showed up. They carried the patient out to the ambulance on the stretcher.

The burning sensation expanded to my left armpit area over the next few hours and extended to left side of chest. It felt like streaks of burn extending out of armpit area.  Approximately 12hrs after receiving the shot (3am) I became extremely nauseated. I alternated between throwing up and diarrhea for the next three hours. During this time i also experienced a fever, chills, sweats, uncontrollable shaking and elevated heart rate. Today (3/19) I am dehydrated, lightheaded and dizzy. fever and chills are gone as well as nausea but heart rate is still elevated.

Since last seen he initiated AIT in December 2020 and reports he had tolerated his AIT injections without large local or systemic reactions until yesterday, 16 Mar, when he received his first maintenance dose. Within minutes of receiving his dose he developed shortness of breath, dizziness/altered level of consciousness resulting in collapse, and was noted to be hypoxic. He was treated with IM epinephrine with initial improvement but subsequently again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness. He received his second dose of IM epinephrine and a dose of IM Benadryl with transient improvement, but again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness followed by nausea and vomiting. He was noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic despite these interventions so a third dose of IM epinephrine and IV fluids were administered. He was transferred by ambulance to ER where he was given IV solumedrol, monitored, and admitted to the ICU overnight for observation. He reports fever (Tmax 101 F) last night in the ICU. He endorses he took his Allegra prior to his AIT dose and did not exercise. Of note, on 15 Mar he received his second mRNA COVID19 vaccine.

Symptoms lasted 2 days; On 5th day, started feeling nauseous and 8pm started feeling acute abdominal pain with increased intensity.   8:30pm abdominal pain continued with pressure in back and chest.   Then wife took me to ER.   Exams (CT Scan, bloodwork and vitals) were taken but was all normal.   At 2am abdominal pain went away but discomfort in abdominal area continued.   I was released at that time.   On 7th day had follow up with primary care physician and they reviewed documentation from Hospital and determined that I experienced symptoms from covid vaccine.

                                                BACKGROUND NOTE: I had Covid mid-January ands ome of the lingering effects have been to my smell (still very diminished) and taste (greatly improved but still not 100 percent). .   Following Sat. 4/10 first vaccination, I had some of the normal side effects starting  overnight Saturday night (fatigue chills nausea) which continued through Sunday and Monday and have generally improved since then though still not 100%..    However I am having more smell and taste issues including an after taste issue which I have not had before. The smell taste and after taste are not ones I have seen cited as a typical side effect so that is the main reason for my question regarding whether this is normal and should quickly subside or if it is not normal so it is documented and if it affects timing or if I have the second dose. Hope that makes sense.

Typically I&#39;m only triggered by taking NSAIDs or consuming the grains that are associated with Celaic Disease. The symptoms I experienced were diarrhea accompanied by some gastric discomfort and bathroom urgency. The symptoms were not worst I&#39;ve ever had them, but they did last a few days.

After six days of these post-vaccination symptoms he called his primary care provider, told patient that between his COVID infection and first dose of vaccine, his antibodies were extremely high and causing his symptoms to lag on. Doctor recommended holding off on getting the second dose of vaccine, and in about six months they would discuss administering the Janssen vaccine. Doctor did not ask that patient come in to be examined or tested, nor did he recommend any medications to include OTC. Patient&#39;s symptoms went on for seven days total, and he states that he has fully recovered.

This graduated to constant dizziness and cloudiness and severe shaking while outdoors.   Arrived at ER at about 10am  and &#34;room spinning&#34; vertigo began shortly after and at about 11am there was about 5 episodes of severe vomiting over about a 2 hour period.  Dizziness did not decrease until enough medication was administered to stop the vomiting and allow a dose of Meclizine 25mg PO to be administered and take effect and decrease the dizziness to barely manageable.  Left the hospital in this state at about 6PM.  Today is 4 days later and dizziness continues as manageable only with Meclizine 25mg every 8 hours.

I went to my primary care physician  today because I had a rash and the left side of my torso was in pain.   He diagnosed me as having shingles.  When I got home I decided to report since I see there have been some reports which appear to be rare according to what I read.  I also had one day of illness fatigue overall just felt cruddy about 3 days after the shot.  I was scheduled to get the second shot today but do to this development I did not take second shot today.

                                                Information below was sourced from the patient record in the hospital EHR system: Patient presented to ED with PMH of HTN and family history of premature CAD who presented with 2 hours duration of substernal chest discomfort. He had been in his usual state of health prior to this evening. He received the COVID Vaccine on 5/12/21. He went out with his wife for dinner and then upon return, started to have some substernal chest discomfort radiating down his arm. This is associated with some SOB and nausea. No vomiting, no diaphoresis. The pain continued for about 2 hours and then he decided to come to the ED. The EKG was consistent with inferolateral wall MI. States that he has been very active without exertional chest pain or dyspnea. He does have a history of HTN and is currently on lisinopril for this. No known history of hypercholesterolemia. Denies any diabetes. No smoking history. No history of PVD. His mother did have a bypass in her early 60s. At age 37, he did have a catherization following an episode of substernal chest discomfort. The patient states this catherization did not show any abnormalities.    Following this, the patient proceeded for PCI stenting with a DES for an occluded OM2 . Patient received Aspirin, Brilinta, Atorvastatin, Metoprolol, and Heparin prior to PCI stenting. Cardiology note confirms acute inferolateral STEMI due to occluded OM@, successfully opened and stented acutely.

This lasted into the weekend where I developed a severe headache for about 24 hours. After the headache subsided I continued to be fatigued with no appetite and dizziness. I&#39;m unable to be upright for long and am extremely restless at night. I can&#39;t sleep longer than a few hours before I wake up with my body feeling anxious.  This is day 8 and I&#39;m still weak and incredibly dizzy struggling to sleep at night.

                                                I had a significant reaction to shot 2. Fever type feelings, aches, pains, nausea, etc. I was in bed for many hours.  One of those symptoms on day 2 seemed to be a throbbing pain in my right knee and right foot. it seemed quite strange at the time.  By Tuesday morning - about 40 hours after the shot - when I felt well enough to move around I noticed that I had numbness in my right leg starting at the knee and working up the leg about 9-10 inches.  The numbness is only on the front of my leg and only in a strip about 3-4 inches wide starting about half way on the kneecap and working up the leg again about 9-10&#34;.  This numbness almost feels like the sensation after a dentists numbs the mouth for a procedure, like local anesthesia.  I just assumed it was temporary and would completely heal. It has not. I informed my primary care doctor and sent a follow up that it is continuing to manifest itself.   My leg is functioning normally and I have no other symptoms or issues - only the numbness in the leg in that one area.  Because this has gone on for so long I felt I should report it.

I did take ibuprofen and Benadryl a few hours later around bedtime.  I woke up with  fatigue, lethargy and Covid fog (decrease mental acuity and lethargic).   I had symptoms for 4 days and symptoms started to improve.  I noticed my heart rate increased at 120 and would only decrease if I lay down.  I went to see a doctor who diagnosed me with POTS (posterial orthostatic tachycardia syndrome).   I was prescribed metroprolol 25mg once a day.

Day over day, I developed extreme abdominal bloating and elevated blood pressure and rapid pulse.  Symptoms have continued for 14 days post shot.  Treatment with 4,000mg Simethicone daily to treat bloating.  When bloating is reduced - Blood Pressure and Pulse are significantly lowered.  Had appointment with PCP on day 13 - currently stopping Metformin - extreme bloating is reducing.    Have previously experienced similar (but milder) side effects of extreme abdominal bloating twice (when starting Metformin), but did not have elevated BP or Pulse.

                                                On June 1, 2021, I received my first dose of Moderna COVID-19 shot [LOT # 042B21-2A].  Within 24 hours, I experienced malaise and tiredness and slept for an unusually amount of time.  No other issues were noted at the time.  The following three days, I was working on building a stone patio in the backyard, an area known to have poison oak.  During this time, I noted a small rash on my abdominal area and a developing pain on my left abdominal side.  At the time I thought it was due to lawn work and otherwise ignored the discomfort and did not believe it was an adverse event from the vaccination.     SEE CONTINUATION PAGE......

On the way he vomited, having sweats and arriving at the hospital he said that he could not walk, I brought him a wheelchair and he went into the hospital telling me that one foot felt cramp and numb that he could not move it, after the doctors checked him and two hours later he told me that he no longer feel both legs. Since that day he could not  move from his stomach down to the tips of his feet,  And after a few days and several tests they could not find any reason why he had  paralysis, the doctor said that it was a syndrome called Guillen Barré and to date he is still hospitalized without being able to move his feet and waiting for help to receive  therapy since we do not have the monetary resources for these services.

He was observed for 15mins without any noticeable concerns noted. He was scheduled for his 2nd vaccine and released. Member returned to 2nd floor conference room C at 4:37pm as he indicated his tongue felt thick and swallowing wasn&#39;t &#34;natural&#34;. He advised he sat in his car for a while and came back in and took 2 benadryl.  I escorted member down to ACC and handed him off with report. He was in no acute distress, able to talk and ambulate. While checking into ACC he indicated he felt the benadryl was helping and felt a little better. (Initially during the 15 minute observation, member advised his mouth was dry and asked for water, which after drinking he said he was fine and that it helped. He was in no distress at that time. )

                                                6 hrs after vaccination, started to feel malaise to include slight headache, body ache, nausea.   12 hrs after, woke up to whole body uncontrollable shivering that lasted an hour.  Couldn&#39;t get warm. 13 hrs after, chills subsided and within 20 minutes I had a fever of 101 degrees that lasted about 2-3 hrs. 24 hrs later, still very tired and chilled with mild headache/body ache.  Reported symptoms to vaccination site and received telemed counseling.  Nothing they could do for me.

                                                Right after the vaccine I just had a slight head ache. I had pretty typical symptoms. Around 8pm my arm got to 8/10 pain. I have waves of Tachycardia and nausea. I had pretty bad diarrhea the first day and second day, this was also a side effect from the Celexa. The Tachycardia was going up to 130-140 .  Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

                                                I don&#39;t have lot number or dose number.  It was a Moderna COVID 19 vaccine.  I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

On Saturday March 20, I experienced the following symptoms from 2 pm to 8 pm: low grade fever, chills, fatigue, headache, and it also affected my vocal cords.  My voice returned to normal around 8 pm, when the other symptoms subsided.

The next morning 3/7 at approximately 0830, same effects as previous, but also a horrible migraine and vomiting. Took one 6ml injection Sumatriptan for migraine in opposite arm from Covid vax, no effect and no relief. 1300 hours, migraine was so intense, I advised my wife I would do a 2nd Sumatriptan injection and if it didn&#39;t work, I would need to be brought to the emergency room. 2nd injection was successful in relieving migraine approx 45 min after injection. Felt run down, but was able to go to work the next morning 3/8. Felt tired and run down on 3/8, but symptoms went away by late evening. This was surprising, since my first Covid vax dose 4 weeks prior didn&#39;t affect me as bad as this 2nd dose

                                                Diarrhea about 6 hours after vaccination.  Feeling off much of the rest of the day.  Fever started about 15 hours after vaccination with chills and shaking followed by sweating.  Used Ibuprofen to bring fever down and it would break after a couple hours.  Then took Tylenol hours later in the morning to try to ward off the fever.  Fever returned when these wore off.  Had fever again yesterday afternoon and last night - again taking Ibuprofen to break the fever both times and Tylenol in the morning to try to head off the fevers.  Sluggish feeling and lots of body aches.  Not as bad as the actual COVID disease probably but reminiscent of those symptoms except not getting the coughing I had when I had COVID in October (I was sick for 3 weeks when I had it with fever over 2 weeks solid).

                                                The morning after I woke up, I had intense abdominal cramping. The cramping was high in the gut area. I figured it was an adverse side effect. The cramping did not subsist night or day and the intensity was great. I called my GI on Monday and got an appointment. When I saw him, he ordered a CT scan and put me on a strong antibiotic thinking that it was an infection, not related to the vaccine. Meanwhile I had a CT scan and blood workup. The CT scan came back with significant swelling and inflammation in my small intestines. Five miserable days later my GI took me off of the antibiotic and was now talking about putting my on a strong steroid. (Budesonide) Then, due to tremendous cramping I went to the ER where they did another CT Scan, blood workup as well. They did see less swelling and that gave us hope that the steroid was working. Finally, I got a endoscopy where they took six biopsies. We are still waiting on the biopsies but they doctor said the inflammation was going done but that my stomach lining was particularly red. That is where it stands today just past one month. The pain is going down but both of my healthcare professionals are warned me against getting the second dose of the vaccine. They are both convinces this is a rare type of allergic reaction to the vaccine.

While walking to get Advil I collapsed on the floor and was conscious but unresponsive for 15-30 seconds while my wife tried to get me to respond.  For the next hour or so I had waves of aches, nausea, dizziness, and muscle weakness.  I was then able to get back to sleep and following day, I had mild aches that subsided as the day progressed and was close to feeling normal by evening.

I was unable to swallow for the first minute or so, then my upper and lower lip got numb. After I was able to swallow   my saliva tasted metallic and a mental fog settled in.  I had difficulty concentrating for the next 2-3 minutes.  All symptoms lasted for  about 5 minutes.  About a week later I developed a skin rash reminiscent to a &#34;zoster.&#34;   It was the size of my palm on my left thigh. Although is almost clear now, the affected skin area lost some sensitivity. Another subcutaneous inflammation persist to present day.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving vaccine I broke out in a cold sweat and was dizzy. That lasted for about ten minutes. The next day I woke up to pain running from the right side of my jaw to my right ear. The injection site in my right arm was more sore than any other vaccine shot I have ever had. The glands in my neck were swollen and my right side shoulder and neck area were sore. I experienced waves of fatigue over the next four days. The pain to my ear that seemed to mimic a really bad ear infection continued for six days. I went to the minute clinic at the Pharmacy where I received the shot and was checked out. There was nothing wrong with my ear and they could not find anything wrong with me other than my glands were swollen and I had a general amount of swelling on the right side of my next going into my shoulder. While the pain in my ear has lessened some it is still there now eight days after the vaccination. I have also experienced some GI issues. I am extremely regular and do not have issue going to the bathroom. My gut was not normal and I did not have normal bowl movements for more than a week. I also have had something akin to a rash on my arms that looks like prickly heat. It seemed to me that my immune system overreacted to the vaccine. I have contended for months now that I had Covid back in March of 2020 right before the shutdown. I believe I caught it during business travel at the very beginning of March 2020. My concern is whether I should get the second Moderna shot if my immune system is already this revved up with antibodies.

Back pain was significant enough to wake me up in the early morning. The abdominal pain required that I stand up as the pain intensified while laying prone. Abdominal pain resulted in difficulty breathing (unable to take full breaths without the pain intensifying). Abdominal pain subsided after 20 minutes, but the back pain continued into the next morning.

                                                patient passed out.  when awoken was clammy and sweaty.  Lowered him to the floor where he complained about being hot and cold alternatively.  BP was usually low 110&#39;s over 60 pulse ran about 56.  Patient was nauseas.  Used ice packs to cool him, and towels to warm him.  He did not vomit.  He continued to be dizzy and sweaty.  BPs and pulses did not improve, after 40 minutes of symptomatic treatment, he consented to an ambulance being called.  He was treated by paramedics, I do not know if he was taken to the hospital.

Mild ringing in both ears that began  the night of the 2nd day after second shot. Ringing decreased and stopped in the left ear and increased to a very loud ringing in only the right ear. I went to see a general medicine doctor, then an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor. She had a hearing test conducted that showed hearing loss in my right ear. The ENT has me scheduled to an MRI today. I went to the MRI, but could not continue because of an increased feeling of dizziness, faintness and severe nausea. I am scheduling an open MRI.

Treated with hydrocortisone cream, to minimal effect. Rash lasted roughly 6 weeks. The following day, symptoms included fatigue, chills and 2 rounds of vomiting. Treated as flu virus. Slept/rested most of 36 hours, plenty of liquids. Still felt logy but mostly 80% recovered by the 2nd morning after injection. Back to normal (other than rash on leg) by 3rd morning.

                                                I took a first vaccination (Moderna) on 1/17/21.  Two days later, I started feeling slght pins and needles in my left foot and eventually felt a numbness on the entire left side of my  body from toes to head.  On 1/21/21, I had an severe headache and nausea and so I vomitted several times in the morning.   I went to a local doctor&#39;s office and got a medication for nausea.   On 1/23/21, I went to a local ER and a bleed was found in the brain stem by CT scan.  Then I was sent to the medical center.  I took several tests and a cavernous malformations was found in pons in the brain.  I was discharged on 1/27/21 and still have a numbness since it occured.

                                                2 hours after injection I felt strong pain at the injection site as expected.  10 hours after injection I felt the expected side effects of tiredness, slight headache, sore body, and slight nausea.  I went to bed.  12 hours after injection I woke up in intense pain feeling very sick.  My entire body hurt on a scale of 10 out of 10.  My neck muscles especially were so tight that it was unbearable and beyond a 10 on pain scale.  I had a headache.  I felt very nauseous like I might vomit at any moment.  My breathing became shallow.  I had chills to the point that my teeth were chattering and I was shivering uncontrollably even though it was 76 degrees inside my home.  I considered calling an ambulance, but was hoping this would pass.  There we moments I felt I might die and I left my door unlocked so EMTs could get in as I was still on the verge of calling for help.  I was unable to sleep due to the intensity of pain.  I could not eat and drank very little.  Day 2 I was still in intense pain on a scale of 10 out of 10.  I had a fever for a short time on and off.  I did not eat for two days.  I was able to take naps for one hour at a time, but then would wake up to a crushing headache and intense neck pain.  The second night I was able to sleep, although I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat.  I would go from being extremely cold to sweating heavily feeling hot.  I eventually became very hungry but was afraid to eat and was still nauseous.  On day 3, the pain scale of my symptoms went down from 10 to 6.  I felt much better.  I was able to eat and drink well.  Day 4 I was not in pain but was exhausted and depleted.  Day 5 I felt I was recovered.  Please note:  I normally have a high pain threshold and I run up mountains and am used to pain.  I also have always had flu shots with no bad symptoms.  I am pro-vaccine.  But something went horribly wrong with this 2nd Moderna vaccine shot.

                                                1-2 weeks after the second vaccination, pt. began experiencing fatigue, headache, muscle aches. He then developed a rash all over his body, and sores on his tongue. Then he developed a fever, was unable to leave his bed, passed out multiple times, and was eventually admitted to the hospital with a 105 degree fever and pneumonia on the morning of July 10th. They could not keep his blood pressure up and put him on three different drugs to keep him alive, and by the end of July 10th, just 12 hours after he was admitted, he was put on a ventilator because he was not able to breathe on his own anymore. His white blood cell count was 0.2, and every time they changed the IV bags and momentarily discontinued the BP medicine, he would drop to critical levels. On the second day they were fairly sure he was not going to make it, but he has since gotten a little better. They have been giving him blood transfusions and platelets. He has remained on a ventilator for 18 days now, and has developed fevers every afternoon, up to 102 degrees, which they keep bringing down again with medication and ice.   They have tested him for practically ever disease known to man for 18 days. There is no cause they can find. Not cancer, not autoimmune disease, nothing. Pt. has not been to the hospital since he was a child and it was for injury, not illness. He has never had any sort of major disease or cancer or chronic illness. The hospital or me, his mother, can be contacted for any further questions.

                                                Afew hours after receiving the inoculation, I was extremely sleepy.   I was sleeping at my job, and my boss had me go home early.  I went to work the next day, however I was feeling weird, my sense of smell and taste were off, as the day continued I started having a headache, body aches, and general malaise.  I went home early, again from work.  But when I arrived to my residence I was having severe chills despite my efforts to try to keep myself warm.  The chills lasted for more than 24hrs, preventing me from sleeping, my body aches were getting worse, my eyes were extremely red, and I did not feel like eating.  Near the end of the day, the chills became sweats, and I was trying to balance between being hot and clammy, to chills.  The next day I paid a visit to my primary care doctor.  I was tested for covid - which was negative, I was tested for the flu - which was negative, and my lungs were clear so there was no reason for my doctor to believe I have a pneumonia.

Major Side Effects/Adverse Side Effects: day 1- increased suicidal ideations, major depression, major fatigue, felt like all psychiatric medication stopped working. I felt suicidal. Felt like Killing myself because of it. resolved after 3-4 days. Stomache was also very upset. only ate rice and crackers and applesauce. Day 5- back ache for 2-3 days. I believe that the vaccine made the psychiatric medication  I take daily to stop working!  My concern is that other psychiatric patients may not know these side effect exist and that they will be getting this vaccine and then be found dead because of it.

I advised him to go to er/call dr if unable to drink, develops high fever/numbness/tingling/loss of motion, etc.  Followed up today. pt is still very nauseated but has developed a full-on  migraine headache.  He went to the ER last night, and was not found to be dehydrated &amp; labs were not unusual.  he was given injection of nausea medicine, and rxs for zofran and norco, but had not taken any today... using pepto bismol instead.  I advised he take the zofran routinely until the nausea subsides and the norco for the headache  &amp; if not improved in a couple days to go see his dr.

Move or swallow. It lasted for three weeks until two days after the second dose of the vaccine. I was prescribed two courses of antibiotics , Cephalexin and Doxycycline ,  which only helped a little.  I had gotten an insect bite the week before vaccination. I also had a CT scan after the second dose of vaccination but the pain had gone by then.

I started feeling better around 2:30 AM on March 17.  I went to work that morning at 8:30 and had to leave work at 10 AM due to feeling worse.  I went home and laid down the rest of the day, taking Tylenol and drinking an electrolyte drink.  I had chills, but not nearly as bad the the night before.  I started feeling better around 6PM that evening.  The next day, I felt fine with the exception of an almost total loss of appetite.   I did not feel fully back to normal until Friday morning.  I do not regret getting the shot, but found this reporting tool and thought it would be a good idea to submit my experience.

I was fine after the shot was made but as the evening came towards the night, I started having the chills, lots of shivering and a slight fever (99 degrees). It felt as if I was having Covid again.  I took 2 - 500 mgs of Tylenol Extra Strength as a precaution in case it got worse.  The next day I felt very tired throughout the day and at night time I didn&#39;t feel as bad as the 1st night but I felt nauseous and muscle pains everywhere so I took another 2 Tylenols, it got better then went to sleep.

He was advised to stay home, was offered Covid testing but refused. On 3/22/21 the RN received an email from patient&#39;s supervisor that he still felt unwell and reported vomiting and diarrhea. Was offered a Covid test but refused.  -Per patient&#39;s friend (a nurse who informed us of the case) various friends spoke with patient up until the morning of 3/25 and he reportedly had no respiratory or cardiac complaints. They were unable to reach him the evening of 3/25, nor the morning of 3/26 so sent the police for a well check and patient was found dead. He lived alone. -Per OSME. Patient did not receive an autopsy but did have an &#34;inspection&#34; which includes an external exam, toxicology and other testing including Covid testing which was positive. The specimen has been sent for sequencing. -Of note, Patient worked in a group  home that had an outbreak of Covid in Jan/early Feb. His last exposure to a &#43; person was likely 2/8/21 but possibly 2/10/21. He had a Covid test 2/15/21 that was &#34;inconclusive&#34;. The test was re-run (same assay) and was also &#34;inconclusive&#34;

                                                Arm became warm and sore within seconds.  After about 90 seconds, a wave of heat flashed through the entire upper-body (torso, arms and head) followed by a mild tingling sensation throughout the entire upper-body (torso, arms and head). From minutes 3-6, increasing stomach discomfort and queasiness. From minutes 5-7,  profuse sweating of the entire head (everything from the neck up). At approximately 7-8 minutes, there was a single dry heave or gag (the sensation of vomiting, but nothing came up).  Other than the sore arm, all symptoms disappeared almost immediately after the dry heave occurred. There have been no symptoms other than continued soreness at the injection location as of 24 hours later.

                                                We have a man that we vaccinated last week with moderna. He is 52 yo. He had his first vaccine at another store on 3/31 and his second vaccine with us on 4/14.  That is only 15 days apart. He said he got notification from us that a vaccine was available and he read in material (he thinks but isn?t sure) through the county that said he could get it in 2 weeks from his first dose. So, when he got the notification he thought it was ok to get his 2nd dose. He did however have a scheduled appointment with the other store for his second dose for the correct date. He did bring his card with him to vaccine clinic that had the date of his first vaccine on there. He said when he got his second dose he had 24hrs of feeling dizzy, 12 hrs of chills and 8hrs of feeling nauseous. He is not wanting to get another vaccine because he doesn?t want to go through those symptoms again

                                                Approximately 16 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to feel very lethargic. I stayed in bed most of the day, feeling chills, then heat, along with pain in my lower legs. I was not very hungry or thirsty either. I started feeling better around 9 p.m. on April 27, and the following day (April 28), I was pretty much back to normal. However, I was experiencing bouts of diarrhea.

Started to use Calamine lotion to help with the itch along with Benadryl.  Could not sleep due to the rash over my body.

                                                a 52 y.o. male sent for evaluation due to symptoms which have now lasted for months and began occurring shortly after he received his second Materna vaccine.  He had his first Madrona vaccine on 3/26/2021, and his second vaccine on 4/23/2021.  Initially he noted headaches, neuralgia, chills and sweats, and just suspected these would dissipate as had been described in the media.  His headaches and neuralgia did resolve, but he continued to have significant night sweats and fatigue.  He had one episode where he passed out and struck his head.  This has not recurred for over a month.  He has had 2 episodes of vomiting bilious material these were significantly spread out.  He has noted a 20 pound weight loss and difficulty sleeping.  He does report that in the last few days his symptoms seem to have improved, and his appetite has improved as well, but he has not noticed any weight gain yet.  He did have low-grade fevers the highest being in the 101 range.  He had no visual, taste, pulmonary, genitourinary, rheumatological, or dermatological complaints.  Apart from the 2 episodes of vomiting he has had no GI issues.  His wife is present and concurs with his history.  He has had a significant work-up from his primary care provider who included an LDH in late May that was normal, CBC with differential which was benign, a Monospot which was negative, CRP that was elevated at 85 with 0-10 being the reference range, a negative ANA, negative RA, and a sedimentation rate of 42, blood cultures were performed and were negative.  Labs earlier in the month noted similar findings.  His basic metabolic panel and liver enzymes were also normal.  He was also reportedly screened for Lyme and was negative but I do not see this test result.   He denies any childhood infections of significance. The also went to a safari in 2019.  They traveled recently prior to the onset of his symptoms but he reports no known bites or scratches by ticks, insects, mosquitoes, or other animals.  No one else in the household has been sick.  He did receive the BCG vaccine as a child.  They also report a chest x-ray was performed and was benign.  He was given a 10-day course of amoxicillin and reports no significant improvement while on this.

It felt like I was being squeezed in a vice and electrocuted at the same time . The pain was unreal. I also experienced a spasm in the area. The only that helped me was 30 days of steroids. The problem is still ongoing. I am taking pregabalin and baclofen for the pain and stiffness. I finally got some relief by March 2021. As of today my right side and ribs still hurt. Also my spine is very painful. My life has been ruined by this vaccine. I have been crippled by this product.

                                                Approx 17hrs after receiving shot I started feeling a mild headache and trouble concentrating. I felt physically weaker and mild stomach ache with my eyes sensitive to light. The following morning I felt almost back to normal. The following evening 2 days after receiving shot I felt a lot of Upper back and shoulder pain. I felt like throwing up but did not. I only slept  3 hours that night and was physically soar. I ate only a can of chicken noodle soup and drank a can of ginger ale Sunday 7/25/21. I slept well last night but still feel tired and a little brain fog. I ate a good breakfast this AM and believe now three days after my second shot I will likely be almost back to normal.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

By 5:30 pm the aching in both legs became greater and started a general unwell feeling.  By 7:00 pm I had a headache/full body aching/major pain and aching in both legs/rapid heart beat at rest/chills/diarrhea.  I suffered from sweats/chills/rapid heart rate/major right and left leg pain and aches/headache for the whole next day.  By 11:00pm the day after vaccine, I was only suffering from major head ache and major left and right leg pain and aching and sweating.  I woke up the 2nd day after the vaccine symptom free but very fatigued.  I took 800mg of Advil every 6 hours from the onset of symptoms.  My watch reported my heart rate at a range from 90-121 BPM while at rest for at least 24hours during onset of symptoms.

Did not want  to eat or anything. Stayed in bed. By 4/16  was a little better, couldn&#39;t eat much, still weak. Was better on 4/17/2021. I tried to report to medical , they didn&#39;t seem to think it was  important.

                                                TWO lower GI tract infections, each one about two weeks after a vaccine shot. Other worries are confusion and bp oscillation.  DETAILS: 1st dose only minor flu like symptoms then 14 days in, big GI tract infection tennis ball size in lower GI followed by UTI and Colo-rectal infections. Gas and no stool passing.   2nd dose down  24-72 hrs later with serious chills and internal fever in main body cavity. Slept it off and hydrated. Then consistent flu like symptoms but stronger and longer than 1st shot. Increasing confusion and maybe dementia? Some 3-D visual dreams too?  lots of inflamation feel in body wherever old injuries were. Also blood pressure going high and low even though I cross checked with both electronic wrist version, and mechanical armband version of bp monitors. Consistent frontal lobe head pressure, bp oscillation, and flu like feelings (upset stomach, change in urine and stool color, wooziness, chills, etc.). Thank goodness for coffee! It helps clear up my mind a bit.  Then again, 14 days beyond second shot roughly, and the only reason I filed the report, another lower GI tract infection. This time I hit it right away with potassium penicillin 800 mg. This worked the first time too. Just an FYI in case others are showing  GI tract version/issues. I believe this was a secondary form of Covid symptoms in early Chinese data if that can be trusted.   Still not in good shape but it sounds like second shot causes more issues. I will probably schedule general checkup with my doctor if I dont get better in a week or so.

His L side of the face was also noted to be drooping, the next day, including inability to raise his eyebrow on L, difficulty closing L eye, and a L sided mouth droop. Reports the swelling started to get better just prior to arrival in ED, however is still persistent and includes the lips and throat, says it feels like the inside is swollen. Was able to tolerate liquids but noted some difficulty. Denies any difficulty breathing. Also denies any extremity weakness, vision changes, balance issues, speech deficits other than what&#39;s related to lip swelling and mouth droop

                                                Approximately 5 days after my first COVID 19 vaccination shot I became severely nauseous and began experiencing severe upper abdominal pain.  These symptoms remained MORE OR LESS CONSTANT FOR AT LEAST 90 DAYS, and were much worse than the somewhat similar intermittent symptoms normally caused by my chronic condition.  I do not know whether or not the COVID 19 vaccination caused these symptoms but feel compelled to report them nonetheless since I suspect it might have caused them.   Once I began experiencing the above-described symptoms I sought out help from my PCP and one of my gastroenterologists.  Lab work (on multiple occasions) and an EGD surgical procedure were performed but nothing unusual for me was found.

                                                Patient manifested with flu-like symptoms (myalgias, fatigue, cough, abdominal discomfort, shortness of breath) with high-grade fevers (TMax 103F) approximately 4-6 hours following administration of 2nd Moderna vaccine on 5/4/2021 per patient&#39;s wife. The symptoms progressively worsened to the point that he presented to an outside hospital on 5/12/2021 at which time he was found to be tachycardic and febrile (T 103.1F). Labs at that time were notable for significant thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, elevated lactate, elevated procalcitonin. Chest imaging showed bilateral airspace disease. CT of the abdomen noted hepatosplenomegaly with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function. He was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Labs on 5/13/2021 were notable for a markedly elevated ferritin level, fasting hypertriglyceridemia, elevated CRP, elevated transaminase levels, hyperbilirubinemia, markedly elevated CXCL-9 level, markedly elevated IL-18 level, normal natural killer cell function. Of note, while his blood and urine cultures were negative, he was found to have elevated EBV viral load on peripheral blood draw. He had a bone marrow biopsy which reportedly showed rare evidence of cells with what appeared to be erythrocytes within their cytoplasm, concerning for HLH.  Given strong clinical and serological suspicion for HLH, he was transferred to our hospital for a higher level of care. Upon transfer to our facility on 5/18/2021, his inflammatory markers were persistently elevated. He unfortunately developed worsened renal and respiratory failure, and required both hemodialysis and intubation respectively. He was continued on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, however we additionally initiated high-dose steroids as well as anakinra for treatment of HLH. Given EBV viremia, we also began rituximab therapy. He was successfully extubated, however as of 5/26/2021 remains dialysis-dependent with continued improvement in urinary output. His post-intubation course has been complicated by encephalopathy of unknown etiology. We have consulted infectious disease to proceed with a diagnostic lumbar puncture to ascertain potential CNS pathogens explaining the cause of his altered mental status. MRI of the brain showed no evidence of pathology. CNS involvement by HLH remains on our differential.

                                                I got my second shot of mederna on april 2  at about 130 pm, I got the shot and felt fine for about 4 hours at which time I got so tired and dizzy I felt like I was going to pass out, so I stopped what I was doing and went to bed. I slept for 4 hours and woke up in a pool of sweat and was so wet it was like I had just gotten out of the shower. I had the chills and felt cold in 84 Deg F, I went down stairs drank power aid and got out and set up a space heater and sat in front of it with it blowing the hot air on me but had hot and cold flashes, a mild head ach and joint stiffness and pain. I was only able to stay up for 4 hours before I was so exhausted I had to back to sleep and woke up the same way, this continued for the entire weekend. By monday morning my urine was so yellow it was almost black in color, I called my PCP office, they called me back and advised I go to the emergency room asap. I called my parents and got a ride to the hospital emergency room. I told intake what happened and sat down to be called in, they called me in 1 time then had me wait for diagnostic testing, I got vary dizzy just sitting their watching the tv. By the time they called me in for testing I told them I felt vary noxious and ended up passing out on the nurse after they took my blood. They transferred me from that chair to a bed in the blue pod, gave me nausea medication and hooked me up too 2 vary large IV bags and ran them at the same time. Then being up for 4 hours then sleeping for 4 hours and waking up wet in a pool of sweat continued for 6 days in total. the hot and cold flashes and sitting in front of a space heater went on for 12 days in total. waking up in a pool of sweat went on for about 28 - 30 days in total decreasing in severity along the course of time. The only side effect I still have is my sleep is all screwed up now. If I stay up untill 4 am I will sleep to 10;30 then wake up tired and stay in bed untill 11;30  am. if I go to bed at 2 am I wake up at 6;30 am have to use the bath room then can not go back to sleep for at least a hour then do not wake up untill 11 30 am. Normally, I used to goto bed at 2 -3 am and wake up at 9 -10 am every day.  on wednesday april 7 th, the doctors office which is part of the same group as the hospital called me to go over the results from the emergency room, but the person calling did not seem to know I had called them on monday morning or they had called me back to tell me to go to the emergency room, so I do not know how much of a help the PCP will be,  but I have proof of that in the phone call records.  MY PCP is no longer with the practice, so I had to choose a new one

Insomnia would not allow ANY sleep for days and lasted for over a month. Breathing seemed to be labored and hard to get a full breath. Had to purchase a CPAP to allow enough air to be able to sleep. Still can not get a full nights sleep.  Developed terrible anxiety which I have never had before. Lost appetite and couldn&#39;t eat. Lost 55 pounds in following 3 months. Developed stuffy swollen nose/turbinates which I have never had before. Constantly feel ill and no able to perform daily functions of job or living. Brain fog and fatigue. I continue to deal with this issues to this day, now over 4 months. These all started the same day I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.

I felt weak kneed for about 2 hours afterwards, and was still wobbly knees the next day.   I also had muscle/joint aches the same day, which went away within 24 hours.  In the past 6 days, I have had reoccurring headaches, fatigue, and  this morning, had a severe enough headache to bring on nausea.   I am med compliant with all my meds and I take care of my Type II diabetes,    I am also a volunteer firefighter - advanced EMT, so I know when there is a problem.

We instructed him to take off his jacket and gave him a cool rag. After the 15 minutes of observation were up, he felt good. He denied any s/s of dizziness or light-headiness or shortness of breath. I called to check on him today and he reported that he feels a little tired and has some nausea at times. His arm is a little sore, but he is doing ok.

                                                I had pain in arm from injection immediately, after injection, which was much different than first dose.  But not unexpected.  But the adverse symptoms started about 5 hours in or so, i developed a cough, and dyspnea, it was tight in my chest, hard to breathe.  the cough was/is (it remains), sometimes hard and raspy, i was a bit wheezy, and I had air hunger, like i could not breathe or get air.  if i exhale to strongly i cough, if i talk to much i cough, if i sing i cough, if i inhale too deeply i cough.  I also have been very dizzy since the shot and vertigo.  I am still coughing and it is 5 days post shot.    I started developing headache and severe body pain, pain in  my spine, low back and joints.  which is expected, but i also had scalp pain and it hurt to be even touched the slightest bit on my scalp and everywhere on my body.  I had very stiff neck and eye socket pain as well.  I also feel &#34;funny&#34; in my head.  LIke dizzy, and vertigo, but also like it is wrapped in a heavy towel and my eyes feel heavy and like i can&#39;t see well.  my vision is as if it has diminshed.    5 hours after shot cough started, and the dyspnea, i started feeling chills and deep squeezing ache in my arm at jab site, and soon had fever of 100.6, over night it went to 100.8 and i felt terrible, headache, body ache, restless.  but next day fever was 102.  it remained all day, i had zero energy slept the whole day.  no appetite, did not eat anything except a scramble egg which made me nausea.  fever remained all day at 101.8. over night.  next day temp was 99.8 (my normal is 97.6) and it was 99.8 all day.  Cough was persistent and really bad with the dyspnea this whole time and i still have cough 5 days out, just giving a timeline here.  by friday, my temp was 98 but i felt extreemly fatigued.  I went and got a covid test which was negative.  i saw the chiropractor and they helped my back and headache a little bit.  went home and rested.  cough has lingered, dizzy lingers, chest tight and sob lingers.  fatigue lingers.   Cough and dyspnea are NOT signs, the sheet i got for V-safe says right on it these are NOT expected.

                                                Beginning about 16hours after the shot (the next morning) my stomach began to bother me a little, within half an hour or so I began to feel a little tingle from the top left arm (shot area) down to my stomach including my sternum area.  It got progressively worse. By about hour 17 I was beginning to get cold sweats and stomach bothering me more. By hour 18 I was cold, sweating, nauseous, vomiting, hard tight pain in stomach /and sternum/chest.  Stomach / chest pain persisted badly for about 30- 45 minutes then began to subside.  By hour 19 most of the sever pain subsided.  for the rest of the day (@and still 25 hours later) I still have a lingering miserable stomach and slight headache.  I slept most of the afternoon without any medication.

About eleven hours after shot I had headache, feeling of irregular body temperature, nausea, body aches..  I took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea which helped.    About 24 hours after the injection I experienced sore armpit/lymph nodes of shot arm.   All but the symptoms except the sore armpit/lymph nodes  were mostly gone within 30 hours of the shot.  The lymph nodes felt better a day or two later.

I woke up Tues. March 23 at 6:30 am and noticed numbness on the left side of my face and paralysis on the right side.  I&#39;d never experienced this before in my lifetime.  I contacted my physician and she advised that I go to s healthcare facility to get checked out.  Once at the healthcare facility, the attending ER doctor said everything pointed to Bell&#39;s Palsy.  However, she ordered a series of tests to rule out anything else.  All tests came back good.  Diagnosis was Bell&#39;s Palsy.  I was prescribed Prednisone, an Anti-Viral and poly eye drops.  When I awoke the next morning 3/24, the numbness on the left side had mostly gone away, but the paralysis on the right side was worse.  Today is 3/26 - there has been no change or improvement since.

As he was driving he wasn&#39;t feeling very  well,  I told him maybe we should go sit in the parking lot of the hospital.  We ended up in  parking lot.  He was pale, nauseated and  he thought he was getting a fever (but didn&#39;t)  and was really getting tired like ran down.  So,  he said for me to drive him home so he could lay down.  I got him home I called Dr.  office  I knew these symptoms were normal , but didn&#39;t think on  first dose and that fast... 30 minutes from time of injection to when he got  sick feeling.  The Doctors office just said to watch him for  symptoms if he got worse etc.,  and I asked if this was normal for how fast this happened.  She said there is no normal.   He was cold and covered up when we got home and took a 2 hour nap!  Afterwards, he helped make dinner and was ok just his arm was really sore.

                                                Beginning at 11:30 PM I began to experience chills. I spiked a fever throughout the night and slept very little. Beginning around 2 PM I experienced aching joints comparable to arthritis. About that time I also began to experience sinus congestion and pain Which was similar to having a significant sinus infection. By 8 AM the fever was beginning to break but the aches and sinus congestion remained, and stomach pain arose. Throughout the day, there were episodes of fever. Stomach pain resolved around noon. Congestion and aches and fever were largely resolved by 4pm, at which time two Tylenol were taken, with only occasional low fever episodes. I slept well that night and felt fine the following morning.

This is the sickest I&#39;ve felt in decades, maybe my entire life.  Oh, and my injection site hurt too.  The night of the shot, and the day after, were the worst.  I&#39;m writing this on the morning of day 2.  Today, the fever, body aches, and joint pain are gone.  I still have a headache (but it&#39;s better than yesterday), fatigue, and injection site pain.  After my first Moderna shot, I had a slight headache and fatigue the following day, but this second shot really kicked my ass.

                                                I awoke the morning of the 28th feeling slightly fatigued with some soreness at the injection site.  By lunchtime, I am experiencing extreme fatigue, overall body soreness, loss of appetite, and increased pain at the injection site. By 3 pm I am home and in bed, dealing with chills/sweats as well. Couldn&#39;t find any comfort to sleep thru the night. In the morning of the 29th, I&#39;m still displaying all the issues listed above. I stay home from work and go back to bed. I awake at noon to find all the listed issues greatly reduced, but feel soreness in my jaw and feel swelling in the lymph nodes under the jawbone, more so on the right than the left.

                                                Sudden debilitating dizziness and nausea 1 week after 2nd dose of Moderna vaccination.  Unable to stand or walk. Vomited 8 hrs until dehydrated.  Went to emergency room and received IV fluids with Zofran.  Emergency room doctor prescribed  Meclizine and Zofran. The nausea subsided the next day however a only a slight improvement in dizziness. After 5 days of significant dizziness and not able sand or walk very well, I then visited the a health care Center. After several Dr diagnosed me with Vestibular Neuritis (permanent nerve damage) in the right ear after several diagnostic tests.  Dr. thinks  a virus caused inflammation and damaged my nerve in my inner ear.  I was put on a 10 day prednisone and my condition improved by about 50%.  I am doing physical therapy to retrain my brain to compensate for the balance that my inner ear provided.  I am improving but this may take up to 3 months.  I have never had a problem like this in the past. I have read several other cases like mine on the website where people got the vaccine and all the sudden Vestibular Neuritis set in.

                                                After administration of the vaccine (yesterday), patient began to experience itching at the injection site and slight whelps at the injection site.  He said he wasn&#39;t feeling great and reported having cold sweats and hot flashes.  He also had dry mouth that caused him to have difficulty swallowing.  I administered 50mg of diphenhydramine liquid and observed him for over 30 minutes.  I checked his blood pressure three times; it was elevated but within what he said was a normal range for him.  He had not had anything to eat nor taken his bp meds that am.  After 30 minutes, he was feeling some improvement and he and his wife left.  I spoke with her later and she said they had gotten something to eat and gone home and he was sleeping.  I spoke to him again this morning and he said later in the day he felt like his throat was swelling, but he continued to take diphenhydramine and felt better today.  He and I both reported this event to his primary care provider.

                                                Note: May 24, 2021 the pharmacy that administered the COVID vaccines contacted me with some billing questions. When I mentioned my severe reactions, they told me they were filing a report upon my behalf. When done they told me it was the VAERS system and gave me a reference number (Ref-531994). I decided that not enough information would be in that report so wanted to submit myself because of my severe reaction and hospitalization. My PCP was not involved until after hospital for a follow up and I was seen by numerous doctors there, so I have no easy single POC until I dig more.

Apr 17, 2021 Wake to find tongue hugely swelled. Thought I&#39;d bitten in my sleep. Unable to eat, hard to swallow fluid past tongue. Lasts for a bit over 36 hrs. Apr 19, 2021 Knee pain begins spreading up thighs down calves. Pain also beginning in feet toes and ankles. Apr 20, 2021 Knee pain when bending prevents me from entering truck to drive.

Apr 28, 2021 Approx. 2:30 pm knee/overall leg pain begins increasing rapidly to higher than before level. Over next three days increases to point where I cannot stand/walk due to pain. Unable to sleep due to pain also. Apr 28, 2021 Same Day-Around 4:30 pm notice voice is becoming raspy. By 6 pm my voice is completely gone. I have no voice for next approx. 36 hrs.

Less each day but still need for stability. Still have knee pain. Have higher level of pain in feet.  I had/have a major reaction to the Moderna vaccine. This should be investigated and reported on.

                                                He got his vaccine, had pain on the side of the injection and from there it grew to feeling aches and pains and then the shivers the next day.  He has had chills/sweating, fever that comes and goes, difficulty breathing as his nostrils block up, and has wheezing and when he gets up he&#39;s light headed and feels like he is going to pass out.  At night the symptoms seem to get worse, and thought that he had the flu.  He has bought everything for the flu and nothing has helped.  He then thought that he may have allergies and bought stuff for that and nothing has helped.  He has lost his sense of taste, he is extremely thirsty and could drink a gallon of water and his stomach hurts from drinking but his mouth is extremely dry and his throat is so dry as well.   He also has a nasty bad headache that is persistent and at night it gets to the point that he cannot seen and had lost his vision and could no see anything out of his right eye.  He called 9-1-1 and refused to go to the ER as he has no insurance and could not afford that kind of bill.  Yesterday his headache was so bad that he could not see out of the left eye, he has a fever of 101.5 right now and his head is killing him.  He has taken all of his medications that he has, medicated and nothing is helping the pain.  His nose is also extremely dry and he has no appetite, and ate last at 5:00 PM yesterday.   He also has vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, sweats/chills.  He watches his diet carefully due to the diabetes, but has not measured it.     He is very concerned about his vision and his fever and headache was so bad that he could not see, and he&#39;s worried about that.   He also has brain fog as well, and cannot remember things, pounding, pulsating water.

                                                I had pericarditis 2 years ago and 4 days after my 2nd dose of Moderna I felt similar symptoms to when I?d had it. They subsided after a day but came back 3 weeks later. Because of my history of having had Pericarditis I had ultrasound and CT Scan and they showed some inflammation. Blood tests showed  C-reactive Protein levels high (70). On my own I googled if pericarditis was a side effect from vaccine as it was odd to me that my symptoms started so soon after. I read that there have been rare cases reported recently  but mostly in young people and they?ve subsided. Perhaps  because I had it two years ago it triggered a recurrent effect. I was prescribed 600 mg ibuprofen as before by Cardiologist and colchicine as before. My PCP suggested I might want to notify you.  I thought I should report this given what I read and that I&#39;m 55, so it?s different than other reports you?ve received.  I do not know if I have pericarditis again but the symptoms have been identical to when I did and the CRP level increase would suggest so. I had Echo and EKG and heart alright so it&#39;s not Myocarditis. Symptoms included: pain in abdomen chest area, pronounced in URQ this time but it migrated, increased when walking or lying down, difficulty sleeping in side, slightly elevated fever 98.9-95 when I?m usually in  96-98 range, breath hiccups, some nausea. Since taking colchicine and ibuprofen have been feeling better, just concerned that this seemed to have recurred, and started exactly 4 day after my 2nd shot.

I progressively felt worse as the day went on. a few hours after vaccination my upper left arm swelled up at the injection site.  upper left arm pain.  Then started to get headache and nauseated.  Around 10pm I was running a fever of 101.1.  Took Advil and went to bed.  Woke up around 130am sweating profusely, temperature down to 99.4, then had extreme chills and nausea and my whole body was shaking, nothing helped.  By 3am my fever was back up to 101.4, took more Advil and went back to bed.  At 8am the next morning my temperature was back down to 99.1.  checked temperature again around 11am and it was low, down to 96.1.  By mid-afternoon my temperature had finally returned to normal.  The next several days I felt tired and sluggish, dizzy off and on, and arm still hurts at injection site.  I have diabetes and have neuropathy and the neuropathy in my feet has intensified and comes on more frequently.

The day after he received his second moderna vaccine he developed polydipsia, polyuria and substantial fatigue in addition to muscle aches, nausea, and malaise. His symptoms initially improved but then slowly worsened again, developing shortness of breath, palpitations, heat intolerance, and continued polyuria, polydipsia. Three days prior to presenting to our hospital (which was 3 weeks after his 2nd vaccine dose), pt developed worsening nausea with vomiting and substantial worsening of shortness of breath.  On admission to our hospital, he was found to be in Diabetic ketoacidosis (no prior history of Diabetes, auto-immune Diabetes labs pending) as well has having new pulmonary embolism, Atrial fibrillation with RVR, and hyperthyroidism with anti-tpo abs (other&#39;s thyroid antibodies still pending). Given the time course of his presentation, it seems to us that he developed these conditions as a complication of his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient&#39;s tachycardia patient&#39;s Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily. (Please note clarification in comparison to discharge home med list.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily was called to pharmacy in place of the metoprolol.)

This lasted about 36 hours. These symptoms were similar to those I experienced when I had Covid-19 in early December of 2020.

I took a benedryl at 5:00pm on Wednesday 3/03/2021. Called my family doctor on Thursday morning and he told me to take 1 Zyrtec in the morning and 1 at night to help clear the rash. My Doctor said it was not anaphylaxis as it did not happen immediately after the vaccine but 24 hours later. I have no trouble breathing as I check myself with oximeter and my oxygen level is 97%.  I did have Covid on January 3, 2021 and after the vaccine on 03/02/2021 I experienced nausea, chills and a dull headache and then the rash. I have experienced this type of rash before after a stomach virus and it lasts for 3 or 4 days and clears up.

                                                I received the first  shot on March 16th and on March 20th around 4:00 pm I was feeling like my speech was a little slurry.  I got home and about 5:30 pm I was resting against my boat cause I was feeling nausea and a headache.  Also it felt like my food tasted different...I had ate some chips the day after the shot on March 17th and I had told my wife that they tasted different.  Anyway, on  March 20th around 8:30 pm I went to spit and realized I could only spit from the right side of my mouth. I called my daughter, who is an ICU RN, asked me to do a series of tests over facetime with her and she told me I should go in cause when I smiled it wasn&#39;t symmetrical.  She came and picked me up and took me to hospital in.  Immediately there they asked me to smile and to raise my eyebrows and they treated for &#34;possible&#34; stroke.

                                                About 30 seconds after receiving my injection I started to feel dizzy, nauseous, blurry vision and a few minutes later my lips and fingertips became tingly and numb.  My cousin let an attendant know and they sent a Paramedic over to our vehicle.  The Paramedic took my vitals (which I believe were all normal) and gave me a bag in case I needed to vomit.  I started to feel a little better about 20 minutes after the injection and chose to go home and rest rather than go to the hospital.  The 2nd day my arm hurt where to injection was given, I had a headache and was still a bit nauseous although I never did vomit.  I still did not feel 100% on the 3rd and 4th day and better on the 5th day.

                                                On 4-18-21, 17 days after 1st dose of Moderna, he developed upper abdomen pain, chest discomfort. He thought it was indigestion and treated it as such. When he got no relief he went to Emergency room where a cardiac alert was initiated. After he died I was told he had developed myocarditis,/pericarditis and they had to remove a liter of blood from the sac around his heart, but that his heart had gone into cardiogenic shock and that he died. They were prepared to insert a stint thinking he had a blocked coronary artery, but his arteries were clear and they had no idea what had caused this to happen.  When he died so soon after the vaccine there were people who wanted to blame the vaccine but I checked into it and there were NO links between the vaccine and myocarditis, pericarditis or cardiogenic shock.  Within a few weeks of his death, there began to be possible links between the vaccine and myocarditis. I know 55 is older than what is being looked at, but he had absolutely no previous cardiac history prior to this and this case should e looked at as well

I did not note the exact time a day because I thought it would just clear up. My stuffy hearing has been constant since roughly 05/18/2021. Also, I have had a constant bloated upset stomach during roughly that same timeframe. Again, thinking it would go away but has not.

Also, my entire left arm looked a bit red, but no hives. It went away as quickly as it occurred. Approximately 30 minutes after that, I experienced nausea again( which was a bit more intense). It also lasted for approximately 1 minute then it quickly ceased. At 4pm (5 hours after the shot), I got a severe headache. I&#39;m not sure if that was related to the vaccine. I took acetaminophen and slept soundly through the night. The next day, I felt fine, and I have felt fine since.

                                                I got the shot at 3pm. I started feeling &#34;off&#34; in stomach/chest around 7-8pm. By 3am, my stomach/chest did not feel good at all and I had trouble sleeping. It was definitely not heart related. By 8am I felt chills coming on. By 9am I was fully dressed, with two blankets on, and lying on couch shaking for 20-30 minutes. Later a fever started and it reached about 102.3 before subsiding late afternoon. By 8pm, I felt blah but fever was gone. During that entire time I felt achy overall (similar to what I felt like 2 hours after running a marathon).  I didn&#39;t have headaches (and rarely do), but area around my eyes were heavy and tired. Weirdly, at times, the top 1/2 of both ears hurt.   I experience about every symptom I had as when I had Covid and went to hospital for 26 days except for the breathing issues.

Abdominal pain came that seemed to be coming from the region of my liver and I had been having some problem with that previously (in a mild way) and the injection seemed to make this flare up more. About 4 days after injection, I went to ER and they did blood test and liver tests. And over time it seemed to resolved itself in a few days. The pain in my SI joint flared up about 24 hours after the injection - the extreme pain lasted for about 24 hours and then it slowly tapered off after a couple of days.

                                                A severe, dull ache resulted at the vaccination site yesterday several hours after vaccination and radiated down my are, up my neck, and down my back. 1000MG of Tylenal helped, but the ache remains. The arm is swollen, warm to the touch, and black and blue. Today I have a mild fever, some hot flashes, nausea without vomiting, body weakness, and overall muscle aching. This is the sickest I&#39;ve been in years.

                                                Pain in arm grew, and encountered body aches &amp; heighten back pain (had some over previous days).  Restless sleep. In morning I was overcome with sweats, and was ?sick? with all these symptoms most the rest of the day ? despite taking it easy and taking Tylenol   After an early dinner Friday evening, I went to bed for the next 12 hours,  Though I woke up a few times all sweaty during that stretch, by morning I was feeling pretty normal.  So, I figure my body was under duress for  30-33 hours.  Although I didn?t feel real bad for some 12 hours after injection, I did encounter some indigestion starting a few hours after the shot.

The most troubling adverse reactions have appeared in the last two days, five days after receiving the vaccination. Those reactions include the following: vertigo, general feeling of unsteadiness, nausea, visual focusing issues, mental focusing issues, and weakness that is mainly in my arms and legs.

From my research, this did not seem like a typical side effect.    I had trouble sleeping, eating and swallowing without pain.  This is now 8 days after my shot and I still have pain.  I have taken motrin and this has helped, but only some.  As of today, my pain is not as bad as it had developed over the past week.  I reported this to my healthcare provider via a call first and all their only recommendation was to take motrin and not come in for a visit / investigation for 2 weeks which I did not agree with at all based on the severity.  These symptoms that I am reporting do not seem common and based on the severity I really question if i plan to take the second dose.  I really felt that this needed to be reported

Irregular Bowel movement, abdominal pain - come and goes, not fully recovered at time of writing. There was no constipation (in sense of difficulty to pass stool) but no bowel movement either, only pain.  Treatment: after 24 hours start taking pain killers (Tylenol night, Aleve). Hot bath helped with back pain and abdominal pain. Laxative (Bisacodyle)  helped with Bowel movement, and relieved pain - but took long time and unknown if back to normal. Now on liquid diet (water,clear  soup, tea with sugar)  to allow to rest a bit, seems more comfortable at the moment.

I have been sick with these same symptoms since then and I am 6 day&#39;s past the vaccination. My second vaccination dose was on the 21st of may. My first dose was on the 7th of May and I was extremely sore with the first dose but, I did not have any of these other symptoms. I have autoimmune diseases and have been told by a couple different doctor&#39;s that several other people with autoimmune diseases are reporting the same things.

I was sent home with a drain where I continue to experience pain in the lower right portion of my abdomen. As of today, June 16, 2021, i continue to experience some pain around where the gallbladder was removed and it continues to drain.

                                                adverse effects started about 6 hours after the injection for the 2nd shot. The adverse reaction to the 1st shot was the normal tired, arm sore, chills and upset stomach stomach. After the 2nd shot the adverse effect started with feeling like my nighttime meds were wearing off from the night before about 3-4 hours earlier than normal. I would get these antsy type feelings running thru both my arms and up and down my legs. Just a constant need to be moving. I took my meds early and things settled down closer to normal. The next day was even worse and its stayed at about the 16-20 hour medicine efficacy instead of the normal 24-28 hour normal efficacy. This has continued since the shot 6 days. I&#39;ve also had a nagging headache fir the last 4 days along with an upset stomach for 2 days. Since the 2nd shot I&#39;ve also had nightmares every night where I&#39;m startled awake and I usually do not have dreams/nightmares. And just an overall feeling of exhaustion.

I had nausea before, but it got worse after the vaccination. I still have a little bit of nausea but I&#39;m taking pills for acid reflux, 1 daily pill of Dexilant, which appears to be working. I had nausea periodically before the vaccination, but afterwards it was pretty much every day of not feeling good.

By 9 30pm I was nauseous and full blow stomach pain.  My stomach was &#39;roiling or churning.&#39;   Then between 9 30pm and 2 30am the next day I was nauseous, had stomach pain, I felt hot and cold and my head became more congested and I got a headache.  Note: the head congestion was there prior to getting the vaccine, but it got worse.   I sipped water throughout and it felt like I had to vomit (but I did not vomit).   I took my temperature a few times it ranged from 98 to 98.8.   My normal temperature is 97 to 97.5.   By morning, or about 4am the worse symptoms were gone.  My stomach felt more or less ok and at 7am  I ate a light breakfast without incident.   My temperature seemed to be elevated through the day.  I felt somewhat weak during the day.  Worst effects seem gone by Jan 8 evening.   The only effect left is pain in my left upper arm.  I consider these to be significant and worrying side effects and I may not take the second dose.

                                                12 hours after began to have a scratch throat.  at 13 hours post dose, had a headache start and an unusual erythematous spot on the posterior palate above Uvula with almost a white scratch appearance inside the erythema.  16 hours post dose began to have fevers and chills.  At 17 hours had severe sweats that soaked the bed with rigorous chills including teeth chattering shaking chills.  Took 800mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep.  Poor sleep with many awakenings.  Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

                                                Had injection late Friday afternoon (2/12/21). After going to bed that night, started feeling extreme body aches, chills, nausea, dizziness, with fever (101 temperature). According,  my heart rate went up dramatically overnight and was elevated all day on Saturday (showing 3 hours 16 minutes in exercise zone doing 19 minutes cardio and 2 hours 57 minutes fat burn although I was in bed all day).  It is important to note that on December 26th I tested Positive for Covid. I work for Health Care Agency and have been working at with option for Vaccine.

                                                On Monday night I tossed and turned, and I gradually realized I felt quite ill. By Tuesday morning I had what I understand to be typical reactions to the second dose: soreness at the injection site, fatigue, muscle aches, chills, overheating, loss of taste, and a touch of nausea. My head was swimming, and putting my hands to my forehead made my head feel a bit better. By midday Wednesday I was gradually improving. But Wednesday evening, at my desk, I noticed my vision seemed blurry. On Thursday morning, I verified that my reading vision (with glasses) was (and is) markedly worse. Now I cannot easily read from my smart phone or computer screen. I plan to see an optometrist as soon as possible.

The pain worsened over the next 2 days and the patient avoided food as a precaution and contacted primary care physician at clinic for advice. Physician advised to monitor pain and ability to eat, and if it became excruciating or persistent to seek emergency medical attention. The patient was again able to eat on the 3rd day (6th day after vaccine) and the pain slowly subsided.

By the time  I had arrived at the house my head was pounding.   I was feeling  a dizzying  migraine.  I have not had one of those in a  while.  It was also accompanied with lite nausea.  I had a cup of coffee when I came home and went to bed.  I was feeling so bad I had to get up  and take a Sumatriptan and another cup of coffee.  I laid back down for a few more hours.  I awakened later,  used the restroom  and was feeling much better than before.   Although my arm and shoulder is sore at the injection site,  I?m feeling much better.

Now, 5 days later, I&#39;m still nauseous and dizzy during the day. My ears are full (especially my left ear) and I can&#39;t lay on my left side without experiencing vertigo.

                                                Patient has a history of getting vaccinations from us over the years never with any issues. The only allergy he has history of is contrast dye (anaphylaxis). Patient stated he was feeling well today, no symptoms. Patient was upset and worked up about his insurance stating he has no coverage right now. Patient was administered his vaccine at approximately 12:45p. At about 12:53p patient started saying he was feeling nauseous and felt like he was going to throw up. We handed him a bag. He stood up and started to walk away. We were able to get him to sit down and stay in the pharmacy area, he refused to lie down. Patient&#39;s wife asked for water for him, but we told her we were unable to give him water. He was burping and dry heaving but not actually throwing up. This went on for about 5 minutes. I measured his blood pressure at 12:58p and it was 142/76, pulse 73. He was offered ice pack, and to lie down once again. All of which was refused. He verified he was not having any swelling of his face, lips tongue, throat, no difficultly breathing. We also called for store management to come to pharmacy. He and wife stated that he is on an antibiotic for diverticulitis which causes him to do this frequently/daily where he burps up air and dry heaves, but because he hadn&#39;t eaten today he was not actually throwing up. Also because of his history of gastric bypass he usually is unable to throw up because there&#39;s nothing in his stomach. She states he was doing this same exact thing all morning (yet stated he was feeling fine before administering the vaccine). Patient and wife did not think that it was related to the vaccine at all. He stopped burping and dry heaving and by 1:18p he wanted to leave the pharmacy. Management wanted to ask him questions for their reporting but he stated he was feeling fine and did not want to stay any longer. Before the patient left, I offered for us to call 911 if patient wanted us to (although symptoms and how patient was acting did not require us to do so). I called patient at 3:20p and he stated he was feeling well and did not throw up. He said ate something after leaving here which made him feel much better, he just has a slight headache now.  I will check in with him again tomorrow.

It didn&#39;t happen even once before the second shot. It doesn&#39;t seem to matter whether I took a probiotic on that day or not, whether I have an empty or full stomach, or anything else I can figure out. It&#39;s just a typical stomach ache.

                                                After receiving his second Moderna Vaccine the patient developed severe muscle cramps, metallic taste, agitation/loss of sleep, and stomach upset. He noticed an increase in stooling after eating, however stools were solid. The muscle cramps and mood changes mostly subsided after 7 days, however on day 8 (5/27/21) he was still experiencing taste changes, gi upset, and was having difficulty sleeping. I guided the patient on some symptom relieve and instructed him to contact the pharmacy or his doctor if the symptoms worsened or did not resolve within another 7 days. He felt he was on his way to the symptoms improving and would report any changes.

Each day the pain got a little worse and started stretching to my chest. My chest and heart were uncomfortable. My wife was having the same symptoms so we just tried to manage through the pain. One April 28, the pain was so severe it woke me up in the middle of the night. I took some antacids and that seemed to help. The next 3 days the pain was on and off until May 1 evening, the pain was so severe and I was vomiting that we decided to go to the hospital. It was determined that I had a heart attack.

The next day, he began to have what appeared to be petechial hemorrhaging in his abdomen. By Sunday, the hemorrhaging had spread from his neck to his knees.  On Monday, he saw his primary care physician, who sent him to hospital ER. After performing extensive tests, the ER doctor stated that the test results were normal, and he could find no reason for most of his body being purple. By Tuesday, he was returning to normal.  The abdominal pain was gone by Tuesday as well.

Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.

I called my family doctor and he informed me there was a stomach bug going around.   I wanted to submit this report just in case others had the same issue and weren&#39;t from this area experiencing this stomach bug.  Just about recovered, probably will feel completely well by tomorrow.

I even sent an email to to my doctor?s office in the afternoon, - at that time the temp was like 102.2 or so.  But it shot up again in the night.  The fever continued on Friday and I still have chills on Saturday I.e. March 27th 2021 and as I write this.  I also felt nautica first two days.  I have been having headaches  also. I was diagnosed with slow heart rate I.e. 43 beats per minute (I forgot to put this in the long term conditions).  I am worried about the second dose as I reading it is the second dose that causes fever in people, not the 1st dose.  I hope I recover over the weekend.

                                                I had only a sore arm with shot 1. The second, caused issues 6 hours later, giving me severe chills and fever.  Loss of appetite, Sensitive to bright light, Pain behind eyes, I felt dizzy &amp; felt  like I had the flu. Over a 3 day period, it subsided. On the 4th of April I was still dizzy/ lightheaded/ Had vertigo? As of today, 4/16/21 after seeing my GP, I still have this problem along with a very sore stiff neck. The shot and this problem may be unrelated, but it started during the worst of the side effects.

Those symptoms lasted approx 3 days.  Two days after the vaccination I also became extremely nauseous.  I was anticipating all of these symptoms.  On the 3rd and 4th days after the vaccine most of the symptoms disappeared but I received some new ones that I was not expecting.  I suddenly felt a large amount of despair and hopelessness.  I had suicidal thoughts.  I had panic attacks and anxiety.  I had paranoia.  I did not feel like I had long to live, or anything to live for.  By 20 Apr all of these emotional and mental side effects were completely gone.

He says it could be due to synthroid discontinuation which he stopped taking one year ago but started back the morning of 4/21/21 to see if that is what is the cause.

Seems too coincidental for 2 people in the same family (with in a month of each other)  to have this happen in the second week after the vaccine.

This is similar to what I experience with milk or small amounts of cheese. This lasted about 20 minutes and subsided over the next 15 min. Stayed at the facility a total of an hour to be sure.

                                                Received my second shot on the late morning of yesterday (Thursday).  My arm was getting pretty sore by the time I went to bed (I could not sleep on my left side).  When I woke up, started feeling fuzzy and got the chills.  Took three 325 mg Acetaminophen in the morning.  Was running a low grade fever by lunch time (99.9 degrees) and was feeling like I had the flu.  Joints are sore, head still fuzzy, feel a little light headed when I move around too much.  Took three more 325 Acetaminophen after lunch.  No appetite, stomach feels queasy.  Tired but can&#39;t sleep.  Intend to take more acetaminophen this evening before bed.  Hopefully tomorrow my symptoms will start to go away.

I feel loopy and feverish. She noticed and took my temperature when she came home. I was napping on the  couch and didn&#39;t know I had a fever until she checked.

                                                I had a fever of 102.1 for hours and the chills. Vomiting and no apatite all day. The head ache made it hard to focus and walking felt unstable. The body aches all over my body and every joint hurt.  This second dose was worse than the first with the head ache and stability issues.  The symptom&#39;s were like back in Oct 2020 when I had covid19.  This time I didn&#39;t go to an urgent care like I did when I had the first Moderna covid19 vaccine since I kind of knew this would happen.

                                                Same day as 1st vaccine shot I started getting nauseous after dinner. The next morning I woke up with dizziness, nausea, and muffled hearing in my left ear. The 2nd morning after the vaccine shot my left ear was almost completely muffled and the sounds I did hear were frequency distorted to the point I could not understand verbal speech from that ear. During the course of that day my right ear started getting muffled also. The night between the 2nd and 3rd day after the vaccine shot I woke up around 2 am with a severe case of vertigo while laying flat on my back in bed. I immediately felt hot all over and my entire body started sweating. I attempted to do an Epley maneuver with partial success. I eventually got up and took a Zertec-D and tried a second Epley maneuver on the floor in the living room. I was not able to go back to sleep and I made it through the day and the next night by taking another Zertec-D before bedtime.  The 4th day after the vaccine shot I did not take any medications and just stayed in bed or in a recliner all day. The night between the 4th and 5th day after the shot I again woke up around 3am with the worst vertigo ever and by 6am I told my wife I needed to go to the hospital. During the whole time the dizziness and nausea never abated. I was checked into Hospital on the morning of the 5th day after taking the vaccine shot and was transported to  in  for an MRI.

The episodes have lessen as far as the heart palpitations. I spoke with the telephone triage nurse at the hospital and was told to report to the nearest ER and I did. The ER Doctor said that he couldn&#39;t rule it in or out that the symptoms were brought on by the vaccine. He consulted the records that were sent from the hospital and some follow up was set up. All medical records were sent back to the hospital to have them follow up on my symptoms.

                                                General Side effects: fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea and fever. I have experienced all these side effects every day for the last 10 days. Additional side effects are: Sweating profusely every night. Not being able to sleep very well nearly every night. Stomach upset if I eat or if I do not eat. I am only able to eat very bland food since anything else upsets my stomach. I can not drink carbonated beverages since they upset my stomach. As of yesterday I started getting little red sores on my back. This morning it moved to my chest in addition to my back.

                                                On Monday, March 9th, I tested positive for the COVID antibodies and believe it was linked to an illness that I experienced last fall (COVID test was not administered at that time).  Approximately 16 hours after receiving the first injection of COVID-19 MODERNA I began to experience joint pain/stiffness, muscle soreness,  headaches, nausea, chills, sweats, malaise, heart racing, numbness to the fingers on my left hand, etc.  I became progressively worse until become bed ridden at 5:15 pm on Thursday, March 11th.  I remained bed ridden with symptoms becoming progressively worse until Friday evening, March 12th.  At that point, my condition began to improve.  I began to feel somewhat better by mid-morning on Saturday, March 13th.  My condition finally improved to ~90% by Monday, March 15th, with lingering muscle soreness and loss of feeling to the fingers on my left hand remaining.

Of interest, my girlfriend who also received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on the same date, time and location, was awaken at approximately 2:00 AM with the same rapid onset of diarrhea.  On the second day following the vaccine, we both had elevated temperatures of 101.5 and 102 lasting approximately 24 hours.

                                                The day of the shot, we noticed significant swelling in my neck on the right of center.  The swelling has maintained its size for now six weeks and one day.  I have a dull numbness in my 2-3 smaller toes of my left foot.  Sometimes I feel this numbness in my right foot, but not always.  My left arm and two smallest fingers also feel funny.  There is a dull pain in my left arm and dull numbness in my left smaller fingers.  The outside of my left leg also at times shares this numb feeling.  On the day I got the shot I immediately felt like I had a dose of caffeine, though that feeling passed after a couple of hours.  It did not feel significant enough to keep me from driving or leaving the facility, but it was noticeable. I experienced diarrhea for about a week and a half. For the first week after the shot I alternated nights of not being able to stay still sleeping, keeping me awake almost the entire night, 3 of the first 6 nights.  I visited my family doctor within one week of the first shot.  He advised me not to get the second shot and made note of the swelling in my neck. I visited him at five weeks because the swelling in my neck and numb feeling has not changed.  He scheduled a CT Scan which has been scheduled.

I started a diarrhea medication about 5 hours after onset of symptoms and that has helped.   Waiting for a response from my primary care physician to determine which medicine I should to (as a diabetic) if the symptoms continue.

                                                Approximately 2-3 hours after getting shot I started to feel flush my temperature was slightly higher than my normal at 98.9 (my normal is about 97.7). I also felt a little tired, I work 2nd shift so I went to work as normal. About 4 or 5pm the fatigue started to worsen and it was difficult to do my job I also felt nauseous, I struggled to finish my shift because of the fatigue. When I came home at 11pm I went straight to bed. When I awoke in the morning the fatigue was worse and it was difficult to stay awake but the nausea had passed. I was extremely tired all day until about 8pm or so when the fatigue started to lessen. By the next morning I was still a little tired but I could resume my normal schedule although I felt like I didn&#39;t get a good nights sleep. By Saturday morning (20th) I was not feeling any adverse effects.  I have sleep apnea which I forgot to list on medical conditions and I can&#39;t go backwards on the form so I am including it here.

                                                I had common side effects including fever of 102.7, joint pain, body aches, headache, stomach pain  from the evening of 4/3/21 until today, 4/6/21. The fever has fluctuated from no fever to102.7, to lower grade 99.1 to 100.5 to no fever to lower grade, 99.1 over the course of that time. The reason for my VAERS report is the major rash that I developed on the evening of 4/5/21 that covers my entire back, my chest, and up to the first two inches of my neck. I contacted my physician practice right away, and recommended that I take Benadryl every few hours. This morning, the surface area of the rash remains the same as yesterday, but is a much lighter hue. Yesterday was deep red and felt very hot. Today, is more of a pinkish red. Today my back feels as if I have a bad sunburn. Clothing touching my back causes a discomfort similar to sunburn. Parts of my back also now have white dryness lines/wrinkles.

                                                In a nutshell, patient was fine, got the first shot of the Moderna Vaccine on 3/24/21, then began to exhibit many covid-like symptoms starting around 4 hours later but 3 times nasal swap tested negative for COVID19 including before and after vaccination. Suffered with various attempts at treatments and tests for approximately a month and then was admitted to the ER at hospital on 4/28/21.  Wife (former smoker who lives in same house and has lung problems) who took the vaccine at the same time from the same lot suffered minor arm pain, aches and pains and fatigue but was fine the next day.  Patient (59) had normal blood pressure and clear lungs in good health, non-smoker, good weight, exercises regularly and strenuously, good diet, rarely gets ill. He works as a ship?s captain and engineer and has worked in boatyards for years doing physical work. Has tintinnitis and in one eye, glaucoma drops but is on no other prescription medicines. Details: March: had nasal congestion, cough and suspected bronchitis, aches and pains, no fever, PCR tested negative for COVID19, and was treated with antibiotics (azithromycin and then a run of amoxycillin), proair, advair discuss a couple of days, various vitamins/minerals, over the counter cold/flu medicines. Seemed to work with most symptoms going away prior to Marcch 24, 2021. March 24, 2021 morning: Got first shot of the Moderna Vaccine at pharmacy. Lot 045A21A at same time as spouse. That morning had no cough and felt ok. Approximately 4 hours later, patient started to cough, felt congested, felt like flu/pneumonia, trouble breathing, aches and pains especially in joints, extreme fatigue, headache, (but suffered no loss of taste or smell throughout 3/24-present) took Theraflu and went to bed early, slept well. Following days, struggled with intensifying symptoms. Felt like the vaccine gave him covid symptoms without the loss of smell/taste.  Spouse experienced minor pain at point of injection, some fatigue, aches and pains which went away by end of next day 3/25/21. Spouse had some lingering cough left over from earlier bronchitis before getting the vaccine which cough/congested breathing continued with no noticeable change. [Spouse was also not adversely impacted by the second shot of Moderna vaccine a month later.) Apr Wk1 &amp; Wk2: Increasing difficulty sleeping due to lung congestion or suddenly waking up wide awake for no reason. At end of Wk2, had some minor tremors in muscles for a couple of days. Suffered from extreme fatigue, congestion, trouble breathing, nightmares, aches and pains. Took azithromycin run then a run of amoxicillin, proair, prednisone, albuterol nebulizer, occasional Theraflu or over-the-counter cold/flu medicines, vitamins/minerals (including heavier doses of Vitamin D, Zinc, C, etc.), probiotic acidophilus, tonic water with quinine or Perrier, melatonin 10mg and magnesium 500mg at night, occasionally a Unisom sleeping pill. Started to lose appetite where rarely hungry. Would force himself to eat anyway, but occasionally vomited it up. Apr Wk3 4/13/21: Patient got another PCR covid test which was negative, chest xray, blood work done at Urgent Care. Showed some elevated liver/kidney enzymes and low red blood cell count/anemia, vague thickening of the plura, swollen lymphnode in the chest xray, no sign of cardiovascular issue. (Some yellow flags but nothing flashing red.) Dr. recommended followup tests and bloodwork and that he get GI/Cardio/pulmonary workups w/specialists. Patient continued to take antibiotics, pregnizone, albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals, and occasional cold/flu/cough medicines, etc. Added SuperB Complex. One day he had hot/cold chills for a few hours. Apr Wk4: While lungs felt clearer, still coughing and now occasionally vomiting productively or dry heaves, insomnia grew into bigger issue with hallucinations not just with nightmares but occasionally during the day where it was difficult to separate reality from dream, trouble remembering, started to feel paranoid/irrational sometimes, trouble sleeping was not due to lung congestion but more due to panic-attack like heavy breathing or sudden central chest/sternum pain (maybe from coughs), aches in joints, but biggest problem was extreme fatigue and tiring when walking up a flight of stairs, etc. Took some Tramadol occasionally for pain relief (but never with aspirin, Tylenol or cold medicine). Could be sitting comfortably watching a mellow tv program but suddenly need to breathe really heavy, hyperventilating and felt need to standup and walk around until it eased. Extreme trouble sleeping. Most comfortable position was kneeling with body bent over a pillow on the bed. [He&#39;d never had panic-attacks/heavy breathing issues before the Moderna shot and doesn&#39;t abuse substances.] Wk5: 4/24/21 feet swelled up and turned purple on the soles. Went for a walk around the block and raised feet. No longer on antibiotics or pregnizone, only taking the albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals/probiotics, melatonin and a OTC cough/flu medicine before bed. Knelt for hours while trying to sleep. 4/25/21, feet more swollen with fluid and more discolored. When searched online, they looked like &#34;covid toes&#34;. Took no medicines except nebulizer and took only a couple of vitamins/calcium-vitaminD and before bed a beer, melatonin, magnesium &amp; nyquil. 4/26/21, feet less swollen and no longer purple except a small line on the side of one foot. Patient indicated he had not knelt when trying to sleep prone during night. But only got a couple of hours of sleep, nighttime hallucinations and panic-breathing attacks. Daytime inability to focus, extreme fatigue, aches and pains, quick to tire on any exertion, vomiting food or dry heaves 2 or 3 times that day, panic-like-attacks with need to heavy breathe/hyperventilate. Wheezing with occasional rattle at end. Coughs sometimes productive, sometimes not but lungs didn?t feel very congested and oxygenation/blood pressure was good. 4/27/21, went to work in morning and was able to perform but very tired. In early afternoon, came home, ate, took nyquil and nebulizer and tried to sleep. 4/28/21, felt much worse, feet and knees swollen, extreme exhaustion, felt miserable. Went to work anyway. Came home around 2pm, ate. Felt much worse so we went to the ER at Hospital. Spouse provided MMC with his medical conditions, medicines, the info on COVID IGG serology test and informed them of the chest xrays and bloodwork that had been done at the Urgent Care center 2 weeks prior. ER indicated he needed to stay overnight and they performed additional bloodwork, xrays, scans and MRIs. The ER doctor called in specialists in Nephrology and Cardiology to provide consultations.

                                                12 Hours after vaccine pain in left arm 15 hours after vaccine, fever started and lasted on and off for two days.  Reached 102 and did not drop below 101 even using Tylenol or Ibuprofen. On day two fever went down but at about 36-48 hours went back up to 99.5 until finally going away after 48 hours. During the first 48 hours experienced body chills, fatigue, some nausea, body aches, some joint shooting pain randomly, headache. On days 2-3 started developing a hot red painful patch about 2 inches below the shot location. On day 4 it is light pink and almost gone, the pain has localized in one spot which seems to have some swelling under the skin (not the actual shot location).   Item 20 asks if there has been recovery.  That&#39;s not a yes/no answer as most symptoms have gone away, but the lingering pain and patch are still there, but seem to be getting better by the day.

After about 9 hours from getting the shot I got a headache that turned in to the worst migraine I&#39;ve ever had in my life that lasted over 30 hours. I had a fever that ranged from 101F to 103F that has lasted for more than 30 hours, I also developed severe muscle and joint pain so much so that I could only get out of bed to go to the bathroom and that was with great pain. I also have had nausea that has lasted over 36 hours. I took Tylenol (1000mg) every few hours, 4 times with out relief. I also took a Tramadol which helped a little with the pain but then my fever spiked for a few hours. I&#39;m now on day 2 of bed rest and waiting for the symptoms to subside so I can get back to my regular life.

They tested for flu, covid and a full blood work and an MRI. 4 days prior to the vaccine my platelet count was 253000 and three days after the vaccine was 45000 and it continued to drop the next few days. My immune system destroyed my blood platelets. They gave me dexametasone, steroids for 4 days.

With in 2-3 weeks increase abdominal pain, and discomfort, I thought it was a Crohn?s flair, so I just tried to wait it out.  Early April I went to the ED, for eval and treatment , it was discovered via CT of abdomen I developed Portal Vein Thrombosis, admitted for anti coagulation, and further studies like JAK 2. Place on heparin, followed by lovonox SQ injections, and bridged to Pradaxa.  Symptoms returned after a couple of weeks, and persisted, ,back tp the hospital new CZt scans, showed increase in Portal vein thrombosis, but now included splenic vein thrombosis, and mesenteric vein thrombosis.  Went back on anticoagulation therapy, transferred to  hospital for Intervention Radiology procedure to have a portal vein shunt placed in, and thrombectomy of the spleen, and mesenteric veins. Had bleeding issues, returned to OR for a second IR procedure, and finally a 3rd procedure of splenectomy, blood transfusion for hemorrhagic shock.  Discharged on warfarin, and lovonox as needed

On 6/5, I developed a 5? x 5? irritated red patch on my injection arm. On 6/6 I awoke to no fever. I then noticed sores in my mouth and busies on my abdomen, left leg and left foot. I went to urgent care. They ran a CBC. My platelet count was down 30% since ,my last test a few months ago. My average was about 180,000 for the last 6 years. My test number was 127,000.  I have no history of a low platelet count. This appeared within days of the 2nd vaccination along with the sores and spontaneous bruising. A CAT and v,MRI were performed that same day. Those tests were normal.

Patient had steady small sized lesions scattered in his body (less than 10 total) prior to new eruption after receiving the vaccine. Currently more than 10 new lesions are identified, ranging from 2mm to &lt;1cm in diameter, through out his trunk and four limbs with no significant pattern. These lesions cause mild pain/tenderness. No bleeding episode. It is unknown if patient has mucosal surface lesion, but so far no symptom/sign of blood loss. Due to these findings after the vaccine, patient was advised not to receive the second dose of Moderna COVID19 vaccine.

                                                After the shot I had a sore arm, constant chronic headache, fatigue, head aches, muscle aches. Several weeks after, in 03/07/2021 I started to have total loss of hearing in my left ear, and ringing in both ears. I went to the ER. After going to another ear doctor I have 40 % loss of hearing in my left ear and ringing in both. I have acid reflux and I could not eat anything because I would throw up. They did an upper GI and turns out I have a small  hernia and they gave me Pantoprazole. I go back to the stomach doctor this month and to the ear doctor on October. I still have no taste or smell since 11/19/2021.
