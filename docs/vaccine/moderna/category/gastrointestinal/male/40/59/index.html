                                                I received the vaccine 30 min. prior to starting my shift as a Nurse in the ED. About 1 hour after receiving the shot while standing I felt off balance and began to have a vertigo like dizziness. I sat down and tried to drink some water but began spitting the water back up and dry heaving after trying to drink. I did not feel nauseous if I was not drinking. I did feel the sensation of a slight lump in my throat. I did not have any shortness of breath, tachycardia,  rash or fever. I did not want to check in as a patient so I called my wife to come and pick me up from work. Before I left I had the pharmacy send me some Pepcid and Benadryl and I took 25mg of Benadryl and 20mg of Pepcid before leaving. I left work around 1400 and now at 1500 I am able to drink fluids. The slight lump in my throat seems to have improved. I still feel a little dizzy and off balance.

She would like to try fluids at this time.  Assuming toleration we will plan on discharge home.  2326 Reevaluation: Patient feels improved.  Headache essentially gone.  Taking p.o. fluids well.  Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

He pulled over and threw up. Once he got to work he vomited again. He drove to another facility for work and then threw up 3 or 4 more times. He began experiencing hot flashes at this time. He went to the hospital and was seen in the emergency room. He threw up several more times in the ER and stated that his heart was racing and that he had diarrhea. The emergency room gave him medications for the nausea and he stayed there for 2 or 3 hours. He began to feel better and was discharged to home.

                                                Around noon, my fiance doubled over in agonising pain and clutched his right side. We treated it like a stomach ache and he went through the rest of the day, even at work, in gut wrenching pain. This morning when I woke up, I noticed he was out on the couch. When I went to check on him, he was as white as a ghost and his lips were greying around the edges. I immediately told him to call into work. I thought he would say no because he has not called in in over 10 years, but to my surprise, he did so. I put him in bed and the abdominal pain is still present and now his fever is over 103!!!  I bought Tylenol and Motrin and will be alternating between the two until the fever breaks and if the pain persists by 8 pm, we will be headed to the emergency room...

Then around 8am I started to have chills which then I checked my temp and it was 101.0 degrees F. Then I started to get a headache and severe body aches. Around 3pm I tried to eat something which I then threw it up. I tried to drink water and flavored water which I also threw up the water. I also went into the bathtub 7 times that day to stop the chills. Which it did but right when I got out they started again which then I felt worse. Around 11pm 1/23/2021 I ended up going into the ER which then they gave me IV fluids and then Benadryl and Toradol by IV. After those were administered I started feeling better which then I was discharged and went home.

Feel back to sleep around 01:00 and awoke again at 03:30 restless and stiff. Unable to fall asleep. Soreness in back and shoulders began to increase with mild headache. Fatigue began to set in and feel asleep at approximately 07:00 on Feb 3. Work up to chills, muscle soreness throughout, no appetite or desire to drink, and extreme headache at 10:30. Restless periods of sleep while fighting body aches and chills continue through the entire day. Waking periods for remainder of the day occurred between 10:30 - 11:30, 12:30 - 15:00, and 14:00-18:30. Suffered from intense headache, muscle stiffness, no appetite, and chills during all of the waking periods.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving my injection, I began experiencing a slight and almost undetectable headache which persisted throughout the remainder of the day.  At 3 AM the following morning, I awoke with a bad headache and body aches, unable to sleep.  The headache and body aches persisted throughout the day (2/5) and evening.  On 2/6, the body aches had subsided and only a slight headache was present, although gastrointestinal issues were present the entire day.  On 2/7, gastrointestinal issues (GI) subsided, but the headache persisted and became worst that evening, especially at the base of the neck.  On 2/8, slight GI issues, no body aches, and slight headache persist.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

Patient was transferred into wheelchair and brought into an examination room with provider NP. Provider and staff collected vitals, blood sugars, and HPI. Patient reported he &#34;felt like he was going to pass out&#34; but did not actually syncopize. Patient was with staff for well over one hour for observation, and symptoms resolved within 15 minutes of the initial onset without intervention. It was deemed likely vasovagal response by the provider.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

                                                Around 11:30 pm that evening I started feeling extremely warm in my face and thighs. Figuring it was due to the shot, I decide to try and lay down to sleep it off. A short time later, I awoke freezing with chills and uncontrollable shivering. My whole body hurt especially my lower back and pressure in my head. This continued throughout the night until the early morning. As the shivering and chills subsided, extreme fatigue, body aches and head pressure continued and it was difficult to get up at points. I had no appetite and forced myself to drink to stay hydrated.  About 1:00 pm, I started to feel better, but that was short lived. Approximately 4:30 ? 5pm, the chills and shivering returned and I had 101 fever. I had some tea and toast and then went to bed for the night. When I awoke this morning, I felt a million times better. As of writing this email, I still have some slight fatigue, aches, and head pressure, but night and day difference from yesterday.

When I woke up at 5 Am I suffered from severe headache. Remainder of the day I had extreme digestive issues that continued over the next several days. At the conclusion of the second day I developed a fever of 101. Pinpointed severe pain developed at the base of my neck between my shoulder blades. That pain remained for approximately 24 to 48 hours that lead to extreme pain and stiff neck on my right side. Chills and periodic fever developed for two days past shot. By day three I had extreme right side neck pain that continued down into my right shoulder blade. By day four and five I suffered from extreme neck pain and severe headache that was focused from my right eye through my head down the right side of my neck to my right shoulder blade. By day 4 this continued with dizziness and blurred vision. I had inability to eat and strong feelings to vomit but only didn&#39;t because I hadn&#39;t consumed any food that day. I continued to suffer from extreme headaches and complete physical exhaustion with inability to stay away. In addition, I continued to have periodic chills but with no fever.  As I submit this in day 5 I still suffer from lack of energy and the stiff neck remains down through my right shoulder blade.

Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

The adverse events include: diarrhea, frequency, abdominal cramping, and nausea. The patient sought treatment after 2 weeks of symptoms. The physician diagnosed the patient  with infectious diarrhea and prescribed a 3-day course of Cipro 500mg BID. The symptoms improved but the patient continued to have some GI symptoms remaining. The symptoms worsened after the second dose of the vaccine series. The patient went to the doctor on March 1st and received another course of Cipro 500mg BID but for a 5 day course. The patient is currently completing the antibiotic course.

Felt as if I was injected with the Flu, based on the symptoms that arose: chills, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, fever, body aches, weakness, no appetite or desire to hydrate(every single symptom was severe) These symptoms lasted 12 hrs. I chose to go in to work, instead of taking the day off. I truly believe that because I pushed my body through this painful ordeal, it helped me to overcome this Flu-like feeling that I endured for 12 hours: 10 of those at my job. I also experienced a swelling &amp; pain in my right knee. The pain &amp; swelling is finally subsiding as I type this report 4 days after the vaccine.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma and Hyperthyroidism. Concomitant products included FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE (FLOVENT) for an unknown indication.   On 22-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out to sleep at 745 pm) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 19-Apr-2021 at 11:30 PM, the patient experienced COLD SWEAT (cold sweats), ASTHENIA (really weak), DYSSTASIA (could barely stand up) and ILLNESS (sick to his stomach). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VERTIGO (head spinning), DIZZINESS (dizzy), FATIGUE (tired), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (pain at injection site) and NAUSEA (nauseas).

                                                3 minutes after vaccination the patient began to feel a tingling and pain in his arm where the vaccine was placed.  Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.

                                                On the first day I had a huge lump underneath my armpit I did not become too concerned with that I read it was something that could happen regarding the lymph node. 10 days later I woke up at 3:30 in the morning and had to dial 911 my throat felt like it was closing and my lips were both swollen. I went in the ambulance they brought me to the emergency room where they gave me Benadryl a steroid and some IV fluids. as soon as I receive the Benadryl my throat started to open up and my lips both started to go down . My lip continue to swell for the next three days on and off often on. Every time it swelled up I took Benadryl and every time sure enough it went away . The day I came home from the hospital I thought I was doing much better until that following night I became severely nauseous. I don?t know if it was something that they had given me in the hospital or still a reaction that was going on in my body, but I had some sort of stomach bug I threw up that whole day, had chills sweats  and a pounding headache that would not go away for over 48 hours .I was unable to eat or drink for 24 hours and had to go to an urgent care where they provided me with some medication for nausea. My concern right now is I am hearing that the second shot hits a lot harder than the first one and if this was a reaction to the shot I am very afraid of what will go on if I get the second one.  I cannot take a chance with my life.  I really want to shot I work in an environment where I am working with the department  which is why I was able to get the vaccine so early I feel safe being vaccinated I am very disappointed that this happened I just cannot take a chance having a family etc. Also I have very bad medical in Sherance so I am dealing with all of the bills from this hospital stay I have a  deductible which I can?t afford and then only 50% is covered afterwards. That is the reason I do not go to the hospital under no circumstance unless I am dying which that night I was that scared I felt the need I had to go.

About midnight March 16 severe chills, restlessness, headache, muscle aches, nauseous and fever of 101.  Took two extra-strength Tylenol. 3 a.m. fever broke with sweats. Headache and body ache remained, as did chills. Took two Advil when I woke up about 7 a.m. on  March 16 for a headache. But I was too tired and achy to get out of bed. The fever came back to 102 degrees. Nauseous, couldn&#39;t eat much. Headache. At 2:30 p.m. on March 16, I felt better...  I was very tired the night of March 16 and still had a minor headache and went to bed about  8 p.m. On March 17, I was back to normal with only a very minor headache and some diahreaha that morning and afternoon.  I did not take any medicine that day. On March 18 I had no symptoms at all. I am a very healthy 42-year-old adult. I would classify my reaction as significant, but not severe. I called in sick to work (and I work from home). So it was enough to take me out of a day.

                                                On 12/24, at 8:30a I began to get nauseated  which lasted about 2hrs. Around 1am I woke  up with SOB which continued thru the night, with off and on sleep. I woke back up at 5:45am, went to work with the SOB which lasted until 12N and resolved on its own.  Around 3-330pm I began to feel feverish and had chills and was told I was disoriented.  My temp was 100.5, HR 122 R 34 BP 170/100 O2-93%. I notified the DON of my feelings who advised me those were possible side effects of the vaccine and made me continue to work until I just couldnt take the feelings anymore and went to the ER.  I was there for about 2 hrs and my body began to calm down.  I took taken 100mg of Tylenol on my own just to help with the fever which did break shortly and I have been fine every since. I was positive for COVID 12/14.

Upon moving I experienced vertigo, dizziness, headache, and extreme pressure in the left side of my face to include sinus cavities and deep inner ear pressure.  I had some episodes of loose stools, not diarrhea, but not formed stools.  These symptoms still persist to today, 1/15/2021, except for loose stool, that has returned to normal.  I had a Dr. appointment today and the doctor would not rule out post vaccine side effects. I was tested for COVID on 1/11/2021 as a precautionary measure as I was displaying symptoms, but the test result was COVID not detected.

                                                I&#39;ve lost 16 pounds in 1 month and 20 days without trying.  Moderna killed my obsession for food.  I was 268 lbs when I presented for the 1st dose of Moderna at the Robeson CRV.  Within 24 hours I was weak, cold, aching all over, and nauseous. The nausea moved over to lack of interest in food.     I&#39;ve struggled with intense craving for food non-stop for 30 years.  The cravings are gone.  By my second shot in March I was down to around 260 lbs.  Twenty days after my second shot, I am down to 252lbs.  Food is more of a necessity now rather than a constant desire.  I believe the vaccine modulated insulin/ghrelin or crossed the blood brain barrier and modulated the incessant dopamine reward signaling in the mesolimbic DA pathway when I eat food.  I reach satiety easily now.  I also have diminished need for Ativan.  I use to drink close to a gallon of water a day.  Now I have no real interest.  I might drink a couple liters a day.  To put things in perspective, before Moderna, I could eat 2 foot long Subway sandwiches, 3-6 cookies, 2-4 32 oz of soda and chips to stop my hunger for 2-3 hours.  2-3 hours later I would feel extremely hungry with a growling stomach. I could then consume 2-3 double cheeseburgers, a 20 piece nugget, 2 parfaits, and a chocolate sundae.  After Moderna, now a half a Subway sandwich and maybe a cookie are enough to last for most of the day.  The desire for food has diminished to necessity to eat and lack of interest in eating, even when my stomach is empty.  If I have a soda or sparkling water, I might have 1 or 2 and stop.  Moderna flipped some hormonal switch in my body.  It&#39;s great.  Food went from being an insatiable desire to a basic necessity.  I&#39;ve lost 16 pounds in 1 month and 20 days without trying.

I woke up the next day to go to my job and as I was standing at my closet to grab a shirt I felt like I was going to pass out. everything went black. The next thing I knew I was laying on the floor with a shirt in my hand but don&#39;t remember how I got on the floor or if I even fell.  I asked my Girlfriend if she had heard me fall, She said no. I walked into the bedroom and layed back down on the bed still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. after what felt like a few minutes, I began Heaving like I was going to throw up but I felt like it was a dream and was very slow to react until my girlfriend told me to run to the bathroom. the whole time I was coughing up a foam.

At around 9:00 AM on Saturday 4/3/2021, I was awakened by intense pain and pressure that felt like the worst heartburn I&#39;d ever experienced. After OTC heartburn treatments didn&#39;t help, at around 11:00 AM I went to the local ER where I was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack. After being given some baby aspirin and a nitro tablet, I started feeling better and was airlifted immediately to a nearby cardiology unit at another hospital. A heart catheterization and EKGs determined that I had not had a heart attack, but instead had takotsubo cardiomyopathy. I was admitted into the cardiac ICU overnight for observation, transferred to a non-critical room the next day (4/4/2021), and released on Monday 4/5/2021.

Hypotension, shakiness and mild nausea.  I&#39;ve never had this symptom in my life and have taken 3mg melatonin before bed for years.  (3mg, not 4mg as reported on the previous page).  I was back to normal after ~10 minutes and woke up perfectly normal. Also, minor shoulder pain.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

                                                After the first day there was the typical site injection pain. Three Tylenol on the next day seem to take care of that but the pain quickly moved to the Front and top of the right pelvic bone. No amount of Tylenol has seem to do anything with that pain. After a week it seem to start to migrate to the left front top pelvic bone. These symptoms were mild and I was still able to carry out my daily activities in law-enforcement.  Friday night January 22 is when I started to have pulsating pressure in the back of my head, chills, dizziness, excessive urination, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue. The symptoms have persisted through today but are starting to ease. I took a COVID-19 test on Sunday, January 24 the results came back today as Covid negative.

When I got home my temperature 100.1, I have nausea, body aches, chills. I have been coughing as well.  I contacted my primary care, they recommended to treat the symptoms and it should go away in a day or two.

EMS was called and patient refused transport to hospital. S/S resolved.

                                                An hour or so after receiving my first Moderna shot, I was aware of an unusual feeling in my lower right abdomen.  Knowing this to be a potential problem area for Appendicitis I paid attention to it for the next day and there was no change.  Two days after receiving the  vaccine shot this sensation got worse and I was visibly bloated.  I went to an Urgent Care where a doctor referred me to the closest ER due to the area of pain and bloat in my body.   After several blood tests and an MRI at the ER, it was determined that my appendix was inflamed and I was admitted to the hospital for surgery ASAP.   Luckily the appendix was stable, never burst and was successfully removed the following day in the early afternoon.   I am currently at home recovering successfully.

                                                Day after vaccine I developed sever jaundice including yellowing eyes.  One week after vaccine I had blood work done and my liver enzymes and bilirubin levels were.  On 3/23 I admitted myself to ER with jaundice and vomiting.  My liver levels were normal but bilirubin was still high.  At this point I had lost 30 pounds since my shot.   I was in the hospital for 5 days where the ran UT, CT, and MRI on my abdomen with none showing issues.   Jaundice and itchiness/jaundice got progressively worse.   The hospital ran multitude of blood tests to pin point the issue and even did a liver biopsy.  No tests showed anything abnormal but biopsy isn?t back yet.  At this point 4/1/21, I am still jaundiced, extremely itchiness, lethargy and a total of 33 pounds weigh loss.

                                                Began experiencing nausea and general stomach pains the morning after receiving the vaccine.  After one day of pain and discomfort I woke the following morning (~44hrs after receiving the vaccine) to extreme acute abdominal pain in the lower right abdomen.  Went to Urgent Care facility and was diagnosed by CT scan as having acute appendicitis.  An emergency appendectomy was scheduled and performed for later that evening.  I stayed at the Hospital overnight on 12/24/2020 post operatively on IV antibiotics to recover from the appendectomy.  Was discharged from the hospital on 12/25/2020 and have been recovering for about 10 days now with limitted activity.

The next morning I woke up with it swollen, red, warm to the touch, huge knot covering most of my upper arm. I was also nauseous and a little bit of body aches.  Later that day the area that was red also began getting hives. I massaged it, applied a warm compress, and took Benadryl. The next day it was still sore but the redness wasn?t as bad or the arm wasn?t as swollen.  Later that night the redness and warm to the touch was completely gone .

                                                I didn&#39;t have any adverse affects until 5 days after I received the vaccination. Early in the afternoon on Wednesday 1/20 I noticed that my lymph nodes in the armpit of my left arm and on the left side of my neck were swollen and sore. This worsened as the day went on. I also noticed a pimple had formed and came to a head in the exact spot of where the needle stick had been. It &#34;popped&#34; that day and a small amount material came out. My lymph nodes have remained sore and swollen since 1/20. On the 7th day after (1/22) I noticed a couple of smaller, dime sized red blotches/rash on my left shoulder and left side of my neck. I also noticed that the injection site on my left shoulder was sore, swollen and hot to touch. On the 8th day (1/23) I noticed that there were more of these dime sized red blotches/rash across both shoulders, my back and a small area in the center of my chest.  It continues to be like that as of today (1/25). On the 9th day, (1/24) starting just after noon, I began to feel poorly. Achy and just generally not very good. I had a few bouts of diarrhea throughout the afternoon. I also had a pretty strong headache when I awoke on the morning of the 24th. Today, (1/25) I awoke again with a headache although it was not as sore as yesterday. I don&#39;t feel great today, but I do feel better than I did yesterday. The rash looks the same and my lymph nodes seem to be slightly less swollen and less sore.

                                                Took vaccine in left arm late afternoon on Friday 2/12/21. The initial symptoms were only very painful muscle pain on the injected arm, and some mild body ache and mild chills for 2-3 days but nothing major. On Monday 2/15/21 was feeling very well and had nice workout in the morning , feeling energetic .  However, in the morning on Tuesday 2/16/21, I started having very strong abdominal cramps, feeling bloated, nausea, that was lasting for several hours and increasing in pain . After 5 hours of pain, I asked my wife to take me to Hospital. There I was diagnosed with Appendicitis after a Cat Scan. My appendix was inflamed and I had to go thru surgery that same day .

                                                After receiving my shot, I waited the half an hour. I felt a pinch in my head and tightness in shoulders and neck. Once I reached the parking lot I was belching ridiculously and started feeling like vomiting. Than my chest hurt.  Went back to the clinic and said I don&#39;t feel right.  They had me stand in line and wait to be re-admitted.  The nurse starting taking blood pressure and offered me water I could not swallow the tiniest amount.  My neck felt like I was being chocked. My fingers on my left arm started tingling and arm was getting slightly red and arm felt heavy. The nurse said my symptoms were happening internally.  The doctor had me remove my mask and looked at the back of my mouth. Than used a stethoscope on my chest and the back.  Asked  if I had asthma , said no. He Than requested epinephrine shot and a steroid. With in a few seconds I started feeling like I could breathe. He prescribed an epinephrine pen incase I had another episode. Two day later I had another visit online with doctor from about redness on left and right arm. Having another allergic reaction and possible site infection. Now I&#39;m taking 10 days antibiotics and allergy medicine.

                                                On 3/16/21, I noticed a rash which closely mirrors what is being described as &#34;COVID arm&#34; at the site of the injection.  This appeared after 72 hours of severe stomach pain and loose stool, combined with fatigue, dizziness, chills/hot spells and lack of appetite.  There has been no fever with any of these symptoms.  The other members of my family who live in my household (Spouse - who also has had one dose of the Moderna vaccine, and our children age 12 and 15) all experienced the same set of symptoms, except the rash at site of vaccine injection.  I thought we had all caught a stomach bug from each other, but now I wonder if my symptoms were related to the rash that I first noticed this morning.

Local soreness in the arm from the shot is still going 48 hours later otherwise all other systems have passed this morning the second day after receiving the shot.  I also tested positive for Covid on November 30, 2020 and had the same effects for 3 weeks with it then.

                                                Body aches in left shoulder, overnight nausea.  These adverse reactions are not so concerning because I have heard how commonly these are experienced. What is most concerning is that I woke up at 3:30 AM feeling nauseous and made my way to the bathroom as a result. At some point, once entering the bathroom, I lost consciousness and when regaining consciousness saw that I had pulled the entire toilet off the floor, cracking the large reservoir and breaking the lid into several pieces. Water was spraying and leaking. Fortunately, I did not suffer a bruise or cut. I am, however, concerned whether I should expect to lose consciousness again.

                                                Headache, nausea, dizziness when sleeping or laying down, or sudden movement.  Feels like everything is spinning around me. This happens few time while I was sleeping , it woke me from sleep. I used to get out the bed as I soon as eyes open but not anymore. Now when I wake up in the I spend few minutes inn the bed because if I put my feet on the floor quickly I feel like I am going to fall.  I am afraid to pickup my 2 year old daughter anymore I feel like I can drop her if I get dizzy.

Elevated blood pressure with the reading fluctuating between 147/85 - 129/87. (Normal blood pressure range for me below 120/75). BP monitored daily since 3/4/21 shows increased BP with ongoing headache affecting activities of daily life. PCP notified.

My left arm was sore and difficult to lift which is the arm I received the shot in.  Throughout the day I have continued to have a headache, body pains and developed a fever up to 101.00.  I have also felt nauseous at times and at one point threw up some of the Gatorade that I had a little while earlier.  So to summarize, all in all, I feel absolutely terrible.

I also had a metallic taste.   3.  Fortunately, the chills, body aches, and fatigue went away the second day.  However, I continued to have the metallic taste for days. 4.  Also, starting the third day and I still have a cough and tightness in my lungs.  I went into a doctor at urgent care four days after the second dose (due to a concern about the cough and tightness in my lungs).  All of my vitals were normal and they attributed to side effects from the vaccine.  Also, they gave me an inhaler. 5.  The inhaler has been somewhat helpful, but I had a consistent cough as well as  some tightness in my lungs for two weeks after the second dose.  On unusually stressful days, it was even worse. 6.   The cough has improved, but I still have it occasionally throughout the day as well as the tightness in my lungs.   7.  Finally, I continue to have the metallic taste.

Woke up with having thrown off my blankets and had to get ice packs and open windows to cool down enough to sleep, a few hours later woke up SHIVERING like I never have before.  I thought I was convulsing until I realized I could control it with my breathing. I was shivering so hard that I bit my tongue several times.  I didn&#39;t have much energy so it took several minutes before I could grab blankets and even longer before I could close the window.  I was wrapped in several layers of blankets and was still shivering until I fell asleep.  I woke up again and my blankets were soaked in my sweat.  This cycle got more and more intense until the next day.  *I&#39;ve been hospitalized with pneumonia and this felt 100 times worse. The next day, I had the worst diarrheic that I&#39;ve ever had, sudden urge.. barely made it to toilet and INSTANTLY discharged what felt like a gallon of brown liquid (it was probably less but felt pretty nasty).

Nurse called 911, and I was transported to emergency. About 1.5 hour later, my heart was even beating more quickly, and I could hardly talked and difficult to breathe. This happened when I walked to the restroom by myself and came back. After they did some medical tests, gave me medication for allergy (the doctor gave me this since he was not sure if it was my allergy reaction to the vaccines), injected 2 IV bags and rest for few hours, my blood pressure went down to about 140/9x and heart beat back to normal. I was released from ER on the next day at 4:00am.

These feelings lasted until 10pm on 1/16/21, and then I went to bed and felt better in the morning.  I was barely able to get out of bed that day (1/16) because of how sick I felt.  Besides the sick feeling,  I had bad pain at the injection site, and had a 3cm x 3cm raised red lump at the injection site.  This stayed painful for 48-60 hours, then the swelling subsided and was left with a bruise.

Tylenol and Benadryl took care of it fairly well.  Had arm pain at site of injection, like I was hit in arm with a baseball bat.  Had some gerd too but not sure if related. Tiredness started around 9 hours after the shot, but symptoms really kicked in about 12 hours after administration.  Lasted till about 46 hours after administration, at which time I woke up from overnight sleep feeling great.  Arm still sore and there might be some lingering joint pain but nothing to keep me from doing anything.

                                                The day after the injection I had a sore arm, slight headache and slight nausea. Since that time I have had a slight &#34;pressure&#34; headache almost continuously.  Today is 2/24/21, more than 6 weeks after the first shot and the symptoms have only slightly subsided. I have decided to forego the second shot until the symptoms completely disappear. I have not sought any medical care because the symptoms are not severe enough and I am hoping they will subside by themselves. If they continue for a long period I will seek medical care but my guess is there will not be a lot that can be done.

I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

                                                52 hours after the injection I started to feel chills and occasional feverish ness. I was also nauseous and threw up a few times. The were also muscle aches. The symptoms were severe enough to leave me stuck in bed. The symptoms persisted for 4 days and on the night of the 4th day I suddenly developed a persistent pain in my lower back. In the morning I went to the emergency room where I tested negative for Covid and a cat scan revealed that my body going through the side effects of the vaccine knocked a centimeter sized kidney stone loose. I was prescribed anti inflammatories and anti nausea meds and told to follow up with a urologist.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

I was still a little sore in lower back the day after the shot and was tired by the end of my work day.  3rd day back to normal.

Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

                                                Upon waking up felt cold sweat, nauseated and became dizzy. Within 5 min from leaving the bed I lost consciousness for 2-3minutes. Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

Symptoms began approximately 24 hours after receiving the second vaccine, and gradually subsided over the following 24 hours, with only moderate diarrhea, heart palpitations, and fatigue remaining. It was by far the worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to a vaccine The only side effects after the first vaccine were moderate fatigue the evening of the vaccine and moderate arm pain.

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event.    On 13-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 13-Apr-2021, the patient experienced CONFUSIONAL STATE (confusion/was not coherent) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VISION BLURRED (blurry vision) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VOMITING (vomited) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CARDIAC OUTPUT INCREASED (cardiac outcomes went up, from the lab results they were elevated) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, CONFUSIONAL STATE (confusion/was not coherent), VISION BLURRED (blurry vision), VOMITING (vomited) and CARDIAC OUTPUT INCREASED (cardiac outcomes went up, from the lab results they were elevated) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient had his first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine yesterday and immediately felt the vaccine go to his chest and down to the toes; 30-40 minutes after had confusion, blurry vision; he made it to a hospital in Dallas where he vomited, he could not read at the moment, could not call 911, did not know how to send his location, how to call or text, he was not coherent. Was admitted in the ER with altered mental state, he was not responsive when she went to see him. He stayed overnight, his cardiac outcomes went up, from the lab results they were elevated. They performed CT scans, neurological checks, a holter monitor, MRI, multiple blood works and everything was clear.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. Further information has been requested.

The fever broke after about 5 hours with 800mg of ibuprofen and 1000mg of acetaminophen. The nausea subsided somewhat with 8mg of Zofran sublingual. The headache resolved about 01:00am on 01/10/2021. The dizziness and fatigue resolved significantly by 04:00am on 01/10/2021. Mild fatigue continued for another 24 or so hours, but seemed mostly resolved by 01/11/2021 and may have been exacerbated by my overnight (7p-7a) shifts.

I was just itching all over.  About 11 days later is when I came down with something else. I was having body aches and diarrhea. I was seen in the ED. By Monday late evening I was starting to feel back to normal.

Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

                                                I took the vaccine on Thursday and i slept good, like normal. when I got up Friday morning I had chills all day. I checked my temperature and it was 101 and went up to 104. I took Tylenol every 4 hours but it would not come down, I took cold shower and it didn&#39;t come down Friday and Friday night all night. It would get down to 102 or 101 but it would come right back. Saturday all day fever, nausea, and headache.  No matter the medicine I took or when I took a cold shower it would not come down.  Everything continued until Sunday all day until Sunday night, I still took medicine but i couldn&#39;t control the fever. I did not want to go to hospital. Early morning hours of Sunday I started to perspire and the fever started to come down to 101 then 99.something.

Was monitored for another 30 minutes and my wife picked me up. Took tylenol when I got home. Checked blood sugar at home and blood sugar was down to 40. I hadn&#39;t eaten before the vaccine. I ate oatmeal and went to bed. After 2 hours, I no longer had symptoms. Returned to work 1/29/2021 without any further issues.

                                                It began with  severe chills and a low grade fever.  The following morning, my fever increased and the highest level noted was 101.8.  I had a loss of appetite, nausea, and no energy.  My fever lasted for approximately 30 hours before subsiding.  I alternated Tylenol and Alieve during my time with fever.  On Sunday, February 7, I began having mouth sores and fever blister on my lips.  For this, I used Lysine, both tablet and lip ointment.

                                                Had vaccine and had a red spot and sore arm which went away after a couple days. Four days after the vaccine a blood vessel in my hand burst (I don&#39;t recall hitting it on anything at all). It puffed up about a centimeter and slowly went away over a few days. Then a little more than a week later the red spot came back and itched very badly and was sore again. It also faded after several days. then yesterday morning I woke up and my arm was sore at the injection site again only I started having the worst headache of my life that lasted 30 hours. I started shaking, sweating massively, I felt hot and cold at the same time, felt as if I had a very high fever but my temperature was 98.4 (totally normal). I was vomiting if I tried to eat or drink. I had severe body aches and EXTREME weakness throughout my body. My heart began to race at 150-160 bpm for several hours and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It has gotten about 50%  better in the past few hours and will hopefully continue that way. I&#39;ve never felt anything like it in my life. I need to know if it is safe for me to get the second shot.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

On 31 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unspecified date, the patient experienced fever, chills, abdominal pain, anorexia/lack of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue/frequently had to lay in bed, and cellulitis on his left shin and foot. The patient took paracetamol and naproxen for the events, which somewhat helped.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events, fever, chills, abdominal pain, anorexia/lack of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue/frequently had to lay in bed, were considered resolved on an unknown date. The outcome for the event, cellulitis on his left shin and foot, was reported as not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. Cellulitis of shin and foot is unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                7pm on date of injection I got very sleepy and fell asleep.  I woke up at 12:45am sweating but chilled to the bone.  I felt feverish but was too cold to get out of bed.  When I actually got out of bed I had a very intense headache, and body aches.  I took my temp and it registered 104.  at 8am I took my dogs out but felt very old, chilled to the bone &amp;  lightheaded.  It was chilly outside.  I got back inside and got back into bed as fast as I could. The second I laid down, the sweat just poured out of my body, drenching my shirt, sheets, and blanket.  The fever lasted all day but was slowly improving throughout the day.  My arm was also incredibly sore at the injection site.  It was very sore for shot one too but the pain lasted nearly 2 weeks the first time and is already just about gone now.  Yesterday, or 2 days after dose 2 injection, the fever was gone.  I still had a headache, and body aches but also developed nausea.  I did not vomit but I did have diarrhea.  I also noticed extreme shortness of breath over very minor exertion.  I?m not sure if this was due to extreme dehydration , due to loss of fluids or if it?s associated with the vaccine.  My lungs feel clear and I deny ever suffering from a bronchial spasms..  Day 3 I?m feeling more myself but am still suffering from gastric upset.  Nausea has dissipated.

The patient stated he wanted me to call 911 so I called 911 and the technician called a &#34;code&#34; over the pager. I went with the patient back to the vaccine booth and got him to take a seat. The patient then stated that he had an allergy to cashews. I retrieved the emergency kit. I asked the patient if he wanted me to give him the epi pen and he said no. He asked if we would page his wife as well. I gave the patient some water while asking how he was breathing. He said it was just difficult to swallow. He said he didn&#39;t have any trouble breathing  but was noticeably shaking. Management came to check in and then went to wait for the ambulance to arrive. The patients wife also called 911 from his phone. While they were on the phone the EMTs showed up. They carried the patient out to the ambulance on the stretcher.

                                                Immediately after receiving 1st dose of moderna my arm began to have a burning sensation and become sore. The burning sensation expanded to my left armpit area over the next few hours and extended to left side of chest. It felt like streaks of burn extending out of armpit area.  Approximately 12hrs after receiving the shot (3am) I became extremely nauseated. I alternated between throwing up and diarrhea for the next three hours. During this time i also experienced a fever, chills, sweats, uncontrollable shaking and elevated heart rate. Today (3/19) I am dehydrated, lightheaded and dizzy. fever and chills are gone as well as nausea but heart rate is still elevated.

Since last seen he initiated AIT in December 2020 and reports he had tolerated his AIT injections without large local or systemic reactions until yesterday, 16 Mar, when he received his first maintenance dose. Within minutes of receiving his dose he developed shortness of breath, dizziness/altered level of consciousness resulting in collapse, and was noted to be hypoxic. He was treated with IM epinephrine with initial improvement but subsequently again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness. He received his second dose of IM epinephrine and a dose of IM Benadryl with transient improvement, but again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness followed by nausea and vomiting. He was noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic despite these interventions so a third dose of IM epinephrine and IV fluids were administered. He was transferred by ambulance to ER where he was given IV solumedrol, monitored, and admitted to the ICU overnight for observation. He reports fever (Tmax 101 F) last night in the ICU. He endorses he took his Allegra prior to his AIT dose and did not exercise. Of note, on 15 Mar he received his second mRNA COVID19 vaccine.

He was observed for 15mins without any noticeable concerns noted. He was scheduled for his 2nd vaccine and released. Member returned to 2nd floor conference room C at 4:37pm as he indicated his tongue felt thick and swallowing wasn&#39;t &#34;natural&#34;. He advised he sat in his car for a while and came back in and took 2 benadryl.  I escorted member down to ACC and handed him off with report. He was in no acute distress, able to talk and ambulate. While checking into ACC he indicated he felt the benadryl was helping and felt a little better. (Initially during the 15 minute observation, member advised his mouth was dry and asked for water, which after drinking he said he was fine and that it helped. He was in no distress at that time. )

Couldn&#39;t get warm. 13 hrs after, chills subsided and within 20 minutes I had a fever of 101 degrees that lasted about 2-3 hrs. 24 hrs later, still very tired and chilled with mild headache/body ache.  Reported symptoms to vaccination site and received telemed counseling.  Nothing they could do for me.

                                                Right after the vaccine I just had a slight head ache. I had pretty typical symptoms. Around 8pm my arm got to 8/10 pain. I have waves of Tachycardia and nausea. I had pretty bad diarrhea the first day and second day, this was also a side effect from the Celexa. The Tachycardia was going up to 130-140 .  Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

                                                I don&#39;t have lot number or dose number.  It was a Moderna COVID 19 vaccine.  I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

                                                Same evening, 3/6 at about 2000 hours, got cold chills and the shakes. Felt exhausted and all muscles ached. The next morning 3/7 at approximately 0830, same effects as previous, but also a horrible migraine and vomiting. Took one 6ml injection Sumatriptan for migraine in opposite arm from Covid vax, no effect and no relief. 1300 hours, migraine was so intense, I advised my wife I would do a 2nd Sumatriptan injection and if it didn&#39;t work, I would need to be brought to the emergency room. 2nd injection was successful in relieving migraine approx 45 min after injection. Felt run down, but was able to go to work the next morning 3/8. Felt tired and run down on 3/8, but symptoms went away by late evening. This was surprising, since my first Covid vax dose 4 weeks prior didn&#39;t affect me as bad as this 2nd dose

I tool Tylenol as directed it would only reduce temps to 101 after 2 hours the fever 104 would return. This lasted until late morning the next day my temps started to fall off to 99. Tiredness and headaches still a problem been 3 days since the Moderna 2nd vaccine shot. I also feel some inner ear pressure like some inflammation in there.  The headaches seem to be getting somewhat worse causing me to feel nauseated I took 500 MG of Ibuprofen seems to reduce the headaches. I also developed a cough dry but almost like a flu cough which seems to be resolving.

                                                Afew hours after receiving the inoculation, I was extremely sleepy.   I was sleeping at my job, and my boss had me go home early.  I went to work the next day, however I was feeling weird, my sense of smell and taste were off, as the day continued I started having a headache, body aches, and general malaise.  I went home early, again from work.  But when I arrived to my residence I was having severe chills despite my efforts to try to keep myself warm.  The chills lasted for more than 24hrs, preventing me from sleeping, my body aches were getting worse, my eyes were extremely red, and I did not feel like eating.  Near the end of the day, the chills became sweats, and I was trying to balance between being hot and clammy, to chills.  The next day I paid a visit to my primary care doctor.  I was tested for covid - which was negative, I was tested for the flu - which was negative, and my lungs were clear so there was no reason for my doctor to believe I have a pneumonia.

Major Side Effects/Adverse Side Effects: day 1- increased suicidal ideations, major depression, major fatigue, felt like all psychiatric medication stopped working. I felt suicidal. Felt like Killing myself because of it. resolved after 3-4 days. Stomache was also very upset. only ate rice and crackers and applesauce. Day 5- back ache for 2-3 days. I believe that the vaccine made the psychiatric medication  I take daily to stop working!  My concern is that other psychiatric patients may not know these side effect exist and that they will be getting this vaccine and then be found dead because of it.

He went to the ER last night, and was not found to be dehydrated &amp; labs were not unusual.  he was given injection of nausea medicine, and rxs for zofran and norco, but had not taken any today... using pepto bismol instead.  I advised he take the zofran routinely until the nausea subsides and the norco for the headache  &amp; if not improved in a couple days to go see his dr.

I started feeling better around 2:30 AM on March 17.  I went to work that morning at 8:30 and had to leave work at 10 AM due to feeling worse.  I went home and laid down the rest of the day, taking Tylenol and drinking an electrolyte drink.  I had chills, but not nearly as bad the the night before.  I started feeling better around 6PM that evening.  The next day, I felt fine with the exception of an almost total loss of appetite.   I did not feel fully back to normal until Friday morning.  I do not regret getting the shot, but found this reporting tool and thought it would be a good idea to submit my experience.

I was fine after the shot was made but as the evening came towards the night, I started having the chills, lots of shivering and a slight fever (99 degrees). It felt as if I was having Covid again.  I took 2 - 500 mgs of Tylenol Extra Strength as a precaution in case it got worse.  The next day I felt very tired throughout the day and at night time I didn&#39;t feel as bad as the 1st night but I felt nauseous and muscle pains everywhere so I took another 2 Tylenols, it got better then went to sleep.

He was advised to stay home, was offered Covid testing but refused. On 3/22/21 the RN received an email from patient&#39;s supervisor that he still felt unwell and reported vomiting and diarrhea. Was offered a Covid test but refused.  -Per patient&#39;s friend (a nurse who informed us of the case) various friends spoke with patient up until the morning of 3/25 and he reportedly had no respiratory or cardiac complaints. They were unable to reach him the evening of 3/25, nor the morning of 3/26 so sent the police for a well check and patient was found dead. He lived alone. -Per OSME. Patient did not receive an autopsy but did have an &#34;inspection&#34; which includes an external exam, toxicology and other testing including Covid testing which was positive. The specimen has been sent for sequencing. -Of note, Patient worked in a group  home that had an outbreak of Covid in Jan/early Feb. His last exposure to a &#43; person was likely 2/8/21 but possibly 2/10/21. He had a Covid test 2/15/21 that was &#34;inconclusive&#34;. The test was re-run (same assay) and was also &#34;inconclusive&#34;

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

                                                At 5:00 pm on vaccination day I started to experience aching in both legs.  By 5:30 pm the aching in both legs became greater and started a general unwell feeling.  By 7:00 pm I had a headache/full body aching/major pain and aching in both legs/rapid heart beat at rest/chills/diarrhea.  I suffered from sweats/chills/rapid heart rate/major right and left leg pain and aches/headache for the whole next day.  By 11:00pm the day after vaccine, I was only suffering from major head ache and major left and right leg pain and aching and sweating.  I woke up the 2nd day after the vaccine symptom free but very fatigued.  I took 800mg of Advil every 6 hours from the onset of symptoms.  My watch reported my heart rate at a range from 90-121 BPM while at rest for at least 24hours during onset of symptoms.

After discussing my symptoms with Dr. , he prescribed a course of valacyclovir.  I took this for 1 week.  The blisters, redness, and pain in my back/torso improved over time.  They lesions are now completely gone.

                                                About an hour after being vaccinated, I got very pale, and almost had a syncope episode at work.  I felt weak kneed for about 2 hours afterwards, and was still wobbly knees the next day.   I also had muscle/joint aches the same day, which went away within 24 hours.  In the past 6 days, I have had reoccurring headaches, fatigue, and  this morning, had a severe enough headache to bring on nausea.   I am med compliant with all my meds and I take care of my Type II diabetes,    I am also a volunteer firefighter - advanced EMT, so I know when there is a problem.

                                                Beginning about 16hours after the shot (the next morning) my stomach began to bother me a little, within half an hour or so I began to feel a little tingle from the top left arm (shot area) down to my stomach including my sternum area.  It got progressively worse. By about hour 17 I was beginning to get cold sweats and stomach bothering me more. By hour 18 I was cold, sweating, nauseous, vomiting, hard tight pain in stomach /and sternum/chest.  Stomach / chest pain persisted badly for about 30- 45 minutes then began to subside.  By hour 19 most of the sever pain subsided.  for the rest of the day (@and still 25 hours later) I still have a lingering miserable stomach and slight headache.  I slept most of the afternoon without any medication.

About eleven hours after shot I had headache, feeling of irregular body temperature, nausea, body aches..  I took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea which helped.    About 24 hours after the injection I experienced sore armpit/lymph nodes of shot arm.   All but the symptoms except the sore armpit/lymph nodes  were mostly gone within 30 hours of the shot.  The lymph nodes felt better a day or two later.

I woke up Tues. March 23 at 6:30 am and noticed numbness on the left side of my face and paralysis on the right side.  I&#39;d never experienced this before in my lifetime.  I contacted my physician and she advised that I go to s healthcare facility to get checked out.  Once at the healthcare facility, the attending ER doctor said everything pointed to Bell&#39;s Palsy.  However, she ordered a series of tests to rule out anything else.  All tests came back good.  Diagnosis was Bell&#39;s Palsy.  I was prescribed Prednisone, an Anti-Viral and poly eye drops.  When I awoke the next morning 3/24, the numbness on the left side had mostly gone away, but the paralysis on the right side was worse.  Today is 3/26 - there has been no change or improvement since.

As he was driving he wasn&#39;t feeling very  well,  I told him maybe we should go sit in the parking lot of the hospital.  We ended up in  parking lot.  He was pale, nauseated and  he thought he was getting a fever (but didn&#39;t)  and was really getting tired like ran down.  So,  he said for me to drive him home so he could lay down.  I got him home I called Dr.  office  I knew these symptoms were normal , but didn&#39;t think on  first dose and that fast... 30 minutes from time of injection to when he got  sick feeling.  The Doctors office just said to watch him for  symptoms if he got worse etc.,  and I asked if this was normal for how fast this happened.  She said there is no normal.   He was cold and covered up when we got home and took a 2 hour nap!  Afterwards, he helped make dinner and was ok just his arm was really sore.

                                                Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient&#39;s tachycardia patient&#39;s Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily. (Please note clarification in comparison to discharge home med list.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily was called to pharmacy in place of the metoprolol.)

At 2am next morning, I could hardly stand due to muscle pain and weakness, neck to toes, with associated nausea and low-grade fever of 99/100 the rest of the day.  I took Advil and Tylenol every 4-6 hours. Some pain and weakness and nausea remain on 2/4/2021 but fever is gone and feeling well enough to return to work.

This lasted about 36 hours. These symptoms were similar to those I experienced when I had Covid-19 in early December of 2020.

I took a benedryl at 5:00pm on Wednesday 3/03/2021. Called my family doctor on Thursday morning and he told me to take 1 Zyrtec in the morning and 1 at night to help clear the rash. My Doctor said it was not anaphylaxis as it did not happen immediately after the vaccine but 24 hours later. I have no trouble breathing as I check myself with oximeter and my oxygen level is 97%.  I did have Covid on January 3, 2021 and after the vaccine on 03/02/2021 I experienced nausea, chills and a dull headache and then the rash. I have experienced this type of rash before after a stomach virus and it lasts for 3 or 4 days and clears up.

                                                I received the first  shot on March 16th and on March 20th around 4:00 pm I was feeling like my speech was a little slurry.  I got home and about 5:30 pm I was resting against my boat cause I was feeling nausea and a headache.  Also it felt like my food tasted different...I had ate some chips the day after the shot on March 17th and I had told my wife that they tasted different.  Anyway, on  March 20th around 8:30 pm I went to spit and realized I could only spit from the right side of my mouth. I called my daughter, who is an ICU RN, asked me to do a series of tests over facetime with her and she told me I should go in cause when I smiled it wasn&#39;t symmetrical.  She came and picked me up and took me to hospital in.  Immediately there they asked me to smile and to raise my eyebrows and they treated for &#34;possible&#34; stroke.

Called PCP on 1/11 and 1/13 and received medication for nausea and ibuprofen for headache.  Felt better by 1/15 but was advised by PCP not to return to work until1/18.  I request name of physician several days ago but he has not communicated that information.  His PCP is strongly advising receiving second dose but wants to pre-medicate.

                                                Approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine shot, I experienced sudden dizziness and nausea for approximately 1 minute. Also, my entire left arm looked a bit red, but no hives. It went away as quickly as it occurred. Approximately 30 minutes after that, I experienced nausea again( which was a bit more intense). It also lasted for approximately 1 minute then it quickly ceased. At 4pm (5 hours after the shot), I got a severe headache. I&#39;m not sure if that was related to the vaccine. I took acetaminophen and slept soundly through the night. The next day, I felt fine, and I have felt fine since.

                                                I got the shot at 3pm. I started feeling &#34;off&#34; in stomach/chest around 7-8pm. By 3am, my stomach/chest did not feel good at all and I had trouble sleeping. It was definitely not heart related. By 8am I felt chills coming on. By 9am I was fully dressed, with two blankets on, and lying on couch shaking for 20-30 minutes. Later a fever started and it reached about 102.3 before subsiding late afternoon. By 8pm, I felt blah but fever was gone. During that entire time I felt achy overall (similar to what I felt like 2 hours after running a marathon).  I didn&#39;t have headaches (and rarely do), but area around my eyes were heavy and tired. Weirdly, at times, the top 1/2 of both ears hurt.   I experience about every symptom I had as when I had Covid and went to hospital for 26 days except for the breathing issues.

                                                Sore arm; the fatigue started 24 hours after the injection. The fatigue lasted for about five days. Abdominal pain came that seemed to be coming from the region of my liver and I had been having some problem with that previously (in a mild way) and the injection seemed to make this flare up more. About 4 days after injection, I went to ER and they did blood test and liver tests. And over time it seemed to resolved itself in a few days. The pain in my SI joint flared up about 24 hours after the injection - the extreme pain lasted for about 24 hours and then it slowly tapered off after a couple of days.

The arm is swollen, warm to the touch, and black and blue. Today I have a mild fever, some hot flashes, nausea without vomiting, body weakness, and overall muscle aching. This is the sickest I&#39;ve been in years.

Irregular Bowel movement, abdominal pain - come and goes, not fully recovered at time of writing. There was no constipation (in sense of difficulty to pass stool) but no bowel movement either, only pain.  Treatment: after 24 hours start taking pain killers (Tylenol night, Aleve). Hot bath helped with back pain and abdominal pain. Laxative (Bisacodyle)  helped with Bowel movement, and relieved pain - but took long time and unknown if back to normal. Now on liquid diet (water,clear  soup, tea with sugar)  to allow to rest a bit, seems more comfortable at the moment.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA Got vaccine 4pm.  I ate dinner at 6pm.  At 8pm felt slightly nauseous.  By 9pm it was worse.  By 9 30pm I was nauseous and full blow stomach pain.  My stomach was &#39;roiling or churning.&#39;   Then between 9 30pm and 2 30am the next day I was nauseous, had stomach pain, I felt hot and cold and my head became more congested and I got a headache.  Note: the head congestion was there prior to getting the vaccine, but it got worse.   I sipped water throughout and it felt like I had to vomit (but I did not vomit).   I took my temperature a few times it ranged from 98 to 98.8.   My normal temperature is 97 to 97.5.   By morning, or about 4am the worse symptoms were gone.  My stomach felt more or less ok and at 7am  I ate a light breakfast without incident.   My temperature seemed to be elevated through the day.  I felt somewhat weak during the day.  Worst effects seem gone by Jan 8 evening.   The only effect left is pain in my left upper arm.  I consider these to be significant and worrying side effects and I may not take the second dose.

At 17 hours had severe sweats that soaked the bed with rigorous chills including teeth chattering shaking chills.  Took 800mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep.  Poor sleep with many awakenings.  Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

Now, 5 days later, I&#39;m still nauseous and dizzy during the day. My ears are full (especially my left ear) and I can&#39;t lay on my left side without experiencing vertigo.

                                                Two days after taking the Covid vaccine on Wednesday 1/6/21, patient developed abdominal pain.  The next day, he began to have what appeared to be petechial hemorrhaging in his abdomen. By Sunday, the hemorrhaging had spread from his neck to his knees.  On Monday, he saw his primary care physician, who sent him to hospital ER. After performing extensive tests, the ER doctor stated that the test results were normal, and he could find no reason for most of his body being purple. By Tuesday, he was returning to normal.  The abdominal pain was gone by Tuesday as well.

                                                Per MD Clinical Note 3/14/21, &#34;Further discussion with his daughter today-patient has not been able to walk and has had unclear mentation for approximately 8 years after an alcohol related decline.  Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.   Assessment and plan Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia  One week post COVID-19 vaccination  Agitation  Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD, Wernicke    -continue to trend the LFTs downward.  Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.

Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

I called my family doctor and he informed me there was a stomach bug going around.   I wanted to submit this report just in case others had the same issue and weren&#39;t from this area experiencing this stomach bug.  Just about recovered, probably will feel completely well by tomorrow.

                                                My fever started on the day of vaccination like 100.4 F.  In the early morning next day, it went up to. 102.7 and it stayed for all day.  I even sent an email to to my doctor?s office in the afternoon, - at that time the temp was like 102.2 or so.  But it shot up again in the night.  The fever continued on Friday and I still have chills on Saturday I.e. March 27th 2021 and as I write this.  I also felt nautica first two days.  I have been having headaches  also. I was diagnosed with slow heart rate I.e. 43 beats per minute (I forgot to put this in the long term conditions).  I am worried about the second dose as I reading it is the second dose that causes fever in people, not the 1st dose.  I hope I recover over the weekend.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the first night after receiving 2nd dose of Moderna.  I had a fever, chills and muscle aches, and extreme fatigue.  Those symptoms lasted approx 3 days.  Two days after the vaccination I also became extremely nauseous.  I was anticipating all of these symptoms.  On the 3rd and 4th days after the vaccine most of the symptoms disappeared but I received some new ones that I was not expecting.  I suddenly felt a large amount of despair and hopelessness.  I had suicidal thoughts.  I had panic attacks and anxiety.  I had paranoia.  I did not feel like I had long to live, or anything to live for.  By 20 Apr all of these emotional and mental side effects were completely gone.

I have experienced all these side effects every day for the last 10 days. Additional side effects are: Sweating profusely every night. Not being able to sleep very well nearly every night. Stomach upset if I eat or if I do not eat. I am only able to eat very bland food since anything else upsets my stomach. I can not drink carbonated beverages since they upset my stomach. As of yesterday I started getting little red sores on my back. This morning it moved to my chest in addition to my back.

                                                On Monday, March 9th, I tested positive for the COVID antibodies and believe it was linked to an illness that I experienced last fall (COVID test was not administered at that time).  Approximately 16 hours after receiving the first injection of COVID-19 MODERNA I began to experience joint pain/stiffness, muscle soreness,  headaches, nausea, chills, sweats, malaise, heart racing, numbness to the fingers on my left hand, etc.  I became progressively worse until become bed ridden at 5:15 pm on Thursday, March 11th.  I remained bed ridden with symptoms becoming progressively worse until Friday evening, March 12th.  At that point, my condition began to improve.  I began to feel somewhat better by mid-morning on Saturday, March 13th.  My condition finally improved to ~90% by Monday, March 15th, with lingering muscle soreness and loss of feeling to the fingers on my left hand remaining.

At approximately 5:30 pm, my blood sugars rose in excess of 400 mg/dl, felt lightheaded followed by quick onset of high pressure and volume diarrhea. I was in my girlfriend&#39;s home and was barely able to get to the toilet in time. The diarrhea appeared pea soup green in color and consistency and very smelly.  Of interest, my girlfriend who also received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on the same date, time and location, was awaken at approximately 2:00 AM with the same rapid onset of diarrhea.  On the second day following the vaccine, we both had elevated temperatures of 101.5 and 102 lasting approximately 24 hours.

                                                The day of the shot, we noticed significant swelling in my neck on the right of center.  The swelling has maintained its size for now six weeks and one day.  I have a dull numbness in my 2-3 smaller toes of my left foot.  Sometimes I feel this numbness in my right foot, but not always.  My left arm and two smallest fingers also feel funny.  There is a dull pain in my left arm and dull numbness in my left smaller fingers.  The outside of my left leg also at times shares this numb feeling.  On the day I got the shot I immediately felt like I had a dose of caffeine, though that feeling passed after a couple of hours.  It did not feel significant enough to keep me from driving or leaving the facility, but it was noticeable. I experienced diarrhea for about a week and a half. For the first week after the shot I alternated nights of not being able to stay still sleeping, keeping me awake almost the entire night, 3 of the first 6 nights.  I visited my family doctor within one week of the first shot.  He advised me not to get the second shot and made note of the swelling in my neck. I visited him at five weeks because the swelling in my neck and numb feeling has not changed.  He scheduled a CT Scan which has been scheduled.

                                                Approximately 21 hours post injection I had lower abdominal pain that resulted in diarrhea lasting approximately 8 hours.   I started a diarrhea medication about 5 hours after onset of symptoms and that has helped.   Waiting for a response from my primary care physician to determine which medicine I should to (as a diabetic) if the symptoms continue.

                                                Approximately 2-3 hours after getting shot I started to feel flush my temperature was slightly higher than my normal at 98.9 (my normal is about 97.7). I also felt a little tired, I work 2nd shift so I went to work as normal. About 4 or 5pm the fatigue started to worsen and it was difficult to do my job I also felt nauseous, I struggled to finish my shift because of the fatigue. When I came home at 11pm I went straight to bed. When I awoke in the morning the fatigue was worse and it was difficult to stay awake but the nausea had passed. I was extremely tired all day until about 8pm or so when the fatigue started to lessen. By the next morning I was still a little tired but I could resume my normal schedule although I felt like I didn&#39;t get a good nights sleep. By Saturday morning (20th) I was not feeling any adverse effects.  I have sleep apnea which I forgot to list on medical conditions and I can&#39;t go backwards on the form so I am including it here.
