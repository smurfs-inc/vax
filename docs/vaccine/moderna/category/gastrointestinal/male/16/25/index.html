                                                At approximately 2 PM on Wednesday the 10th, I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and feverish. Color drained from my face and I also began to lose track of the conversation I was having. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace of the conversation and eventually realized I couldn&#39;t remember what we were talking about. Looking back on the event now, I could only remember what was happening for around. 2 minute span before I forgot it. After losing my ability to form new memories, I began to lose old ones. I would look through pictures and not recognize faces, listen to songs and not remember the artists, and lose entire gaps of my past. My parents described my memory loss as that of a concussion but, to be frank, I don&#39;t remember much of any of it. All of my past memories have returned, but I still have yet to regain my memory from 2 PM to 10 PM of that day.

                                                Patient received vaccine in left arm and during waiting/observation period a few minutes later (while sitting), he told the person near him he felt dizzy, and he fainted. He soon regained consciousness (within about a minute) and was observed/attended to. 911 was called immediately as a precaution, and paramedics monitored his vital signs slowly helped him into a chair. He drank some water and a little electrolyte drink. He did not want to seek hospital treatment, and paramedics left.  He stated he was experiencing nausea while sitting in the chair, and said he started to feel like he was going to faint again.  Again 911 was called and paramedics attended to him, but he did not faint again. After resting in a chair and drinking some more water and some electrolyte drink, as well as cold compresses on his forehead and the back of the neck, he was eventually escorted by two store employees on a motorized scooter cart to his parent&#39;s car and went with his parent home (he did not want to seek hospital treatment).

                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.

                                                Patient stated prior to administartion of vaccine that he has had a history of passing out following vaccinations, mostly when he does not eat or drink beforehand. He stated he made sure to have something to eat and drink beforehand and was aware that it may happen following this vaccine as well. Prior to administering vaccine, I verified details with patient on previous episodes and discussed risks with patient, who understood and wished to proceed anyways and was okay staying additional time beyond 15 mins post vaccination to ensure no serious reaction. Immediately post-vaccination, I asked the patient how they were feeling prior to sending him to the designated waiting area. He stated repeatedly that he was fine and okay to walk to the chairs on his own. Moments after sitting down, a technician alerted me that he had collapsed off the chair and fell on the ground before anyone could get there to catch him. I immediately called 911 and attended to the patient who had already regained consciousness while I was on the phone with emergency services. He informed technician that when he sat down he felt a little queasy and the next thing he knew, he was on the floor. Fortunately there happened to be an EMT in the store that came over to help while waiting for additional paramedics. We provided the patient with an ice pack and a bottle of water, but instructed him not to drink anything until paramedics arrived. We checked the patients blood pressure and found the reading to be low and patient was tachycardic, expected following a syncopal episode. Myself and the EMT got patient to lie down on the floor and elevated his head. We noticed that the patient had suffered a small laceration to his head resulting from falling off the chair onto the ground. Store management also got involved to assess the situation and take statements. Upon arrival of paramedics, care was transferred over to them. At first, patient refused to be transported to the hospital but asked that we contact his mother. After reaching his mother, she arrived shortly after to the store, and after further rest and evaluation, patient was transported to a local hospital for a further workup .Patient was only unconscious for 20 seconds or less, and the event occurred within 5 mins of vaccine administration.  Upon regaining consciousness, patient was alert and oriented, and again stated that he&#39;s fine and it wasn&#39;t the first time it has happened.

Total or partial hearing loss, tennitis, vertigo, nausea,etc. This needs to be reported to the Public. I&#39;m angry that I was not warned about this before getting the vacinne.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine was administered I experienced the usual side effects of mild headache, fatigue and localized redness and swelling  Around 11pm the night the vaccine was administered I developed a migraine that resulted in blurred vision. and when I checked my temperature it was approximately 104.9 degrees Fahrenheit.By the next morning, approximately 7am, I was weak to the point I could not get out of bed myself, I was nauseous that resulted in a single Emesis episode approximately 8am, I had mild swelling of my face since 7am, between 7:30am and 12pm, I had multiple times where I would temporarily lose my vision. Throughout 1/25 I continued to have a fever ranging from 102 degrees Fahrenheit to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 8am and 1pm I took two acetaminophen pills each time which alleviated the migraine and to an extent helped with the visual deficit episodes. Throughout 1/24 and 1/25 I suffered with extreme chills resulting in shivering that lasted for several minutes despite a room temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and covered in two blankets. PCP was consulted via telephone and she advised to go to the hospital via EMS given the high grade fever, abnormal vitals and severity of symptoms

                                                I called my insurance provider&#39;s RN hotline at the onset of dizziness, which was then followed by a bout of ear ringing and nausea. I was advised to seek immediate medical attention, so I had an RA at my university dorm walk with me across the street to M Health Fairview hospital. I was seen by an RN in their emergency room, but was ultimately never seen by a Doctor as I did not present a clear risk of anaphylaxis at the time. After waiting in the ER for four hours for medical care, I ultimately left because most of my symptoms subsided. My most lasting symptoms cleared up late yesterday (1/25) and they were extreme soreness/tenderness at injection site and fatigue.

                                                Patient had parked in the COVID vaccine waiting area, and was observed to fall forward onto his steering wheel within a few minutes of parking by 2 other participants waiting in the car next to him. One of them immediately notified one of the parking lot volunteers who came and got me within 1 minute of this observation. 2 students and I came quickly to the open drivers side door and began talking to assess the situation. Mr. Bannister appeared pale, mildly diaphoretic (sweating) and slightly confused as to the passage of time, but was able to state and spell his name and talk coherently about his circumstances. He stated that he was not allergic to anything that he knew about, and that he had no prior history of similar reactions to vaccines or medicines although he had not taken any shots in several years. He noted that he had not eaten anything since breakfast (now mid-afternoon). He described himself as initially feeling weak, faint, and nauseated with his vaccinated arm feeling heavy and numb. He also reported that he had a sensation of blurriness before passing out, but denied any spinning sensation, visual loss or ringing in the ears. There were no obviously visible abrasions or bleeding on his face or forehead. The nursing students brought a chair, and we elevated his legs and gave him some water to drink during the time we were monitoring his vital signs. He refused a cupcake because of the nausea, but as time progressed he gained facial color and was more comfortable in conversing. His hands had equal muscle grip and strength, visible fingernail beds were pink and his capillary refill was less than 3 seconds. Towards the end of our monitoring, he did accept some nuts and M &amp; Ms to eat. A University Safety Medical Report was completed by the appropriate safety personnel. He was fully AAO x 3 at the end of our monitoring, and stated that if he felt better he would drive to his apartment (less than 5 minutes away) but would wait for his girlfriend to get out of class if he did not feel fully capable of driving. We encouraged him to eat something light when he got home, to use cool water/warm water soaks at his shot site, exercise his arm, and to take an NSAID for pain relief the next day. We recommended that he eat something light before his second shot (which had already been scheduled), that he bring someone with him the next time, and as a precaution to wait 30 minutes following the second shot. He left at 3: 15 pm driving his car without any apparent difficulties. An online report was completed for the incident 04/20/2021.

                                                My 20-year-old son received his first Moderna shot on March 16, 2021, at his college health clinic with no obvious side effects. He received the second Moderna shot at the same location on April 13, 2021. On the morning of April 14, 2021, he began running a high fever with repetitive vomiting and stomach cramping. He did not immediately seek medical attention because he had been told of side effects of the vaccine. When it was no longer tolerable, he reported to the local ER where it was later discovered he had a 4 mm kidney stone, which he passed two days later. We were told that the kidney stone would likely have begun forming about 31 days earlier, which would approximately coincide with his first COVID injection. There is no family history on either side of any kidney stones in the family. While my son&#39;s lifestyle may introduce some risk factors for kidney stones, I felt it was reasonable to report it as potentially relating to the vaccine.

                                                Admission HPI: Right-sided chest pain began 2 days prior to admission (3/19) after getting out of car, without identifiable trigger. Pain was sharp, pleuritic, and worst with movement; didn&#39;t feel it when still. Pain not responsive to ibuprofen or heating packs. Reported 30-60 seconds of self-resolving heart racing during ocular migraine which has been his baseline for years. Not associated with SOB (at rest or with exercise), palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. No viral URI symptoms, N/V, or rash. He did receive his 2nd Moderna COVID vaccine about 1 week PTA, followed by 36hrs of fevers, chills, and body aches. Given persistence of pain, Patient asked his parents to present to urgent care.   In UC, he was noted to tachycardic with CXR with bibasilar atelectasis and b/l effusions, per report. Given continued tachycardia, decision was made to transfer to ED to r/o PE.      In ED, tachycardic to 104-116 and tachypneic 22-26. Had one episode of tachycardia to 182 iso ocular migraine. Endorsed chest pain but points to R middle abdomen when asked where worst. Exam was unremarkable. He received 1 dose of morphine which reduced pain from 10/10 to 0/10. Labs notable for leukocytosis (14.61), thrombocytopenia (422), elevated d-dimer (1.56), and elevated CRP (5.6). Otherwise normal chem and coags. COVID/RVP negative. CXR unremarkable. CTPA showed scattered PEs in b/l lower lobes with small pulmonary infarct in RML. No evidence of right heart strain. Heme was consulted who recommended starting him on lovenox and sending lupus anti-coagulant. Cardiology was consulted who recommended EKG, BNP, and troponin, all of which were normal and reassuring against right heart strain. ECHO was therefore deferred to the AM. The decision was made to admit.   Upon arrival to the floor, Patient was tachycardic 114 and tachypneic to 22, otherwise stable vitals. He denied any pain since morphine. Denied any unexpected weight loss; reports that car ride was short. Mom reports that Patient has been less active d/t cold weather and baseball being on hold. Denies family or personal history of clots. Last seizure ~13 years ago.  Hospital Course: (3/21 - 3/22)  Patient was admitted to the hematology service. He was therapeutically anticoagulated with LMWH injections and his anti-Xa level prior to discharge was 0.92. (goal 0.5-1.0) Lower extremity ultrasound with Doppler showed patent veins and no evidence of DVT and upper extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT, though there was potential evidence of collateralization seen in mid and distal third of right subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein. Since this was an unprovoked PE, a full thrombophilia workup was sent and will be followed up by the outpatient hematology clinic. Cardiology consulted regarding possibility of right heart strain and the tachycardia during migraine episodes. Echocardiogram performed on 3/22 was technically limited but showed no gross abnormalities. The cardiology team requested a repeat echo scheduled outpatient for 1-2 months after discharge.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the first dose of my vaccine at about 8:30am on January 12. Around 6pm on January 12 I started to experience chills. As the night went on the chills got worse and I developed a terrible throbbing headache. In addition to that I was feeling hot and sweating profusely. I fell asleep around 10pm and woke up around 11pm, at this time the headache was worse, the chills were getting better, and I was still hot and drenched in sweat. I was able to fall back to sleep shortly after. I then woke up at 1am on the 13th, I still had a headache, the chills were gone, I was still hot and sweaty. At this time I also started vomiting. I preceded to vomit until there was nothing left in me and went back to bed. I woke up at 3am and proceeded to dry heave as there was nothing left to come up. My headache was extremely bad at this point and I was still hot and sweaty. I could not keep down Tylenol so I used a cold wet rag to help with the headache. I was finally able to sleep again. I woke up at 5am still with a headache and still hot at this time I was able to take my temperature and it was 99.8. I fell asleep again and woke up at 9am with a temperature of 100.1, at this time I was able to take Tylenol and keep it down which broke my fever and alleviated the headache. Now at about 1pm on the 13th I am still only able to sip liquids and my stomach is upset. This was the sickest I have been in a long time. I have spoken on the phone with a triage nurse at my doctors office and I am waiting for her to consult with a doctor and call me back.

Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

                                                At the pre-counsel stage, the patient said that he was a little nervous about getting this immunization, but wanted to go ahead and do it.  I counseled him on the immunization and sent him into the booth to get the shot.  Technician administered the vaccine and then told Technician that he felt a little nauseous.  Technician told him to stay seated.  A few seconds later the patient passed out and started slipping down the chair.  Technician grabbed him from behind and called me over to assist.  I yelled for Staff to call 9-1-1 and a code white.  I held him from the front and Technician held him from the back and we slowly lowered the patient to the floor.  Technician sat behind the patient to hold him up while I assessed the patient and tried see if he was responsive.  The patient was breathing and had a pulse, so I patted him on the face and chest to see if he would become responsive.  After about 15 seconds, the patient became responsive and confused.  He asked what happened and if he got the shot yet or not.  After talking to the patient for a moment he said he was fine, but needed to vomit.  I gave him a trash can and he vomited.  We gave the patient some water and sat with him on the ground for a few minutes until the paramedics arrived.  The paramedics took the patient&#39;s vitals and the patient said he felt fine and declined going to the hospital.  We had the patient sit in the observation area for another 30 minutes.  He said he felt totally fine and was ready to go home.

                                                Patient received vaccine in left deltoid and immediately responded which looked like a short seizure, losing consciousness shortly, then upon shaking responded by waking back up. Within the next few minutes the patient did the exact same thing and again responded after shaking by waking back up. Patient felt hot, weak and nauseous for quite a long time, he eventually vomited and thought he felt a little better. We called EMS and they responded by checking him over (B.S. 79 and Blood Pressure initially 87/60 but a repeat reading was 105/74 and patient felt well enough to decline a trip to the hospital. Patient was still feeling weak, so we observed him for over 2 hours and he took some water and drank some gatorade. After a bit we had him call his mother to drive him home. Patient was standing when we had one of our interns take him to his mother&#39;s car.

                                                Vaccine was administered at approximately 6:15PM and patient was instructed to sit in waiting room for 10 to 15 minutes to make sure he was OK. He looked fine and sat looking at his phone for approximately 5 minutes. He then  stood and walked to pick up window and asked if it was normal to have stomach pains. I said no and asked if he felt dizzy. He said &#34;no&#34; then turned to go back to his chair. As soon as he turned he said &#34;now I feel dizzy&#34;. I told him to return to his chair and he suddenly crumbled to the floor. I had my technician call 911. After 1 to 2 seconds of being unresponsive he suddenly came to. I had him continue laying on floor for a couple minutes and then he got up on his own and went to the chair. We gave him a cool towel for his neck and had him lean his head forward and down onto a chair placed in front on him.  The paramedics came within minutes and found him to be OK.  After they left he continued sitting in the chair for approximately 10 more minutes while talking on the phone (to his parents, I think). He then left stating that he was now OK and that it probably happened because he was nervous

                                                Starting on December 24 and lasting until March 1, I experienced the worst insomnia I had ever experienced, as well as depression, anxiety, and paranoia.  Previously, I was doing well. My parents and I saw a night and day difference. I was also throwing up regularly.  I also became much more angry and moody.  I often felt sick to my stomach.

                                                Pt received the first of the two-series COVID vaccination at 1512. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, he was noted to have severe diaphoresis, prominent pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. His head initially fell back and head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. This provider was speaking to the pt and performed a sternal rub to elicit a response, pt remained unresponsive and with eyes closed. Pt remained in this state for approximately 10 seconds. Pt noted to suddenly have some muscular rigidity to arms and torso and in order to prevent injury upon possible onset of seizure activity, pt was lowered to the floor by this provider and RN . Once on the ground the pt was relaxed and opened his eyes. Pt was immediately verbally responsive and asked if he passed out. Pt was able to sit up and was assisted into the wheelchair. Pt moved to treatment area where vitals and blood glucose were obtained. (@1525 BG- 104 mg/dL, VS BP 116/72, HR bradycardic @51 bpm, O2 sat 95%).  Patient responses/speech was clear and pt was oriented to self, place, time and situation. Pt stated that he felt nauseated upon sitting in the observation area and admitted that he only had a coffee today, nothing to eat all day and attributed this as the cause of his reaction. Pt verbalized that he would not respond to the hospital with the paramedics and was encouraged to at least call someone to take him to the hospital.  This provider spoke with the patient?s mother and explained the events. The patient?s mother stated that the patient had febrile seizures when approximately 4 years old, associated with asthma exacerbations; but pt was evaluated with a neurologist and there were no abnormal findings. Pt admitted that he has a similar syncopal episode after washing a laceration and seeing his finger bleeding. Pt states this was a few years ago and witnessed by his father that told the patient he initially fainted and then became momentarily rigid before responding appropriately (similar to today?s events).   Ambulance - arrival @1536 report given and pt stated he was feeling better and declined further evaluation in truck and also declined transport to ED ( departed at 1545). Pt?s overall condition, appearance, including color was much improved. Pt denied any allergies or medication history. Past medical hx of febrile seizures at approximately age three and four, childhood asthma and one syncopal episode as an adult. Pt girlfriend  arrival and she agreed to drive patient from the vaccine clinic.  Pt and girlfriend were both provided with an explanation of the many concerning causes of syncope and the necessity for further evaluation in the Emergency department to rule out any underlying conditions. Both patient and girlfriend verbalized understanding and although they still declined to respond to ED directly from the clinic, both did agree to respond to ED if any changes in mental status occurred.  Pt lives alone, but agreed to stay with parents and family in order to have others watch him for any changes.

Was prescribed triamcinolone acetonide paste two days after onset of symptoms, after visiting a walk-in clinic because of reduced ability to eat or drink due to pain. The doctor at the clinic requested we report the symptoms due to the timing after receiving the vaccine.

I woke up at 1:30am to brush my teeth but I couldn&#39;t take full breaths. When I was trying to take full breaths, I could only get ~70% of an inhale. This lasted for about 10 minutes. I then experienced the rest of the symptoms, minus vomitting for the rest of the day.

                                                Patient fainted shortly after receiving second dose of Moderna Covid vaccine. When I approached the patient he was laying on the ground and very pale but still breathing. I rolled him onto his back and elevated his feet and asked him to keep breathing and try to stay calm. I asked someone to grab him some water and someone else to run to the pharmacy and grab the pharmacy manager while I monitored the patient. I asked if I could help him sit up to drink some water and he accepted. After sitting up I asked if he had eaten and if I could get him something to eat. He stated he hadn&#39;t eaten all day and that he had a panic disorder and felt like he was having a panic attack. I asked if he had medicine he needed to take to help him feel better, he stated no, he needed to just wait it out. Then he told me he felt like he was going to throw up and I got him a waste basket that he threw up in right away. I asked the patient if he hit his head or if he wanted us to call an ambulance; he stated no to both questions. The pharmacy manager arrived and sat with the patient for the next half hour or more until he felt better. He stated that his dad was going to take him home now that he felt better. Some store staff had us fill out an incident report and the pharmacy manager walked the customer out to his car where he said he would call and find his dad.

                                                A little under 48 hours after receiving second Moderna injection, I woke up with vertigo. I have never had vertigo before. The room was spinning horizontally and it would subside after sitting up for a short while. Once it subsided when I was sitting up, I laid down and the spinning began again. I got into the shower (dumb idea) and the spinning was no longer occurring, but I still felt off-balance and got a bit nauseous. It was at its worst for the hour after I woke up, but gradually has subsided since then. I did some vertigo relief maneuvers and they&#39;ve helped, but I can tell I&#39;m not 100% back to normal as of writing (11:54am). I would say I&#39;m 90% back to normal. This could be a freak occurrence, but since I&#39;ve never experienced vertigo before, I have a feeling the vaccine I received two days prior may have something to do with it.

Performed my daily routines uneventfully other than just not feeling 100 percent. By that evening the chest pain returned. On 4/18, I awoke with severe chest pains. I then presented to the ER where was presumed I was having a heart attack vs. acute pericarditis/myocarditis.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Asthma and Eczema.   On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), MALAISE (Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;), FATIGUE (Fatigue), PYREXIA (Fever), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headaches) and NAUSEA (Nausea). On 09-Apr-2021, DIZZINESS (Dizziness), MALAISE (Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;), FATIGUE (Fatigue), PYREXIA (Fever), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headaches) and NAUSEA (Nausea) had resolved. At the time of the report, DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) and COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, Colonoscopy: abnormal (abnormal) it appeared to be an &#34;ulcerative colitis&#34; on the entire colon.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medication mentioned topical cream NOS for eczema.  Treatment information mentioned IV Methylprednisolone and Metamizole. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Company comments This case concerns a 22-year-old female hospitalized with serious unexpected events of diarrhea hemorrhagic and colitis ulcerative, nonserious unexpected dizziness, malaise, and expected pyrexia, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea. Event onset 24 hours after second dose mRNA-1273. Serious event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I was alerted and I helped him into the vaccination room to lay down on the floor with his feet propped up. His girlfriend was there to help calm him down. I offered to call 911, he refused. I grabbed a fan for him, and turned it off when he requested. He then began shivering rather uncontrollably and said his left arm (injection site) was hurting and tingling, and at one point, said his right arm was beginning to tingle as well.  We had him breath and relax, he began to return to normal and he and girlfriend discussed how he must be partly having an anxiety/panic attack. He trialed standing up a few times until he felt good enough to leave the room, all in all about 20 minutes. He sat close by for additional 15 minutes of observation, at which point he left stating he felt more like himself.

He vomited from the severe pain. I thought it was a kidney stone, but once he urinated the pain went away within several minutes. He has never had this before.

We assessed and then he began to report difficultly breathing and a very difficult time swallowing. Blood pressure was taken and lung sounds assessed. EMS was called.   Epi pen was given. Within 5 minutes he reported feeling much better and no issues with swallowing or breathing. EMS arrived on site and he was transferred to the local hospital.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

Next morning, I starting feeling sick, with flu symptoms. Aching muscles, sensitive skin, mild headache, sore eyes, and in the evening, nausea. Temperature gradually rose. ~99.7 at 6pm, 100.1 at 7pm, 100.7 at 8pm, 101.7 at 9:30pm. I took some Tylenol around 7pm, and then some theraflu at 10pm.   Fell asleep at 11pm. Periodically waking up every 30min from 1am onwards. Muscle discomfort, sweating, and nausea continued until 3:45 AM, at which point I was feeling better and was able to sleep continuously.

At 9:55 the patient reported feeling a bit nauseous and like he &#34;broke out in a cold sweat.&#34;  Denied dizziness, lightheadedness, difficulties breathing or any other symptoms.  Patient accepted to laydown and was provided water.  Reported feeling better after that.  VSS...BP 110/70  Pulse 65  Resp 16.  Staff sat with the patient and his dad for an additional 10 minutes.  Reviewed symptoms to watch for at home.  Confirmed with the patient that he felt back to base line then allowed him to leave with his dad. On 4/13  a follow up call was made.  Patient reports he has had no further symptoms and felt it was due to being nervous.  I encourage him to inform his vaccinator when he comes in to get his second dose.  Patient stated he appreciated the call and denied having any questions or concern.

He does smoke marijuana but has no tobacco use. He can follow with PCP to further risk stratify the nodules, either with PPD, and consideration of repeat scan in 6-12 months as needed.   4. Mild bilateral gynecomastia: I informed patient this has been found. He is not bothered by this finding and it seems an incidental finding. He can follow with his PCP for further evaluation as needed for this finding.   Inpatient Consultants and summary of recommendations: 1.

                                                Appendicitis; COVID-19; This case was received via FDA VAERS on 01-Jun-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 01-Jun-2021.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of APPENDICITIS (Appendicitis) and COVID-19 (COVID-19) in a 23-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 040A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     No Medical History information was reported.   On 09-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 02-Apr-2021, the patient experienced APPENDICITIS (Appendicitis) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and COVID-19 (COVID-19) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was treated with Surgery (appendectomy) for Appendicitis. At the time of the report, APPENDICITIS (Appendicitis) and COVID-19 (COVID-19) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 02-Apr-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: positive (Positive) The result was positive..

I then felt nauseous and threw up, and my body began to ache. 12 hours post vaccination I began to develop a fever of 99.8 with the use of acetaminophen and had severe chills / muscle aches.  The fever progresses to 101.1 about 36hours post vaccine and declined to 100.8 48 hours post vaccine. By 72 hours the fever was gone as well as all symptoms excluding fatigue and a slight headache.

                                                One hour after injection, at 1500, i experienced high sensitivity to pain. Every inch of my limbs ached, including headaches. I took ibuprofen, but was later advised against it.  The next day around 1300 i experienced chills and began shaking uncontrollably. It didn&#39;t stop for an hour, where i got incredibly nauseous and tired and slept the rest of the day.  The next day, starting at 0700, i felt the need to vomit and had diarrhea. This continued until i fell asleep at 1030. Afterwards the majority of my problems passed.

                                                On 2/24/21 around 1:30 PM, Patient was not feeling well and temperature was 100.8.   He was able to take Tylenol but then the staff noted his eyes rolled back in his head.   911 was called but he was not transported since his temperature was now normal and he seemed  to be at baseline.   He did not eat or drink much liquids later that night and in the morning of 2/25/21 around 9 AM, staff could not get him up from bed.   He was incontinent and had temperature of 97.7.  He was staring off and not talking or responsive.   911 was called and he was transferred to the ER and later admitted.   All labs and Xrays were normal and later on 2/26/21 he was awake and alert.    Of note, Patient also received news on the afternoon he got his second vaccine that a favorite staff person had been killed in a MVA.   Patient  was upset at this news at the time.

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

In addition to the soreness, I felt cold throughout the day, and I had a headache until I ate around 12:00pm, but I did not have much of an appetite.

                                                I kept a log of the events that occurred. Notes: 25mg amitriptyline taken nightly for the last month, 200mg motrin I?ve never taken pain killers before this, time is in military.   Mar 18  1430 (1 hour 30 mins after my shot) i have a compressing headache toward the back of my head so i take 1 motrin.  1700 i head home, take 1 amitriptyline and head straight to sleep. ( i have no apatite so no dinner ) Mar 19 0100 The pain starts, it?s unbearable. I am sweating heavily and im also shivering cold. i have a high fever I have body aches which turns my shivering into shaking which keeps my wife up all night. In my dreams i feel pain. I talked to my deceased mother, i hold my deceased cat and i relive some of my most regrettable moments.  0700 I wake up, the bed is soaking wet. I take a motrin and get dressed. it takes me an hour longer to get ready for work because, the pain has sapped my energy. My supervisor sends me home seeing how horrible I look. 0900 I take an amitriptyline and lay down. I ask me wife to close to the storm shutters to darken the room. They are normally pretty quiet to close but, this time they are deafeningly loud. I struggled to get 1 hour of sleep.  1500 I wake up due to shaking so bad that i hit my head on the wall. I then take 2 motrin and about 30 mins later i notice theres a tightness in my chest. i take 1 tums. I know that my body is exhausted from the pain and my mind is clouded but i really wanted to do all of the tasks that i was planning on doing this weekend. All of the tasks end up failing. 2100 i try the tasks again and end up failing again.   20 Mar 0100. I eat a pear and 2 cheetos. i do not take a amitriptyline and i lay down. i have no pain or fever. (Dream start) The dream i had is of me watching myself get thrown around by a ghost. The ghost possesses my body for a short time. I grab some kittens (cats are a comfort to me so im guessing that my subconscious trying to reel me back in) I then wake my sleeping wife and tell her theres a ghost and we need to leave. We walk outside and im in an old neighborhood that i grew up in, everything darkens and im in pitch black feeling my way around a room. I open my eyes and im in a hotel. The front desk staff will not let me take the kittens up to my room so i leave them. When i walk into the room, it?s full of kittens (dream end) and i wake up  21 Mar 0900 I wake up and I have a sore throat and tightness in my chest. The soreness prevents me from going back to sleep and the tightness in my chest causing some anxiety. Once I calm myself down and convince myself that im not having a heart attack I take 2 motrin and some tums and the pain goes away from the day. These could be some withdrawals from not taking amitriptyline since 19 mar in the morning. This is still happening as I write this report. (23 March 2021)

Had a headache since the night before, but I sometimes get headaches due to neck pain so I cannot fully attribute the headache as an effect of the vaccine. Vomited three times within two hours and experienced diarrhea at the same time. Fell back asleep for four hours and felt little nausea and no chills afterwards. Took ibuprofen for headache 24 hours after time of vaccine. Felt back to normal the next morning.

                                                Fatigue, for about Two days afterwards. Diarrhea has persisted for four days afterward. Anxiety Disorder has been acting up, this could be from anxiety over the vaccine or a side effect of the vaccine. I?ve felt more anxious since I received my vaccine, not severely, just noticing more than a typical day. I?ve only received the first dose, if it happens more after the second I will file an additional report.

Uncontrollable shivering 6 hours after, alternating (rapidly) with overheating and uncontrollable sweating. Eventually fell asleep ~11:00 PM. Woke up at 2:20 AM thirsty, shivering. Used restroom and stomach started to feel &#39;off&#39; or &#39;upset,&#39; followed by ~45 minutes of dry heaving. After bouts of dry heaving ended, instantly overheated and began sweating profusely (to the point I was as wet as if I had just gotten out of the shower). Eventually fell asleep again. Day after - headache, body aches, sweating alternating with chills. Feels like flu now (6:50 PM 17 April)

                                                Pt was sitting in post-vaccination area for his 15 minute observation time when he passed out after a few minutes. He had fallen onto the floor beside his chair. I immediately went out to pt. His eyes were fluttering. I shook pt and asked if he was okay. Pt opened his eyes and sat up seemed disoriented and said that he felt nauseated. I told pt to lay down on his back and elevate his feet on the chair, and told my technician to grab a bucket, an ice pack, and to call code white. We applied the ice pack to pts head. A member of management and an EMT who happened to be in the store reported over very shortly. Pt said he did think that he hit his head and his head did hurt. We asked the pt if he wanted us to call an ambulance. Pt said no, he was feeling a little better and he just wanted to wait a little bit and then finish his shopping. Pt was feeling better and was able to get back into the chair and sit. Pt appeared pale and we got him a drink of water. Pt sat and rested for sometime and after about an hour he said he was okay and was going to finish his shopping.

I felt the pain above my stomach, below my sternum, and above my heart, and it was a sharp, stabbing pain. My heart was also beating faster than normal.  The stabbing chest pain continued for the next few hours before eventually subsiding. However, for the next few days I occasionally felt a fleeting, stabbing chest pain. After a few days, it went away completely. I had never had such a sustained chest pain before.

                                                The patient was administered the vaccination, observed for 15 minutes following the vaccination, after which he left to return to work at a pharmacy. The patient came back into the store about on hour later to pick up some things for his pharmacy and reported feeling a little chest pain. The patient was then informed to keep monitoring the pain and if it got any worse to go to the doctors office. About 2 hours later, the patient called when on the way to the emergency room and reported chest pain and a fever of 102 degrees (at the highest). Around 3pm, which was about 6 hours after the vaccination was administered, the patient reported chest pain was alleviated and that the emergency room treated him for a migraine/nausea with Tylenol #3, Fioricet and Zofran.

Laid in bed all day, fell asleep around 10PM. 3:30AM woke up panicking with fever, tremors, chills, myalgia and very lethargic. Got out of bed to get tylenol and was shaking.  Tuesday morning - woke up feeling the same as I did at 330 AM, plus no appetite on top of headache, chills, myalgia, lethargic and slept pretty much all day, felt fatigued. Wednesday was doing better, thought it was the end. Then suddenly about 7-8pm started having chills and shivering.  I would say Thursday night is when I actually felt better and by Friday morning I was good with just residual ?brain fog/feeling dazed?

                                                Adverse event started with nausea, chills, and body aches across the body. At 6:00 AM, I became very hungry, ate breakfast, and took two 500mg acetaminophen tablets which resulted in relief from body aches. I fell back asleep, woke up at 9:00 AM and was hungry again so I ate more food. I became hungry again at 12:00 PM and ate again. At 2:00 PM the body aches returned, I took two 500mg  acetaminophen tablets and fell asleep until 3:30 PM. At 4:00 PM I became hungry again and ate. At 6:00 PM I ate another meal. At 9:00 PM I took two 500mg  acetaminophen tablets and went to sleep. When I woke up the next day all symptoms had subsided.

                                                24 hours after the second Moderna dose, I began to feel very weak with a strong headache and a low grade fever. By Thursday (48 hours after vaccination) the headache was very strong and by that night it was debilitating. The fever had increased as well to between 101-102 degrees. Thursday night Friday I treated symptoms with alternating doses of Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, which succeeded in reducing the fever but did not rid of the headache. Saturday the debilitating headache persisted with extreme light sensitivity and nausea. The pain became so great Saturday night that my wife took me to the Emergency Room. There they performed a brain scan with an MRI that came back normal and treated the pain with Morphine. I was sent home around 8am Sunday morning with a prescription for Toradol. The pain did not decrease with the Toradol and by 6pm Sunday I was vomiting blood and the pain was excruciating. At the advice of my primary care doctor, I went back to the Emergency Room. In the Emergency department they performed a Lumbar Puncture and collected spinal fluid for testing, as well as blood for lab work. The pain was managed with Fentanyl. Late that evening the Hospital admitted me. I was given two more MRI&#39;s of the brain - one with contrast. I also underwent an upper scope of my esophagus, stomach, and upper colon which found 3 small ulcers likely due to the high volume of NSAID pain relievers taken over the previous days. The lumbar puncture revealed that my white blood cell count was 51 and they officially diagnosed aseptic meningitis.

                                                First night after receiving 2nd dose of the Moderna Vaccine,  I experienced a high fever and chills, sweating and a disturbing Ringing in my head. The second day after was roughly the same as the first night. I expected some of these symptoms and was willing to power through them.   It is now past 2 weeks since I have had the Vaccine. I still have a maddening Ringing in my head. Different than a Ringing in my ears. It does not feel the same. I feel pressure in my head, resulting in constant headaches that never subside. I have felt nauseous at random times, stomach pain from not being able to eat, and I am for the first time in my life experiencing anxiety and depression. I feel like my pain will never go away and I am scared. This pressure/pain in my head accompanied with the constant ringing is driving me insane. I have lost time at work, lost time with friends and family trying to sleep off my pain and symptoms but it never helps. I have taken headache medication which helps a small amount for the head pain, but leaves me with an upset stomach. I can not take these pain pills any more.  My Doctor, had me do a blood test and we are awaiting results as of today 5/25/21. I do not think they will find anything that will be able to help me with what I feel this Vaccine has done to me. I do not know what to do besides try not to cry myself to sleep anymore. I hate this and I do not want to feel this way anymore.

He stated he was feeling nauseous. I led him to a private space and had him lie down. He stated that his lips were tingling.  I gave him 25mg liquid diphenhydramine and continued to observe. He said throat was very dry and feeling worse. I contacted 911 and they came to the clinic to evaluate the patient. They checked blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate and rhythm. At 5:25 he decided he was feeling a little better and he refused transport by the ambulance. We arranged for an emergency contact to come pick him up.
