                                                On the fourth day after receiving the first dose of Moderna Covid 19, I started experiencing abdominal which doctors determined was appendicitis. I had laparoscopic surgery for it. Don&#39;t know if there is any causal effect between the vaccine and my developing appendicitis. Info online says  Pfizer, not so much Moderna, more than double the number of clinical development volunteers developed appendicitis than did those that took the placebo. Am just reporting; don&#39;t know if there is a causal effect.

The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

                                                Hallucinations; Dizziness; Fatigue; Nausea; Vomiting; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning her husband, a 77-year-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On an unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: unknown) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 01 Mar 2021, approximately three days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 03 Mar 2021, after second dose of vaccine, the patient experienced nausea and vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, and hallucinations. The event hallucinations were considered to be medically significant. The patient was also not been out bed for seven days. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not applicable.    The outcome of the events, hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events (dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding these event (hallucination) has been provided at this time. Medical history and concomitant medications are required for assessment. However, further information has been requested. However, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting are expected for mRNA1273.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I would have taken him to the ER had I been home.  When I returned home around 11am, he was having a very hard time breathing.  I got him a rescue inhaler to use.  He had a dailysis treatment that day, during the treatment they kept him on oxygen.  I called Dr office to inform them, they ordered a new inhaler and told me if the symptoms did not decrease by 72 hours to inform them.  His breathing did get somewhat better but he did not have his enegry levels that he had previously or his appeatite.  12 days after his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine he went into cardiac arrest in the home with myself and husband present.

                                                Currently waiting for dental work (crown removal and replacement to treat cavity).    2/18/21 Started to experience toothache (R) which got worse as the day progressed.  Tylenol didn&#39;t help.  Took one tab of Percocet (5-325) to allow me to sleep.    2/19/21 Contacted dentist and was prescribed Penicillin VK 500 mg. Started Penicillin around 3 pm.   2/19/21 ~6 pm onset shakes, chills, sweating, low grade fever (~100.2), nausea, headache, weakness,  difficulty in standing.  Took more tylenol, lay down, fell asleep for approximately 3 hours. Woke briefly took my nighttime meds (atrovastatin, metoprolol, ranolazine, baby aspirin.) Additional information for Item 18:  2/20/21 Felt better when I woke up.  Temp normal. Ate breakfast.  Mild stomach ache. Around 3 pm onset of sweating and chills, shakes. Low grade temp (~100)   2/22/21 Fully recovered.  No lingering issues.  Not sure whether what I experienced is related to the Moderna vaccine or a reaction to the Percocet I took to alleviate the severe pain associated with my toothache.

                                                Patient is an 79 year old male who had his 2nd Moderna vaccination in his dominant right arm Thursday afternoon.  Upon awakening Friday morning, he had difficulty walking.  His legs were strong enough to hold him, but he was unstable.  He also had some numbness on the palmar surfaces of some index and middle fingers of his left hand.  His speech was somewhat garbled, but when his wife would encourage him to repeat himself, he could enunciate more clearly.  He had some nonspecific difficulty swallowing.  He attributed this all to adverse reaction to the vaccination, which would pass...  Friday mid day his wife took him to the barber, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  Later in the day on Friday they went for car ride, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  He had no other episodes of nausea.  He had no fevers or chills.  He had no visual disturbances.  He had no other numbness or paresthesias.  He was aware of no clear weakness.  Finally today, the gait instability persisted and the numbness in the left hand, so he came to the ER for evaluation.   Patient is currently recovering in the hospital

He was admitted 12/25 with hypogycemia and mild weakness and sent home He was given his first dose of the Moderna vaccine 1/4/21 at approximately 9AM covid vaccine clinic He developed weakness the next day  (1/5) prompting admission to a hospital and then transition to subacute rehabilitation briefly  Work up at hospital revealed progressive respiratory failure and pneumonia requiring intubation and progressive ascending weakness and sensory loss without upper motor neuron changes.  MRI : nerve root enhancement LP : protein 40, &#43;/- 80 lymphocytes, cultures negative B 12 and B6 normal extensive CSF testing still pending campylobacter and Musk antibodies negative Neurology diagnosed likely AIDP (Guillain-Barre) and an EMG is planned for the near future.  Neurology felt the cause of his GBS was likely his covid infection verses his Moderna vaccination He was treated with plasmapheresis.  Client received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and zosyn and doxycycline when progressive leukocytosis and procalcitonin elevation was noted. Candida was cultured from tracheal aspirates but felt most likely d/t colonization with an option to treat further if he did not continue to improve. He is now extubated, unable to swallow and has profound weakness and distal sensory loss. He will transition to Acute rehab in the near future.  Comorbidities:as described in the above section and... DM2, CKD3, HTN, DJD, BPH ( h/o prostate surgery), h/o Lumbar surgery and hernia repair, GERD, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia.  Possible etiologies of his AIDP ( GBS)  would include his recent covid infection, the Moderna Vaccine, or other undiagnosed infection. He got his flu shot 9/25 ( fluzone sanofi) so this is not likely to be the culprit

                                                Acute pancreatitis; Acute renal failure; Low blood pressure; Weakness; Decreased appetite; Fatigue; Alanine aminotransferase increased; Aspartate aminotransferase increased; Troponin increased; Lipase increased; Blood bilirubin increased; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning an 81-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed an odd presentation of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue.  The patient&#39;s medical history included advanced dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism and possible leukemia. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 08 Jan 2021, three days after vaccination, the patient developed symptoms of weakness, decreased appetite, and fatigue.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted into the hospital with a diagnosis of low blood pressure,acute renal failure,acute pancreatitis,alanine aminotransferase increased,aspartate aminotransferase increased, troponin increased,lipase increased and blood bilirubin increased. Abnormal lab results included &#34;significantly elevated&#34; aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, lipase up to 1900, and &#34;slightly elevated&#34; troponin of 0.079.  On 13 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had improved, and he was discharged. Treatment for the event included two liters of intravenous fluid and supportive care.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.    The events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, were considered resolved on 13 Jan 2021.   The physician assessed the events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, as not related to mRNA-1273. The physician&#39;s rationale was that the patient may have had a gallstone obstructing the pancreatic duct and once the stone passed, the patient got better with supportive care and slow administration of fluids.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 81-year-old male patient with medical history of dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and possible leukemia, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, the non-serious listed event of fatigue, and the non-serious unlisted events of weakness, decreased appetite, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated alanine transaminase, elevated bilirubin, elevated lipase, and elevated troponin.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on the current available information and in agreement with the physician reporter&#39;s assessment, the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273, noting the rapid improvement after administration of IV fluids.

The patient&#39;s medical history included afib (atrial fibrillation). Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included finasteride, warfarin, sotalol, simvastatin, mesalamine, metoprolol, and oxygen.   On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient reported that he felt a little nausea for the first few days after vaccine administration.  On 25 Jan 2021, the patient woke up at 1:00 AM with hives on his right arm from the elbow to the shoulder. He stated the hives were painful to touch. The patient took diphenhydramine and the hives disappeared that morning. Later that day, the patient developed difficulty breathing and the hives appeared on his left arm from the elbow to shoulder.  The patient went to the emergency room and was hospitalized overnight due to breathing issues. He was given diphenhydramine and steroids and was released from the hospital on 26 Jan 2021.

                                                My dad got the Moderna Vaccine on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 in his left arm at the Mall injection site for the Health Department. He was told that the side effects could mean his arm hurting, tiredness, headache, and even a low grade fever. Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021. We have no doubt my dad, following the instructions of the injection facility, thought he was just experiencing the side effects of the vaccine. He had no chance. Had this injection been done in the RIGHT arm, perhaps he could have recognized the arm numbness being that of an impending heart attack. We really miss Dad. He served this country with distinction for over 50 years, and we believe his country failed him.

The patient&#39;s medical history included 3 stents in the heart and angina.  Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 03 Feb 2021, approximately 26 hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number unknown) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The reporter stated that 26 hours after receiving the vaccine, he had a stomachache that lasted for 10 hours. The patient also experienced nausea and vomited 1 time.  Early in the week of 08 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing angina, which he stated he had not had for a very long time. The patient reported that no treatment medications were taken for these side effects.  The patient stated that he will follow up with his cardiologist.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the event, angina, was unknown.  The events, stomachache, nausea, and vomiting, were considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event of abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. The patient&#39;s medical history of 3 stents in the heart and angina confounds to the causality of Angina Pectoris.

When I woke up at 1:00 am my lips and my tongue were in lots of trouble. Its hard to describe, somewhere between numbness and whatever. They sent an ambulance, they looked at it and had me move my tongue and said the area wasn&#39;t swollen so they said it would be ok sooner or later. The second day that was a little bit improved but even until now my lips are not normal. By the second day i was having a swallowing problem, the back of my throat feels like the top of my throat. Even when I swallow saliva its not good. But i am still able to eat. So lips and throat are still a problem. When I went to get the shot I was quite able to walk but not long distance. By the second day i began to have a problem in my back, I assume just muscular unless something is wrong in the vertebrate. I can barely walk now, I just shuffle one foot ahead of the other. At any moment if I move I just collapse. I&#39;m always using a cane and always have something to hold on to because I don&#39;t know the next minute I&#39;m going to go down, it is very bad.
