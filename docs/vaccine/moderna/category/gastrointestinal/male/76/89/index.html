Took two rolaids and set on toliet in case I needed to throw up or had dirarerra.  Nothing happened so 30 minutes later took acid reducer pill and went back to bed.  Saturday morning pooped and it was black.  Extremely tired all day and about 11:00pm again got an upset stomach.  Threw up dark red liquid and had dirarerra and it was black.  Sunday again extremely tired and drank lots of water and avoided alcohol drinks.  (Had drank some beer on Friday and Saturday.)  Poop still black but no upset stomach.  Monday felt much better and poop became more brown.  By Tuesday I felt back to normal.

More relevant is the increase in systolic blood pressure by over 20 pts.

                                                On the fourth day after receiving the first dose of Moderna Covid 19, I started experiencing abdominal which doctors determined was appendicitis. I had laparoscopic surgery for it. Don&#39;t know if there is any causal effect between the vaccine and my developing appendicitis. Info online says  Pfizer, not so much Moderna, more than double the number of clinical development volunteers developed appendicitis than did those that took the placebo. Am just reporting; don&#39;t know if there is a causal effect.

                                                Reported via Nurse Triage / PCP:  Fainted earlier, eyes rolled back, mouth was drooping. Nausea, weakness, and chills. BP was 107/75, HR in the 70s. Currently alert and resting.  States that patient had his 2nd covid vaccine yesterday AM and then develop chills and clammy skin last night.  Symptoms worsened today and patient became weak and fainted.  Was unconscious for about 5 minutes and while unconscious, mouth was open and drooling and became incontinent and eyes rolled back in head.  Is awake and alert now, but still weak and only able to take 1 or 2 steps.  No chest pain or breathing difficulty and no fever.  Feeling very nauseous.  Caller requesting prescription for zofran.      Yesterday AM 2nd vaccine. Last night chills. This AM feeling weak. Today at 11am he felt weak with ambulation. He fainted. Was unconscious for 5 min. Had drooping of the face. He was unresponsive during this time. Had incontinence of urine. Then became awake but very weak still. Only able to walk a few steps. He is communicating. No chest pain. No current fever. No shortness of breath. BP 107/75 with HR 70. He has been very nauseated. He is drinking only small sips of water. Does not seem like a usually COVID-19 vaccine reaction. Given the LOC with urinary incontinence and sustained weakness, I advised ER evaluation to rule out neurological issues. Pt&#39;s daughter in agreement. They will go to ER.  From Emergency Department:  Patient presenting with chief complaint of syncopal episode which was witnessed by his wife.  He reported the got dizzy and lightheaded and then passed out while seated.  The reported duration of his loss of consciousness was somewhat inconsistent, unclear how long he passed out for, there was however no postictal state.  He was not noted have any shaking or seizure activity, he did have an episode of urinary incontinence.  He has not been feeling well ever since receiving his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine.  By the time of my exam patient states that he is completely asymptomatic, he states he is feeling much better after receiving IV fluids.  His lab work is remarkable for a slightly low sodium, compared to his previous levels which were many months ago.  Unclear of the acuity of this, although upon further discussion with the patient he has been drinking large amounts of water since his vaccine trying to stay hydrated.  I advised him to substitute to some electrolyte balanced fluids and to have his sodium rechecked by his PCP to ensure that this is transient.  With negative testing and resolution of his symptoms he is stable for discharge home.  Close return precautions were given.

                                                Poor PO intake, fevers at night, body aches, excessive somnolence/sleeping, and a progressive exquisitely tender erythematous maculopapular rash. The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I would have taken him to the ER had I been home.  When I returned home around 11am, he was having a very hard time breathing.  I got him a rescue inhaler to use.  He had a dailysis treatment that day, during the treatment they kept him on oxygen.  I called Dr office to inform them, they ordered a new inhaler and told me if the symptoms did not decrease by 72 hours to inform them.  His breathing did get somewhat better but he did not have his enegry levels that he had previously or his appeatite.  12 days after his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine he went into cardiac arrest in the home with myself and husband present.

Approximately 26 hours after the vaccination extreme dizziness occurred and he lost consciousness for a few  seconds.  He was clay and completely lost his coloring . His son is a retired HCP and we took vitals and within 30 minutes after drinking electrolytes he was back to normal.  We believe he was dehyrated. He has had vertigo in the past and has a pacemaker.  His blood pressure was taken in 3 positions and within less than 30 minutes after having him hydrate all symptoms subsided.  I emailed these symptoms to his Medical Doctor.  We also had him use his pacemaker monitoring system to send a report to his healthcare specialist.

Tylenol didn&#39;t help.  Took one tab of Percocet (5-325) to allow me to sleep.    2/19/21 Contacted dentist and was prescribed Penicillin VK 500 mg. Started Penicillin around 3 pm.   2/19/21 ~6 pm onset shakes, chills, sweating, low grade fever (~100.2), nausea, headache, weakness,  difficulty in standing.  Took more tylenol, lay down, fell asleep for approximately 3 hours. Woke briefly took my nighttime meds (atrovastatin, metoprolol, ranolazine, baby aspirin.) Additional information for Item 18:  2/20/21 Felt better when I woke up.  Temp normal. Ate breakfast.  Mild stomach ache. Around 3 pm onset of sweating and chills, shakes. Low grade temp (~100)   2/22/21 Fully recovered.  No lingering issues.  Not sure whether what I experienced is related to the Moderna vaccine or a reaction to the Percocet I took to alleviate the severe pain associated with my toothache.

He fell on the floor and was unable to get up.  His face was very flushed and he broke out in a sweat several times.  We had to have fire dept come and pick him up off the floor.  He was able to get around a little bit with a walker, but spent most of the day in bed and was transported to bathroom by wheelchair.  He was also a bit confused.  He had very little appetite and was unable to eat very much.  At dinner time, he ate a little bit of soup and when he stood up at the table, fell again onto wood floor.  We had to call fire dept to pick him up from floor and EMT&#39;s/ambulance to come out and check him over.  VItals were all normal.  He was just a little bit better on the next several days.  We made an appointment for him to see Dr. on 3/3.  Doctor did blood work which came back normal. Pt. is still not back to normal.

Over the course of the day I alternated taking Ibuprofen (200mg) and Acetaminophen (500mg) every two hours for eight hours to drive down the temperature.  I also pushed water, and took naps.  I continued this treatment throughout the day of Feb. 19, and once on Saturday, Feb. 20.  I experienced a deep degree of lethargy beginning these days and continuing for several days later.  I did not &#34;feel like my old self&#34; until Friday, Feb. 2, eight days following the vaccination.

                                                Patient is an 79 year old male who had his 2nd Moderna vaccination in his dominant right arm Thursday afternoon.  Upon awakening Friday morning, he had difficulty walking.  His legs were strong enough to hold him, but he was unstable.  He also had some numbness on the palmar surfaces of some index and middle fingers of his left hand.  His speech was somewhat garbled, but when his wife would encourage him to repeat himself, he could enunciate more clearly.  He had some nonspecific difficulty swallowing.  He attributed this all to adverse reaction to the vaccination, which would pass...  Friday mid day his wife took him to the barber, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  Later in the day on Friday they went for car ride, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  He had no other episodes of nausea.  He had no fevers or chills.  He had no visual disturbances.  He had no other numbness or paresthesias.  He was aware of no clear weakness.  Finally today, the gait instability persisted and the numbness in the left hand, so he came to the ER for evaluation.   Patient is currently recovering in the hospital

                                                Saturday morning (30 hours after vaccination) onset of widespread abdominal pain and tenderness, extending all over the whole surface of the abdomen; tenderness to pressure over the same area; pressure accentuated the abdominal pain symptom.  The pain was associated with mild nausea.  These symptoms continued through Sunday and into Monday following vaccination.  Moderate to severe lethargy, expected with COVID vaccination.  On Monday, the symptoms stopped. No cramps, diarrhea, constipation, fever, cough, loss of smell or taste or other expected side effects of COVID or its vaccinations.  No symptoms relative to an allergic reaction.  No treatment was necessary, other than bedrest. I am a retired public health physician.  My theory:  peritoneal inflammation.  Question: should I take the second dose?

                                                Client developed a mild covid infection 12/8/21 and recovered. He was admitted 12/25 with hypogycemia and mild weakness and sent home He was given his first dose of the Moderna vaccine 1/4/21 at approximately 9AM covid vaccine clinic He developed weakness the next day  (1/5) prompting admission to a hospital and then transition to subacute rehabilitation briefly  Work up at hospital revealed progressive respiratory failure and pneumonia requiring intubation and progressive ascending weakness and sensory loss without upper motor neuron changes.  MRI : nerve root enhancement LP : protein 40, &#43;/- 80 lymphocytes, cultures negative B 12 and B6 normal extensive CSF testing still pending campylobacter and Musk antibodies negative Neurology diagnosed likely AIDP (Guillain-Barre) and an EMG is planned for the near future.  Neurology felt the cause of his GBS was likely his covid infection verses his Moderna vaccination He was treated with plasmapheresis.  Client received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and zosyn and doxycycline when progressive leukocytosis and procalcitonin elevation was noted. Candida was cultured from tracheal aspirates but felt most likely d/t colonization with an option to treat further if he did not continue to improve. He is now extubated, unable to swallow and has profound weakness and distal sensory loss. He will transition to Acute rehab in the near future.  Comorbidities:as described in the above section and... DM2, CKD3, HTN, DJD, BPH ( h/o prostate surgery), h/o Lumbar surgery and hernia repair, GERD, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia.  Possible etiologies of his AIDP ( GBS)  would include his recent covid infection, the Moderna Vaccine, or other undiagnosed infection. He got his flu shot 9/25 ( fluzone sanofi) so this is not likely to be the culprit

I advised that he remain seated or lying down, to give Tylenol per dosage on pkg/bottle.  To call 911 if symptoms worsen.  Wife stated that  did have COVID infection in Sept. 2020.  He walks with walker.  I called wife back at 1:50 pm.  States  took Tylenol, fever went down to 99, and he has been able to keep small amt of fluid down.  He has remained seated to avoid risk of falling.  Wife has him urinating in bucket.  Re-emphasized calling PCP to consult, or 911 if symptoms worsen.  To continue Tylenol per pkg instructions.  Wife voiced understanding.

At the time of the report, ABDOMINAL PAIN (Abdominal pain), COMPLICATION ASSOCIATED WITH DEVICE (complication associated with device) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (pain in arm) had resolved, STOMA SITE HYPERGRANULATION (stoma site granulation) and DEMENTIA (Dementia aggravated) outcome was unknown and MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (stiffness), MUSCLE RIGIDITY (rigidity), DYSPHAGIA (swallowing disorder), FREEZING PHENOMENON (freezing phenomenon) and BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (worsened blood pressure fluctuation) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 08-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal Abdominal: Revealed the internal retention plate of the G tube was rubbing up against the abdominal wall causing the pain. On 08-Mar-2021, X-ray: abnormal Abdominal unclear; PEG J Placement was okay. On 10-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal Abdomen: Balloon was pushed up against the stoma. On 10-Mar-2021, X-ray: abnormal Abdomen: PEG J Placement was okay.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered PAIN IN EXTREMITY (pain in arm) to be probably related and ABDOMINAL PAIN (Abdominal pain), STOMA SITE HYPERGRANULATION (stoma site granulation), COMPLICATION ASSOCIATED WITH DEVICE (complication associated with device), WRONG TECHNIQUE IN PRODUCT USAGE PROCESS (wrong technique in product usage process), STOMA SITE PAIN (stoma site pain), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (stiffness), MUSCLE RIGIDITY (rigidity), DYSPHAGIA (swallowing disorder), FREEZING PHENOMENON (freezing phenomenon), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (worsened blood pressure fluctuation) and DEMENTIA (Dementia aggravated) to be not related.    Treatment: The patient&#39;s PEG tube was moved back in from position 2 to position 4.  The patient received treatment with silver nitrate and trimethobenzamide (Tigan).

The patient&#39;s medical history included advanced dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism and possible leukemia. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 08 Jan 2021, three days after vaccination, the patient developed symptoms of weakness, decreased appetite, and fatigue.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted into the hospital with a diagnosis of low blood pressure,acute renal failure,acute pancreatitis,alanine aminotransferase increased,aspartate aminotransferase increased, troponin increased,lipase increased and blood bilirubin increased. Abnormal lab results included &#34;significantly elevated&#34; aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, lipase up to 1900, and &#34;slightly elevated&#34; troponin of 0.079.  On 13 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had improved, and he was discharged. Treatment for the event included two liters of intravenous fluid and supportive care.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.    The events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, were considered resolved on 13 Jan 2021.   The physician assessed the events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, as not related to mRNA-1273. The physician&#39;s rationale was that the patient may have had a gallstone obstructing the pancreatic duct and once the stone passed, the patient got better with supportive care and slow administration of fluids.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 81-year-old male patient with medical history of dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and possible leukemia, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, the non-serious listed event of fatigue, and the non-serious unlisted events of weakness, decreased appetite, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated alanine transaminase, elevated bilirubin, elevated lipase, and elevated troponin.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on the current available information and in agreement with the physician reporter&#39;s assessment, the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273, noting the rapid improvement after administration of IV fluids.

On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient reported that he felt a little nausea for the first few days after vaccine administration.  On 25 Jan 2021, the patient woke up at 1:00 AM with hives on his right arm from the elbow to the shoulder. He stated the hives were painful to touch. The patient took diphenhydramine and the hives disappeared that morning. Later that day, the patient developed difficulty breathing and the hives appeared on his left arm from the elbow to shoulder.  The patient went to the emergency room and was hospitalized overnight due to breathing issues. He was given diphenhydramine and steroids and was released from the hospital on 26 Jan 2021.    On 27 Jan 2021, the hives reappeared from the patient&#39;s hands, spreading to the arms, shoulders, head, neck, and face. He described some of the hives as being nearly a quarter-inch high and he stated they looked like water blisters.  On 28 Jan 2021, the patient went to the emergency room again because he was having a lot of trouble breathing.   On an unknown date, the patient&#39;s legs had also itched but there were no spots.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events, nausea, hives, difficulty breathing, legs have also itched, and hives painful to touch, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 81 year old, male patient, with medical history of atrial fibrillation, who experienced serious unexpected event of dyspnoea, and non-serious unexpected events of urticaria, pruritus, pain, and non-serious expected event of nausea.

                                                My dad got the Moderna Vaccine on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 in his left arm at the Mall injection site for the Health Department. He was told that the side effects could mean his arm hurting, tiredness, headache, and even a low grade fever. Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021. We have no doubt my dad, following the instructions of the injection facility, thought he was just experiencing the side effects of the vaccine. He had no chance. Had this injection been done in the RIGHT arm, perhaps he could have recognized the arm numbness being that of an impending heart attack. We really miss Dad. He served this country with distinction for over 50 years, and we believe his country failed him.

The patient&#39;s medical history included 3 stents in the heart and angina.  Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 03 Feb 2021, approximately 26 hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number unknown) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The reporter stated that 26 hours after receiving the vaccine, he had a stomachache that lasted for 10 hours. The patient also experienced nausea and vomited 1 time.  Early in the week of 08 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing angina, which he stated he had not had for a very long time. The patient reported that no treatment medications were taken for these side effects.  The patient stated that he will follow up with his cardiologist.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the event, angina, was unknown.  The events, stomachache, nausea, and vomiting, were considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event of abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. The patient&#39;s medical history of 3 stents in the heart and angina confounds to the causality of Angina Pectoris.

PTA bowel obstruction led to a syncopal episode following use of laxative, and several episodes of vomiting in the days prior . Upon admission Patient was receiving conservative therapy for a partial obstruction when he developed increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory status and eventually developed significant hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Neurology was consulted for altered mentation in the setting of respiratory failure. Patient with ascending paralysis. MRI of the head and neck as well as CTA were obtained x2. Patient was ultimately diagnosed with Guillain-Barre, variant and received 5 days of Intravenous Immune Globulin therapy.  Patient&#39;s small bowel obstruction resolved and ultimately patient required percutaneous tracheostomy tube and gastrostomy tube placement for prolonged respiratory failure and neurologic compromise.  The patient had uneventful ventilatory requirements and ultimately was performing intermittent spontaneous breathing trials; however, still had episodes of apnea, but improved.  He was tolerating tube feeds at goal with resolution of his small bowel obstruction, which was thought secondary to his Guillain-Barre.  The patient did develop abnormal LFTs which were thought secondary to cholecystitis not requiring operative intervention, with improving LFT findings on antibiotics.  The patient had a nonobstructive cholecystitis.  The patient&#39;s mentation was improving to the point where he was able to communicate and open his eyes upon discharge, as well as was working with Physical Therapy for strengthening.  He was able to move his upper extremities and followed commands and lower extremities were improving in strength as well. Patient was discharged via private air flight to acute care ICU facility.

In addition, my chest was wheezing and felt as if &#34;bubbles&#34; were in my chest. My arm felt very hot and tender at the injection site. This attack lasted for half an hour. I went back to sleep and awoke the following morning feeling very weak and confused. Feeling extremely fatigued, all I wanted to do was sleep. I also lost my appetite. The next day, I had occasional coughing which subsided with my over the counter cough medicine.

He noted that the injection was done in his left arm and the left side of his body is what is reacting so strongly.

                                                Initially, the night of January 18, the left arm was somewhat sore as expected. The next day, within about 24 hours after the injection, I felt slightly queasy, somewhat weak, what we called on the farm, being &#34;off our feed.&#34; The left arm was increasingly painful, although I slept reasonably well that night. On the second day after the injection (Wednesday, January 20), the left arm was even more painful, I was actually nauseous, weak,  and in the afternoon had a temperature of 99.8 (my normal temperature is 97.4). I had some abdominal pain for a few weeks before the injection and that pain had increased. But by bed time (about 10:30 p.m. CST) the temperature had returned near normal and I was feeling much better. Today, Thursday, January 21, I felt normal, no general weakness and minimal abdominal pain, and there was only very slight soreness in the left arm. My wife (81 years old with a history of nut allergies and asthma) received an injection at the same time I did and had minimal side effects from the Moderna vaccine with the same Lot Number. I note the EUA Fact Sheet says the Modern vaccine is still being studied so I hope is a small contribution.

Pain was slightly relieved by burping and passing wind. After 3 hours of these symptoms I Called EMS, who checked and could find no other cause other than reaction to the injection. I took pepcid, gas pills and additional blood pressure pill but had no relief. After EMS visit I took Tylenol and was up for hours before finally falling asleep. Awoke this morning with no cramping but still very tender in abdominal area. Additionally I had a muscle cramp in my upper thigh this morning

Went back to bed, he went to sleep and the next morning 2/13/21, wife got up and when he got up around 7:30 he was dressed, but not buttoned right and had his hat on and was confused.  He sat in front of the fireplace not moving, and starting talking nonsense until 9:00 - 9:30 when he started talking to her.  He could not differentiate between morning and night, and then slowly progressed back to normal.  Did not eat much, and said that he could eat anymore.

                                                I came home and found my father on the floor in his bedroom just after 8am.  He was disoriented and unable to get up.  I had to lift him up and he was still off balanced.  I asked him if he had fallen and how long he was on the floor.  He couldn&#39;t give me a clear answer and I don&#39;t know how long he was on the floor.  I noticed he seemed very weak and I asked him when was the last time he had something to eat and he wasn&#39;t sure.  He said maybe 1 or 2 days.  I asked if he didn&#39;t have an appetite and he couldn&#39;t answer me or give me a reason.

Comes to the emergency department today after getting his 1st Monday and a COVID-19 vaccine at 7:30 p.m. and about 5 minutes after while sitting down developing significant diaphoresis, nausea, dizziness and feeling very warm.  The symptoms lasted for about 15 minutes and then resolved.  Since then the patient has felt a little off in his stomach but has not had any difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, chest pain, diarrhea, rash or itchiness.  With this episode the patient did not have any changes to his vision or feel like he was going to pass out.  Patient will be given 25 of Benadryl, 125 of Solu-Medrol, 20 of famotidine of concern for possible allergic reaction.  Additionally the patient will be given a small bolus of normal saline.  Given the patient&#39;s reassuring vitals and reassuring physical exam he will simply be monitored here were sure.  I do not feel any lab workup is necessary this point this is resolved episode seems either like a mild allergic reaction or a vasovagal episode.

When I woke up at 1:00 am my lips and my tongue were in lots of trouble. Its hard to describe, somewhere between numbness and whatever. They sent an ambulance, they looked at it and had me move my tongue and said the area wasn&#39;t swollen so they said it would be ok sooner or later. The second day that was a little bit improved but even until now my lips are not normal. By the second day i was having a swallowing problem, the back of my throat feels like the top of my throat. Even when I swallow saliva its not good. But i am still able to eat. So lips and throat are still a problem. When I went to get the shot I was quite able to walk but not long distance. By the second day i began to have a problem in my back, I assume just muscular unless something is wrong in the vertebrate. I can barely walk now, I just shuffle one foot ahead of the other. At any moment if I move I just collapse. I&#39;m always using a cane and always have something to hold on to because I don&#39;t know the next minute I&#39;m going to go down, it is very bad.

                                                I received a Moderna vaccine injection on January 19, 2021 at approximately 3:15 p.m.  Later that evening at about 7:40 p.m, I was suddenly hit with pain in my back like someone had hit me with a board.  The pain continued to surround the midsection in a swath of about 15 inches.  I felt like my muscles were failing me.  I made it to my bed where I started shivering and shaking uncontrollably feeling like I was having a seizure.  The shaking was sporadic, lasting about an hour. I was covered with a blanket and continued with liquids for dehydration and was given an Xanax to calm nerves. Later that night while attempting to sleep, I was perspiring and my heart was beating 90 to 100 beats hindering sleep.  Through the night I attempted to go to the bathroom but with absolutely no control over my arms and legs I was unable to stand.  Rolling off the bed and unable to pull myself back, I lay on the floor and pulled a cover over me.   At about 4:30 a.m. (Wednesday morning.) I was covered with another blanket and a pillow was put under my head.  I slept until awakened at about 11 a.m  My heart rate and oxygen level was chedked and appeared to be within normal range.  I was greatly fatigued, and light-headed. Continuing a regimen of liquids, I was fed a small amount of soup and some fruit. I ate nothing the rest of the day. I slept most of the day.  In the evening, I was fatigued and nauseated and spent 2-3 hours through the night on my knees in the bathroom attempting to vomit.   Thursday morning I was awakened around 11.a.m. and was barely able to lift my head.  I slept more until needing to use the bathroom and receiving more liquids. Two hours later I was able to eat only a half a piece of toast ? the first and only thing I was able to eat that day.  Early evening having no control of  my legs, I attempted to walk. It was difficult getting legs out of the covers, but I got up and walked a few feet with the help of a walker. However, an hour later (about 8:30) I went to the bathroom and was unable to pull myself up from the toilet and fell to the floor and crawl flat on my stomach to my bed.  I had no strength in my legs and arms and needed assistance from two people to put me on my bed. Periodic rapid heartbeat and fatigue caused restless sleep. Some strength began to return on Friday and with caution over the weekend, and support from a loving family, I appear to be making a slow recovery.  Checking with several family medical people working in hospitals, my experience with the serum seemed more extreme than most.  Therefore, it was felt that I should report some information on how the Moderna injection affected me that it may be of help to others. (Some of the above information was related to me as I was not always cognizant of conditions at particular times.) I am still puzzled, as members of my family are, as to what happened to me.  We would be grateful for any information that might be helpful for us to understand my situation as it relates to others that may have had similar experiences with the Moderna serum.
