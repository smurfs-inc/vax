I didn&#39;t experience any diarrhea or vomiting that night.  The stomach cramps were enough to keep me up for most of the night, but not as bad as food poisoning.  The next morning when I got out of bed I immediately got sick and vomited.  I was very shaky and light headed.  These symptoms continued until about 7 pm on the 30th.

I felt very short of breath. worst when walking and talking that improved with me sitting. Nausea with lots of drool. Around 4:30 I started feeling body aches . Then at 5 on my way home, i started feeling extreme pain in my joints, to where i couldnt hold the steering wheel tight. Around 7:30 I started having shaking and aching. Around 9:30 I ate potatoes, and took motrin and it helped a little. I felt weak and washed out like I ran a marathon.  I was still feeling fatigue and wiped out, I had no energy.  I took my pulse ox and it was 95-96.  I am now having muscle pain at the injection site, and injection site is very sore.

                                                1/5/2021 - Day 1:  R) deltoid pain at injection site around 1600, mild headache viewing around 2100 when going to bed. I took ibuprofen prophylactically to prevent pain getting worse.  1/6/2021- Day 2 around 00:00, I was woken up out of bed with severe body aches all over. Mostly to bilateral hip joints and lower. Arm pain and headache were barely noticeable d/t other pain. Pain radiated to arms down to both shins. It hurt to touch skin and took ibuprofen around 0130-0200. It was so bad I couldn&#39;t roll my body up without assistance and I&#39;d need to use restroom for almost 2 hours at this point. Had to call out of work because I knew this pain wouldn&#39;t go away in a few hours in addition to lack of sleep, I knew it&#39;d be better to rest with OTC, rest, And heating pad.  Later this day I was still feeling the same, went to store to get something for body aches. It wasn&#39;t until I was in this store, when my left femur bone hurt so bad I had to grab onto a shelf. I felt my bone was about to break - scary. (My1 st time experience the bone pain symptom) Later at home same day, spent an hour going back and forth to bathroom with large loose/water diarrhea. I slept most of the day, as I was too fatigued to do simple tasks. Went to bed around 21:00 after taking ibuprofen, laying on heated and covered in electric blanket.  1/7/2020 woke up at 05:50 to get ready for work and instantly felt the pain again and headache, I&#39;m usually not so tired after sleeping, so contributed that to same fatigue. Although is not pounding, still dull.  1/7/2021 0900 took my HCTZ, Propranolol, and Potassium. Today the pain is not as high, but better than yesterday. I expect to feel a lot better tomorrow to go into work.

                                                On the afternoon/evening of 1/7/2021 my arm became sore around the injection site. It was also a little red. On 1/8/2021 @ 1:30am I woke up with nausea,  chills and my arm was swollen, red, hot to touch. I took tylenol and went back to sleep. When I got up around 6am that morning my symptoms were worse. I went to the emergency room at this time. I was treated there for cellulitis with IV ceftriaxone and prescribed a 10 day course of cefdinir. It is slowly getting better, however, I had to return to urgent care yesterday due to increase in redness and have now been presribed prednisone and will also finish antibiotics.

Woke up in the middle of the night with chills, severe arm pain and my temp was 100.1F, I went back to bed and next day no energy, I stayed in bed most of the day. A shower would take all my energy. No taste I had appetite though. The only thing I could taste was salt, no flavor. Nauseous for the next few days, general malaise. 3/4 days I could only stand crackers and ginger ale. Thursday night I started having taste again. I went to the Drive Thru clinic and they tested me for Flu strand A and B and covid and all negative. The following week I got tested again and it came back negative as well.

                                                typical side effects with in the first 48 hours. then 8 days post injection began to have side effects again. Began with an itchy arm at injection site and thought nothing of it b/c there were not marks. by the end of that Sunday my arm was red and warm with round spots. I took some Cetirizine and used a topical cortisone. Monday morning I woke to two lumps, itchiness, heat, tenderness, sore muscles, headache. I took some APAP and IBU and applied some more cortisone, went about my day with a two hour car ride and a walk. i was stiff through the day so i completed stretches several times through the day. When i got home that night most of my major joints hurt enough that I could not sleep through the night even with Naproxen 440 mg , APAP 1000 mg, Cetirizine 10 mg on board. My arm began to be more swollen, my nervous system began to be off. I had no appetite, was dizzy, felt shaky but when I held my arm and hand out, I did not shake. I have continued on a with Naproxen an d APAP since Tuesday after read not to take PO IBU if had Moderna vaccine.  I have not been able to complete house hold chores, missed three days of work, and been able to be with family.  As of today, January 22nd 2021, thirteen days post injection I still have fatigue, intermittent dizziness, loss of appetite, joint pain, headache with no relief with OTC&#39;s. The redness, swelling, heat have dissipated in left arm at and near injection site.

                                                Got my vaccine early morning.  Left arm where injection site given,  started to become really sore 30 minutes after injection.  I ate breakfast at around 9:30am. Went to my Doctor&#39;s appointment for 1030am, started having mild chills that would come and go. After Doctor&#39;s appointment,  around 1130-12pm, started to feel nauseous and loss of thirst and appetite.  I called the vaccine line at my job at around 2:59pm, but nurse just stated nothing to do right now, to call back following morning.  I knew things would get worse so I made the judgement call to call out this was close to 4pm. My chills started increasing,  despite not having any high temp was 98.9 f. Then around 5pm started having mild joint pain all over my body. Around 7pm joint pain got unbearable,  that I even started to shiver from more chills and pain.  I couldn&#39;t sleep,  except just laying and tossing and turning in bed, I also started having stomach cramping . Finally I fell asleep at around 12:30 midnight,  due to the pain. I finally woke up around 3:30am, took 2 Motrins. Then I woke up around 06:30am with body aches all over. Last night just took sips of ginger ale, didn&#39;t eat anything since 9:30am yesterday.  Finally had a small breakfast at around 7:30am with a glass of water. Still feel warm at times, with body aches, and nausea.  Will call vaccine line again today.

The patient&#39;s medical history included a propensity for fainting and low blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient got dizzy, had nausea, a little vomit, and fainted to the floor. She reported feeling dizzy, hot and sweaty.  Patient did not take medication to treat her symptoms.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, fainted, dizziness, felt hot, nausea and vomiting, and sweaty were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 40-year-old female patient with medical history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the unlisted event of Syncope which was considered medically significant. Additionally, the patient experienced the non-serious listed events of Nausea and Vomiting, and the non-serious unlisted events of Feeling Hot, Dizziness and Hyperhidrosis. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. We would note that the patient&#39;s history of propensity for fainting and low blood pressure could be also contributory.

                                                One hour after vaccine, arm began to hurt then progressed to hurting so much I could not lift it for two days without significant pain. By 7 hours after vaccine, chills and fatigue started and I could not get warm. That same night upset stomach and migraine as well as hot sweats between the chills. No fevers noted. These symptoms worsened on the next day. Very fatigued all day and little to no appetite. Sunday started improving but easily fatigued with walking more than 100 feet. Still little appetite. Able to eat half usual amount at dinner that night. No chills anymore. Still sweats. Monday still easily fatigued but not as bad as sunday. Appetite improving. Still sweats with minimal exertion.

                                                Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

I had a low grade fever of 99.9 that went up to 100.0 measured by ear thermometer  I had joint pain and over all muscle pain By the evening I had mucous in nose, post nasal drip and slight difficulty breathing. I took 2 advils which relieved the fever and body aches On Saturday and into Sunday, I continue to have an over arching malaise, I do not feel healthy.  I feel like my body is fighting something, I developed a slight sore throat and my head feels heavy and foggy. I&#39;ve continued to take advil.

Patient reports that shortly after receiving her vaccine in her left arm she developed the sensation of her throat closing and a &#34;film &#34;in the back of her throat.  Patient has also reported feeling nauseated and having a throat clearing cough.  No chest pain, headache, abdominal pain or development of a rash.  Injection site appears to be unremarkable. Patient is given some antihistamine medications as well as steroids and observed here in the ED.  The patient has improvement in her sensation of her throat closing and is able to be discharged.  I discussed with the patient the usefulness of continued antihistamines over the course of the next few days and would likely advise on not receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine based on her reaction to the first.  Discussed with the patient the use of epinephrine and EpiPen as needed.  See discharge instructions.  Patient is discharged home with her sister in improved condition.

This lasted about 2 hours and then subsided.  For the last week, I&#39;ve had off and on headaches and feelings of tiredness.  I&#39;ve also had soreness in left arm at the injection site.  Yesterday, 1/5/2021 I noticed increased redness, warmth and a raised area at the injection site.  It&#39;s hard and a little itchy.  I&#39;ve also had soreness in my neck and arm pitt.  I have reached out to employee health through the hospital that i work at and whom i recieved that vaccine from in regards to my symptoms.  The only invervention I&#39;ve taken has been taking tylenol for a headache.

                                                I received the injection around 2:15 pm.  There were no immediate effects. By late afternoon/early evening, my arm was a bit sore and later started to feel warm near the injection site.  However, I otherwise felt fine.  At 9 pm, I suddenly became very dizzy and passed out for several minutes. When I regained consciousness, I felt a little short of breath, which resolved within 20 minutes or so. However, I was also extremely nauseous, which got worse any time I tried to move. This continued for several hours.  I also alternated between being very warm and chills during this time - it was like waves of heat. I did not have a fever. Later, my head began to hurt and I took tylenol to help with that. I also had diarrhea. These symptoms began to gradually lessen after a couple of hours and I was able to fall asleep around 12:30 pm. I woke up hot and sweaty several times throughout the night. The following day, 1/6, I was very tired and had a headache and could not eat much, but otherwise felt much better.

I had COVID-19 disease in September, so I was expecting to have a robust response to the vaccine. I received my Moderna vaccine on 12/29. I developed fever, shaking chills, and terrible body aches about 13 hours after the dose. I felt a bit better in the morning, so I went to work as usual but was still sore with body aches. I developed shaking chills, nausea, and worsening aches at lunch time and left work early because the nausea and chills were so significant. I slept the remainder of the day and by the morning of 12/31 felt well again. My symptoms probably lasted around 24-30 hours total. I did miss a half day of work but otherwise had no significant effects.

I felt like I couldn?t get warm.  No fever.  Took 800 mg of Ibuprofen l, went to bed.   Still felt like I couldn?t get warm.   At about 2:00 am I suddenly awoke to severe nausea and thought I was going to vomit, but it didn?t come up.  Then, I felt like I was going to have diarrhea.  No BM.  Went back to bed eventually and continued to have chills and hot sweats back and forth. Nausea and stomach turning feeling  off and on.  No fever.  Normal temperature.  1/8 stayed home from work due to nausea.  Off and on during the day today and some light chills about 5 times so far.  Some headache and possible shoulder stiffness.

Fever broke this am on 1/10/21, still feeling slightly fatigued with discomfort behind my eyes but improving from yesterday.

At 3 am that morning , I had 102. fever. By the time fever broke, my arm had a goose egg the size of an actual egg.  The fever continued off and on the next 24 hours. The next day, my arm was swelling more about the size of a lemon. My whole arm was swelling. I then called my ER doctor. It felt like a hard lump. The fever I had again 102.3. I took Tylenol and Motrin and could not break fever. My heart rate went up to 125 from the fever. The next day, I felt achy, chills, nausea and then they subsided. It took about a week for the arm swelling to resolve.

Feeling nauseous again this morning and have a persistent headache again today.

                                                Severe headache, nausea and cold sensation occurred within a few hours of receiving the vaccine.  Arm discomfort and fatigue quickly followed.  Low grade fever noted approximately 8 hours post vaccine.   I took acetaminophen.  Headache, fatigue, and fever/chills resolved within about 48 hours.  Nausea and arm discomfort persisted for about 5 days.   After approximately 48 hours, I noted vision changes, blurry up-close vision.  This change might have occurred sooner, but it was not until this time that I felt well enough to really read.  The change in vision led me to seek further evaluation in the emergency room on 1/16/2021.

                                                Approximately 36 hours of fever of 101, chills, shivering, sweats, aches and pain in every joint in my body, back pain, headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, nausea, difficulty completing my daily work duties and household activities due to pain and not feeling well. This was not much helped by Alleve, therefore I took Tylenol which was mildly helpful. After the first 36 hours, the symptoms lessened in severity and lasted for about another 12 hours. After that, I felt well for several days in a row, then about 1 week later I felt sore, weak, tired and nauseous. This resolved in its own in about 2 hours. I have felt well since then. I am choosing to receive my second dose of moderna vaccine tomorrow, because I would rather experience these side effects then catch COVID ever again. I caught COVID19 in March 2020. With my COVID infection, I was sick for about 21 days with fever of 101 and more, bone pain, body aches, chest pain, back pain, headaches, nausea, shaking chills, sweats, trouble breathing, dyspnea, cough, runny nose, sore throat, pink eye, dizziness, tiredness, ?brain fog? and fatigue. I was not hospitalized. After about 21 days I began to recover, but the first week after my recovery began I was very weak and tired, and spent most of my time sleeping. I was 41 years old at the time, with health problems including well controlled asthma and being overweight. I never wish to experience this again and I am grateful that I am receiving the Modena vaccine. Thank you so much for logging my side effects.

This is typical for me when I am starting to fight something off.  I was managing okay until around 1pm when I started to low grade fever at 99.8.  By around 4pm, my body was really starting to ache and I was getting chills.  After the training, I took some Thera Flu, but I couldn?t really move from the couch to the bed because my body was so sore.  My fever fluctuated between high 99?s to low 100?s.  I felt like I got hit by a truck.  I managed to fall asleep around 8:00pm and was able to sleep until 1:00am.  I took more Thera Flu, water, and was able to fall back to sleep at 3:00ish am. 1/23/21:  I woke again at 11:00am and my aching was still there but not nearly as bad as the previous day but now I felt heavy congestion in my head and chest.  I also had sneezing, and a stuffy then runny nose off and on throughout the day.  I was also very, very tired and had no energy to do anything but lay there.  Today is when the diarrhea started 1/24/21:  Body aches at this point are still tolerable but I?m sore.  My arm injection site is bruising and starting to itch and still slightly warm to the touch.  I have sneezing, a dry cough, and an off and on runny nose and diarrhea  1/25/21:  Body aches are mild today, dry cough is here, post nasal drip mucus I am assuming as well.  All I want to do is sleep.  I?m so tired.  No diarrhea today so far but I haven?t had anything to eat yet.

I took ibuprofen for the pain which didn?t help. Symptoms resolved by the following morning.

She was assisted to the ground in a supine position and given one EpiPen injection, with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. Upon arrival to ED, she does endorse some diffuse itching over her body, but airway is asymptomatic. She denies taking Benadryl, Zyrtec, or any other antihistamines today.  o Of note, on the day of her first vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, she had gradually developed symptoms including severe fatigue, muscle aches, and headache. The following day, she also developed increased redness, hives, and similar itching to her presentation today, which she describes feeling like &#34;bugs crawling inside.&#34; She subsequently had a virtual visit with her PCP on 1/7, who prescribed her an EpiPen and Zyrtec. She has had resolution of these symptoms and has had no other complaints since.

The next morning I experienced brain fog, inability to formulate thoughts correctly, difficulty thinking, lack of concentration, muscle soreness, aches all over body, tired easily, shortness of breath, fever, chills,  and nausea.  36 hours after receiving vaccine, I still feel uneasy on my feet, light headedness, muscle soreness, stiff neck, nose bleeds, headache, nausea and extreme fatigue.

Then my legs started to feel heavy and numb, then my face felt numb and then my arms. I could barely pick something up and I could not stand. Then my jaw started to shake and so did my legs. I went to the ER and they said I was having a shock/panic attack response to the vaccine. On Monday 1/25 I woke up in extreme stomach pain and went back to the ER and they said I needed to have my appendix out. I went to a hospital where they tried to just give me antibiotics, but still had to have my appendix out on Wednesday 1/27.

                                                I started with severe bloating and constipation. Then it progressed over a 12-15 hour period to vomiting and abdominal pain. I went to the emergency room of Hospital, and was diagnosed with appendicitis. I had an emergency appendectomy. I have never previously experienced constipation or symptoms related to appendicitis.   After reading about a possible increase in Bell&#39;s palsy and appendicitis in the clinic trials, I wanted to err on the side of caution and submit this incident for data purposes and tracking.

                                                Chills began within 2 hours of injection.  Fever rose to 101 within 6 hours and lasted for approximately 48 hours.  Chills lasted the entire time the fever lasted.  After the fever came down to below 100, bodyache became more recognizable.  Most unusual pain, which began while the temperature was above 100, was in the muscles connecting my neck to the shoulders, more severely on the left-side where the injection was administered.  The pain was so severe that it felt the muscle was tense, numb and itchy at the same time. The severity of the pain made it feel like the throat was closing up even though I knew it was not true because I did not have trouble breathing.  This pain lasted (in similar intensity) approximately about 36 hours. After this, on the third day, most of the pain was gone but I experienced dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea.  I had a loss of appetite the whole time (over 72 hours) I was experiencing these side effect symptoms.

Both the pharmacy and the health dept. refused to record our reactions, and the health dept. hung up when we tried to report this incident. The pharmacy would not call us back.

I kept saying it felt like my whole body was floppy and melting into the couch, and I couldn?t motivate to stand or do anything for 24 hours.  Then myalgias and nausea continued for 2 days.  Around the same time as the malaise, I developed a palpable indurated area under the vaccine site.  Then day 8 my entire shoulder swelled up with overlying red leathery skin and axillary pain but no adenopathy.  Day 10, back to normal except for some residual red pruritic skin extending down my arm.

                                                Thursday night shortly after the vaccine I was exhausted and headed home to go lay down. While driving, I developed a severe headache. I went home and went to sleep really early. Friday morning, woke up, went to work. Extreme lethargy and severe headache. Left work early (2 ish) with joint pain, headache, lethargy. In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and &#34;buzzing&#34; throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled. Still lethargy and dizzy yesterday but no joint pain, no nausea. Now, Monday morning, still dizzy/lightheaded. Symptoms are subsiding, but not gone.

                                                Extremely sore arm started a few hours after I received the injection. About 8 hours after receiving the injection I experienced flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, body aches, headache, upset stomach, malaise, overall ill feeling. Those lasted for 24 hours and started to subside on day 2 after the injection. On day 3 after the injection I was feeling better with only some minor aches and a little bit of a decreased appetite.

By that evening my headache was still there and I had the chills and felt exhausted. For next three days after I had a normal headache on and off accompanied by nausea. Tylenol slightly relieved the headache. The last few days I have been feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; but the headache is gone. I noticed my lymph nodes were a little swollen which I am thinking is what caused the headaches.

For 24-48 hours after injection had nausea, fatigue, dizziness off and on - swelling of right eye about the same. 72 hours after injection noticed moderate swelling of both eyes, right worse than left and swelling of upper lip. Also had some numbness and tingling to upper palate and back of throat.

Swelling of lip and numbness and tingling of throat resolved after 2-3 doses of benadryl.

The observation nurse gave be a Benadryl and water.  within the next minutes my whole body started tingling, I felt nauseas, and felt like I was going to pass out. The nurse laid me on the ground.  I asked her to take my BP and pulse.  For me it was high 145/98.  My pulse was also reported t be high.  I was able to swallow and breath.  I continued to have waves up and down my whole body of tingling, nasusea and cold sweats.  The nurse called my husband to come.  I was able to sit up after about 20 minutes.  The waves of feeling sick continued for about an hour.  After having some food and drink about 2 hours later I was able to drive home.  I was exhausted, nauseous, and had a headache the next 2 days.  I am concerned to get my second vaccine.

                                                On the 1st day, I had a migraine. 2nd day (29th) fever, chills, nausea, vomiting - woke up with it and that lasted about four or five days And I had meds to treat it.. Went to work but had to leave work - acutely ill. When I went home, I had a rash across my abdomen. On the 30th I went to urgent care, I had a rash across my neck when I woke up. Rash kept spreading. They gave me a prescription for steroids and a cocktail of meds to reduce spread of rash. Watched me for 30 min to make sure I wasn&#39;t having airway restrictions and they sent me home. Had it for a week and a half. Went to PCP and came up with an action plan to get my next shot.

                                                After the vaccination I felt like I was drunk and tired which lasted about 2 days.  On day 3 I developed a horrible headache and the muscle behind the eye was throbbing and hurting really bad with nausea associated for about 5 days.  It made me feel manic and felt as if I was in a psychotic state which lasted from 12/28-1/26 .

                                                Around 730-8 I got a really bad headache. Throughout the night my back tightened up and my hips. I got up tp get ready to go to work, I felt really  light headed while I was brushing my teeth but went in to work. I started felling shortened of breathe and achy. I started feeling  bad and told my Head Nurse and he took my BP and I have a fever. My heart beat was rapid. I went home, slept and had no appetite . The I ended up going to the Hospital  my chest was hurting bad in my lung area, everything about me just hurt I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  They did xray on my lungs, they were clear, my BP was still high, my heart rate had calmed down. They had me sit and relax. The next day I woke up and was ready to put my scrubs on, it was like nothing has ever happened to me. I felt worse with the vaccine then I did when I got the Covid, all I had with Covid headache.  Everything hit so rapid and fast after the shot.

                                                I received my second dose of the moderna vaccine on a Sunday at 10:30 am in my left deltoid.   Symptoms started with chills and swollen supraclavicular lymph nodes around 10:30 that night, and progressed to body aches,  joint pain, muscle pain,  and a low grade fever.   I was unable to sleep due to chills and pain.   The muscle pain would radiate down my arms and legs, and I would sometimes have a pinpoint sharp pain in the bottom of my left foot.  Symptoms persisted the next day, and also included extreme fatigue, nausea, and enlarged and painful axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  The  supraclavicular lymph nodes were large enough to visibly see.   A round rash/redness started around the injection site started on Monday as well.   This also occurred with the first vaccine, but is much larger this time.   Most symptoms had resolved as of Tuesday, except for fatigue and the rash which are still on going.

Also on December 30th my left eye began to swell. I took benadryl that evening before going to  bed, but woke up the next morning December 31st with both eyes swollen. The left eye being worse and now under the eye was red and extremely itchy. Contacted employee health at hospital on December 30th and 31st. where vaccine was given and left a message detailing  my side effects. Contacted my own primary dr on December 31st and was seen by Dr who believes I have had an allergic reaction to Moderna vaccine. I was prescribed predinsone and zyrtec for 5 days.

By the time I arrived home around 3 pm I had chills, achiness but never ran a fever. This went on throughout that evening. When I woke up the next day I felt great until approximately 1000 am and then began having diarrhea. That lasted for about 5 hours. I had some soreness in my L arm where the shot was given however the following  Monday (1-4-21) I had a hard lump where the shot was given and a red rash that appeared. The rash has improved today but is not completely gone.&#34;

                                                The patient had a previous reaction to a flu vaccine.  She was treated for Bell&#39;s Palsy related to the flu vaccine 3 years ago.  The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

Pain and swelling moved down into armpit and below followed by extreme itching.  Swelling and pain then moved down to left elbow. Then I developed throat itching, difficulty swallowing and wheezing. I also developed joint pain in opposite shoulder. I  immediately took 600 mg Ibuprofen and 50 mg Benadryl .  Itching, redness, and wheezing, and difficulty swallowing resolved about 30 minutes after taking the medication.  Next morning (today) I still have pain and swelling around injection site. Pain in left elbow and right shoulder joints. I still have moderate pain and edema below left armpit.

Then like half of my body was cut head to toe in half and the left side of my body went numb and tingly. I could barely move my extremeties. Tounge began to burn like a 9volt battery was being held on it. I was taken to the ER and was told I had a rash on my chest neck and chin. I was treated with Epi IM, Benedryl, famotdine, then had epi again because my tounge felt fat and like a 9volt battery again. Epi went IV second does and had extreme pain with that. Had IV tylenol . Along with IV fluids. For the next 5 days I have had pain in my right harm , shoulder , neck into my head to the tip of my nose. The first 4 days were so bad that I could barely move and would get nauseated and throw up if I moved just right. each day the pains in my right arm,shoulder, neck and head did get better by about 25 percent each day. You could feel it getting better with each day I woke up.  I was also having ear pain that seemed to be worse on 1/19/21. A PA checked my ears and said they were clear.Today, 1/22/21 is the first day I have been able to turn my head without being so sore and feeling nauseated. I was also very fatigued until today, 1/22/21. My hips and lower body are sore today and upper body seems to be less sore by 75%. I still am numb at times in my feet and fingers but can turn my head a lot better today.

She had a nurse check her blood pressure and it was 101/65 and her heart rate was 138 bpm.  She felt presyncopal so she went to the ED for evaluation.  By the time she got to the ED, she felt her throat was scratchy, and when she would lie down flat she felt her throat was occluding.  She notes that she is s/p tonsillectomy in 12-2020, and considered whether that was playing a role in her symptoms, but she had not had any of those throat symptoms for 1 week prior to getting her COVID-19 vaccine.  In the ED, she was given IV medications and IV fluids.  ENT was consulted.  Her symptoms got better with medications, she is still experiencing some throat dryness but otherwise is feeling back to her usual self.  She never had any rash, flushing, itching.  She had a little tenderness at the injection site only.  She never had any difficulty breathing, lip/eye/tongue swelling, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, vomiting/diarrhea/abdominal pain.  She did have nausea when she felt vertigo.

After sleeping from 12am until 11am the next morning, I awoke with fever and extreme exhaustion. I was unable to get out of bed  or stay awake until 5pm, an hour after taking Tylenol.  I also experienced. brain fog for several days after vaccination.

But worst is inability to lift left arm, severe left arm pain, even joint pain in left wrist. Could barely lift L arm on day 2 after (Sunday) and again unable to lift it day 3 after (Monday).  First dose, I had arm pain, trouble lifting it 1 day, pain for a week and mild soreness for the whole month. Pre-existing joint pains from autoimmune were worse for a week, but this second dose - it only seems to be vaccine side, including left jaw, left eye pain, left collarbone pain near a previously affected injury.

The next day, muscle aches &amp; chills continued, and were joined by exhaustion, fatigue, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, migraines, chest congestion (for one day).  The symptoms continued to worsen each day, and on 2/09, I vomited and went to the clinic.  I tested negative for Covid-19, (both the rapid and 3 day tests), negative for the flu, negative for strep.  I started taking Excedrin for the migraines, and it helped, but prior to that, no medicine was working.  I continued to rest and take Excedrin.  Daily symptoms continued to include:  migraine, fatigue, chills &amp; aches, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, could only warm drinks &amp; bland food.  Also nausea, short of breath.  These symptoms continued to slowly improve, but I had them through 2/19.

When I woke up the next morning, the site was raised and swollen more than the night before. It had the appearance of cellulitis. It was still hot to the touch. I marked the edges of the rash and it progressively got bigger over the course of 48 hours. I still have a mark on my arm where the rash was. I also had severe jaw and neck pain. I felt like my wisdom teeth were pulled with no lidocaine.  I has boughts of nausea and was very tired. I tried to put ice on the area of my arm that was swollen, but it did not help.

                                                Received vaccine on 3/3/21 at 2:30pm. Waited for 20 minutes at pharmacy for allergic reaction. Given the all clear, so headed home. Around 5pm, I started noticing how extremely sore my left arm was, almost as if somebody had hit it with a baseball bat (no bruising, redness, etc., just VERY sore). I also started noticing numbness and tingling in my left arm that traveled down the outside of my arm into my left hand and into my left pinky finger.   As the evening progressed, I lost my appetite, developed a headache, felt extremely fatigued, was dizzy, had muscle and joint aches, had left kidney pain, and began to feel flushed and hot. I took my temperature and it showed I was running a low-grade fever of 98.7F (my normal temperature is anywhere between 96.9F and 97.1F). I went to bed around 9pm.  Around 3am (which is now 3/4/21), I woke up with nausea, and my left arm/hand/finger really experiencing numbness and tingling (it&#39;s as if that portion of my arm/hand/finger was semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was on the verge of throwing up. I broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed and went back to sleep.  Around 5am (still 3/4/21), I woke up again with nausea and my left arm/hand/finger still numb and tingling (semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was again on the verge of throwing up. I, again, broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed. I decided to take a Zofran around 6am for the nausea.  I slept from 8am-12pm on 3/4/21 due to the Zofran. When I woke up, I called the pharmacist at pharmacy to notify them of my symptoms. The pharmacist everything I experienced was normal and should go away in 2-3 days (if they didn&#39;t then contact my regular doctor), that I could take Tylenol for any pain, and I still needed to keep my follow-up appointment for the second shot.  The entire day on 3/4/21 from 12pm until I went to bed around 10pm, I still experienced an extremely sore arm, loss of appetite, slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, muscle and joint aches, left kidney pain, low-grade fever (for me), and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger.  I was able to sleep through the night, and woke up around 6am on 3/5/21. Currently, I am still experiencing an extremely sore arm, fatigue, and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger. I am EXTREMELY concerned about the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger as it does not seem to be getting better.

                                                At about 2:20 am the morning post injection I awoke with a SEVERE headache and nausea. I began vomiting shortly thereafter and continued to vomit for several hours. It wasn&#39;t until late the evening after the vaccine that I was able to hold down solid food. The headache continued until the next day and I experienced extreme fatigue (Although that&#39;s likely due to the lack of sleep and vomiting for several hours).

On 12/25/2020 she reports after 1200 pm noting feeling of fatigue, sl. cough with SOB noted, and fever of 100.4. On 12/26/2020 she reports having sorethroat, fevers around the 100 range, but denies cough. On 12/28/2020 she got tested for Covid due to having s/s mentioned above. She was found to be Covid  positive on 12/28/2020. She was seen in the ER with s/s of some loose stools, mild pleuritic cough, mild fever and pulse oximetry in the 80 range. She was placed on an Albuterol inhaler and 6 days of Dexamethasone 6 mg with instructions to not to return to work at least until 01/11/2021. Our local Health Department felt a VAERS form should be completed since she became Covid positive and required medical treatment even though she could have had the exposure prior to receiving the vaccine.

My body felt the way it did when I had a CAT scan with contrast. Like something through my body in addition to the dizziness. I got super nauseous too. The dizziness subsided in about 10 minutes. The nauseous stayed for about 12 hrs. Anti-nauseous meds did help throughout the day. I was fine the next day

I then had dizziness, nausea, unbalanced when walking, chest pain, feeling like my heart was racing,  palpatations, muscle weakness in my legs, and brain fog. The unbalanced feeling, dizziness, weakness ,and occasional palpatations remain. I had a covid test done on 1/6/2021.I had sinus pain started on 1/8/2021. I am being treated for possible sinus infection with Augmentin that I started on 1/11/2021 but my symptoms are still present . I have been unable to work because when I walk I feel dizzy and unsteady.  I have follow up with my primary doctor on 1/18/2021.

                                                Diarrhea started in the afternoon the day after the first dose. Bowel movements have been loose continuously and  mild cramping at times. Diet/medications/vitamins have not changed. Tried adding yogurt to diet for good bacteria in the gut. It may helped for the day, but then stools are loose again.

                                                At injection, some vaccine trickled out of the arm. Increased soreness and swelling that day and for the next few days resolved on their own. Same day as injection, I experienced mild nausea and dizziness. Resolved with rest and time by the end of the day. On 1/23, my left arm at the injection site was swollen, hot, and red. Large red area present that grew bigger the next day. No other symptoms. Was prescribed Keflex on Sunday (1/24)  by covering HCP (telephone call). Saw my dermatologist for a scheduled appointment who said it was not cellulitis but a delayed allergic reaction. I stopped Keflex on 1/26. On 1/27, symptoms have improved. Small circumference, less redness, and swelling.

Sore arm the next day, a quarter sized red area that was a bit itchy.

I continued to run a temp all day on Saturday, had body aches, joint and muscle pain. I also became very nauseated and lethargic. I had headaches the entire time

                                                1 week after injection I woke up with severely swollen lymph nodes in neck, swollen throat and could barely swallow. Right arm at site of injection 1 week prior was acutely hard, elevated, red, warm and tender to touch.  I immediately took a benadryl and 5 mg predniosne tablet, water, elevated position to rest. Swelling of lymph nodes in neck improved and gradually resolved 3-4 days later. Right arm redness and size of affected area doubled over the next two days, but then started improving. Resolved in about 8 days.

                                                Left leg began hurting one hour after shot.  Throat started to swell causing increased clearing of throat,  swollen glands, with difficulty swallowing.  Throat, esophagus was swollen 5 hours later.  Went to emergency room and was given Benedryl, Epinephrine, Pepcid, and Solumedrol.  Kept in ER for 8 hours, Throat still swollen, but better, provided second doses of Benedryl and Epinephrine, then admitted for observation for 24 hours.   Throat and swallowing difficulties continued for approximately 3 days after discharge.   Hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, having to push liquids and food into diaphram was uncomfortable.

                                                Slight right  facial numbness half hour post administration lasting 30 mins. Chills and Rt arm site pain and swelling on the first night. 2nd night, chills and increased swelling, pain to right arm site with slight weeping, warm to touch and redness. Throughout the first two weeks, I would have intermittent chills and right arm site redness, swelling, pain, warmth was gradually getting better but did not have any fever the first 13 days.  The night of 2/15/2021, I felt the chills, body aches and went to sleep. All night I felt I was about to get a fever. I was in bed until 1pm the next day on 2/16/21 when I started to have the severe tremors with my chills, back spasms, abdominal pain, and nausea. I got out of bed, took my temp and it was 101.5 F orally. I tried to take Tylenol but I could not because as soon as I sipped some water, I started vomiting yellow emesis first and then later on I was already vomiting greenish bile. I was getting weaker, lethargic and my tremors and chills were getting worst as well as my back spasms and abdominal pain. My husband, then brought me to the ER around 2:30-3pm. I was admitted in ICU for septic shock with unknown source on that day, 2/16/2021. I was on levophed drip via right chest central venous catheter for 48 hours and was given multiple antibiotics until discharged to home on 2/20/21. I developed red facial rashes more prominent to the right side on the second day of admission. Two days after discharge, I had headaches for two days with right shoulder pain. But, on the next day which was the 3rd day post hospitalization, I broke out with generalized reddened, raised, itchy and burning rashes. My husband brought me back to the ER on that day on 2/24/21. ER MD loaded me with dexamethasone steroid IV and Benadryl IV and sent me home with oral dexamethasone and anti-histamine orally. I saw my primary MD on 2/26/2021 for hospital follow up and referred me to Infectious disease MD and Endriconologist. On March 3rd, I was started on insulin SQ due to my blood sugars running 300?s to almost 400. As of now, my MD is still adjusting my insulin dosage due to persistent high blood sugar readings of 300-400 mg/dL.

Day 2: residual headache (50%), tiredness, weakness, sweating if doing things, residual knee joint pain, sense of smell/taste returned and heightened. Day 3: residual headache (25%), still not 100%, residual knee joint pain. Day 4 (today):  residual knee joint pain (comes and goes). I realize that these are not symptoms of an allergic reaction, but severe side effects.

                                                About 4-5 minutes after receiving the shot, experienced heart racing (180 bpm), and feeling faint.  Breathing was fine.  Felt slightly tight in the throat.  Also experienced diarrhea twice within the 40 minutes following the vaccine.   The heart racing and faint feeling lasted about 5 minutes.  The throat tightness lasted closer to 1.5 hours, but was never severe- just noticeable.  Within 2 hours of the vaccine, was feeling much better.  Never experienced actual difficulty breathing.  I reported to employee health RN and personal physician.

                                                Was fatigued and had headache since about hour after shot day before, and was nauseated morning after shot but was tollerable.  About 1 pm was sitting at my desk when felt flush and neck hurt. Noted rash across neck and upper torso, swelling at lymph node L side neck area. Area was painful to light touch. Pt (self) went to urgent care to be further evaluated by someone else other than patient, once there began to get worse.  All over tingling but significant at fingers, toes and mouth lips. Unable to talk clearly, but never  became confused. So tired unable to stay awake; difficult to rouse. No difficulty with breathing; Epi was not needed or given. Transported to hospital via EMS due to inability to stay awake and difficulty speaking/unable to stand without assistance. It was very hard to talk - to get the words out - but I never did have any decline in mental thought process and was never disorientated. Looked intoxicated however.  At hospital when pt transferred from stretcher to bed, pt doubled over due to abdominal discomfort - it was where the EKG stickers were. All reflexes noted to be hyper - MD kicked on accident when checking reflexes. the EKG stickers felt like being punched or slapped. Needed assistance transferring. All over numbness/tingling noted. Breathing never affected. Symptoms resolved after a few hours.

                                                Approximately 25 mins post Moderna COVID-19 vaccination, pt had bilateral hand swelling and her throat started to fell scratchy.   50mg IM Benadryl administered in R arm within 1 minute. Pt has no difficulty breathing, no urticaria, hives, redness or visible swelling on chest, face, or neck.  Post Benadryl administration, pt  has no difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, and hand swelling is decreasing.  Pt states she feels slightly dizzy and was briefly nauseous after Benadryl admin.  Pt wants to refuse.  EMS called a medical center for high-risk refusal and a doctor gave permission to refuse.  Pt&#39;s husband is driving pt home and will monitor pt for next 24 hours.  EMS also called Poison Control, who said there&#39;s nothing they can or will do. Our Medical Director was consulted and advised EMS to patch for HRR and to have pt follow up with an immunologist/allergist before receiving dose 2 of Moderna V&#43;COVID-19 vaccination.  Our EMS Chief will be following up with the patient later today.

With cool wash cloth crackers and water it went away after 10 minutes. I hadn&#39;t eaten before I came in and I was nervous also. An hour later I started feeling the heat through my body again, but not as bad. I started getting a horrible burning in my stomach. It lasted around 4 hours. The other side effects were the temperature, flu like symptoms, and tiredness .

On Jan 4 2021 my bp and pulse were elevated, I had increased chest burning, headache and was admitted to the hospital to rule out MI.  The ct scan showed mild pancreatitis, endoscopy negative. I didn?t have a period for the month of Jan and I am neg for pregnancy. I continue to have esophageal, chest and back burning. I feel better now. I am scheduled to have my second vaccine Thursday Jan 21st and I am nervous. Not sure if this is an adverse reaction or coincidence.

Several hours later, I was still nauseated and unable to hold anything down and my torso and stomach was in pain. I dealt with the pain for 2 more days and eventually went to the ER on Sunday 2/6. After a blood test and a CT scan, I was informed that I had an inflammed pancreas (pancreatitis).

Extreme fatigue .  has lasted over 6 weeks now. at two week mark noticed numbness in hands and feet that continued to spread over the next month. was dropping items cause lost hand strength,  Cold all the time and realized when I accidentally burned myself I could not feel pain on my skin anywhere. 2nd degree burn on arm legs and torso 2 weeks after vaccine which is what really made me aware of the neurological issues after the vaccine.  These neurological symtoms have increased to involve both hands and both feet and part of palms and arch of feet.  Numbness and pins and needles feeling all the time now. do not know if nerve stuff will be permanent or not.  had to go on fmla due to disability related to this.

                                                9th, in the late afternoon, I started feeling really cold and I started getting headache and a lot of arm pain. It hurt to reach out to grab steering wheel. I felt very tired. I checked my temperature - 100.5. I got really cold and shivering at about 6:00 pm and I could not warm up for about 2 hours. It went to 101.5. Horrible pounding headache and dizziness. I started having stomach issues and diarrhea but didn&#39;t vomit. That went through the night - I felt like I had the flu. Back of my  neck was really stiff and achy - from shoulders up to the back of my skull. I didn&#39;t sleep much. I woke up completely soaked in the morning. My fever had broken. SUnday, I felt a little better. Dull headache ( it came and went). My temperature would go up and down -96.8 - to 100.1-ish all day. When my temp went up I got a headache and fatigue and down my headache would be better. Rolling every four hours. Monday, I stayed at 99.2 to about 100.2. Stayed at that the whole day. I was really tired. I had trouble thinking and concentrating. My arm was feeling better by Monday. Monday afternoon, about 1:00 my fever went to 100.5 and I called the nurse then. She told me to call my doctor&#39;s office. They sent me to a call to a triage nurse and she advised me to get tested for COVID. So Tuesday morning,  the 12th,at 9:00 am - healthcare clinic - the results were negative for COVID. Tuesday, I was feeling a little better - fever stayed around 99.2 to just over 100 and the headache was dull. I wasn&#39;t quite as tired. Wednesday, I was feeling better - like I could go to work but I didn&#39;t because of my fever the day before. I went to work on Thursday or Friday. The whole next week then I was better and felt fine. I got the second dose February 1.

                                                I am quoting this from my mother as she is currently unable to type due to the shaking and shivering. &#34;It started with red hot places on both arms, and then it moved to my face. 2 1/2 hours later I began getting really nauseated and began shaking/shivering uncontrollably. I then went to urgent care and on the way there my heart was pounding and racing. After I was admitted they told me that I had tachycardia and my blood pressure was high (I do not usually have high blood pressure). They did an EKG at urgent care and noticed small changes. I was then sent to the ER and was given IV Benadryl and oral steroids. I was put on a heart monitor, and they were able to get my heart rate to go down, but a few hours later it jumped back up. At that point I was referred to a cardiologist and given a prescription for steroids, and then I was discharged. I saw the cardiologist 2 days later, during those two days I still experienced red hot spots on my arm, shortness of breath, Tachycardia, and shivering. When I went to the cardiologist, they did another EKG and said I still have tachycardia and did some bloodwork. The results of the bloodwork were normal and the cardiologist diagnosed it as an unspecified delayed severe allergic reaction. I am still experiencing symptoms and still having to use Benadryl and steroids.&#34;

                                                I got very light-headed when I got up this morning. I felt like I was going to throw up when I brushed my teeth. I then got very dizzy and fell back into bed to avoid passing out. That was 3 hours ago and I think I just need to stay in bed today.  Also - I&#39;m taking 800 mg ibuprofen q6h for the arm pain. Pain is tolerable with the medication.

                                                Two hours after the injection, I started to not feel &#34;right.&#34;  My head felt heavy, I was getting a little dizzy and all I wanted to do was to lie down.  By the third hour, my body completely shut down.  I was so tired I had no energy to move, to talk, and even breathing was difficult (not because I couldn&#39;t breathe, just that the effort was difficult).  I was dizzy, nauseous, and lost my appetite.  My temperature was elevated, 98.5, but no fever.  I slept for 5 hours as if in a coma.  Woke up to drink water, felt total-body aches, and slept the rest of the night again getting at least 12 more hours of sleep.  At some point during the night, I had chills so bad my body was shaking uncontrollably.  I had 2 layers of clothes and 3 layers of blankets and could not warm up.  Day #2 (today), I have a tremendous headache, dizzy, nauseous, my heart rate is abnormally fast and I am out of breath.  My resting heart rate is typically upper 50&#39;s and is currently averaging in the 70&#39;s, jumping into the 90&#39;s often.   Sitting up, my heart rate is between 80-100 (which is typically my rate when I exercise).  When I stand up or walk to the other room, my heart rate is around 115-120 (typical of when I am running/sprinting or participating in taxing exercise).  Along with this, I am out of breath as if I am exercising, although I am barely moving around. All I am doing is laying down, only getting up to go to the bathroom and my body feels like I ran a marathon.  Breathing is difficult even at rest.

                                                I had some common symptoms after the 1st shot.  Really run down a little nauseous arm hurt but not swollen for a couple days.  I also had some symptoms that I don?t think are common.  My arm muscle was twitching and my pinkie and ring finger were tingly and cold. All went away after a couple days.  Day 8 discovered a lump on my arm where the injection site was.  Was red, hot and a little itchy fingers tingly again.  Saw doc on day 9.  Gave antibiotics incase of cellulitis/infetion but not sure the cause.  Now that is 90% cleared up.

Additionally, the area where the vaccine was administered (left upper arm) was tender to the touch and red. On the same day, at 5:00pm all symptoms were at an extreme level where I had to lie down to rest, however, the pain of the body aches, headache, and chills made it difficult to rest (sleep) On the morning of Wednesday, January 13 and throughout the day all symptoms were still at an extreme level making it difficult to function (unable to get out of bed, no appetite to eat due to the nausea,  unable to sleep due to the headache, extreme discomfort) these symptoms continued on this level throughout the morning, into the afternoon and into the evening On the morning of Thursday, January 14 all symptoms with the exception of the nausea and headache had subsided The headache and nausea subsided by 11am on Thursday, January 14. I am now feeling better and could eat and function.

                                                Vaccine was not administered in the deltoid.  I was administered approximately 5.5 inches below the shoulder in the left arm.  The day after vaccination, the arm was painful, red, hot, hard, and swollen.  Over subsequent days, the red area increased and became itchy while remaining red, hot, hard and swollen.  The red area was a well-defined circle 10cm circle.  The skin temperature of the area was between 101-104 degrees F.   The redness and swelling resolved on day 5-6, then on day 7 (January 6) I awoke with severe nausea and my left arm was again hot, swollen, red, and itchy.  This lasted for two days.    The arm has returned to normal, except for intermittent itching that occurs sporadically, not associated with redness or edema.

                                                Nine hours after the vaccine was administered I began to have symptoms.  It started with severe chills. I bundled up and went to bed.  I woke at about 2am with severe nausea. Went to the bathroom still suffering from chills, and in severe pain from joints and muscles attempted to use the toilet and passed out.  Revived and climbed back into bed.  The next day 01/16/21 continued to have chills, nausea, and joint and muscle pain.  At 2pm on 01/16/21 started to have a rash in my stomach.  By 8pm the rash was on my stomach, and back.  Sunday 01/17/21 still having mild chills and aches, the rash is now wide spread over my torso and back.

                                                Reaction day of injection was mild (queasiness after 40 minutes).  Experienced expected mild injection site soreness days 2-4.  However, more than a week after the vaccine I developed a large, bright red, swollen, very hot to the touch painful welt the size of an adult hand at the injection site.  Tried several times to report it to Montefiore Nyack with no success (no one knew where to transfer the call).  Reaction has been ongoing for 3 days; appears to be waning at this time.

                                                About 20 minutes after vaccine my tongue swelled about 1 and 1/2 times it?s normal size. My eyes became slightly swollen, I developed a (non-itchy) rash on my cheeks and across my nose, and a fever. My tongue also was partially numb. After about 1 hour, the tongue swelling significantly decreased and the rash began to calm. About 3 hours after the vaccine I developed severe nausea (no vomiting), body aches, and a headache. My face was also partially numb. Today I woke up with severe body aches, fever, headache, nausea, diarrhea, very sore arm.

                                                Fatigue hit within a couple of hours; So tired and this was fall in to bed and be out. I slept for awhile - I rested all day the second day. I was getting dizzy and; muscle pain; a lot of joint pain (normally I&#39;m not in a lot of pain and never this tired). I needed a cane to walk I went to work on Wednesday and I had to leave early (11:30). Wed - horrible diarrhea Started getting a little confused and  still had dizziness and joint pain was bad. Couldn&#39;t take care of patients. Went to work on Thursday and I had to leave earlier yet that day - by 9:00 am - Started having chills  but didn&#39;t have fever and still had other symptoms and was getting confused.   Had an excruciating headaches and nausea (no diarrhea but extreme nausea) and that day started light and sound sensitivity - so bad. Was getting scared driving home - and had very slurred speech. Couldn&#39;t drive for a week after that(. My sister was on the phone with me helping me stay alert and drive safely on the way home from work on that Thursday.) Thursday when I got home. - had Telemed visit - Set up appt for a rapid COVID test - and a flu test so my sister drove me and I slept the whole way there. My sister said my speech was slurred; confused in my speech and I felt like that for three days. Both (Covid and flu) tests came back negative. Times when my sister couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying and I slept more than I was awake (Thursday - Saturday was like this). Took Imodium for diarrhea when I had that. For joint pain - I treated it by tramodal 50 mg and I can take it as needed and I usually don&#39;t need it but took it consistently during this time.  What scared me the most was I could feel my Hip Implant  - ball and socket joint from bone all the way to my femur( I had Right implant on Hip on May 2019) - which is healed completely but I felt it at this time. I still can&#39;t lay on my right side without pain - like a deep bone pain.  I was going to call my surgeon today.  January 4th visit with my Dr - for check-in - He gave me a clearance to go back to work on Wed the 6th. I work two days a week; I&#39;m on disability and so have been able to work since then. Right hip pain is still  a lot and bouts of dizziness and still have joint pain. Have to take a minute and a couple of breaths to stand up. Some days I do have to use may cane. Chills are gone.

                                                Angioedema of arm, face, and tongue; Difficulty swallowing; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 46-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed angioedema arm, face, and tongue and difficulty swallowing probably due to swelling.    The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included penicillin allergy, seasonal allergies, dermatological fillers and collagen fillers. Concomitant medications included Redopx and Aloim.   On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 041L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had swelling, angioedema of the arm, face and tongue. She also had difficulty swallowing, probably due to the swelling per the reporter. Treatment for the event included prednisone and diphenhydramine.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed angioedema arm, face, and tongue and difficulty swallowing probably due to swelling, were considered resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 46-year-old female patient with relevant medical history of penicillin allergy, seasonal allergies, dermatological fillers and collagen fillers who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 041L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Patient experienced the serious unlisted event of angioedema of the arm, face, and tongue and serious unlisted event of difficulty swallowing probably due to swelling. Treatment for the events included prednisone and diphenhydramine which resolved the events. Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the events occurring after receiving the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events of angioedema of the arm, face, and tongue and difficulty swallowing are possibly related to the product.

I had to increase my dose of Allegra  to BID because the itching has intensified. I am getting an increased amount of random red/swollen itchy spots, mostly in my extremities.  Other adverse events present post dose include: nausea, fatigue, mild headache and mild dizziness.

                                                Fatigue - I was unable to work that day. I was so tired. Pain - in my arm to the point that when I moved my arm I felt like I was going to pass out - it hurt that bad. I felt nauseous like I would vomit. I didn&#39;t vomit. Had a headache on day two (I have been having headaches since I had COVID in July 2020). I took Tylenol for that severe headache and that helped and it was just that one day that it was severe.  The worst, was my heart - increased heart rate - anything I did just was difficult on my heart. My heart - was having a hard time - standing, brushing my teeth - was exhausting for my body. That type of exhaustion went on for five days. I was able to feel better by day 11. But my heartrate is still poor. Depending upon what I did - 10 to 30 beats over my normal - just normal work. 40 beats over when I&#39;m attempting a more intense exercise. A slight jog puts my heartrate to 180. My heart rate still hasn&#39;t subsided yet - it is still above average above post COVID ( I had COVID in July of 2020). My heart rate was still at an elevated rate post COVID but worse after the vaccine. I have chest pressure now - like someone sitting on my chest - that started day two after the vaccine. Even when I&#39;m resting, I have chest pressure - it comes and goes and there seems to be no pattern as to why. Didn&#39;t have a doctor visit this second time yet. I treated with Tylenol for the pain at the injection site and for that headache and then I just rested my body.

COVID swab -rapid test, negative 27th - still nauseous but ate a little; injection site improved - flat hive rash from injection site down to elbow. took Ibuprofen each day once or twice a day which helped with joint aches.

                                                Received injection at 0930 on 12/29/2020 and was observed for 15 minutes after injection.  Around 1630 I developed a headache so I took a Fioricet as I have a history of migraines.  I had a few body aches and only ate toast for supper that night.  By 2330 my headache seemed to be worsening and I started experiencing a fever of 102, tremendous body aches, nausea, sore throat.  At that time I took 500 mg Tylenol at 2330.  By 2 am on 12/30/2020 my fever had reached 103 and I had difficulty walking as my body joints ached so bad.  My headache was unbearable and I asked my husband to drive me to the ER as I could no longer take the pain.  I also was hyperventilating.  In the ER I was given normal saline 500 cc, Tylenol 1000 mg IV, and Zofran 4 mg IV for the nausea.  I did fill prominently better thereafter, except I continued to have a headache. I was given Toradol 30 mg IV and advised not to take my Celebrex that day.  The ER Doctor did call and speak with ER physician, and discussed the validity of lab testing for Covid after vaccination as well as his recommendations as to whether I should receive the second dose of the vaccine. Since I did not really have anaphylaxis, the doctor recommended that I proceed with the second vaccination with extended observation. I was discharged and instructed to take Tylenol 650 mg orally every 4 hours as needed advised for fever/analgesia.

                                                Within 8 hours of shot administration, I was running fever and experiencing chills.  Ran fever (as high as 102.7) for the next 48 hours.  Lethargic, no appetite, muscle and joint aches, severe headache.  The symptoms experienced in the 48 hours after vaccine were vastly more sever than the symptoms I had when I had COVID.  Fever broke during the night on 1.21.21.  Felt much better on 1.22.21, but was still very tired and had headaches.  On 1.25.21, I awoke with a SEVERE headache on the left side of my forehead and temple.  My eye was bothering me.  When I looked in the mirror, my left eyelid was swollen and red.  The left corner of my mouth was drooping.  My doctor diagnosed me with Bell&#39;s Palsy on 1.25.21.  Symptoms are worse today.  She prescribed a steroid dose pack to help with the inflammation of the facial nerve.  Steroids were started today, 1.26.21.

Woke up the following morning with increased swelling/redness (large red circle) around injection site and hives/rash with intense itching from the waist up.  Went to clinic at work sent to allergist.  Started on 2 (24hr Allegra tabs) in am and 2 (24hr Xyzal tabs) in the pm.  High dose antihistamines continued for 1 week then weaned.  Upon weaning the dose the red/raised swollen circle got worse and spread to new tissue.  Presented back to allergist - EPI and Steroids administered and topical antihistamines applied.  Continuing to take AM/PM antihistamines the circle on my arm now is not as raised but continues to spread out from the injection site to new tissues.  Larger and larger with each passing day.  Now on day 13&#43;

I felt a little ?foggy?   I went home and went to bed , I woke up at 3am with a severe headache and nothing helped it. It felt like a jackhammer  was pounding in my head. I felt very fatigued the next day. The headache lasted about 16 hours. I woke up 1/7/21 feeling better.

                                                I got the vacine today.  Unfortunately I did have a reaction, and had to cancel my patient load at work for the day.  They said if you have food allergies you might have one, but I was willing to risk it.  They observed me for 30 min after.  After 15 min it felt like I was having a mild panick attack, but I?m used to that so I just breathed through it.  Coughed a few times.  After 30 min got up and was whoozy/dizzy, but shrugged it off, got my card and walked slowly to my car, drove 5 min home.  By then my hands were shaking hard.  It was like being shot with a crapload of adrenaline.  I called my sister and when I talked I started sobbing.  I don?t know, I just couldn?t stop.  But I knew it was just the adrenaline and if I could calm down, I?d get thru it.  She was awesome bc she kept her voice soft and low when she spoke, which helps.  After 3 hours it has calmed down and I?m just really cold and exhausted and nauseous and only a little shaky.  Being quiet and calm is helping.  Also sitting on a heating pad bc it?s 74 in my apartment and I?m freezing cold.  I?ll be ok by end of day.  I got the Moderna vacine and I?m still glad I did and thankful I could get it....but to those who are getting it...symptoms are that it feels like being shot full of adrenaline, you get a panic attack, but my O2 actually went up, not down.  Chest pain, panting, high anxiety, shaking, nausea, dizziness.

Can smell coffee, candles etc. if nose is held close. Cannot taste coffee, oranges, toothpaste, salt, mustard, etc.  Had no symptoms 1/30, 1/31, or 1/1. Starting 1/2, had a migraine (including nausea) that persisted until 1/8. As patient (me) has cluster migraines, its difficult to say if this was related to vaccine, but feel it should be noted this was an especially intense migraine week (also was with menstruation so likely &#34;normal&#34;)  Other than that, feel generally tired.

For a few seconds I felt nauseous but that quickly passed. There was no swelling, no rash,  and I never had any breathing problems. I was monitored for almost an hour. My heart rate  returned to normal.

                                                I woke up around 12:30 in the morning on the 21st of January with a headache and I took 600mg Advil.  I went back to bed and was restless and still had the same pain, so I took 975mg Tylenol. I continued to feel poorly and pain was increasing, so I used Maxalt x 2 without any relief.  I became nauseated and diaphoretic with increasing pain in my head.  I woke my husband to take me to the ER for relief.  My pain was 8 and all vital signs normal.  1 liter of Saline, Toradol 30mg IV and Zofran got the headache to a 3. I did follow up with my doctor later that day for further eval.  I have not had a headache that bad in 17 years.

On 1/28/2021 I had muscle aches, headache, fever (101) and fatigue. Also, I lost sense of taste on 1/28/2021. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen on 1/28/2021 at 12:30 pm and symptoms seemed much better by 4:00 pm on 12/28/2021. As of 1/29/2021 at 10:10 am I am asymptomatic other than sore arm at injection site and stiff neck or muscle soreness in neck on right side.

                                                Appendicitis pain; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning a 48-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced appendicitis pain.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included omeprazole, venlafaxine hydrochloride, trazodone and spironolactone. (batch number: 041L20A) On 11 Jan 2021, seventeen days prior to onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 041L20A) intramuscularly in her left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28 Jan 2021, after the vaccine administration, the patient experienced appendicitis pain, hence on 30 Jan 2021, she underwent appendicectomy.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of event, appendicitis pain was considered unknown at the time of his report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case of appendicitis in a 48-year-old, female patient 17 days after the administration of  mRNA-1273 vaccine(batch number: 041L20A) as assessed as unlikely associated with the vaccine administration based on then natural history of the disease and based on duration and outcome (appendectomy), it was most likely an ongoing inflammatory process.

I became hot, sweaty, dizzy and my head starting to buzz.  The nurse on-site provided me a couple cold packs and after about 30 minutes, I felt better. The nurse described my response as a &#34;vascular&#34; reaction.  Later that night, I got a headache and night sweats and bouts of nausea.  They only lasted a day.    Approx. 10 days after the injection,  the injection site became red, swollen, itchy and uncomfortable to the touch. Then it traveled down my arm and created a large red, swollen, itchy area on my entire upper arm.   I advised my doctor and she provided me a Rx for a topical steroid and oral steroid.    After 5 days of treatment, it is 90% better.   The injection site still hurts.

                                                Patient is hospital employee who completed screening form for COVID-19 vaccine by answering &#34;no&#34; to all contraindication questions.   Approx 10 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose # 1, patient was still in vaccine clinic area and complained of dizziness, palpitations and flushing.  I observed patient fanning herself with papers.  She was escorted out of the immediate clinic room, and assessed by paramedics present as having an anaphylactic reaction.  Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV given in clinic, Rapid Response was called overhead and patient immediately transported down the hall to the Emergency Dept. In ED, pt was noted as having swollen tongue, large areas of erythema on face, arms and chest, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (per ED physician notes).  Pt reported being hospitalized in ICU with COVID disease more than 3 months ago, including intubation (not treated at this hospital), and has been back at work since August 2020.  ED physical exam noted bilateral wheezing and patient in acute distress.  In ED, pt administered racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL via neb, epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV and epinephrine 5 mg/250 mL IV drip (started at 0.118 mcg/kg/min).  Acute symptoms reported to resolve in ED.  COVID test was negative.  ED physician discovered that pt had history of multiple medications, including previous anaphylactic reaction to radiocontrast dye requiring intubation (which was not disclosed on the vaccine screening form).  Pt admitted to Telemetry floor for observation.   Overnight course was unremarkable, and patient was discharged the following day with prescription for Prednisone taper and prescription for Epi-pen.  Advised not to return for second dose of COVID vaccine.  EMR updated to reflect possible anaphylactic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

Patient received her COVID-19 vaccination on 12/30/2020 around 1PM. Immediately after the injection in her left shoulder, she began to feel warmth and numbness in her left shoulder, arm, neck, face, and chest. She reports later experiencing nausea, palpitations, and left arm weakness. Her symptoms persisted, and her family noted a left sided facial droop which prompted her ED visit.    In the ED, patient was noted to have some left sided facial droop and left arm and leg weakness. CT head and CTA showed no acute abnormalities. Tele-neurology was consulted who recommended admission to rule out acute stroke.  Ultimately, work up was negative and symptoms resolved.  Symptoms appear to be related to the vaccine.

                                                moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Tachycardia sudden onset 4 minutes after injection (6:09am). Arms and legs cold and weak. Generalized weakness. BP 167/78, o2 sats 100%. Tachycardia lasted about 10-15minutes and resolved to HR 88 and BP 138/78.  Still left with overall weakness, malaise, cold feeling. No other symptoms.  Released from the facility at 6:48am.  Drove 2 blocks to my husband&#39;s workplace (hospital). Had diarrhea x 2, dull diffuse headache, odd feeling and malaise that persisted. Sudden onset of terrible feeling, the need to get to the ER at 8:36am. Had a bathroom visit to urinate. By the time we got to the ER the intense malaise improved. I sat in the ER lobby not wanting to be admitted to the ER (didn&#39;t want to be having a vaccine reaction). I stayed in the ER lobby. Symptoms completely resolved at 9:45am. I stayed there for 30 more minutes to be sure and then drove home with no other symptoms but Left arm soreness. Tachycardia never returned after the first episode. No rash, no itching, no swelling, no dyspnea. Just felt toxic. Then it resolved completely at hour 4.

I felt a lot of pressure behind my nose, but not a stuffy nose. The woozy feeling also brought on some nausea. I felt like I couldn&#39;t focus, like I was in a daze or fog. This lasted throughout the following day. Left arm at sight of injection was sore starting 2 hours after shot, couldn&#39;t raise left arm x2 days. Still sore but manageable. I took a zofran for the nausea.

Arm soreness developed about 8 hours after vaccine, woke next morning with fever 100.9, severe body aches, headache, nausea, weakness and fatigue, decreased appetite. In addition, as the  day went on I experienced a shallow cough, high pulse rate (130), tongue twitching and just felt aweful. Slept on and off all day, sx lasted the entire day. Took Tylenol throughout the day for the the fever. I awoke 3:30 am today, 1/10/21 with fever 101.5, took more Tylenol, still headache and feel tongue twitchiness  however muscle aches, body aches, nausea, decreased appetite and fatigue have subsided. I took 600mg Advil around 9am today and have been gradually feeling much better as of now 1:30pm. As a side note, I did have COVID 19 illness mildly in March 2020. It was dx&#39;d with PCR testing and my sx were loss of taste/smell, nausea, weight loss, bursted eye vessel, slight respiratory sx, I recovered well and had a follow up negative test 2 weeks after.

                                                Thursday January 7, 2021: Developed a hard lump around the injection site (A week to the day later).  Friday January 8, 2021: Arrived at work and around 9:30 felt short of breath. Had pulse and oxygen checked anyway; Pulse 99 (down from 107) and Oxygen 99. Dismissed it as being in my head. Proceeded through my day and it persevered.  After lunch, still felt short of breath. Contacted Infection Control nurse and was advised to leave work as it was also a COVID symptom.  Went home around 12:15; felt fatigued. Slept all day and night. Saturday January 9, 2021: Minor sore throat, feel as if coming down with a cold.  Back of sinuses felt hot upon breathing.  Bump at injection site gone completely (I massaged it Thursday and Friday). Minor discomfort with breathing; barely noticeable. In the afternoon time around 2pm, sudden and urgent diarrhea that lasted into the evening hours at bed.  Top of stomach burning (inside body). Diarrhea stopped, but nausea remained.  At bedtime, still felt as if coming down with a cold. Sunday January 10, 2021: Woke up feeling as if I was getting over a cold.  Nose stuffy on the side I slept on. Throughout the day, had the sniffles as the stuffiness went away.  Stomach still off; feeling nauseous.  No diarrhea (no bowel movement at all).  Throughout the afternoon tightness in chest/shortness of breath returned.  Towards the evening time still felt as if getting over a cold.  Contacted Human Resources and voice appeared hoarse. Ended phone call.  Touched my face and noticed a huge lump on my chin that felt like the lump at injection site.  Felt like a cyst. About 20 minutes later began to have difficulty swallowing; throat felt tight.  Drank a bottle of water and took two allergy pills with antihistamine.  An hour and a half after taking these,  tightness in throat is still present, but has not progressed any further; in fact, it appears to be slowly fading away.  (It&#39;s more like the feeling of having a &#34;lump in your throat&#34; (but I can&#39;t physically feel a lump).  The lump on my chin has noticeably diminished in size and is less painful to the touch. COVID test is scheduled for 1/11/21 at 10:30am. It feels as if my body is doing a &#34;systems check.&#34;

Approximately 2hrs after vaccine the reaction subsided but then developed a rash over whole body.  The rash lasted until late evening and then started to subside.  She took  Zyrtec and Motrin by that point.  She has an immunologist involved in the care of her asthma. He recommended she carry an EPI PEN.  We do not recommend she proceed with the second vaccine.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine, I awoke at 4am to severe pain, swelling, and stiffness at the injection site.  By 7am I was feeling nauseous, lightheaded and my arm was very stiff, itchy and swollen at the injection site.  I took Zyrtec D thinking that this was a delayed allergic response to the vaccine.  By 10am the symptoms were worsening and my lymph nodes in my left underarm and in my neck were swollen.  I called my physician who had me add another dose of Zyrtec and Motrin.  These symptoms worsened over the course of the day including tingling in my left arm and hand, numbness in my arm and hand until approximately 730pm when I was finally able to eat something and keep it down.  I went to bed exhausted, still with stiff upper arm and feeling general malaise.  I awoke this morning (1/20/21) at 6:45am and my arm is still stiff and swollen.  Other symptoms are resolving and I have been able to eat.

My husband had to help me get my sweater and coat on. Within a half hour,  body aches and a headache developed.  I took 1000mg of Tylenol at 7:00 am.  That took away all symptoms and most of the arm soreness.  Around 11:30 am, the symptoms resurfaced.  I had all the original symptoms plus chills and tiredness.  Felt like I had a fever but when I took temperature it was normal.   As the day went on symptoms worsened and I had a 102.5 temperature at 3:00.    I took another 1000mg of Tylenol but it took several hours for fever to break and other symptoms to subside.  The fever and other symptoms did not return. When I awoke on January 22nd, I had a headache and some nausea.  I took Motrin for the headache and that did help with the headache

                                                Neurological response/trigger  - severe leg pain and weakness in both legs. Extremely difficult to walk and not able to climb stairs.  Disrupted sleep (woke up in pain throughout the night). This lasted for a couple of weeks, the worst (debilitating) being 48 hours from initial onset.  I also had difficulty breathing and nausea about 15m after injection which lasted for about 24 hours, then subsided.   I contacted my neurologist, Dr., early next morning, and notified her of what happened and she advised that I increase the dosage of gabapentin until symptoms resolved. After 48 hours, I began to walk without experiencing so much pain and weakness, and it slowly subsided over the course of a couple of weeks. I still experience flares of pain in both of my legs periodically.

                                                Rash started small area on my right arm (opposite arm of injection) - like eczema red; raised; itchy spot. As a couple of days went I got more and more spots. Sent pictures to my Dr - Pityriasis Roseola - Went to see dermatologist - he diagnosed me with the same thing (January 19th). He gave me cream for it - it was all over my entire body by the time I saw him. It was like a red petechiae rash over my whole body. I usd the cream as instructed per doctor. The following week on that Monday, I was short of breath and not feeling right and I worked. But next day I only worked a couple of hours and went home. I started having vomiting and diarrhea - I went to the ER twice - 1st time they diagnosed - Viral infection - and they discharged me and didn&#39;t give me anything but told me to rest and they pushed fluids. The second time I went - they gave me medication and they said it might help with the pain in my  abdomen. They didn&#39;t do much. I had gone to ER - was there for four and half hours waiting to be seen but didn&#39;t get seen. Two days after second ER visit - I went back to the hospital  on January 26 and was admitted for heart failure and that is when cardiac symptoms occurred.

I had nausea, vomiting, fever of 103.2, had trouble breathing, felt like someone was sitting in the middle of my chest, left side of my body was numb, weakness, migraine headaches, and muscle aches in neck and shoulder.  I went to bed after I took Tylenol and nausea medicine. I woke up at 4 am the next morning and told my husband to get the girls (our daughters) up and that i needed to go to the hospital. When I got there they did a chest x-ray, blood work and gave me a breathing treatment. I was admitted to the hospital. While I was there they gave me IV fluids and medicine for headaches and nausea medicine. I was released about 2:30 in the afternoon on Feb 26th. I still have muscle aches  and head aches. I have noticed my memory is real short, I have trouble remembering things from yesterday.

Symptoms were consistent and as severe as covid infection that I experienced in August,2020. On 01/05/21 tested negative for covid and flu ( tested at nursing facility where I work) Today, 01/06/21, I&#39;m still bed resting, no fever today, and less headache and body ache. Left arm is just sore- no numbness or tingling. I do realize that most of these symptoms are listed under side effects,  but my side effects are as intense as my covid infection. Beck in August, last year, I couldn&#39;t get out of the bed for 8 days, due to aches, and all the other mentioned symptoms ( except arm problems). I was not hospitalized, but I was never that sick in my life. Based on severity of reaction to vaccine, I&#39;m not planning to take second dose.

Husband took me to work to get tested- negative for covid and flu on 01/05/21,  Today, 01/06/21, still bed resting, but feeling better . No nausea, no left arm problems, body and head ache  pain level 7/10.no appetite, but drinking well, no change in taste or smell. Given severity of the symptoms, I&#39;m definitely not taking second shot. I never had bad reactions to vaccines, side effects are anticipated, but I would clasify my case as adverse reaction, like experiencing covid infection all over again with shorted duration.

                                                I started to have mild symptoms (malaise, flush feeling and then numb, tingling, weak hands followed by joint pain) in the afternoon of 1/7. The symptoms progressively worsened into what my husband (an immunologist) called an intense hyperimmune response. I had severe COVID symptoms (intensified from my experience having the virus in Sept): fever 100-102, flushed face, intense muscular and some neurologic symptoms--joint arthralgia and myalgia, headache, shivers/rigors, extreme weakness (especially my hands) and later I could barely stand or walk, glandular pain with minor swelling (axillary and neck), nausea, and my hearing was temporarily diminished--nearly lost for a few minutes; tylenol 500 mg taken the night of 1/7. The intense symptoms have subsided. Currently I am tired, weak, achy, and afebrile (last ibuprofen 200 mg taken last night). My hands remain weak.

                                                The day i received the first dose of the moderna shot i started getting nauseas  during the night. I woke up and was very tired feeling. I felt like flu like symptoms for the next few days. I was in bed Friday, Saturday, and Sunday i went to ER due to throat, face and neck swelling. It was hard for me to swallow. They gave me an IV and administered Benadryl and something to help with my throat. In about 30 minutes i could swallow much better. I still feel tired and just have no energy at all. I went to see my doctor and i will not be getting the second dose of the moderna shot.

                                                Patient called the pharmacy to inform us of her side effects. She stated that after the vaccine she had the regular sore arm, muscle aches and pain, swelling and redness at injection site, diarrhea and headache (72 hours). The swelling at injection site didn&#39;t go down until day 6.  On day 7 it came back worse than it started and the patient went into her doctor and they decided it may be a delayed reaction response. At last time of contact patient was going into doctor office again thinking she may need to start antibiotics as it may be cellulitis. The injection site was very far back on the deltoid and MD thinks it may have gone into the soft tissue instead of the muscle.

                                                Patient called the pharmacy to report adverse events a week after it started. She stated the normal possible listed side effects of diarrhea/headache for 72 hours but said he redness, swelling tender at the injection site seemed pretty extreme and lasted 6 days.  On day 7 it actually came back worse than the first time so she went into her doctors office. Her doctor was thinking that she was having a delayed reaction response and they marked the area and was told to come back if it got any worse.  Last note I heard from the patient is that it did get worse and she was going back in to possibly get antibiotics. The doctor was thinking possible cellulitis due to the injection site.  The injection site was very far back on the deltoid and the MD stated she thought the vaccine was in the soft tissue vs being in the muscle.

I went to bed with no issues then within a short time I felt an instant burning in my stomach...before I could make it to the bathroom....I began vomiting uncontrollably...this lasted for 3 hours. I had 1 bout of bathroom issues but that was it. I thought I was going to go unconscious because I couldn&#39;t stop to catch a breath. Each time last about 7 minutes. As soon as I went back to bed....I got that feeling and had to rush back to the bathroom again. Today  (24 hours later) my left arm is extremely sore. (no swelling or redness------very tight and sore to the touch). I cannot lift my arm  more than 50%.

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving my injection on Thursday, I noticed my upper lip felt like it was swelling.  Over the next 30 minutes, I felt the same in my lower lip and cheeks.  I took 50 mg of Benadryl at that time.  I slept for nearly 20 hours after that.  On Friday, I experienced severe body aches from head to toe.  I felt somewhat better Saturday.  I woke up Sunday with nausea and dizziness that lasted all day and evening.  I woke up feeling better Monday morning but noticed 2 enlarged lymph nodes above my collar bone and pain from my R deltoid, across my shoulder and into my lower neck.  It is Tuesday and and the lymph nodes are painful to touch and I&#39;m experiencing 5/10 pain in my upper arm, shoulder R side and back of neck and above my R scapula.  I am considering calling my PCP.

                                                &#34;This patient received the Moderna Vaccine yesterday. She was recently hospitalized for COVID 19 bilateral pneumonia. I saw her in office yesterday and she was doing much better. She got the vaccine and started having severe abdominal cramps and diarrhea around 1 AM this morning.  The diarrhea and abdominal cramps have subsided since then but she has also been having a fever of as high as 103 Fahrenheit.  She has been taking scheduled Tylenol which was able to knock it down to 100.6.  I have recently also added on ibuprofen to help her reduce her temperature.

She arrived to work at 2:50 pm and informed her boss who sent her to the employee health department. She reported having oral Benadryl and  was going to take that. Anesthesiology evaluated her, felt it was a progressive allergic reaction, and recommended evaluation at an urgent care or ED. She later developed hives, her lower lip became swollen.  She was later evaluated at Emergency Department. She will be able to provide you with information on the doctor, treatment. She was prescribed a course of prednisone and will have allergy testing scheduled. MD indicated uncertain if caused by vaccine.   She missed work on 1/6 due to the ongoing reaction which had improved.

Temperature highs ranged from 100.8-101.4, and I felt as badly as when I had COVID-19 in March 2020. I was unable to go to work as scheduled on Friday 1/8 and Saturday 1/9. I am concerned about getting the 2ND DOSE as it has been stated that 2nd dose may create more severe symptoms than the first. PLEASE ADVISE. Also, is there a correlation between having had COVID-19 and having strong &#34;side effects&#34; to the vaccine? Please advise. Thank you!

                                                Had a fever that would &#34;come and go&#34; left work due to the fever spent the day on the couch.  Certain smells are terrible, some foods very off putting, unable to eat normal amounts of food without feeling like I am going to be sick.  Forgot to eat for 7 hours yesterday (NEVER in my history do I forget to eat).  I feel okay now but my stomach is not feeling normal and my eating habits are not normal yet.  So symptoms have been present from Tuesday to today, being Friday...they are improving but I am nervous about getting a second dose if more people generally have more severe responses with the second dose.  I forgot to list it earlier, I am not able to take calcium supplements. Anything over 50 mg of calcium on a regular basis makes me very sick and blood labs will like thst have been switched with someone else&#39;s.

I was also very tired with a bit of a headache. I teach school, and throughout the day I had very little energy and went to bed early that night. The next day (Wednesday) I felt the same, really wiped out, but also had some gastrointestinal issues and little appetite. Thursday I felt the same. Today is Friday, and I&#39;m still dragging a bit but my appetite is returning. I feel like I&#39;m getting back to normal.

                                                MADERNA COVID-19 Vaccine EUA ; Within 6 minutes, experienced warming feeling through chest followed by light headed and dizziness, followed by immediate sensation of nausea. Then lost awareness and surrounding noise sounded as if I were in a cave, echoes and non-discernable. Lost consciousness for several minutes.  Next recollection was regaining awareness, clothes soaked with sweat. Was lying on a bed with no recollection of being moved to the bed. Shakes and feeling of distress. Experienced shakes and a tingling sensation for approximately 15 minutes. Once that subsided I experienced chills for the better part of an hour. Would like to add, I have no phobias of injections and regularly have blood samples drawn for medical evolutions with my primary care physician.  Was counselled by administering physician to go home and skip work.

                                                this is a report of my personal experience I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine Wednesday January 20th at approximately 4:30pm Cox North. The injection was painful, the person administering the injection inserted the needle VERY slowly, and then pressed the plunger VERY slowly. However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt &#34;funny&#34; mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised &#34;bed rest and hydration&#34;) I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up. I was unable to remain upright, but could sit in a recliner at that time. I was unable to hold a bottle of water on my own until approximately 2pm. I had no headache, no fever, no nausea (after the initial 5am experience) but DID experience extreme muscle weakness until approximately 2pm Thursday January 21, 2021. (too weak to chew food) Friday January 22nd, I felt &#34;fine&#34;, but still mild tiredness. ( I was told by our office manager that I should fill out an RL to report my experience)

The reason I am submitting this form is fatigue, mild diarrhea, moderate nausea, and vomiting starting 8 days after the vaccine. So far it&#39;s nothing serious. I haven&#39;t been out to catch anything so it seems related. I thought you may want the data because of the strang delay in gastrointestinal symptoms.

                                                Moderna covid-19 vaccine eua. About 15 min after injection I felt hot (very unusual for me), then dizzy,  racing heart, weak then very nauseous.  I told the nurse.  He asked me to lay down.  I did not get worse.  After 20 min or so I sat up and did not feel worse.  Just stable nausea and dizzy.  I asked if I could leave.  After verifying I had people at home I was allowed to go.  I felt exhausted and nauseous for the rest of the day.  I was confused the next morning about what day it was and had some hives at injection site.  I felt normal after figuring out what day it was.  I walked 8 miles and aside from the hives at the injection site was normal.  One week later I had headache, exhaustion and had an uncomfortable rash at the site.  The rash is still on my arm.    Should I get the second dose?

Worst part was, I had like a tingling and burning sensation that radiated to my extremities legs and feet. Sweating in feet that came in waves. I felt like my skin was on fire, like I was too close to a heater. Waves of numbness and tingling that was constant that lasted for approximated 5 days. Bad taste in mouth like a metallic taste. Blood pressure was extremely high. Worse at night. I went to ER on 1/3/21, because I was still having waves of burning and discomfort that was raising my blood pressure. I thought after 72 hours I would be better and it did not so this is why I went to ER.  Day 5, I had lost of taste, runny nose, light nausea. By day 6, the cough turned into itchy throat discomfort. Day 7 low grade fever. Day 8, everything started to subside.

Some hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills, headache, started vomiting and my blood pressure started bottoming up that is when I was rushed to the ER. I was admitted and stayed 2 days. They said it was not related to the vaccine. First they told me it was sepsis. Then they told me it was pneumonia, not sepsis. Then said it was a bacterial infection. I sincerely do not know what I had. I am doing better now. My PCP did not recommend me to receive the second dose.

Continued feeling sick nauseous mild headache brought My blood to be high all day.  On 1/5/20  woke up with headache and diarrhea (6 times for the past13hrs) discomfort of the stomach. Hardly no appetite.  Also noticed today my injection site left arm (slight red and rise bumps almost like a big rash or welts and itchy. That?s what caught my attention to see my arm.    My concern is could this be part of  late reaction of the vaccine?

I suddenly felt a &#34;snap&#34; in my left calf which led to severe muscle pain. I can barely walk. It is still painful today. About the same time I developed chills which lasted till about 1PM today. Within 10 minutes of the shot I was dizzy and nauseous (lasted about 15 min). About 20 minutes after the shot my face turned red and lasted about 5 hours.

                                                Following 1st Covid shot on 12/31; about 2 hours afterward experienced extreme fatigue, nausea, and dull headache.  All mild and expected as possible side effects.  No concerns.  Symptoms continued and by 1/5; all symptoms had move to severe level and are still occurring today 1/8.  Temperature spikes to 102.8; chills, severe headache especially in eye sockets, body aches, and heaviness in chest.  Could not work on 1/7 and only for a bit on 1/8 (working from home).  Became concerned and was flu and covid tested on 1/7;  both negative.  I was retested for Covid on 1/8 and still negative.  I am not sure if maybe I am sick with something else and this is coincidence or if I am just experiencing issues from the vaccine that are a little different from others?

I notified my direct supervisor how I was feeling. I woke up on Tuesday morning with the sickness and I called off work. I got into contact with my Doctor, on Wednesday and had a tele-appointment. He gave me three medications, and currently it has lasted for six days, and I am going to try and get an appointment with the doctor on Monday 01/11/2021.

Usual &amp; expected solicited SEs: fatigue, soreness, feeling &#34;off,&#34; transient headache, chills sx Day 2- strong R arm pain, cannot lift R arm.  Metallic taste in mouth and tingling tongue persists.  Also same usual Sx as day 1 plus mild nausea.   Felt really crummy.   Day 3- Still moderately strong R arm pain, can only partially lift arm over head, cannot straighten over head.   Strong fatigue continues, mild nausea.   By this day I recall having some unusual Noc . calf cramping.   Sx certainly improved after 72 hrs but some did continue up to 7 days.   Cramping returned as did odd R ear/jaw/throat nerve pain.  Scratchy throat.  Fatigue persisted, gradually improved.  I believe the non-standard SEs may represent an allergic reaction.  I deem this mild to moderate, as I was unable to perform daily functions at times.  I would like to be able to talk to a professional as to whether a second dose is recommended in my situation.  I am concerned to know if previous allergic reactions suggest increase likelihood of future and possibly worsened reactions.  Note: I have been unable to access my Vsafe reports today to confirm exact time frame.  The above is to best of my recollection.

Symptoms did not resolve after a few hours.  ~ 3 hours later, took Benadryl and bronchodiolator and symptoms improved.  Also since injection have had mild GI distress gradually improving.   Reporting now because I learned reaction could be worse to second injection, and 30 minute observation period would likely be prudent.

                                                within 30 seconds I had a cooling sensation rush across the tip of my tongue, then a sweet taste, then more identifiable as bubble gum flavored.  By 12:45 I noticed I was scratching several areas of my body. Arms, legs, chest, neck, back and scalp and kept clearing my throat.  I looked down at my arm and seen a red welt from my elbow to my wrist in my left arm and a fine red rash beneath skin on right arm.  I looked up at the pharmacist and he said at 12:40 he had already placed a call to have another pharmacist come to look me over.   I then noticed that my heart seemed to be racing and feeling winded.  I figured this was my anxiety and just tried to relax.  The second pharmacist arrived and we walked to the ER.  I was very winded. They took me to a room and checked stats.  after 3 attempts taking my BP and using two different cuffs, she said my BP was 190/90 where it is typically 120/70. I drank lots of water and they monitored me for almost an hour and gave me another Benadryl.  My BP came down to 180/82 , breathing was easier and itching was decreasing so I chose to return to my station and I took one more Benadryl.  The following day: woke up with head ache in rt eye and fuzzy vision all day, mild sore throat, mild body aches, queasy stomach, fatigue and runny nose.  Took a Pepcid for stomach, Tylenol/Advil duo for sore throat, headache/body aches, drank lots of water and rested.  Following day most symptoms resided, still  slight sore throat, rt eye blurred vision, coughing, sneezing and runny nose.  everyday since, symptoms continue to decrease.

She was assisted to move from chair to an available bed where her blood pressure (154/94), pulse (73) and Sp02 (90% on RA) were collected. 5 minutes later her BP had increased to 166/100, HR was 68 and Sp02 was 91% on RA. EMS was activated at 1005am and assessed this person and eventually transported her to the ER for observation/follow up with a provider. She was observed and sent home and advised to receive the second dose of this series as scheduled. When I spoke to the person she reported that she had no reservations about 2nd dose and would return as scheduled.

                                                The patient received the vaccine at approximately 1:30. They were observed for the standard 15 minute wait time at which time they complained of some mild numbness to their arm. The patient felt well enough to return to work after the 15 minute observation time. They returned approximately 20 to 30 minutes later complaining of more numbness and some dizziness. She (the patient) was told to continue to monitor symptoms and alert anyone of worsening side effects or symptoms. The patient returned to the room again and was now complaining of nausea. She was offered Benadryl but patient refused stating &#34; I cant have Benadryl&#34; after multiple times of the pharmacist(s)  offering Benadryl. Patient stated they sometimes take Claritin so they were instructed to take it and lie down in an area where staff could monitor her. At about 3:30 another staff member came into the vaccination room and alerted the pharmacist they were having a hard time keeping to patient awake.  Upon arrival at the patient&#39;s side they were coughing and seemed to be in a state of drowsiness. They were linked to a vitals monitor by the staff. BP: 170/110 O2: 96-100% HR between 80 and 90.  Approximately 2 minutes after arrival at patient&#39;s side 911 was called. Pharmacist retrieved the Epi-Pen and was on standby if administration was needed.  The patient was moved to a chair and vomited multiple times over the course of a few minutes. The Patient was able to vocalize and stated they felt &#34;aweful&#34; and has some difficulty swallowing, and when asked if they were short of breath they stated &#34;a little.&#34; Over the next 5 minutes (approx.) the patient&#39;s BP went down to 152/90&#39;S and O2 saturation was holding at 97-100%. Epinephrine was not administered during this time as patient was breathing and did not appear to have hives. Emergency medical services arrived about 5 minutes but within 10 minutes after the call was placed. EMS then took over care  for the patient. EMS was told of condition and that epinephrine was not administered at this time. After patient assessment by EMS they also declined to use epinephrine. At around 3:40 the patient was transferred to a transport bed and was taken away by ambulance.

About 48 hours after I felt very fatigue, almost too exhausted to get ready for work. The following two days I felt nauseated, very fatigued, achy and interrupted sleep patterns - going to bed earlier than usual, waking up between 2-4am. 4 today after still fatigued aches. The 6th day I felt better with energy, then that evening came the headache and by the following morning (7th day) felt fatigued with chills. The head ache woke me up from sleep at 1 am that night and 3:45am the following night. By the Friday 1/15/21 I still had chills, broke out in a sweat walking throughout house, still tired but not as bad and the headache is gone. I felt so bad onvthe 14th I went and saw a Doctor who suggested I was having a severe reaction to the vaccin. He said my vitals were good, performed a covid test to rule out the possibility (turned out negative) and told me to rest. He also warned the 2nd dose could be worse reaction.

                                                Left work early Friday (4pm) and went to bed. In bed for the following 5 days, including now. Muscle and bone aches through my spine and hips, nausea with some vomiting, chills, severe weakness, no recordable fever but felt feverish, skin hurt. Woke up Tuesday drenched in sweat but the bone pain had subsided. Still very weak, nauseous, continued in bed. Woke up today feeling on fire, eyes burning hot, skin no longer hurt but felt hot.  Injection site hurt through Sunday-no redness, no rash or swelling.  I took Tylenol and Advil throughout.  My previous trunk rash completely disappeared. I began taking the prednisone last night. 50mg BID. I have a 5 day supply.  Took a Covid test on Monday-results pending.  Tried to see my doctor today giving them the above information-there were no appts til Friday and I was referred to the ED.  I will not go to the ED where I could actually catch Covid. I was unable to get past phone triage with the doctors office.

                                                Within 6 hours of vaccination, intense pain in the right arm - could not lift it overhead without pain.  This continued - and got worse on Friday morning.  The Friday morning event is what I am reporting.  I got up to shower; put shampoo in my hair and then conditioner. My right arm was hurting so badly that I was having trouble rinsing my hair. Then I felt faint and nauseous. Got out of the shower and fell onto the bed in the bedroom. Woke my husband to tell him that I was feeling badly - faint and the whole room was spinning. Then I felt my airway closing. He went down to get my levalbuterol (rescue inhaler); took one puff and that opened my airways.  I was still weak and he had to help me get dressed.  (BTW- I&#39;m a competitive athlete/ swimmer.)  I held onto him going downstairs.  I was not hungry though did eat a bit.  I spent the day on the couch with the chills and the room spinning until early afternoon.  By Saturday I was starting to feel better.  The pain in my arm mostly subsided by Sunday and I went to swim practice.  It wiped me out for the entire day and I spent the rest of Sunday on the couch. It&#39;s now Monday morning. I am feeling a bit off but better.  I am concerned about getting the second shot.

                                                Approximately 3 hours after shot I became nauseous, intestinal cramps with diarrhea.  Approximately 1 day later began having breathing issues.  Not like an asthma attack.  Just could not catch my breath, coughing trying to get air. I could not speak on the phone or in person without coughing to get air in my lungs.  I started using an inhaler but it was not helping.  I began using a Nebulizer; this helped slightly at first.  On Feb 20th (I got a new box of meds for the nebulizer) since then I have gotten another box of nebulizer meds on March 3rd.  I have used half of this box now.  Also, on March 3rd, my doctor called in for a new inhaler, which started with 200 sprays and as of today I have 15 left.  This has been going on for over a month!  I have been using the nebulizer every morning and at night but still would wake up 4-5 times during the night to use my inhaler.  I have difficulty feeding my horse without almost collapsing from lack of air.

Became nauseous and extremely dizzy. Was forced to call off from work.  Contacted the occupational health doctor at the facility where I received the vaccine (my employer) and reported my reaction.   Was advised to rest, take pain reliever and report back if symptoms were not gone after 2 days

Although lymph node swelling/tenderness was mentioned, I had pain deep in my armpit and lympadema extending from shoulder to wrist. I&#39;ve used a TENS unit crossing the armpit area to stimulate the lymph nodes, massaged and ace wrapped the arm. The swelling has gone down but is not fully back to normal.

Self treated with Tylenol, hydration and rest and felt better. The symptoms seemed to develop suddenly after I went for a 8 mile run on Saturday afternoon 1/9/21 about 48 hours after getting the shot.

                                                On 12/25 after the vaccination I started feeling very fatigued and on the 26th and throughtout the next 3 days I had a low grade temp, body aches were mild that affected my knee joint but just a little, periodic taste loss, loose stool and the color change in the BM for 3 days.  I had a virtual visit on the 28th and got tested and got the results on the 12/29 and was positive for COVID-19.  I went to the ER on 1/3 because I just wasnt feeling well and was advised my bone marrow were throwing off immature white blood cells. And after about 8 or 9 days is when I finally began to get some relief an symptoms began to resolve.

                                                First three days was just muscle soreness and fatigue.  On day 4 I started having tight chest and SOB while snowshoeing, which I did not have the day before on same activity.  That night I woke up with SOB and tightness in my chest and severe pain in area of my heart.  I could not lay on my left side.  It seemed like I was having heart attack symptoms.  Barley slept but upon waking my heart rate was 94 and the pain remained in LT Axilla area.  Took it easy for day and that night again had trouble sleeping, SOB but not as bad.  Woke up with excrutiating pain radiating up the base of my RT skull.  Was concerned about blood clot potential??  Had SOB when walking up stairs.  My throat hurt when bending over, as if my esophagus was crushing.  Friends said my face looked puffy and I felt bloated.  Landed up reporting to ER at the Hospital on Monday, Feb. 1st as directed by my PCP.  Hospital was told I had just had 2nd dose of vaccine, but did not think it was related.  I will mention all tests below, but upon arriving home on Feb. 2nd, I discovered a rash breaking out on underside of my LT upper arm, LT inner thigh and LT lower leg.

Felt achy in her body, her arm was hurting and was not feeling like herself.  She went home, sat on the sofa and drank something and went to sleep and felt drained, and slept for 4 hours.  She then woke up with runny nose, low grade temp, and felt really weak.  The next day, 1/6/21 her body ached bad.  She slept a lot that day and drank a lot of water, didn&#39;t eat and just felt really sick.  Then on Saturday evening, she looked at her leg and felt cold chills and her leg was hot.

On day 2 my lips began to swell and were itchy, by day 3 they were very swollen, took benadryl every 8 hrs and by day 5 today they are fairly normal but still sore. My arm also swelled and spread to arm pit and was very hot and red. The redness has mostly gone, the swelling has lessened but not gone. Still sore and itchy. Still pretty run down and no energy. My cousin and I live together and were vaccinated at the same time and both had these symptoms except the lips swelling.

                                                I had the expected flu-like symptoms for a couple of days, and then on Day 3 got nauseous and started feeling tingling on my face (below the nose and around my mouth. It felt like pins and needles. When it went on for several hours I called Hospital and they advised to contact them if it worsened of I began having symptoms of Bells Palsey or a stroke (not concerning at all!)  I took tylenol then ibuprofen and it went away. It&#39;s come back two more days (up to today) but has not worsened. Just thought I should report it.

                                                on Friday 01-01-21 I was feeling a sore throat. On Saturday, 01-02-21, it was even worse. I took over the counter medication and nothing seemed to happen.  On Sunday, 01-03-2021, it was so sore that I could not swallow and the neck was sore to the touch. I went to the emergency room and they ran several tests and it was determined that I experienced an allergic reaction to the dose.  They prescribed two (2) medications.  I followed their instructions and did not report to work on 01-03 and Tuesday, 01-05-21.  The throat is still sore but getting better slowly.

                                                Got the vaccine on Friday and 14 hours later , early Saturday morning,  I started feeling sick. It started with severe chills, and graduated into fever, lethargy, nausea, hyperventilating, headache, and chills interchanging with sweating.   I had a fever the entire weekend and it wouldn&#39;t go away, even with taking Advil and Tylenol.  My oxygen level was fine, but my pulse was elevated.  I felt the same as when I had Covid-19 in June, to the point where I thought I had it again, so I quarantined myself, and was going to get tested on Monday. On Sunday afternoon, I started to feel better and thought it was the end of it, but then Sunday night I started shivering again, and it all started again.     I took an Ambien to get some good sleep and I woke up at 6am Monday morning feeling better.

                                                On 1/8/21, the day after the vaccination I developed a headache, nausea, fatigue, chills and cognitive impairment.  I quickly started vomiting  which was intense and persistent.  I had no food in my system so vomiting was mostly dry heaves, bile and what ever water I could drink.   Shortly after the vomiting began, I believe I passed out, fell and hit my head on the floor.   I don&#39;t remember falling but my husband said he heard the fall and I developed a large lump/bruise on my forehead.  The persistent vomiting lasted about 4-5 hours and other symptoms gradually improved.  1/11/21 I still have a milder headache, slight nausea and some fatigue.

                                                Patient is a 55-year-old female who had presented to the vaccination clinic this afternoon to receive her COVID-19 vaccine.  She does have a history of migraine headaches and other comorbidities as described below.  Has had reactions to a number of medications, mostly narcotics as noted in her allergy list some of which could in theory be compatible with urticaria.  Does not have true anaphylaxis in her history. Today at about 15 minutes after administration of her COVID-19 vaccine she began to rather precipitously developed an itchy crawling feeling in her skin, nausea with retching and some shortness of breath.  She did not have the sensation of her throat closing off.  Did not have coryza.  Within about 10 minutes she did develop difficulty with speech that she says is typical for her migraine headache.  She received, in the vaccination Clinic, epinephrine 0.3 mg subQ, 125 mg of Solu-Medrol and 50 mg of Benadryl all IV.  An IV was started and a 500 mL bolus of saline was initiated.  With this she was then transferred to the emergency room for further evaluation.   In the emergency room she did develop chest heaviness but no palpitations.  She was not dyspneic.  Her nausea and vomiting by then had seem to resolve.

                                                Within 30 minutes after having the vaccine, she felt a thickness in her throat and then had trouble swallowing.  She reported this to the authorities.  They took her vitals which showed that her oxygen saturation was 99%, heart rate was 78 and blood pressure was normal.  They eventually let her go home.  She was not given any Benadryl or any other medications.  The following day on February 13, she was fine.  Later on that day, she developed some sudden onset of itching from the neck up.  Even the insides of her ears were itching.  This lasted 3 to 4 hours and then disappeared by itself.  On February 14th and 15 she said she was suffering from the usual side effects expected from the vaccine including fatigue and a low-grade fever of 99.6 but these again went away by themselves.  The following week, on February 17, she developed more generalized itching all over her body including feet legs and everywhere.  It was similar to the itching that she had developed when she was allergic to sulfa medication.  Discontinued on Thursday.  Now she continues to have some itching but not as bad as on the 17th and 18th.

The patient reports undergoing her 1st COVID-19 vaccination recently and did not experience any reaction with this whatsoever. However, she received her 2nd vaccination yesterday and initially felt well, but awoke this morning with the feeling of &#34;an elevated pulse&#34;, along with fatigue, nausea, nagging diffuse headache, left flank/low back pain, and soreness surrounding the vaccination site. No redness or significant swelling around the site. Also notes a brief episode of RLQ abdominal pain described as &#34;cramping&#34; earlier this morning that has since resolved. She has tried taking 500 mg Tylenol at 0800 without relief in her symptoms. No fevers, chills, dysuria, hematuria, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Patient reports being recently diagnosed with thyroid disease and began taking medications for this about two weeks ago. She denies any past medical history otherwise.

                                                I had the normal soreness in my arm, slight nausea the first few days. On Wednesday, February 17 all my joints started to hurt. When I woke up on the 18th I could barely walk. My right knee was swollen, both hands were swollen, I had pain in my neck to the base of my skull.  I called the doctor&#39;s office and told this was normal and to take Tylenol. I spent the weekend barely able to move by the following Thursday, February 25th I went to my doctor, who immediately sent me to the ER. I was admitted to the hospital. My inflammation was high.  I was dehydrated. I spent the night in the hospital. Doctors say there is not enough research to say this vaccine did this but  I know it did. I am still having problems, still can barely walk, pain in the joints of my hands and pain radiating up my neck to the bottom of my skull.

The patient&#39;s medical history included transverse myelitis. Concomitant medications included mesalazine.  On 04-MAR-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot# 013A21A) intramuscularly in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Initially, the patient reported she was fine. Then, at night on 04-MAR-2021, the patient developed headache, sore throat, then every 6 hours, she became nauseous. Early morning on 07-MAR-2021, the patient became really nauseous and went back to sleep. She reported that she had a mild flare of transverse myelitis &#34;which doesn&#39;t happen without big insult.&#34; The flare included spasticity, weakness, and apraxia. Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcomes of events, headache, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, and transverse myelitis flare, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I took Advil,  it was like the worst &#34;flu shot&#34; I ever got. Then the muscle pain started. I went home and took some Advil, tried to walk my dogs and couldn&#39;t. I usually walk 3 miles with them and did not walk even 1/2 mile. Went home and took a hot shower with Epson salt and laid down. My arm started aching. I can&#39;t even wash my hair, the injection site itches and is painful and my scalp was itching too. Overall headache, joint/ muscle pain like flu like symptoms. Wednesday morning before I left work my back started hurting really bad, severe back pain. When I arrived home and used the bathroom I was having abd pain, and diarrhea. It was all fluid. I ate some chili the day before and when I wiped my bottom it was red like bloody. My PCP was closed. It happened about 4 times. It is like I have a kidney pain (the back pain)

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   I had chills, low grade fever of 99.4 initially, fatigue, lightheaded and  felt like I was moving in slow motion.  As the evening progressed, I felt worse and worse, had no appetite, very slight nausea, but no vomiting. During the night, my fever went up.  I only checked it once and it was 100.1, but I was having severe chills, my knee joints were aching, as well as some of my fingers.  The next morning I had a headache, and was dizzy (which may have been from not eating the night before). The symptoms continued throughout the day, but were managed fairly well with Tylenol.  Additionally, my arm was extremely sore.  It hurt to move it in any way.  Even worse arm pain than with a Tetanus shot, which has always caused me a great deal of pain.  Thankfully the symptoms only lasted about 28 hours.

Home from work on January 6th, day of initial dose. Started with chills after arriving  home at approx 8pm.  Went to bed and woke sometime around midnight with the above described symptoms. Symptoms  cont throughout the day (January 8th) . Finally out of bed by evening and was able to hold down food. Back to bed and woke sometime around 3 am after breaking a sweat. Fever was gone and my body cooler. Up that morning around 9. Normal, tolerable body aches, mild headache and left arm very sore but could tolerate it being touched.   Side Note: I had contracted the virus in March 2020.  The symptoms from the vaccine were so much worse than the actual virus. I am too scared to get the second dose.

Later that evening she reports developing a cough, fever, headache, bodyaches, chills and vomiting. Her s/s continued on 12/25/2020 and she reports going to the ED (no record found in to verify this claim) for evaluation. She states a COVID test was ordered (negative results).  She sought further treatment on 12/29/2020 for ongoing symptoms. Another COVID test was ordered (negative results) and a CXR was taken, which the employee states &#34;showed inflammation&#34;. I advised her to call her PCP for further follow-up care/evaluation and for advice on receiving her second COVID vaccine.

Outreached PCP and was advised that these events were side effects experienced by some after receiving vaccine.  Ibuprofin was recommended along with rest, fluids, eating small meals, monitoring of symptoms, and was advised by NP for my PCP that symptoms/side effects normally remedy  in 24 to 48 hours.  On the evening of the 48th hour, 1/8/21, after other symptoms had cleared, I began experiencing constant ringing in my left ear and some wobbliness, this continues today 1/11/21.  Called Urgent care and was advised there is nothing they can do for  such symptoms and was advised to continue to receive guidance from PCP.  Am currently awaiting call back from PCP.

On the second day after vaccination I felt better with temperature of 100.5 and headache. On the  third day I was back to normal.  Should I take the SECOND dose on 27th of January? Thank you.

                                                The patient received her first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on 12/29/2020.  However the patient was diagnosed with a positive COVID-19 test on January 4, 2021.  Patient complained of nausea, vomiting, back pain, and sharp chest pain.     On January 13, the patient presented to the emergency department again with shortness of breath and sharp, stabbing left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and right side. Initial work up ruled out cardiac etiologies. CTA chest demonstrated COVID-19 pneumonia.    The patient complained of bilateral lower extremity weakness which had been progressing since her COVID-19 vaccination, per patient report.  However, during her hospitalization the patient&#39;s bilateral lower extremity weakness began to accelerate.  On the 13th, the patient was able to ambulate to and from the bathroom herself.  Then on January 14 the patient required maximum assistance. Neurology was consulted and work up initiated for suspected possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) secondary to recent COVID-19 infection.    On January 15, 2021, the patient became obtunded and unable to protect airway.  She was emergently intubated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to GBS. Neurology started GBS treatment with IVIG. Patient also developed NSTEMI and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient remains critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation.

                                                Did okay in the first hour, no issues.   Began to get mild muscle cramps in side of face, jaw, down both sides of neck, upper left shoulder with finger and upper right foot tingling, left wrist tightness, and itching in both armpits, upper inner arms and upper back and irritability while driving home. Went to Urgent Care. All seemed to resolve except itching, muscle pain, irritability. Itching started in legs. Was given shot of Benadryl and oral Prednisone which helped. Woke up with nausea, headache, fever, abdominal pain, muscle aches, but no itchiness. No continued irritability. Feel dehydrated now. Have had fluids. Still very dry. Headache is worse. Having some trouble getting enough  fluids  in. Will keep trying and call physician next.

                                                That evening my heart was pounding very hard throughout my entire body that&#39;s all I could hear laying down I thought that I was going to either have a heart attack or a stroke. I got up and took one of my blood pressure medications. It&#39;s slowed down but I was unable to sleep due to feeling jittery and my heart pounding hard. The next day I felt exhausted my stomach hurt. I have had a sore throat the worst being on the Thursday following. Today Friday things seem to be subsiding.  However my concern is not to get the second dose if I had such a bad reaction the first time I definitely will have a heart attack the second time.

She was feeling tired, slightly nauseous and very low energy. At about 4:50 PM that day, patient got up to walk to the pantry after eating some peanut butter toast. She suddenly stopped and shut her eyes and froze and then she began having a seizure (and she has never had a seizure before and seizures do not run in her family). After the shaking from the seizure ceased, her body tensed up and she fell flat backwards and she hit her head on the refrigerator. She then was going in and out of consciousness, she had a big laceration on her forehead and was bleeding rapidly. I, her daughter, witnessed this and then at 4:54 PM I called emergency services and paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. Later that evening, the family was notified that the patient had bleeding in her brain, a concussion, a forehead laceration that received 15 stitches and a broken neck (C2 fracture).

The decreased sense of taste improved after 24 hours, but the generalized fatigue and injection site discomfort persisted over the next several days. She also experienced body aches, but notes these are fairly typical for her, so she didn&#39;t think much about it. She recalls having headaches and stomachaches around days 3-5 following her injection, and beginning on day 7, she also started to notice some injection site itching and induration.  The localized swelling and redness increased during days 7-10 following her COVID-19 vaccination, and over the last 6 hours, she also started to develop nausea. Her fatigue persists, but the headaches, stomachaches, and body aches have subsided.

Sunday night, 1/16/21 the injection site became itchy, continued to be red .  Monday, 1/17/21 injection site was swollen, hard, red and warm. I work at a SNF as a Licensed Physical Therapist Assistant, I had an RN look at site and trace it. It continued to stay swollen after taking Motrin and A 24 hr Claritin. Went to Urgent Care to have Dr look at it and was put on Bactrim  for possible infection to injection site. I do not take many antibiotics or any other medications, so I do not always react well with medicine.

                                                Two hours post vaccination:  tongue heaviness followed by metallic taste sensation, vomited once after this.  Four hours post vaccination:  nausea, bilateral forearm pain evolving to all over body aches and muscle cramping along with a pulsating headache.  Spiked a fever of 102 F that I treated with 500 mg of Tylenol.  Later took ibuprofen for body aches.  Had frequent urination along with unexplained crying.  The lowest the fever would measure for the next 24 hours was 100 F.  I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen as directed on a regular basis.  On Thursday 1/21/2021 at 5:55 pm, I woke up drenched in sweat.  I felt weak yet improved.  Headache and back pain were less.  Showered and moved to the couch in living room attempting to watch TV.  Could not stay awake.  Woke up three hours later again drenched in sweat.  Showered and went to bed.  Slept through the night and woke up at 8 am with body aches, muscle cramping and nausea gone.  Night gown and sheets were damp with sweat. Lingering symptoms:  Skin from lips and inside my mouth appears to be sloughing off.  There are very tiny cuts on my bottom lip.  Left with mild headache I attribute to dehydration.  No longer nauseous although I have no appetite.

                                                Patient felt unwell and had a fever on Wednesday (1/27) and went home early from work. On Thursday morning (1/28), she threw up once and then laid down to rest. Her son reported seeing her that morning with the episode of emesis prior to her getting on the couch. Son reports that when he came home at 5pm, she was asleep on the couch. Teenage daughter reports patient had been asleep on couch all day. Son tried to wake patient up and she was disoriented and lethargic.  Daughter (reporter) was contacted to come see patient and on arrival to house (5;45pm), noted patient was confused, lethargic, febrile (104), and hypoxic at 83% on room air with portable pulse oximeter. Patient was able to stand and ambulate to car with assistance and was driven to Emergency Department for evaluation.   At emergency department, patient was hypotensive 80/40s but was able to increase blood pressure with 3 L of normal saline to blood pressure of 90/50s. See all tests performed and results below.  Patient received antibiotics, anti-virals and tylenol for fever of 102.7 while in emergency department. She was admitted to ICU that evening at approximately 11pm and had a foley catheter placed overnight due to decreased urine output. patient continued to have low blood pressure through morning of 1/28 and was placed on levophed for blood pressure control at approx 10 am. Her blood pressures continued to improve through afternoon and levophed was titrated down and then discontinued around 4pm.  She continued to received antibiotics for 24 hours after initiation and continued acyclovir during course of hospitalization and is still receiving doses on 2/2. Patient&#39;s initial mental status was confused, lethargic, and unable to communicate. She was intermittently oriented to herself only and would not follow commands. She would localize painful stimuli. Her mental status began to improve on Saturday when she started to become more awake but was still unable to follow commands or communicate clearly. She was moved from ICU to IMCU (step down unit) on Saturday once mental status was improving and blood pressure was stabilized. Her mental status continued to improve from Saturday 1/ 30 to Tuesday 2/2 (current). She began to have diarrhea on Saturday afternoon that continued through Monday and occurred every 1-2 hours. She was unable to stand or move body on her own and had to be assisted by staff to be cleaned. She remained awake and alert and was able to get up and walk on Monday and began to eat. She continued acyclovir treatment pending HSV meningitis panel PCR results (still pending currently 2/2). Mental status not currently at baseline but continuing to improve. She is also still experiencing generalized weakness. Hospitalist team and infectious disease doctors report she should be discharged tomorrow (2/3).  No source for confusion and hypotension has been found at this time. Physician team think HSV is unlikely but awaiting final diagnosis until test is resulted.

Required ibuprofen every 4hours for 30hours and sporadically thereafter to manage symptoms. I was ready to call 911, but was able to reach friends as a safety check through the night and the next couple days. Very difficult to manage this living alone.

                                                By midnight after getting the shot, my arm was extremely painful. I iced it through the night, but it didn&#39;t help that much. Then the next morning, was very nauseous and started having diarrhea. Remained nauseous and continued having diarrhea for 2 1/2 days. Arm was sore for 3 days. Then, the diarrhea slowed down, recurs about once a day, but have continued having regular bouts of nausea, especially after eating or when doing something more physically active (skiing, snowshoeing, walking the dogs, swimming). And last night, 10 days after receiving the vaccine, a slightly sore, itchy hive the size of a 1/2 dollar appeared at the injection site and slight soreness returned. No temperature during any of it so far.

I woke up with the chills and a headache. At 8:00a.m. I also experienced in addition to those symptoms, fatique, body aches and diarreha. I also lost my appetite completely. When I had covid in October, I experienced thses very same symptoms. These lasted all day untill around 7:00p.m. and I felt good almost all at once the symptoms seemed to be gone. The next day I was a little fatigued still and still no appetite. Everything became normal on friday 1/8/21.

It is stiff and itchy, per the patient. She also complains of stomach pain that comes and goes- some so severe that the patient finds herself unable to eat. Patient was advised to place warm compress on the area as well as take antihistamine for symptoms.

I called out sick and had to use a vacation day because still had headache, fogginess, and temp of 98.8.  At 3pm I started to have a lower back ache that went in to my mid back.  I was tired.  Then on Tuesday, 01/12/2021 I started with diarrhea at 11AM.  I called work and explained that it was a side effect of the Covid vaccine.  They still would not let me go to work even though I was covid negative.  I took 2 Imodium tablets. I will email you tomorrow, 1/13/2021 and continue to monitor.  Yes I am a RN.

Anaphylaxis is often referred to as slow roll and without the typical face swelling and rash. It is more subtle and can be harder to detect.  And that was my experience: as follows: I became faint and briefly passed out within 2 minutes of injection. I stabilized quickly within a 30 minute hold although developed increasing nausea, I and med tech was satisfied that it might just be my dysautanomia. I spent the evening with severe headache vomiting as passed out again. I experienced throat tightening but not full closure. The next day I had flue like symptoms that I assume were normaland vaccine related. When this passed in the evening I again suffered nausea and dizziness, vomiting and throat tightening when I tried to eat.  These symptoms were not similar to the flush feelings earlier in the day. The symptoms ebbed and waned for 2 days with increased frequency as I took chromalyn , Benadryl with some effect at first and ate with great care as not to introduce more allergens.  I had increased chest pain,  sweating, fainting, throat tightening became severe Benadryl was not effective. I was having trouble swallowing. I was forced to us an epi pen and call 911. This  is a typical anaphylactic response for EDS&lt; Mast Cell patients. It became clear that I could not get past this on my own and the symptoms were increasing. I started to shake with chills and feared shock as my chest pains increased. The epi pen injection and hospital visit via ambulance occurred Monday 1/25-1/26. I became very faint during the Ems intake with the techs having to hold me up to check vitals etc.. My HR dropped despite the EPi. At the ER I was given IV steroids,  IV Benedryl and Potassium,  tablets and fluids throughout the night, admitted for evaluation.

                                                1st dose December 23, 2020.  Arm pain, swelling, raised red 3 inch bump developed within 12 hours.  Subsided, and reoccurred about 10 days post vaccine.  10-14 days post vaccine I developed New onset forefoot weakness (foot drop) Right, new onset trigger finger Right middle finger, new onset bladder spasms with immediacy and incontinence - not bladder volume dependent, resurgence of body aches, new bilateral knee pain requiring two arm support for sit to stand,  Mental status changes including anxiety, paranoia, mania and depression (personality change!), motion induced nausea and dizziness, visual changes (blurry vision), New intensification of nocturnal muscles spasms - bilateral and progressive and intermittent headache up the Right neck to crown, New onset (01/14/21 - present) burning rubber scent when some food being cooked.  The muscle and joint pain were present with February illness, subsided by April, and came back with a vengeance within two weeks of the 1st injection.  I also lost three teeth (fracture vertically while flossing), thinned hair, and had intermittent dizziness during the initial illness in February.   February Initial loss of taste/smell included metallic taste with artificial flavors, rotten garbage - random, and ?iron taste with meats.  I can now taste some fruits but only get bitterness with other fruits and vegetables.  I had one sided facial paralysis after tooth extractions in September - resolved in 1 week.  I required dental implants to replace the fractured teeth.  I am a vaccinator, and have been administering our vaccines and swabbing for Covid testing since we reopened elective procedures.  I strongly encourage our staff to get the vaccines - and I am the one who gets the reaction.  The constellation of symptoms, temporal proximity to the vaccine with no intervening illness or injury, and commonality of some symptoms with my February illness have prompted further testing and evaluation for central nervous system insult.

                                                Side effects started the same day I received the vaccine, which were reported on the V-safe app.  Started with very sore arm, within 24 hours progressed to extreme fatigue, joint and body aches, loss of taste and headache. I also experienced some mild nausea. By Wednesday evening, I began to experience heart palpations which I listened to as a nurse which sounded like PVC&#39;s. I have never had this happen to me before. I assessed my vital signs and noted that as the arrhythmia progressed, my O2 sat level began to decrease and my pulse began to increase. I could hear a definite pause in my heart rhythm. Within an hour, I had chest pain in the area of my left chest over my heart which progressed into a feeling of pressure as if someone was standing with a foot on my chest. As time went on, this sensation radiated into my back at an angle from left to right. It was at this point that I had my father take me to the emergency room. When I got there, my pulse was in the low 100&#39;s and my blood pressure was 230/130. I have never had this happen to me before. I ended up on a nitroglycerin drip. My magnesium level was low and my sodium level was low normal.   I was kept in the emergency room until Thursday evening then transferred to Progressive Care Unit where I remained until early evening on Friday.I was sent home on 2 different cardiac medications, Coreg and Lisinopril. I am to follow up with my PCP and a cardiologist. Both are brand new to me. I am now feeling better, but I am very reluctant to have the second covid vaccine. Also, the Hospital does not know what happened to me. (Facility where I received my Covid vaccine.)

Vaccination on 2/12/2021 and diarrhea and constipation began 2/15/2021 and lasted until 2/21/2021 3. A lump where I received the vaccination from 2/12/2021 until 2/20/2021 4. Warmth around the injection site (4 cm in diameter) from 2/12/2021 until 2/20/2021 5.  Extreme muscle spasms as a side effect of my vaccination 2/12/2021.  They came on Monday 2/15/2021) but subsided Tuesday. Pain came back Wednesday and then Thursday I had to go home early and take 4 hours sick time.  I then took 4 hours sick time on Friday in order to see the Nurse Practitioner. NP diagnosed as muscle spasms and prescribed Tizanidine 3 x day.  I took two doses of Tizanidine (4mgs) on 2/19/2021 4pm and midnight and one dose 2/20/21 and muscle spasms are now resolved.   The pain on Monday was on left and right flank (lumbar) but migrated to thoracic level by afternoon.  On Tuesday it was not there. On Wednesday it was on left and right flank all day.  On Thursday it was worse. The pain was an 8 on a scale of 0-10 with 10 being equivalent to labor pain. (Natural labor x 2, each 8 hours in 1994 and 2000). The pain 2/19/2021 was so severe that I left work in order to go home and made an appt with the medical provider for the next day.  I saw the NP on Friday 2/19/2021 at 10.30am.   Pain was worse when seated. Pain was extremely bad when driving. Pain lessened if I could press the area with my hand. Possible confounder is that I pushed a boat with arms outstretched on a trailer over uneven ground with my spouse on 2/13/2021 about 3 feet to its resting place. However, I was on the boat in particularly frigid weather outdoors for two hours prior to pushing the boat to its resting place.

Used an anti itch cream, took a Claritin antihistamine.  No real pain, but uncomfortable with the itching.

I gradually became more fatigued, lost my appetite for food, and the left armpit lymph nodes began swelling.  Then I started having chills and sweats.  This lasted for approximately 2 and a half days.  On day three, the fever broke, and all adverse side effects slowly began to reverse.  On day four, theupper arm and  lymph nodes were still slightly swollen, but no longer bothered me.

I could not think clearly and made simple but yet important mistakes. I also felt moderately dizzy, especially standing up. No appetite. These symptoms lasted until Wednesday, Jan 6th, at 1730. At 1730 I suddenly felt clear headed and coherent. Duration of symptoms was 49 hrs. The sudden clarity and no longer dizzy was interesting and unexpected and noticeable.  The symptoms were fast onset and sudden termination.  Only a mild headache for an additional 24hrs.

Yesterday in the morning, I had diarrea after I ate.  After lunch, 2:30 pm , I started getting stomach cramps, which progressed from 3:00 into the evening to be pretty much unbearable to about 8:00pm. Then I broke out into a sweat, I got very hot and needed to be wipe down with a cold towels. I took my temp, but it registered as low (may not be right ). I had to lay in a fetal position to go to sleep. Awoke at 3: 30 with same symptoms. woke back up at 4 with mild cramping, and it felt like food poisoning.  I am still having mild cramping and nausea.

                                                Monday evening - Extreme pain in the arm where the injection was given. Swollen (like a baseball) and very red. I realize it would be sore; however, the pain radiated down the arm to the hand and upwards into my neck. A fever of 100 so I took tylenol.  Headache throughout the night and by morning my whole body hurt to the point I could not get out of bed.  Tuesday - I got up to go to the bathroom with help and lost consciousness. When checked at that time, I had a fever of 102, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms took place all day. I continued taking Tylenol for the pain. Not much sleep due to pain.  Wednesday - Some of the pain in the arm subsided; however, the spine pain was extreme. I struggled walking the pain severe. Throughout the day I was feeling a little better. Thursday - still body pain but tolerable.

                                                Awakened by sudden nausea and vomiting.  Vomited only once -- no stomach contents except mucus &amp; minimal stomach acid.  Nausea continued for a couple of hours, and then I slept the rest of the day (suddenly very tired).  No lingering symptoms.  Occurred 3 days after vaccination, so may have been unrelated.  -- ???

For the dizziness I had a banana and potato chips to stabilize the sugar in the blood and took about and hour nap.  Co-workers and Supervisor monitor me in case EMS needed to be call. For the pain in general I took 1 capsule Tylenol 500.  Nothing for the nausea and plenty of water to reduce swelling.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction. Shot given around 9am. Around 11am symptoms appeared: extremely hot/flushed, nauseated, felt ill, difficulty swallowing. Went to pharmacist who had me sit down, within 30 seconds could not swallow. Pharmacist injected me with Epi Pen and called 911. Paramedics arrived gave more epinephrine, oxygen, started breathing treatment. Lost my voice as throat started to tighten more. Taken to Hospital where I was given Benadryl, steroids, stomach meds, more fluids and another breathing treatment since my lungs were so tight, I could only take shallow breaths. The crated my lungs, did blood work and kept me overnight for observation because I have a history of secondary reactions when I experience anaphylaxis. I was released from the hospital on 2/20/2021 at 2pm.
