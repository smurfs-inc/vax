Got up a 2am to go to bathroom and had teeth-chattering chills.  30 minutes later vomited several times.  Fever was 99.6  last night, 99.8 this morning, and 100.2 this afternoon.  Significant pain in joints, moderate in muscles.  Feel by far worse than when I had covid.  Though these side affects typically resolved in 24 hours? Mine are no better, other than I&#39;m only nauseated, not throwing up.

When I woke up a few hours later, I noticed that I had a very bad headache and all-over body aches, and I felt like I had the flu.  Weak, nauseous and extremely tired.  I went to bed and slept through the night, when my alarm woke me at 7:00 am on Tuesday, January 5, I got up to use the bathroom and felt all the same symptoms from the night before, only worse.  I noticed that I had a rash on my left arm below the injection site.  I called in sick and went back to bed.  I slept from approximately 7:30 to 2:00 pm on January 5.  I felt a little better upon awakening, but had a very bad headache and no appetite.  The other body aches seemed better.

                                                Within a few minutes of injection had tingling sensation in tongue, followed by a couple days of increased stomach gas, tons of burping, some reflux, took Prevacid. Tongue seemed to affected during the first several days, especially along the sides, red. Didn&#39;t get concerned at first.  The common sore arm, cleared up within a few days. On about day 10 noticed large area on arm where injection given, warm red area about 4 inches by 3 inches, itchy, resolved on own by day 14 or 15.  The next week (third week) mouth seemed to be getting more sore, swallowing harder, took prevacid. Today, day 27, mouth is sore, especially noticeable along sides where there are circle looking ulcerations where surface tissue seems to be missing. Very discouraged. Doubt I feel able to receive second dose which has been postponed, by myself, until day 30. Seeing primary doctor on day 30.

                                                2.5 hours after the injection I developed left arm swelling, itching with erythemia as well as, severe headache, nausea, GI turbulence, fatigue, and chills. I had to stop working that day and the next day. The headache was unrelenting. I went to bed with a heating pad on my head. Typically my body temp is 97.3 it went up to 98.1 I took Ibuprofen and Benadryl around the clock for the next 10 days. Day 8 &amp; 9 were the worst. My arm looked like an orange at the site of the injection; it was red/inflamed, induration &amp; itched. The welt size 2&#34; x 1&#34;. My headache was intractable, severe chills with teeth chattering, nausea, GI turbulence. It was a horrible 48 hours at which time I was again not able to work. I finally felt better on day 10. On day 14 my arm finally looked like it had not had an injection in it.

All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

At 8:30 pm of the same date, I had a fever of 102 degrees, chills, severe body aches, headache and lethargy.  During that night, I experienced nausea and my whole left arm (injection arm) started to hurt a lot.  This lasted the entire next day 1/9/21 .  My fever finally broke that night.  I was still slightly achy and fatigued on 1/10/21.  On Monday 1/11/21 I was fine.

Chest pain, left sided stomach pain, and headache persisted through the night.  I was able to get some relief by takin a 325 mg Aspirin and an Advil every 2-3 hours through the night.  The chest pain was pretty bad, considered going to the ER, but persisted to fight it through to the morning.  In the morning, around 6:30 am I was exhausted, but the worst of the pain was over.  I did take another Aspirin and Advil around 8:00 am and stopped after that.  I did run a low grade fever off and on of 99.7 to 100.4.   I felt better on Saturday, but by noon I was feeling generally run down and again started to run a low grade fever off an on the rest of the day.  Sunday - what a joy to feel totally well!!

However, I could breathe easily so I just remained to relax and slowly swallowing my salia over and over again. Once home took a benedryl and was able to drink water without any problems. My throat is still somewhat scratchy after 2 hours.

Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right. I still feel fatigued and I have a full feeling around the area of my right upper abdomen ( liver), I dont have a gallbladder. Otherwise, I am OK. Just wondering about the 2nd dose. Lymph node still slightly swollen above clavicle.

Finally went to Med-One walk-in-clinic on Saturday, January 30th (only one nearby with rapid response) and got and rapid response test for both COVID and the FLU.  Results were negative.  The APRN, at the clinic, asked me to report these symptoms to you.  I have no other health issues that could have caused this abnormality, as I am normally quite healthy.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 22 Dec 2020, about 4pm, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #011J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22 Dec 2020, around 7pm, the patient experienced severe leg cramps.    On 23 Dec 2020, she experienced severe diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shaking chills and bloody diarrhea. Treatment for nausea was ondansetron.    On 24 Dec 2020, the patient experienced terrible hemorrhoid pain and abdominal pain. On 25 Dec 2020, the patient went to the emergency room where she received a computed tomography scan. The computed tomography scan of  the lower abdomen showed that earlier diagnosis of diverticulitis 27 Nov 2020 &#34;inflammation&#34; had gotten better.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not reported.  The outcome for events, severe leg cramps, severe diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shaking chills, bloody diarrhea and hemorrhoid pain, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62-year-old female patient with medical history of diverticulitis, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 011J20A), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of bloody diarrhea, the non-serious listed events of nausea and chills, and the non-serious unlisted events of severe leg cramps, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hemorrhoid pain.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s history of diverticulitis is noted.

                                                I developed chills/shivering in the evening of the vaccination (2/19/21) but was not alarmed, just tried to stay warm.  I ate normally.   I awakened in the night with extreme chills and was shaking most of the night, unable to get warm.  I felt feverish and had body aches as well as nausea.  I threw up what I could to alleviate the feeling of nausea, about 2 a.m.   I slept restlessly until 9:00 am, then tried to take a hot shower.  Though the chills were gone, I felt weak and listless and went back to bed shortly after showering.  I slept for about 4 hours.  I had little/no appetite for most of the day after the vaccine.  By the second day I still had a headache but felt better, albeit weak.   I took Ibuprofen for the body/headaches with minimal success.

Tylenol did little to decrease this fever, motrin seemed to bring it down for about and hour then would go back up again. Temp stayed between 102 to 103 through Sunday 2/21/21. Temp 99-101 on Monday 2/22/21. Today as I report, temp is 99 and continue to feel very fatigued with no energy and poor appetite.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

                                                A 63-year-old female with a medical history of Hashimoto?s Disease, on Levothyroxine 88 micrograms (4 days per week) and 100 micrograms (3 days per week), presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of acute onset of severe, debilitating, fatigue, weakness, anorexia and malaise. She had no clear precipitating events, stated that she was in her usual states of health, active, working as an optometrist at a University hospital. Stated that 1 week before symptom oncer she had her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Stated that 24hrs later her symptoms started associated with low grade subjective fever, however her fever disappeared, and she persisted with severe fatigue. She was unable to do her regular activities of daily living and was hoping her symptoms would resolve but upon persistence and given the severity of her complains she presented to evaluation. She denied recently starting any new medications/supplements, or recent change in her levothyroxine dose. There were no headaches, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, recent infectious illness or sick contacts. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s Disease over 10 years prior and had been on the same dose for more than 2 years.   VS were stable and within normal limits, physical exam was only remarkable for weakness on 4 extremities 4/5, lethargy, bradylalia, bilateral ptosis, no focal neurologic deficits, sensation intact. Laboratory workup revealed normal Hb 14.8, normal renal and kidney function, normal cortisol level, TSH normal 3.7, normal FT4: 1.2, normal CPK, negative tox screen. ESR and CRP were performed, and both were found to be elevated ESR 74, CRP 28, at that moment we decided to do immunologic workup showing high titers of ANA &gt;1:320 with a nuclear speckled pattern, and a positive rheumatoid factor 60. At this point a full rheumatologic panel was performed which was negative for anti-Ach receptor Abs, negative anti-CCP, anti- dsDNA, anti-smith, negative anti-Jo1, anti-RNP, negative anti-TPO, negative anti-SCL70, normal C4 and C3 however elevated total CH50 &gt; 60, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Her symptoms of severe fatigue persisted throughout her admission and it was decided to give her a course of prednisone 40mg for 5 days and follow up as outpatient with a Rheumatologist. Repeat workup 2 weeks after discharge showed still elevated ESR at 72, high CRP 17, rheum factor elevated again at 67.  At this point no clear cause was identified as she did not have any symptoms of Sjogren or anything else other than severe persisting fatigue.  Another course of steroids was given and 1 month later she stated that she was much improved and was able to go back to work. Stated that she would not take her second covid MODERNA vaccine dose due to fear of recurrence of symptoms. It appeared that this vaccine triggered a severe inflammatory and autoimmune reaction in this patient with history of Hashimoto?s disease. The association between MODERNA vaccine and development of autoimmunity and inflammatory reaction needs to be assessed.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

After about 6 hours after that took more Benadryl and the the next 2 days just as needed about every 8 to 10 hours   Started  chills with highest temperature was  99.4.

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

                                                Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021 I felt a little strange.  Just not myself. A little dizzy.  Went to work overnight.  Got up at 5 am Friday, Jan 8, 2021.  Still felt odd.  Dizzy. Had to think before I did anything. I stood up from the bed and sat back down again as if I was dizzy and confused.  Drove myself home from work, fed the cats and went right to bed.  I felt very fatigued, had developed a monster headache.  Was dizzy, had chills, body aches, nausea.  I brought  water bottle over to the bed with me but after laying down just could not get myself up to get a drink.  Felt very fatigued.   Slept until 2 pm.  Took my temperature.  It was 101.5.  Had no energy, ate no food, took no meds, just went back to sleep.  Still nauseous, had headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Woke up at 5:00 pm to feed cats.  That?s all I did, and go to the bathroom.  Took my temperature again.  It was 100.9.  Still felt awful:  nauseous, headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Seemed like I could  not get warm.  Stayed in bed and slept.  Saturday, Jan.  9, 2021 I woke up around 7:30 to go to the bathroom.  I fed the cats also.  Still dizzy, moving slow.  My headache was gone, but still felt unsteady.  After feeding the cats,  I went back to bed.  Slept until 12:30 that afternoon.

                                                Approx. 12:30am I awoke to a leg cramp. I arose from bed and stood up till the cramping muscle relaxed.  Then I walked to the restroom and during the short distance,I felt a sudden &#34;flush&#34;.  Upon entering restroom, I felt I was getting faint.  Feeling that I was about ready to faint, I tried to easily lower myself to the floor without striking my head or body.  Feeling very dizzy and faint, my stomach instantly felt nauseous and then vomited.  After vomiting, I  suddenly started to &#34;shake very violently&#34; (chills?).  The shaking was uncontrollable and went on for approx. 10 -15 min.  I tried to relieve the violent shaking by covering up with bath towels, that I was able to reach from the floor, where I was still sitting; but that did not seem to help.  After I did not feel so faint, I called for help to have my husband help me back into bed to try to warm up.  By that time the shaking (chills) were no longer so severe, and I was gradually able to fall back to sleep with no further problems the remainder of the night.  The following morning, and ever since that night, I have had no other adverse reactions.   For many years, I have received the yearly flu vaccine and have never had any kind of reaction, accept some minor soreness at the injection site (muscle).

                                                About 14 hours after vaccination, I had a (really bad) pulsating headache in a band around my head, body aches (hip flexors, shoulders, back, neck), chills, fever/sweats, and nausea/vomiting (threw up twice, total, about an hour or two apart after not eating for 10 hours - small amount of liquid came up). The nausea/vomiting went away about 4 hours after onset while the other symptoms remained for an additional 42 hours. I also had sinus/eye pressure that began about 22 hours after vaccination and ended with the other symptoms. Could not sleep for the duration because of headache. Very tired/sleepy about 62 hours after injection and was able to nap since headache went away. I still have soreness at injection site about 72 hours after injection.  I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn&#39;t want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days. The next worst was the nausea/vomiting, because, well, nausea/vomiting, and especially because there was nothing to bring up. And, unlike vomiting from bad food or something, you don&#39;t really feel better afterward, just still nauseated. The other symptoms were more bearable. Did not call or see doctor because I had read about these possible side effects and didn&#39;t think there was anything the doctor could do to alleviate them.

However 13th day after receiving injection  I developed severe fatigue, fevers as high as 101.9, shaking, nausea, severe itching.  overall feeling of sick.  3 days later it passed. Due to my preexisting conditions I have isolated myself for almost 1 year, followed all protocols, and very rarely out in public. I also recieved flu vaccine.  So doubt the symptoms I had could be contributed to flu bug. So since it seemed very odd I am reporting this to CDC. Note: I had 2nd dose 02/19/21. So far only reaction is sore injection site. Should I develop symptoms after several days like the ones I reported after 1st dose, I will report these to this site.

Felt exhausted and nauseous.  Slept for a few hours and got up and just sat on the couch for another few hours and then felt that same nausea and exhaustion and went to bed. Took 2 more Tylenol. Started drinking more water.  On 2/21/21 felt pretty good -- stayed in all day -- ate a little -- but saw the site on my arm just under the injection site was very large, red, and hot to the touch.  The red welt area went from just below the injection in the left arm to just above the elbow.   On 2/22/21 (today) feel pretty good.  Drinking a lot of water and tool 1 Tylenol.

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

Severe headache, body aches, chills, fever, exhaustion and diarrhea, Slight chills and arm soreness at bedtime the evening of vaccine. Woke up the next morning after vaccine in complete body pain. Diarrhea began later in day. Exactly like my COVID experience! Slept all day except to take Tylenol and Imodium.  Woke second day after vaccine feeling improvement but still tired and weak. On couch most of day. Today, 3rd day after vaccine,  much improved but still not 100%.  Will never get the 2nd dose! Have heard it is usually worse and I would probably not be able to handle it

The feeling in chest and back would last about 10 seconds, subside for a little while and then start again. This happened off and on for about an hour. The tingling in legs continued for about 2 hours. About 1 hour after I received vaccine I started having vision problems, blurriness, strange spots /lights , had trouble focusingnmyneyes. Then a terrible headache set in. I have had similar vision problems with a migraine headache in the past. Felt like it triggered a migraine. Vitals were normal. Checked out by EMS and went to local ER.

                                                Injection was at 12:00 Pm on 12/29/2020. At 12:20 PM i started to feel faint, slightly nauseous . I layed down on my office floor, , my heart rate went up to 140 BPM and BP was around 140/76. My MA checked it . One of my physician colleague&#39;s that was nearby checked on me as well as the nurse that gave me the injections. it took about 30-40 minutes for the symptoms to subside. I was sent to our Urgent care dept in the same clinic by wheelchair at around 12:30-12:40 pm. I was evaluated and my symptoms subsided in 30-40 minutes. I was out of Urgent care at 1:25 pm, able to walk upstairs back to my office and felt okay and was seeing patients again at 1:30 PM.  This reaction was similar to getting a shot of Novocaine w/ epinephrine for a dental procedure I received a few years ago, so if I were to sum it up it was like getting a shot of epinephrine. it was not a vasovagal reaction as my BP was high. I have felt fine since. I plan to get the second vaccine. Any suggestions to avoid these symptoms w/ the second one would be appreciated.

                                                awakened at 0500 the following morning with a blinding migraine and nausea.  Prior to that there were no sequelae.  No redness or swelling at the injection site; mild generalized muscle aches.  Took ibuprofen 600 mg tid for 36 hours.  Additional -- difficulty concentrating, some word finding issues and fatigue.  Symptoms resolved after 52 hours.

                                                Uneasy stomach with very soft stools in every visit to the bathroom and on a few occasions in between.  Awkward, to say the least. Started overnight after day of vaccination and has continued for over 24 hours and has not yet resolved although frequency has started to diminish as of 48 hours.  Also visibly flushed face/hot flashes, slight rise in temperature at 98.4 (over my normal baseline of 97.5) this morning which has since receded.  Waiting to see how long this lasts.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

It only lasted a few minutes.   About after an hour of being home, I had an issue swallowing only once.   I don&#39;t know if adverse reaction, or panic attack.  I have my 2nd dose schedule for the beginning of Feb  I will let them know what happened.   Also, quarter size red spot on right arm.   It hurt when touched.   Lasted a couple days.

My husband had called 911 when my blood pressure dropped so low.  By the time they arrived it was back up to normal.   I have never had any problems with blood pressure,  low or high. Or with dizziness,  fainting etc. I am very sure it was from the vaccine

                                                Patient had the first Moderna Covid vaccine on Thursday 1/21/2021.  She had a bit of sore arm on that day and the day after.  On Saturday 1/23/2021, she had a fever of 100.5 F (11AM), nausea, light headache and chills. The temperature went down after she took ibuprofen.  Patient&#39;s husband enrolled her to V-Safe to report all the adverse effects she experienced. On Sunday 1/24/2021, her temperature was 98.3F. She still had nausea and no appetite.  She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included two time cancer survivor . Concomitant medications reported included Carvedilol for high blood pressure, acetamide for cholesterol, potassium, multivitamins, zinc, calcium, Vitamin D.  On 05 Feb,  prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 031L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Patient was ok at midnight, but when they woke up, they felt very dizzy, were vomiting that day, and experienced extreme tiredness for 3 weeks, now they feel relatively recovered, like 90%, but still somewhat tired, probably related to not been able to eat on account of having very limited appetite. They mentioned they had limited bowel function, and their bladder felt full, like they could not empty it. Patient states they had a dry mouth from  the beginning of the symptoms.  After a week of these symptoms, on Saturday, the patient went to a clinic and they did some bloodwork and found that the liver enzymes were elevated and 5 more values were not normal and that their kidney function was not normal.  They consulted with their oncologist and they believed these could be an extreme immune response to the vaccine, since the lab work conducted on the 23Dec2020 was normal.  Last Friday they have some blood tests and the values were back to normal.  Treatment for the events included paracetamol and ibuprofen alternating; and  Prednisone.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, dizziness, vomiting, fatigue, dry mouth were relatively recovered, like 90%, but still somewhat tired.  The outcome events,  urinary retention,  decreased appetite,   and limited bowel function are unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Severe dizziness to the point I was unable to walk or even sit without fear of passing out or falling and had to lay on the floor. Rapid heart rate, nausea, felt like blood pressure was going up a lot.  Afraid I was on the verge of having a stroke. Symptoms hit abruptly with no warning. Were severe for about an hour and then started subsiding.  Gradually felt better over the course of a couple of hours. After about 6 hours, symptoms completely gone and I felt fine.

COVID test negative yesterday.  Plan another test tomorrow.   I am an RN at the Health Center on campus.  Unsure if the latter symptoms are adverse event to vaccine, but felt it should be reported.

                                                While driving home after leaving facility 15 minutes after shot, I started having an increased heart rate.  Once home, the rapid heart rate continued and I noticed throat swallowing was getting a little tighter.  I started drinking water and just breathed normally sitting down.  I went to a mirror to see if I could see any swelling of my face and noticed my neck right under my chin was red about half way down.  My chest seemed fine.  I continued to just sit &amp; drink water and soon the heart rate was getting back to normal.  I noticed the redness on my neck was getting lighter also.  I looked at my watch and it had been a little over an hour since my vaccination.  I did not seek treatment, nor have I called my doctor.  There have been no more adverse reactions.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

                                                When I first got the vaccine I was fine but as the day went on I felt soreness in my left arm with some stiffness in my neck. Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

Over next 36 hours fever was between 100-102. Nausea began 48 hours after injection.  It is now Tuesday, almost 4 days since injection and am still dizzy and weak.  Fever stopped yesterday and only light headache today.   My husband also had all my symptoms except a much lower fever.  We are wondering if we could have got a bad batch???  They said to expect 1-2 days of mild discomfort.  This was like the worst flu I&#39;ve ever had.

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

                                                Patient appeared nervous upon receiving vaccine. Patient reported trouble swallowing ( has a history of radiation therapy on throat). When asked if breathing was restricted, patient was able to take long breaths with minimal additional effort. Shortly after, patient appeared to be close to passing out (not completely awake and alert), eyes dilated. The pharmacist who administered the vaccine then administered one dose of the epinephrine (Epi-pen LOT:0FM353/eEXP:NOC 21) while the staff member kept the patient stable in her chair. The facility was instructed to call 911. At 11:49 AM (7 minutes later), symptoms began to improve and the patient became more alert. EMS arrived around 12:00PM to take patient to hospital--patient refused and was back walking around the facility 5 minutes later. No further issues were reported with this patient (pharmacist administering the vaccine left the facility around 1:15PM)

She was noted to have significant nongranulomatous anterior chamber reaction (2&#43; cell). There was no hypopyon or keratic precipitates. She was symptomatic with pain and light sensitivity in the right eye only. (Of note, the left eye was quiet. It had undergone cataract surgery and recently discontinued postoperative steroid drops). I discontinued the Tobradex and start Durezol drops every 2 hours. Of note, she has no history of uveitis. I saw her again 1/12/21 with complete resolution of the inflammation. She is currently tapering down on the topical steroid. I will see her again on 1/26/21 while taking Durezol 1x/day. This should be about 3 days from her second vaccination

Started getting sick to her stomach all evening, started throwing up last night beginning at 11:00 PM, throwing up bile.  Today having fever of 101, didn&#39;t take anything for it, but down to 100 now.  Took 2 Tums and had such achy joints and sat down in a chair and could not get up from the chair.  Took some Tylenol and that helped, but freezing cold.  Didn&#39;t sleep all night.  Has not notified her doctor of the symptoms, just calling us.

On Jan 27th (7 days following vaccination) a large (2.5&#34; X 4&#34;) red area formed around the injection site on my arm and it began to ache and itch. I also had diarrhea which began in the middle of the night (2 am on Jan 28), with a total of 3 episodes over 3 hours. That day I was very tired, experienced intestinal upset  (w/ very small episodes of diarrhea) and my arm began to really ache and the swollen area became rather firm and hot. The intestinal episode is over but the hot red welt continues as of this report. Diarrhea is not a common condition for me.

                                                I have had very intense diarrhea for a week now since vaccine. i I was not aware of this as a listed side effect, but it started over 8 hours after shot and has continued for a week now.  I have taken Imodium and it has helped but the minute this wear off diarrhea returns. The thing is I just NEVER have diarrhea, in 67 years you   could count on 1 hand the times I have had mild diarrhea, never anything like this.  I would classify this as violet diarrhea.

                                                I received the 1st shot of the Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine on 1/23/21 at the Pharmacy. Three days later I started experiencing sharp abdominal cramps with gas that I couldn&#39;t expel and abdominal bloating. I am still experiencing this 6 days later from when it started. I feel better when laying down but when I stand up I have this really heavy feeling in my lower abdomen. I also experience abdominal cramps not long after eating. I am not constipated. In fact, I&#39;ve been having a lot more bowel movements which is not normal for me. Also, on Sunday, 1/31, eight days after injection, I developed a red patch that was very warm on my left arm where I received the injection and a headache. The red patch is still there. I&#39;m concerned about this and wonder if this may be related to one of the ingredients in the vaccine, i.e., polyethylene glycol.  I have reported this to my M.D. this morning and they are asking me to come in.

                                                I felt queasy at 5:15am.  Had severe vomiting and diarrhea throughout the day, with a fever of 100 degrees. Tried taking a Pepcid, but got dry heaves. Had nine episodes of diarrhea. Called the doctor at 1:40pm who recommended tablespoons of water every 10 minutes.  The nausea and dry heaves  would not stop so my husband called the doctor again at 7:00pm who recommended the emergency room for an IV.  But at 7:30pm, the nausea lifted, and I was able to sleep.

                                                I received this vaccine at a walk-in-clinic, called STAT Med.  About 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt nauseated but finally managed to sleep.  The next afternoon on February 23 I became very ill with vomiting and diarrhea all at the same time.  I nearly passed out several times.  First responders arrived and found my blood pressure to be about 70/30.  Got in ambulance and given fluids.  Arrived at hospital around 5:15 pm.  Got more fluids and numerous blood tests, none of which were very remarkable.  My WBC was 17 but nothing else was wrong.  Left hospital at 9:00.  Physician assumes Covid vaccine cause these side effects.

I was having difficulty catching my breath and unable to burp or clear the liquid.  After three tries, I was able to clear the airway and was able to breathe well.  I also checked my blood pressure which was 163/83.  I had phlegm in my throat and could clear it with drinking water.  After approximately 40 minutes of checking and rechecking my blood pressure and drinking water, I was able to sleep until 9:00 am.  It is now 24 hours from the injection and I feel much better.

I had all these symptoms in January and July too. The only thing that I didn?t have was a deep cough and trouble breathing that I also had in January and July.

Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility.

Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

Started with severe chills, body shaking, achy all over, head felt like it was going to implode, started to sweat and felt flushed.  Woke up my spouse to get me something to take for headache, etc.  Later that morning could hard lift the Arm, felt a golf ball size lump at injection site and warm to the touch. Was in bed 2 days bcuz it exacerbated my MS.  After that the injection site started itching, with redness.  Lump finally getting smaller.  I took a photo of the injection site which has a red circle the size of my hand.

                                                At 3:30 pm (2 hours after the injection) my arm at the injection site started to hurt and I felt light-headed and had chills,  These symptoms continued, plus I became exhausted and my joints hurt.  My stomach was queasy.  By the next morning, my joints hurt so much it was difficult to roll over in bed, and all the other symptoms were still there and worse.  I did not have a fever.  I developed a headache.  All I could do was lie in bed; sitting up felt exhausting.  By evening of that day, my joint pain was lessening and my stomach felt somewhat better.  By the following morning, I felt normal, basically.  So in total, about a day and a half of bad reaction.

                                                Four hours after injection suffered severe body pains with nausea for several hours, and red rash about two inches in diameter popped up. The next day the injection site was red, with an expanding hard tissue underneath the skin, about five inches in diameter. Seven days later the rash was almost gone. Eight days later the rash came back with a vengeance, extremely itchy and expanding to three inches in diameter. As of this report, at ten days post-injection, the rash remains at three inches diameter and itchy.

                                                I felt fine until the morning of Jan. 10 (except for very painful arm).  I was awakened early in the morning by severe vertigo (my eyes were blinking rapidly and the room was spinning violently); I was nauseous and couldn&#39;t lie down without the violent spinning re-occurring.  I was very dizzy and exhausted the whole day, unable to function.  The next day I continued to be very dizzy and off-balance, couldn&#39;t work but better than prior day.  Each day, same symptoms have continued but milder.  I called my PCP on Monday, Jan 11.  He told me it sounded like an inner ear problem, probably unrelated to the vaccine and to call him the next day and report my symptoms.  I did (Tues. Jan 12) and reported dizziness was milder but still there.  He suggested I see an ENT doctor.

After one hour I was fine.  Second vaccine was administered on Feb. 8th at noon. By 3:30 AM Feb 9th I could barely get out of bed because of severe joint pain and aching. I was nauseated, had a mild fever, mild headache and very tired. This lasted until  February the 10th at which time I felt better. By Feb. 11th I had return of deep aching pain in my hips and pelvic bones. ( I have arthritis and know what joint pain is). This was much worse. I felt ill from about one week after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna. I started feeling much better with the occasional return of mild symptoms.  I go to physical therapy for arthritis pain and had taken a week off. I returned to physical therapy on Thursday. February 18th. I was unable to complete my usual workout due to weakness in my legs and joint pain. I returned on Feb. 22nd and the same thing happened I felt weak, diaphoretic, nauseated,  after exercising a short time. This has never happened before.

                                                On Wednesday, February  17, 2021 around 7:00 pm I had a pounding headache that I never experienced before.  The next morning headache began again and started vomiting at 7:45 a.m. thru out the morning until 11:30 a.m.  I could not eat anything , tried eating a piece of toast &amp; after one bite the vomiting began again.  I vomited again at 3:15 p.m.  Tried again to eat white rice and immediately began vomiting again.  On Thursday morning had a slight headache with no vomiting.  Friday I felt OK, just weak from all the vomiting.  Saturday morning I felt Okay, then suddenly I felt dizzy and though I was going to faint.  My daughter immediately told me that she was driving me to the ER because I was pretty dehydrated.  Was diagnosed with dehydration at the ER.

I was shaky for a couple of more hours.  I had an upset stomach. I was very cold, but had waited in a 2 hour line outside in 20 degree weather because they were overwhelmed at the facility. And only had 3 doctors giving the shots.    I was able to swallow the whole time.

About and Hour or so later got up to go to the restroom and just remember walking thru the door. Next thing I knew I was on the floor bleeding,  passed out approx. 24 hrs after receiving shot.  No way to know how long I was out, received head cut.

                                                On the first day of the injection (1/14/2021) the left arm was sore and I felt tired. Towards evening and during the night I felt cold and hot at the same time - an intense burning/freezing sensation, but no sweating. On the first day after the injection (1/15/201) the arm was still sore and I still felt tired - burning/freezing sensation had ceased. On the second day after the injection (1/16/2021) the left arm was not sore and I felt better, but at 11:00 a.m. the vein in the left temple burst and bled until about 6:00 p.m. Continuous throbbing pain across the forehead the entire day. The  middle of the forehead is covered with red dots; the area near the left eye has a number of open, bloody lesions; the area below the temple (left cheek) is black and blue. There are also two bright red spots on my left knee - but no bleeding. Nausea was slight, but present during the entire day on Saturday and Sunday. Since the hospitals have Covid 19 patients and I do not have a car, I stayed home and rested in bed.  Today on Sunday (1/17/2021) I can sit up and walk around somewhat; the throbbing pain in the head has ceased. The lesions are still vivid red , but slowly forming a crust.  Will make contact with my doctor  on Monday, when the office is open.

                                                4 days after the vaccine, I had EXCRUCIATING nerve pain, starting at the upper vertabrae and  shooting down both arms to fingertips. Sometimes all the way down my back and the back of my legs.  I vomited all day, had a low fever which  lasted for 24 hours, then the pain and fever subsided. Still have nausea but no more vomiting .  I went to a doctor  after that, he also thinks it was a reaction..  On the 7th day, a purple splotchy rash showed on my skin and my hands started swelling up at night, so painful I couldn&#39;t even pull up the sheet.  The hand swelling goes down during the day and comes back at night.  I plan to get an antibody test  on  Feb. 26.  I am 98% certain that I had COVID in July, it was precisely the same symptoms and I had with the vaccine.  No treatment, just resting tilll it&#39;s over.  I am almost 80% better now, but not completely. I worry that I will never get back to 100%, it&#39;s been  11 days now.

                                                Neurology consult note 2/16: The patient is a 72-year-old woman, who states that last Friday she began to notice a strange fullness and numbness and perhaps a mild degree of weakness in her right leg and came to  Emergency Room.  She was seen by ER doctors.  Diagnosis was unclear.  She was offered admission to get physical therapy, but she did not wish to stay for the weekend and returned home on Friday the evening only to come back to the ER on Sunday, 2 days later with progression of further right leg weakness, right leg numbness and a hint of new left-sided symptoms that had not begun before Sunday.  None of her symptoms involve the arms or face and everything was below the waist.  There was no significant pain.  She has not had a bowel movement since Thursday and has lost the ability to void.  Her MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine was reviewed by me on the computer monitor and was unrevealing except for mild DJD.  Thoracic MRI scan shows possible spinal cord infarction versus myelitis occurring within the thoracic spine at the dorsal surface of the cord at the T5 and T6 vertebral body levels to the right of midline.  This was a faint finding and not clearly infarct or myelitis and could be artifact.  It appears that she has hydronephrosis on her scans too and now is using a Foley catheter.  She does have a history of high cholesterol for which she takes a statin at home and was taking a baby aspirin a day when the above symptoms occurred. In summary, the patient has a 72-year-old woman, who presents with progressive right lower extremity weakness and now evolving left lower extremity weakness.  This may be related to an autoimmune process such as myelitis or less commonly cord ischemia.  Normally, I would start her on Plavix, but I think she may need to undergo spinal tap tomorrow if MRI scan of the brain and cervical spine are unrevealing.  Patients with mild hyperglycemia can develop a diabetic amyotrophy or lumbosacral plexopathy simply related to diabetes, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Speaking against this would be that her reflexes are intact at both knees at 2&#43; to 3 and slightly brisk, 1&#43; at both ankles and 1&#43; and symmetric in the upper extremities.  We will hold aspirin for today.  Consider LP for tomorrow, but have not ordered as we will try to avoid and hopefully the imaging studies I have ordered will be sufficient.  We will continue to follow.  While admitted to this facility, she was treated with IV dexamethasone 2/14-2/21  She was admitted to an inpatient hospital 2/14-2/23 and discharged to an inpatient rehab unit at a different health system.

Into the night I began vomiting (which lasted all night)  I became feverish, had chills with body shaking, extreme nausea. (temp 102) This persisted to the next day and I went to the ER.  There I was given  multiple liters of IV fluids,  IV Zofran and IV Tylenol.   I felt better after treatment but still had the intense headache and ringing in the ears.  The next day, I&#39;m now gradually beginning to feel better, just weak.  I can eat today, two days after the injection and slowly beginning to feel better.   This reaction was terrible for me.

                                                First vaccine digestive symptoms and minor aches; very sore left arm lasted 7 days; 2nd vaccine: 102 degree fever on next day; aches and pains all over; could barely get out of bed; inability to eat at all for 24 hours; digestive symptoms: gas, acid refulx, nausea; giant burps. By next day, very painful electric transitory pains (seconds) in core of my vascular formation in my upper left leg. This is a congenital defect that responds to estrogen, but also some medicines like synthroid, which I do not take after getting reaction with just 3 pills. Successfully moderated Hashimoto&#39;s with strict gluten-free and dairy-free diet. I have never experience such severe leg pain and massive swelling, still happening today. Th The only other time that I have experienced these short intermitent &#34;electric&#34; pains was during infertility treatment at age 40, more than 30 years ago. I suspect something in the adjuvant. I hope that this will exit my body because the sudden swelling and severe pain is not something I can endure. It barely beats dying from Covid-19. My quality of life is wrecked for the time being. I suspect that this vaccine has caused an autoimmune attack on my vascular malformation; that my T cells have gone beserk. I&#39;d be willing to have my antibodies against Covid checked and I&#39;ll bet I have more than average! The havoc for people with autoimmunity and Moderna vaccine is serious. I despair and hope that it won&#39;t have a lasting impact on my health. I will volunteer to be studied, but no more Moderna vaccine for me! I trusted the medical establishment and government and this has not worked out well!

Shortly after that , while driving, had nausea, &amp; muscle aches to legs &amp; arms.  Reaching family members home, could barely carry bags with each arm, due to pain in joints, and to muscles, getting worse.  Through the next 6 hrs. had moderate to severe pain to joints, &amp; muscles &amp; gradually severe fatigue. Took 1 Tylenol 650 mg for pain.   Also, checked temperature thru out this time, with only mild 99.5 temp.  Vaccine site gradually became swollen, with increased pain.  Was doing work on computer, but could not continue, so left for my home, &amp; went to bed, to sleep.  Lt.  Arm started becoming red, with severe soreness &amp; swelling by 1/28/21, 2 days after vaccine.  Vaccine was given very high on my arm, almost shoulder area.  All Symptoms continued for about 10 days, including  to vaccine arm, which continued with redness &amp; soreness for 2 weeks.   My physician was notified.   She advised NSAID before #2 dose, but I already take NSAID daily (Meloxicam), so don&#39;t think I can take another NSAID.  I have been taking Tylenol 650mg at least twice a day, for increased joint &amp; muscle pain, since vaccine.  My 2nd dose, originally scheduled for 2/23/21 has been rescheduled to 2/27/21 due to no vaccines available.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included rosuvastatin and eye drop.  On 16 Jan 2021, approximately 0 days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number 041L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced chills, nausea and headache, all of which resolved within 36 hours on 18 Jan 2021. She took 3 Tylenol, and a Zomig to help with the symptoms.  On 24 Jan 2021, the patient began to experience neuropathy in her finger and right arm, which she reported as it was getting worse.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The events, chills, nausea and headache, were considered resolved on 18 Jan 2021. The outcomes of the events, neuropathy in the finger / neuropathy in the right arm  were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report concerns a 73-year-old female patient who experienced a serious event of neuropathy in the right finger and non-serious events of chills, nausea and headache. The events of chills, nausea and headache occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of the vaccine mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot #: Unknown, expiration date-Unknown). Neuropathy occurred 8 days after the administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine. Treatment administered included Tylenol and Zomig for chills, nausea and headache with resolution.  The events of chills, nausea and headache are consistent with the safety profile for mRNA-1273 vaccine.  Based on the information provided, including temporal association and in the absence of any other etiology, a causal association cannot be excluded for all reported events. Causality for the event of neuropathy is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Main field defaults to possibly related&#39;

                                                At about 2 pm, 2-19-2021, I became very light-headed rather suddenly, and could barely stand up or walk.  (A trip from my bed to the bathroom was difficult.)  This proceeded to severe nausea (I retched into the. toilet bowl a couple of times and came close to vomiting).  I dosed in bed and the severity of the symptoms eased, but I really haven&#39;t felt completely over it until today (2-22-2021).

                                                Typical expected side effects but were very SEVERE and UNable to function normally- headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Dizziness, Chills, Cold Sweats, Pain and soreness especially in lower back, and throat hurt when swallow.  These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

Started feeling sick during the night, knew something was wrong.  Could barely get out of bed, was hot, possibly low grade fever, had chills, was achy, bad headache like you feel when having the flu, weakness.   Took Tylenol and her regular medicines.

                                                First Vaccine, no side effects except sore arm for one day and a lot of bruising at injection site which left in 8 days. Vaccine 2 awakened at 2:00 AM in extraordinary pain in my whole body,, dry heaved for 4 hours, sweats and chills, temp only 99 (I usually run 97) Felt sick to stomach rest of  day. Never felt this sick.  By evening it left as quickly as it came.  Was tired for several days but nothing else. On Feb 16th awakened with an very sharp pain in the injection site when I moved my arm up to stretch. This has gotten worse every day. When I move my arm in a certain direction it feels like it is ripping inside. It is not bruised and not painful to the touch. It is inside and in the same location as the injection. Heat and ice make no difference. It seems to be getting more painful and feel it more often. It is painful enough that I let out a yelp when I forget and lift my arm a certain way. As of yesterday I feel it all day, not the sharp pain but more a inside burning, not enough to stop me, but I know it os there.

                                                woke up a little tired; Achy arm; Diarrhea; Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 74-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced diarrhea, achy arm/vaccination site pain, tired/fatigue and inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot: L0AM20A) on 28-Jan-2021. On 16-Feb-2021, approximately 6 hours prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot: 015M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Six hours, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine the patient reported that she had diarrhea, just once. She stated that went to sleep and woke up a little tired the next day and had some diarrhea. The patient reported that she was a little tired and slept for nine and a half hours.  She also stated that she had an achy arm. On 17-Feb-2021, she stated that she was feeling fine at that time.   Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, diarrhea, achy arm/vaccination site pain, tired/fatigue, was considered unknown . The outcome of the event, inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 Y/O F with nonserious unexpected event of inappropriate schedule of product administration with mRNA-1273 (lot # unknown) and adverse events of NS unexpected diarrhea and NS expected vaccination site pain, fatigue.  Adverse events occurred 6 hours after second dose mRNA-1273, and event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Pain/nausea elevated BP and decreased food intake which caused low blood sodium levels. IV treatments to increase sodium and lower BP. Dizziness from low sodium and high BP created fall risk, so bed had alarm.  Bed confinement necessitated daily injections to prevent blood clots.  Twice daily blood tests done to monitor sodium and potassium levels &#43; kidney function.

The only medical attention they sought at this time was a home health hospice nurse as the patient had been on hospice.  Her condition spontaneously improved without treatment after 3 days and 6 days after her vaccination she was at her normal baseline.

                                                Woke up about 1:00 am in delirium and feverish. No control over thought process or able to get up. Managed to get out of bed at 9:00 am but was so weak could barely make it up a flight of stairs. And when I did ended up in bathroom vomiting. Laid on floor to get some strength back. Went back to bed and slept restlessly until 4:00 pm.  Still feverish and weak but not as bad as earlier. Ate some cold grapes and went back to bed until the following morning. Tried to stay hydrated and took ibuprofen several times. My upper arm was red and blotchy for 3 days. Overall I?d say the severest part of the event lasted 48 hrs and another 24 hrs of tiredness and nausea but not vomiting.
