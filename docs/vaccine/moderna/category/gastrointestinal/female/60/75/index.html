Got up a 2am to go to bathroom and had teeth-chattering chills.  30 minutes later vomited several times.  Fever was 99.6  last night, 99.8 this morning, and 100.2 this afternoon.  Significant pain in joints, moderate in muscles.  Feel by far worse than when I had covid.  Though these side affects typically resolved in 24 hours? Mine are no better, other than I&#39;m only nauseated, not throwing up.

                                                Monday, January 4 in the evening I became very fatigued, to the point where I couldn&#39;t stay awake.  When I woke up a few hours later, I noticed that I had a very bad headache and all-over body aches, and I felt like I had the flu.  Weak, nauseous and extremely tired.  I went to bed and slept through the night, when my alarm woke me at 7:00 am on Tuesday, January 5, I got up to use the bathroom and felt all the same symptoms from the night before, only worse.  I noticed that I had a rash on my left arm below the injection site.  I called in sick and went back to bed.  I slept from approximately 7:30 to 2:00 pm on January 5.  I felt a little better upon awakening, but had a very bad headache and no appetite.  The other body aches seemed better.

                                                Within a few minutes of injection had tingling sensation in tongue, followed by a couple days of increased stomach gas, tons of burping, some reflux, took Prevacid. Tongue seemed to affected during the first several days, especially along the sides, red. Didn&#39;t get concerned at first.  The common sore arm, cleared up within a few days. On about day 10 noticed large area on arm where injection given, warm red area about 4 inches by 3 inches, itchy, resolved on own by day 14 or 15.  The next week (third week) mouth seemed to be getting more sore, swallowing harder, took prevacid. Today, day 27, mouth is sore, especially noticeable along sides where there are circle looking ulcerations where surface tissue seems to be missing. Very discouraged. Doubt I feel able to receive second dose which has been postponed, by myself, until day 30. Seeing primary doctor on day 30.

Episode lasted several hours, next 24 hours was dizzy, weak, and soreness of arm. Had another slight episode of dizziness, sinus congestion, tiredness, and chills on day 11 after the vaccine.

Nausea to the point of emesis by 1630, headache increased in severity and beginning to chill, visible tremoring, requiring my leave from work before the end of my shift. Sore at injection site by  2000 hrs. site had swollen to the side of a tangerine orange red, hard, tender, the previous injection site from the first vaccine approximately one inch above was also swollen, and red, but the size of a dime stacked 3x. Both injections sites had their own circular indurations, I have never had a reaction to vaccine like this. My arm ached going down to my fingers and up into my neck. My spine ached from the base of the skull to my tailbone, and my hips, but not as severe as the first vaccine reaction.  I was able to move without being brought to tears. The nausea persisted.  The chilling this time brought a low grade fever 99.8.   Unable to work the second day after the vaccine.  Symptoms persist  till Saturday around 1600hrs then completely gone. Reported S/S to Dr. day of  second dose of the vaccine administered.  Advised to continue Tylenol .

                                                Buzzing or fizzing feeling, primarily in left chest, under skin, above my heart. Also I have arm soreness in my left arm where I got the injection, malaise/fatigue, joint pain, and mild nausea. But I&#39;m making this report due to the strange development of buzzing/fizzing in my chest.  It seems unrelated to breathing. I have a Kardia 6-lead EKG and it is reading normal. My blood pressure is about where it usually is (143/93, elevated due to as-yet untreated Cushing&#39;s Syndrome. I do take metoprolol succinate to bring it down somewhat, but diastolic has been chronically 90 and above for several months despite medication.) I don&#39;t feel this is a cardiac event, but of course I would like to be sure. It has been constant on and off fizzing/buzzing since 7:30 this morning (may also have been occurring while I was asleep), and it&#39;s now 11:08 a.m. My question is whether I need to go to urgent care/ER. Plan is to call Moderna and talk to them about this, and then make a decision about what to do next. I&#39;m reading online that this could be an immune response, that some people with COVID get the fizzing and buzzing. But I never stop with Dr. Google. I&#39;m going to speak with the manufacturer and then either my primary care doc or an urgent care/ER doc. So I clicked &#34;none of the above&#34; below, but I will likely be seeing a doctor today.

                                                On Thursday, Jan 21st, I woke up with the worst heart burn and I thought I&#39;d have to throw up.  Nothing I have ever experienced before. Then I ended up with a rash/hives on my rear which spread to my lower back and my thighs - later getting one on my face near my left eye. It only started itching a few days after.  I started taking Benadryl for a couple nights.   I found out my coworkers all had similar side effects and we all had the vaccine on the same day.   No one had any side effects right after having the shot - except for feeling tired.

Rested on the couch, huddled under a blanket from about 12:30 on Saturday afternoon till about 11pm when I then went to bed.  During the day on Saturday I took at total of 4 ibuprofen, spaced out, and slept on an off.  By 6:30 am Sunday when I woke up, still a little fatigued, and slight body aches and still lymph node swelling and pain.  Went about with normal routine on Sunday, just a little slower.  By Monday morning the only side effect left was the lymph node pain and swelling and pain around the injection site.  At the time of this report, about 7 pm Monday, the lymph nodes are almost pain free, the injection site is slightly painful when touched.

                                                2:00am. Chills started first. Then chills got so bad I started shaking uncontrollably almost like seizures. I used slow breathing methods to try to reduce my shaking. I used an extra large heating pad with 4 blankets but could not get my body warm. I felt like i was suffering from hypothermia. I moved my heating pad around to large body parts to try to warm individual body parts to  slow my severe shaking.  My  severe shaking and extreme chills  went on for at least 4 hours. I felt nauseous and felt like I might vomit. I got in shower at 6;30 am to get into a hot shower. I could not lift my left leg without extreme pain in my lower left back. The pain in my back then moved to my hips, then my upper right side. I had diarrhea for 2 days and indigestion after eating small bits of food.   I took Tylenol gel caps on Sunday morning with a full glass of water and went to sleep at 10:00 am. I woke up with my hip joints and left ear pain.

My blood pressure readings 140/70, 166/76, 144/80 and 161/89. My doctor put me on BP medication, Metoprolol to take for a few days. I also experienced jaw pain and I went to the dentist where an x-ray was done, which was negative. I was also put on antibiotics due to a suspected middle ear infection. I felt like I had a spiral headache.  I saw my PCP, nurse practitioner who gave me a steroid injection which helped. I have cancelled my second dose injection. I have been sick for 4 weeks. I still have the jaw pain with a ringing sensation to my left ear.  Tomorrow I will go get more tests done. I am also having swollen neck with lymph nodes swollen.

                                                2/24/21 about midnight I was not feeling well. I was having stomach pain. At 3:00am (2?25/21) i woke hot and stomach pain was worse. About 4:00am diarrhea started.  I never went back to sleep that day.  At 6:00am after a shower I notice a bump by my left clavicle.  I notice it was movement about the size of a nickel.  I called Dr. office, they agreed to see me in the afternoon.  At 3:30pm I saw Dr. said that it&#39;s lymph and I should keep an eye on it.  He recommends an ultra sound if not better in two weeks. Left shoulder is painful and it is a little hard to type, but not a big deal. 2/25/21 about 9:00pm I went to the bathroom I had a bright red bowels.   2?26/21 I am waiting for Dr. (she has been my stomach doctor for many years) to speak with her about the bloody bowel.  I will also call Dr. a message to keep her up

                                                Approx 30 minutes after my 1st Moderna vaccination,  I noticed that I was having difficulty swallowing water.  I soon began to not feel very well.  Sort of light headed.  My heart was racing.  When I looked at my watch it recorded my heart rate at 160 beats per minute!!  I started taking deep breaths and a technique called EFT tapping to calm me down.  Eventually it worked, but I felt extreme tiredness after that.  When I woke up in the morning my entire face was swollen.  I also noticed on the 2nd day after vaccine shot I had dark purple circles under my eyes.  None of those things have ever happened to me before in my life.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the vaccine on Thursday I had a very metallic taste. Shortly after breakfast on the morning of the 25 I had a lump in my throat as though my food didn&#39;t go all the way down. Then, as the day wore on I got more &amp; more fatigued; later in the day my lips were mildly numb. I had no appetite at supper time and started getting a headache along with chills. All day Saturday I had flu-like symptoms, chills (no fever) extreme tiredness and a dull headache and laid under a blanket all day, no energy. Saturday evening around dinner time I started feeling better and Sunday woke up feeling as though nothing had happened other than a dull headache and soreness at the injection site.

Gastrointestinal tract noisy and gassy...gastritis. I eat healthy I.e. gentle, bland goods since starting diarrhea Sunday morning (currently Tuesday).

                                                I noticed many days after getting the first shot a kind of sick all over feeling, loose stools and cramping lower GI, nausea gassiness, a lot of phlegm in throat, headache, and some chest pain, each evening just after dark and into bedtime. The last day I had it was yesterday and it was all day. My doctor asked me to report this to you. By the way I have the date wrong my vaccine was 02/19/2021 but the form won&#39;t let me go back to fix it. Symptoms came up suddenly 7 days later.

                                                She got her vaccine and had no reactions at all.  On 3/12/21 she was in her car and started having stabbing pain in the left side of her chest under the rib.  She thought it was gas pains and dismissed it, and then it started radiating towards the front and the stomach.  On 3/16/21 she went to the ER and they did a CT scan that showed that she had a blood clot on her spleen.  With that they gave her the diagnosis of idiopathic splenic infarction.  She was then sent by ambulance to another hospital to be admitted in case she was needing surgery.  She was given heparin and on that for 2 1/2 days.  They determined that 60% of her spleen is dead, blood supply cut off to it, and the other 40% is nonfunctional.  On 3/19/21 they gave her vaccines of Prevnar 13, HIB, meningococcal, meningococcal B, and a flu vaccine.  She was discharged on the 3/20/21 with Plavix.  She saw her regular doctor yesterday and he diagnosed her with functional asplenia and to continue the Plavix.   She is no longer having any symptoms after dissolving the blood clot.

                                                She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.  Then her arm started hurting to the point that she could not move it.  On Thursday, 3/25/21 she was tired but functional.  Then around 5:30 PM she started feeling really strange, odd, felt faint, got hot/cold, her heart was racing.  She laid down as she was at a friends house, they checked her BP, blood sugar and her temperature and they were all normal at that point.  Around 8:00 PM she got the nausea that would not stop and took Zofran.  Around 9:30 she started throwing up.  She then tried Phenergan and was not able to keep that down yesterday.  Then she started running a temperature, and called her doctors office and told her what to look for and to call back if things got worse.  They then got worse, called them back and then around 8:00 AM on Friday they told her to go to the hospital.  When she got to the hospital they started checking things as her fever was higher, her liver enzymes, her thyroid, her kidneys, iron just started going off the page.  Her fever then kept getting higher and higher and at one point it was documented at 104.8, and felt like her organs hurt.  11 days prior to this visit she had just had labs done and everything was normal.  So due to the new findings everything was all elevated, so they checked her for an infection, COVID which was negative, but the intensity of the symptoms got to the point they were unbearable.  She stayed in the hospital for 4 days, and the doctor came in and noted that she had a severe reaction to the vaccine.    They told her to stay longer than the 15 minutes as they had some issues today, and told her that they had to call a medic for 4 other people that passed out, which made her wonder if they had a bad batch or not, and wonders how many people from that day got sick as well.     She still has the most dreadful fatigue, headache and cannot walk from her house to the mailbox without feeling like she is going to faint and used to walking 2-4 miles daily.  Wonders how long is this going to last and that this will pass and that she will be okay, or is she going to be permanently this way.  She feels like she has a bad case of mono or something and cannot stay up and has to go to bed, and also has bouts of insomnia as well.   The body aches are extreme and is taking pain medicine daily due to these symptoms, which she did not have prior to the vaccine.   She got the vaccine, that evening she had a headache.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine I started having difficulty breathing and it went into an asthma attack. I used my rescue inhaler which I keep on hand due to allergies. I used it 3 times that afternoon and evening. I felt nauseated but did not vomit. I had watery diarrhea twice. Nausea continued for 24 hours with loss of appetite. That has now abated. The injection site did not hurt until the next day when it started with tenderness then quickly turned red and painful and hot to the touch. Wednesday and Thursday the arm started getting a rash and it has spread up to the neck and face.  Headache started the night of the injection and became intense (near migraine level) and stayed painful for 24&#43; hours. Fatigue began the night of the injection and has gradually gotten better over Wednesday and Thursday. Treated with Tylenol, rescue inhaler, Benadryl and hydrocortisone creams, rest, drinking lots of water, and notified my family doctor. Although I still have a rash and the injection site is hot and sore, I am considering myself recovered from the side effects.

                                                started with metallic taste in mouth, progressed rapidly to clammy, light headed, elevated BP and HR. All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

Chest pain, left sided stomach pain, and headache persisted through the night.  I was able to get some relief by takin a 325 mg Aspirin and an Advil every 2-3 hours through the night.  The chest pain was pretty bad, considered going to the ER, but persisted to fight it through to the morning.  In the morning, around 6:30 am I was exhausted, but the worst of the pain was over.  I did take another Aspirin and Advil around 8:00 am and stopped after that.  I did run a low grade fever off and on of 99.7 to 100.4.   I felt better on Saturday, but by noon I was feeling generally run down and again started to run a low grade fever off an on the rest of the day.  Sunday - what a joy to feel totally well!!

                                                I took the shot at 6:00P.M. at 6:10P.M. I started feeling a pain running from the shot site down to the bend in my arm, then it radiated down my lower arm to my wrist. I kept feeling it and at 6:15P.M. I started feeling lightheaded and  had the sensation I was going to faint. I notified the attendant and she and some other nurses came to my assistance and lowered me to the floor and raised my legs above my head.  They took my blood pressure and it was low as was my pulse, but my oxygen was 100%. i kept deep breathing as per their request. After a little bit i started to come to my senses and they gave me water.  I was difficult to swallow, my throat felt unusual. After about five minutes my swallowing got back to normal. The pain was still radiating from the shot site to my wrist. I stayed there till 6:50P.M. I felt better but on my way home the pain was still going down my arm.  About 8:00P.M. my left upper hand stated to hurt, then my thumb, index and middle fingers stated tingling.  That happened on and off through the evening.  At 12:00A.M i went to bed. On and off through the night I still had the pain and tingling in my arm and hand.  About 3:00A.M. I woke up and my arm and ring finger and little finger were numb like they fell asleep.  I raised my arm and the feeling slowly went away.  Throughout the day an 01/21/21 my arm was very sore by the injection site. Other than that nothing else has since occurred.

However, I could breathe easily so I just remained to relax and slowly swallowing my salia over and over again. Once home took a benedryl and was able to drink water without any problems. My throat is still somewhat scratchy after 2 hours.

I woke up about 1:30AM and was miserable felt like I had beaten me up. I had body aches, chills, low grade fever 100.2, fatigue, lethargic, nausea and headache. I did not go to work the next day. I stayed in bed and slept most of the day. It lasted 24 hours and then I felt back to normal.   I spoke with primacy care provider and she told me take Vitamin D since my annual labs the Vitamin D levels were and low. But she said just let it run it&#39;s course since it meant my immune system was working the way it was supposed to.

Had a fever of 101 degrees.  As the hours passed, the joint pain spread to both hips  and ankles. Alternated Motrin and Tylenol with fever reduced to 100 degrees. All muscle aches, joint pain and chills continued for the next 2 days. Finally by day 3 the fever was down to 99.  Experienced fatigue, followed by severe vertigo by day 3.  Although muscle aches and joint pain slowly decreased over time, the vertigo has persisted and at times is accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

                                                Pt is a pleasant 61 year old female who received Moderna COVID19 prime vaccine dose on 1/15/2021 as part of employee immunization event.  Pt reported upper respiratory viral illness the week prior but determined with medical advice that she was well enough to be immunized on the 15th. Immediate post-vaccination period was unremarkable.  Later that evening pt experienced onset of HA and fatigue which progressed to severe HA, low grade fever (~99 F per patient), malaise, and sore shoulder the following day.  Symptoms gradually improved over the next 2-3 days with HA being the most troublesome and lingering symptom.  Pt used OTC analgesics to manage HA pain. On 1/19/2021, four days after prime dose administration, pt noted a visible lump mid-clavicle, determined to be a severely swollen lymph node.  Warm and tender to touch.  Pt sought medical attention for this the following day, 1/20/2021.  Physician&#39;s assessment: &#34;Pt received the COVID moderna vaccine Friday, left arm.  She is a triage RN at Medical Clinic.  She states yesterday a lump appeared on her LT clavicle area.  Pt reports the lump is tender, &#34;warm&#34; but not red, and no surrounding erythema.  Yesterday had HA and a &#34;weird sensation&#34; radiating to LT ear from the lump.  The lump is now the size of a golf ball, did draw a line under it to see it.  She is able to swallow okay and has no other concerning Sx.  No changes in breathing.  Has had headaches, which have been reported possible side effect from COVD19 vaccination.  This vaccination was given quite high in her arm she thinks as well.  Fever Sunday night, 2 days after vaccination.  Has been taking Tylenol and IBU (not what she does usually) taking with food and has some GI upset.  Did try a cool compress on the lump yesterday which did not seem to help.&#34; // &#34;Can clearly see her soft tissue mass above her left clavicle, with a line that she drove underneath it yesterday when it started to form. There is no redness but is certainly tender to touch. Can still see a little bit of bruise in her arm where her vaccine was given in her left arm which does seem quite high, not two finger widths from the acromion process. Discussed prednisone but she is terrified of this as she was given a Symbicort inhaler not that long ago and felt that the steroid really made her wired. Recommend warm compresses, alternate between Tylenol ibuprofen with food and even topical Voltaren gel which she has at home and Arnica gel to area. Can certainly get CBC CMP for further evaluation. Discussed soft tissue ultrasound if this does not improve, will order this today in case it is needed she can just get that scheduled. She is going to report her vaccine reaction to the link she was given on the paper which I think is appropriate. Hopefully symptoms will improve in the next few days and then can proceed with her second vaccination a month from the first.&#34;  I spoke with patient today, 1/27/2021, to submit VAERS report. She reports swollen lymph node is still visible though size and sensitivity continue to slowly diminish.

I awoke around 3am with Severe chills, nausea, headache, and body aches, fever of 100.1. This lasted about 18 hours. It was ifficult to get any food or liquids down during that time due to painful nausea. The following 24 hours most of the above symptoms had subsided, maybe a bit of a temp coming and going throughout the day, I did feel extreme fatigue the second day. I spent a total of two days completely bedridden, unable to work or even care for myself.  Today, which is day 3, all symptoms are gone except fatigue, but I am able to do some work from home today.

This lasted until mid day, then just fatigue.  Wednesday  I got a large fever blister on my lip ( have had history in the past, not in some time though)  Since then I have had an additional  3.  2 very large and not on my lip.  Under by nose and as of yesterday on my lower cheek area. I was given Valtrex 1000mg  take 2 then additional 2.  Because of the frequent out breaks in the past several weeks, I started 500 mg daily.  I am due for my next vaccine on Feb 9th, but I am concerned.  ( I did have Covid 4/15/20 )

                                                IM vaccination was  given in LUE deltoid. On the day of the vaccine felt slightly dizzy and more fatigued. The following day, I developed a painful, enlarged lymph node in left supraclavicular area. The next day I felt overall weakness and tiredness. No fever noted, but I was frequently flushed and had hot flashes with perceived sudden weakness. I had slight nasal congestion and prolonged sneezing spells on the following days. I had to find a place to sit down and remove my lab coat and turn down the heat because of hot flashes at work. I had fecal urgency and loose stool x 2 on 3/5/21. I have mild lymph node enlargement in left neck today (2/6/21) that is not painful. I had pain at the injections site for 2-3 days after the first vaccine injection that awakened me from sleep a couple of times. The second injection was given in the same arm. All of my symptoms are easily managed with Tylenol, Motrin, fluids and rest.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the Moderna vaccine, I experienced an odd sensation in my stomach increased breathing, HR, lightheadedness, and dizziness. (I  experienced a similar reaction years ago but more severe, after having a breast MRI   with Gadolinium . I will consult my primary physician by email today. Per consult with a family physician, the recommendation has been advised for possible prophylactic treatment prior to obtaining the second Moderna vaccine. On rereading the composition of the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, I noted that polyethylene glycol(PEG) is a component in both the Pzifer and Moderna vaccines. I also discovered that PEG is also used with Gadolinium particles in contrast dye. Gadolinium-containing copolymeric chelates. A new potential MR contrast agent. Solvothermal synthesis and functionalization of polyethylene glycol.  It leads me to consider whether contrast dye should now be listed as one of the allergens on the vaccination registration forms, in order for persons with this allergy to report this information to their primary physicians prior to obtaining this vaccine.

On Jan. 25:  Went to bathroom around 3:15 p.m. with diarrhea and became woozy so decided to get off of the toilet and sit down on the floor.  Husband found me semi conscious on the floor with drool at about 4:10 p.m.  He tried to awaken me and found me not lucid, speech was garbled, fragmented responsiveness and could not keep upright position, could not give details to the situation.  Husband called 911.  Ambulance transported to hospital ER   during hospital exams and tests patient was not lucid and this continued for the next 32  hours.  EKG, EEG, CT scan, MRI, Blood/Lab work;  all tests were negative indicating no seizure , healthy heart, clear brain scan, no stroke, white blood count normal, dehydrated. All tests negative with all doctors unable to find a reason for this situation other than the Moderna vaccine considered highly for the situation.  Advised patient not to take the second dose of Moderna.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

                                                After 45 minutes of receiving vaccination , the knuckles in my left hand, the arm I received the shot in, began to hurt very badly.  Before I was able to get home,  7 minutes away, both hands hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t hole the steering wheel and I was having cramps in my legs.  I could hardly walk up the steps to my house because my ankle joints hurt so badly.  I went to bed  right away and slept .  My hands hurt really badly, but I knew the vaccination caused an inflammatory response so I figured just  rest.  By the end of the day Tuesday, I couldn&#39;t type and could not hold the steering wheel to drive home.  I felt out of breath, I hurt all over, my muscles ached and were cramping.  I was nauseated, very emotional.  I had a fever that spiked at over 101 degrees.  I was so chilled that I was shaking violently. I hurt in every joint, my lymph nodes were painfully swollen, my heart was racing, normal pulse for me is 68 to 72, it was 88 to 90.  Halfway up our stairs, I just stopped, couldn&#39;t make my legs work.  Day 3 I called my doctor, had a virtual appointment I knew I couldn&#39;t drive or ride 45 minutes away.  I missed 3 days of work, stayed home all weekend and was better by Monday.  It was 3 weeks before my hands quit aching.  The pain came and went in my ankles, wrist, knuckles, hips and knees.

My symptoms were a severe headache, fever of 102, body aches, chills, nausea, sore arm.  The second day after getting the vaccine, I still had a small headache, sore arm, swollen injection site and now a red rash at the injection site.

                                                Within several hours my arm began getting really sore and I became extremely tired. I laid down for a nap in the recliner. I awoke 2 hours later (around 9:30 p.m.) with the whole left side of my body temporarily paralyzed. The whole side felt heavy/sore like my arm - almost as if the vaccine had spread down my side. It really scared me because I initially couldn&#39;t move. I finally worked my way into a sitting position, then stood up and walked it off, then was fine. No more problems with it. Just today (2/27) I am starting to feel better as far as fatigue and soreness and nausea go. No more paralysis.

The pharmacy staff was notified on 03/29/21 that the patient did report to the ER on 03/25/21 and was possibly intubated.

                                                On Wednesday, March 24th my husband and I got our 1st Moderna vaccine at 8:30 am. Felt good the rest of the day. On Thursday, March 25th I woke up and the bag under my right eye was really swollen and I felt like I had a big cold sore coming out on the top right side of my lip. My arm was swollen like a 2x2 area and tender but other than that I felt good. At 9:30 am that same day I started getting a headache and my stomach felt really upset. I didn&#39;t throw up but felt like I was going to.  About 10:00 am I really felt sick to my stomach and extremely tired. My headache was more intense and mostly on my right side (same side as my eye and cold sore). By noon I had the chills and was running a temperature over 100. At 3:00 when I got done with work I slept. I was only awake for a total of 1 hour and went to bed for the night at 8:15 pm. I still had a bad headache, upset stomach and chills and my arm was swelling bigger but I slept all night. On Friday, March 26th I woke up and my face looked worse. The cold sore was getting bigger and the bag under my eye was huge making my eye almost shut. I still had  a bad headache and the injection site was getting bigger and stuck out far. It was hot to the touch. It was bright red and bumpy and hurt to touch it. I no longer was sick to my  stomach and I had no fever. My face was still looking awful and about 2:00 pm I started running a fever again. I still had a headache. I still felt tired. On Saturday March 27th, my bag under my eye looked a little better but the cold sore was getting worse. I had a slight headache, no fever and not sick to my stomach. However, the lump at the injection site got huge.  It was the size of the palm of my hand and stuck up about an inch. It was hot to the touch and red.  By 9:00 pm my eye and face were worse and the right side of my face was drooping. On Sunday March 28th 8:00 am my face was worse and itchy. The cold sore was spreading up the right side of my drooping face and my eye was almost shut. I called the Teledoc and had a video call. She said that the vaccine triggered a virus in my system. She called in a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM 4 pills. Took 2 pills at noon and then the last 2 that night before bed. She said to give it 2-3 days and it should clear up. On Monday, March 29th 6:30 am the lump in my arm is a little smaller but my eye is worse. I looked horrible. On Tuesday, March 30th I still had a low grade headache and my lip and right side of my face is kinda numb. I called my doctor and made an appointment for Wednesday, March 31st. On Wednesday, March 31, 2021, I woke up and now had a canker sore inside my top lip on the right side of my face in addition to looking like a monster. I went to the doctor?s office at 7:30 am and she said that I definitely have a virus going on and now I have Bell?s Palsy as a result. The doctor gave me a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM tablets to take 3 times a day for 7 days. She also prescribed Prednisone 20 MG to take 3 tablets for 7 days to relief the itching and irritability of my face.

I was bloated, swollen, nauseous. About 4 hours after the vaccine there was some relief, but the pain came back multiple times that night, would subside and was mostly better the next day. I did vomit around 7pm. I took antacids and simethecone with no relief.

On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right.

I went back to the office to do some paperwork and when I tried to walk it was painful I told my coworker who suggested I need something warm on my stomach. I tired that but was to nauseous. I ended up leaving work and coming home and laid. I have cannot lay flat as it is uncomfortable and have myself propped up in bed. I have been unable to sleep since then. I previously had COVID in November 2020

                                                About 9PM after the receiving the vaccine I started had riggers which lasted for about an hour. I couldn&#39;t reach for my phone or call for help. I either passed out or fell asleep. Around 1AM I woke up and checked my temperature 102.7.  Some point after I took some Tylenol but don&#39;t remember when. I finally had to call for help from my family in the morning because I was not able to pee or drink. Tuesday was my fever was still 102.7 with taking Tylenol and Advil it would just go back up.  Tuesday I had Riggers again about 5:30 it only lasted 3-5 minutes. Wednesday my fever went down to 101.4-101.5. Have had difficulty swallowing when the fever is high, did not feel as if I had a allergic reaction or that my throat was sore it was just hard to swallow.  I have a weird bruise on my arm I have clue where I got it. I didn&#39;t urinate for 9 hours. Headache. Pulse OX was at 93-94 for Monday and Tuesday but then it came it up 95-98 yesterday.  As of today I still pretty weak no fever when I woke up.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 22 Dec 2020, about 4pm, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #011J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22 Dec 2020, around 7pm, the patient experienced severe leg cramps.    On 23 Dec 2020, she experienced severe diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shaking chills and bloody diarrhea. Treatment for nausea was ondansetron.    On 24 Dec 2020, the patient experienced terrible hemorrhoid pain and abdominal pain. On 25 Dec 2020, the patient went to the emergency room where she received a computed tomography scan. The computed tomography scan of  the lower abdomen showed that earlier diagnosis of diverticulitis 27 Nov 2020 &#34;inflammation&#34; had gotten better.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not reported.  The outcome for events, severe leg cramps, severe diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shaking chills, bloody diarrhea and hemorrhoid pain, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62-year-old female patient with medical history of diverticulitis, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 011J20A), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of bloody diarrhea, the non-serious listed events of nausea and chills, and the non-serious unlisted events of severe leg cramps, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hemorrhoid pain.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s history of diverticulitis is noted.

                                                initial symptoms started at ~ 8-12 hr post inj on FRI:  fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain (generalized), back pain from sacrum to occiput, through cranium to behind eyes, nausea, loose stools, exhaustion, arm swelling (6&#34; diameter) with bandaid indented becoming hard (feeling a little like cellulitis).  routinely measure pO2 and body temp--both spiked; resp rate went from normal pattern of 10-12 to 25; night time HR went from low 60&#39;s to the 100&#39;s; pO2 went from 96-98 to 89-91 (Innovo PulseOx)Treated with sleep (slept from 8PM night of shot until 48 hours after the shot), fluids, hot water bottles, arnica (I can&#39;t take NSAIDS), vit C, zinc megadoses;  by ~36 hours post injection I started wheezing and coughing deeply but non productive, both nasal passages were/are open, feels as though phlegm is stuck at bronchi.  By 48 hours, I was feeling better except chest, ribs, head, and neck and was experiencing 1-3&#34; episodes of spasmodic coughing, wheezing, SOB; Occurred every 20-30 minutes and leaving me physically exhausted.  Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

                                                I developed chills/shivering in the evening of the vaccination (2/19/21) but was not alarmed, just tried to stay warm.  I ate normally.   I awakened in the night with extreme chills and was shaking most of the night, unable to get warm.  I felt feverish and had body aches as well as nausea.  I threw up what I could to alleviate the feeling of nausea, about 2 a.m.   I slept restlessly until 9:00 am, then tried to take a hot shower.  Though the chills were gone, I felt weak and listless and went back to bed shortly after showering.  I slept for about 4 hours.  I had little/no appetite for most of the day after the vaccine.  By the second day I still had a headache but felt better, albeit weak.   I took Ibuprofen for the body/headaches with minimal success.

                                                Afternoon of vaccine began chilling, body aches, fatigue, sore arm. Temp rose to 103.5. I alternated Tylenol with Motrin. Tylenol did little to decrease this fever, motrin seemed to bring it down for about and hour then would go back up again. Temp stayed between 102 to 103 through Sunday 2/21/21. Temp 99-101 on Monday 2/22/21. Today as I report, temp is 99 and continue to feel very fatigued with no energy and poor appetite.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

There were 3  episodes that lasted less then 5 minutes over a 30 minute period.  Then at approximately 2:00 AM on 2/27 I experienced another event described above with severe intensity lasting approximately 30 to 45 minutes. This event was concerning.   I?ve not experienced any further symptoms except a bit of fatigue and mild soreness at the injection site.

                                                Following my second dose of Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on 2/13/21 I experienced a significant reaction to the second dose: My temperature rose to 102 with headache and arthralgia throughout body that prevented sleep. I was in bed for more than 24 hours due to lightheaded/dizzy/nausea when standing. I fell once when getting back into bed due to loss of balance. Severe symptoms started 15 hours after receiving the dose and lasted approximately 36 hours post dose when my temperature then returned to normal. The next 1-2 days, while I no longer had a fever and symptoms were improved. I was still fatigued and did not feel fully recovered. Treatment during the severe symptoms included rest, icepack to head, Tylenol or Ibuprofen slightly decreased temperature for a brief periods. I informed my physician&#39;s office Dr, of the above reaction and was told to file a VAERS report.

                                                After waiting 15 minutes, I was released to head home. About 5 minutes into the drive home I suddenly couldn&#39;t swallow. I was able to breathe without any feeling of my airway closing. The inability to swallow lasted about 3-5 minutes. I stopped at a store and picked up Benadryl and took 2 tablets. I turned around and went back to the vaccination clinic. They checked my vitals and watched me for another 20 minutes. At the end of the 20 minutes the doctor checked with me and determined that I could leave. It was recommended that I speak to my general practitioner about the reaction and whether or not I should get the second dose.

Liquid Benadryl (1 capful) was administered by mouth and within 10 minutes swallowing difficulty was less but still difficult. Within 30 minutes all symptoms subsided.  At no time did I have difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing or any other anaphylaxis symptoms other than the ones described.

                                                A 63-year-old female with a medical history of Hashimoto?s Disease, on Levothyroxine 88 micrograms (4 days per week) and 100 micrograms (3 days per week), presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of acute onset of severe, debilitating, fatigue, weakness, anorexia and malaise. She had no clear precipitating events, stated that she was in her usual states of health, active, working as an optometrist at a University hospital. Stated that 1 week before symptom oncer she had her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Stated that 24hrs later her symptoms started associated with low grade subjective fever, however her fever disappeared, and she persisted with severe fatigue. She was unable to do her regular activities of daily living and was hoping her symptoms would resolve but upon persistence and given the severity of her complains she presented to evaluation. She denied recently starting any new medications/supplements, or recent change in her levothyroxine dose. There were no headaches, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, recent infectious illness or sick contacts. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s Disease over 10 years prior and had been on the same dose for more than 2 years.   VS were stable and within normal limits, physical exam was only remarkable for weakness on 4 extremities 4/5, lethargy, bradylalia, bilateral ptosis, no focal neurologic deficits, sensation intact. Laboratory workup revealed normal Hb 14.8, normal renal and kidney function, normal cortisol level, TSH normal 3.7, normal FT4: 1.2, normal CPK, negative tox screen. ESR and CRP were performed, and both were found to be elevated ESR 74, CRP 28, at that moment we decided to do immunologic workup showing high titers of ANA &gt;1:320 with a nuclear speckled pattern, and a positive rheumatoid factor 60. At this point a full rheumatologic panel was performed which was negative for anti-Ach receptor Abs, negative anti-CCP, anti- dsDNA, anti-smith, negative anti-Jo1, anti-RNP, negative anti-TPO, negative anti-SCL70, normal C4 and C3 however elevated total CH50 &gt; 60, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Her symptoms of severe fatigue persisted throughout her admission and it was decided to give her a course of prednisone 40mg for 5 days and follow up as outpatient with a Rheumatologist. Repeat workup 2 weeks after discharge showed still elevated ESR at 72, high CRP 17, rheum factor elevated again at 67.  At this point no clear cause was identified as she did not have any symptoms of Sjogren or anything else other than severe persisting fatigue.  Another course of steroids was given and 1 month later she stated that she was much improved and was able to go back to work. Stated that she would not take her second covid MODERNA vaccine dose due to fear of recurrence of symptoms. It appeared that this vaccine triggered a severe inflammatory and autoimmune reaction in this patient with history of Hashimoto?s disease. The association between MODERNA vaccine and development of autoimmunity and inflammatory reaction needs to be assessed.

Within a couple hours I had a fever of 102. In the next few hours I began having abdominal pain.  The pain grew worse over the next day.  On Tuesday April 6 I had a telehealth appointment with my primary care physician.  He advised me to go the the ER.  I went to my local ER where they found via ct scan, that my appendix was inflamed and they told me it needed to come out.  I had an appendectomy on April 7.  I am feeling much better now that my appendix has been removed.

On 03/27/2021, her nausea continued and she complained of shortness of breath while walking. On 03/28/2021, she was short of breath before vomiting a small amount. She then became unresponsive. Death was pronounced a short time later.  Per her treating physician who signed the death certificate, the cause of death is felt to be probable myocardial infarction due to electrolyte abnormalities due to complications of her diabetes mellitus.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

                                                Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021 I felt a little strange.  Just not myself. A little dizzy.  Went to work overnight.  Got up at 5 am Friday, Jan 8, 2021.  Still felt odd.  Dizzy. Had to think before I did anything. I stood up from the bed and sat back down again as if I was dizzy and confused.  Drove myself home from work, fed the cats and went right to bed.  I felt very fatigued, had developed a monster headache.  Was dizzy, had chills, body aches, nausea.  I brought  water bottle over to the bed with me but after laying down just could not get myself up to get a drink.  Felt very fatigued.   Slept until 2 pm.  Took my temperature.  It was 101.5.  Had no energy, ate no food, took no meds, just went back to sleep.  Still nauseous, had headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Woke up at 5:00 pm to feed cats.  That?s all I did, and go to the bathroom.  Took my temperature again.  It was 100.9.  Still felt awful:  nauseous, headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Seemed like I could  not get warm.  Stayed in bed and slept.  Saturday, Jan.  9, 2021 I woke up around 7:30 to go to the bathroom.  I fed the cats also.  Still dizzy, moving slow.  My headache was gone, but still felt unsteady.  After feeding the cats,  I went back to bed.  Slept until 12:30 that afternoon.

                                                Approx. 12:30am I awoke to a leg cramp. I arose from bed and stood up till the cramping muscle relaxed.  Then I walked to the restroom and during the short distance,I felt a sudden &#34;flush&#34;.  Upon entering restroom, I felt I was getting faint.  Feeling that I was about ready to faint, I tried to easily lower myself to the floor without striking my head or body.  Feeling very dizzy and faint, my stomach instantly felt nauseous and then vomited.  After vomiting, I  suddenly started to &#34;shake very violently&#34; (chills?).  The shaking was uncontrollable and went on for approx. 10 -15 min.  I tried to relieve the violent shaking by covering up with bath towels, that I was able to reach from the floor, where I was still sitting; but that did not seem to help.  After I did not feel so faint, I called for help to have my husband help me back into bed to try to warm up.  By that time the shaking (chills) were no longer so severe, and I was gradually able to fall back to sleep with no further problems the remainder of the night.  The following morning, and ever since that night, I have had no other adverse reactions.   For many years, I have received the yearly flu vaccine and have never had any kind of reaction, accept some minor soreness at the injection site (muscle).

I slept for most of the following 2 days, and continued to be more fatigued than normal for about a week.  I then had flu-like symptoms  (lower GI, nausea, headache, fatigue) that lasted about 3 days and caused me to miss work.

                                                About 14 hours after vaccination, I had a (really bad) pulsating headache in a band around my head, body aches (hip flexors, shoulders, back, neck), chills, fever/sweats, and nausea/vomiting (threw up twice, total, about an hour or two apart after not eating for 10 hours - small amount of liquid came up). The nausea/vomiting went away about 4 hours after onset while the other symptoms remained for an additional 42 hours. I also had sinus/eye pressure that began about 22 hours after vaccination and ended with the other symptoms. Could not sleep for the duration because of headache. Very tired/sleepy about 62 hours after injection and was able to nap since headache went away. I still have soreness at injection site about 72 hours after injection.  I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn&#39;t want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days. The next worst was the nausea/vomiting, because, well, nausea/vomiting, and especially because there was nothing to bring up. And, unlike vomiting from bad food or something, you don&#39;t really feel better afterward, just still nauseated. The other symptoms were more bearable. Did not call or see doctor because I had read about these possible side effects and didn&#39;t think there was anything the doctor could do to alleviate them.

                                                I had the first dose of the vaccine on December 28, 2020. There was no reaction at all. The second dose I took on January 25th at 10:45 AM. There was no immediate reaction. Six hours later I began to be fatigued. No appetite, moderate nausea and continued fatigue. (Not achy, no fever or chills). The next day was pretty much the same, no appetite, moderate nausea, continued fatigue.   This symptoms continued until 9PM and like a light switch, I felt much better.  At the injection site there was a hard knot (making my arm look like I had very nice biceps!), sore only when pressure was applied. This area stayed hard and larger than normal for about 6 days.

After removing my shirt on Sunday the entire arm had a 4 inch red band almost the entire circumference of the upper arm.

However 13th day after receiving injection  I developed severe fatigue, fevers as high as 101.9, shaking, nausea, severe itching.  overall feeling of sick.  3 days later it passed. Due to my preexisting conditions I have isolated myself for almost 1 year, followed all protocols, and very rarely out in public. I also recieved flu vaccine.  So doubt the symptoms I had could be contributed to flu bug. So since it seemed very odd I am reporting this to CDC. Note: I had 2nd dose 02/19/21. So far only reaction is sore injection site. Should I develop symptoms after several days like the ones I reported after 1st dose, I will report these to this site.

On 2/20/21 still a slight headache, took 2 Tylenol then went out and walked about a mile, visited family, then walked back home.  By the time I got home I was barely able to walk up the stairs.  Felt exhausted and nauseous.  Slept for a few hours and got up and just sat on the couch for another few hours and then felt that same nausea and exhaustion and went to bed. Took 2 more Tylenol. Started drinking more water.  On 2/21/21 felt pretty good -- stayed in all day -- ate a little -- but saw the site on my arm just under the injection site was very large, red, and hot to the touch.  The red welt area went from just below the injection in the left arm to just above the elbow.   On 2/22/21 (today) feel pretty good.  Drinking a lot of water and tool 1 Tylenol.

There was a large, red, itchy and painful area on my arm for over a week. Two days after this started, I had a day of not feeling well. I did not notice a fever but had a bad headache, was nauseous and tired. The next day I felt okay. I do not have any lingering effects now.

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

Arm soreness lasted quite a few days - about 5 days or so. Still continuing to have heart racing and pounding and heartburn pain up in my chest. Those heart symptoms haven&#39;t gotten noticeably better until about this last week.  Cardiac Nurse Practitioner - saw her on January 25th  - taking PEPSID. l. GI assessment will be this Tuesday, the 9th of March - I will be having that at the medical center.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.     On 03 Mar 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Mar 2021, the patient experienced severe diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort. At 4 AM she had lost consciousness and fell after urinating and hit her head on the curb of the shower. Her husband found her and when he saw her, she was cold, clammy and very sweaty. Her husband reported that the patient had low blood pressure that caused syncope and caused her to fall. The patient was in a semi-delirious state and was confused, tremulous. The cramps were intermittent for 1-2 hours. The patient was in a borderline shock or in shock as she was very dizzy when she stood up. The events were resolved after four hours. On the next day her temperature was at 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, loss of consciousness, fall, cold sweats, hyperhidrosis, hypotension, syncope, confusional state, tremors, muscle spasms, shock and dizziness were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 15 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 027L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 08 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 0101M20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The first dose of vaccine was taken in non dominant arm and second dose was taken in right dominant arm.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced swollen arm. In between the two doses she felt very hard to breath for few minutes and when she took a deep breath it was fine. She had tylenol for the headaches after the second dose on 08 February 2021. She also had nausea along with headaches. She had blood clogging when she was in a blood donation camp. The event very hard to breath for few minutes and blood clogging were considered as medically significant. Thiamine was provided as medication  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  Follow-up received on 17 Mar 2021 included updated date for first dose of vaccine, and the events very hard to breath for few minutes/dyspnoea, blood clogging/thrombosis.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a strong temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Nausea and headache are consistent with the safety profile of the product

Severe headache, body aches, chills, fever, exhaustion and diarrhea, Slight chills and arm soreness at bedtime the evening of vaccine. Woke up the next morning after vaccine in complete body pain. Diarrhea began later in day. Exactly like my COVID experience! Slept all day except to take Tylenol and Imodium.  Woke second day after vaccine feeling improvement but still tired and weak. On couch most of day. Today, 3rd day after vaccine,  much improved but still not 100%.  Will never get the 2nd dose! Have heard it is usually worse and I would probably not be able to handle it

Over 48 hours, the ache stayed the same but a headache came on, and then a very low grade fever, under 100. It wasn?t severe but it was enough to keep me from eating or sleeping for 48 hours. Motrin seemed to help the abdominal pain. Then I recovered.

                                                On Saturday 1/16/21 at approximately 4:15 pm my husband and I received the Moderna vaccine, lot number 041L20A . We waited the required 15 minutes to see if we had any reaction, we did not. After checking out we drove directly home. At approximately 5:10 pm, while driving to our home, about 45 minutes after receiving the injection, we both noticed that we were having difficulty swallowing and felt a swelling in the back of our throats. My husband experienced a metallic taste. The feeling of the swelling in our throats was similar to when a dentist uses a topical numbing gel prior to a dental procedure. The difficulty swallowing and the thickness in our throats lasted about 30 - 45 minutes. We monitored ourselves at home and did not feel that we needed medical attention. Because of my angioedema I had 2 Epipens at the ready. We both experienced soreness at the injection site (left arm), my husband&#39;s sorer than mine. The swollen throat and difficulty swallowing is the only reaction I had. My husband woke on Sunday morning and his arm was very sore, more so than what he has experienced with a flu shot. At approximately 12:15 pm on Sunday, 1/17/21, and about 21 hours after the vaccine was administered, my husband began to feel achy, like he was getting a cold. He took a nap and upon waking did not feel any better. His temperature was 97.6. He felt lethargic the rest of the day and went to bed early and sleep ok but woke up not feeling any better. I used a finger pulse oximeter and it registered 94/94. His temperature remains normal. I am registering these reactions after reading about the adverse and severe reactions of persons at who received the same Moderna lot 041L201 as we did.

                                                Hello, i took the Moderna 1/4 and am scheduled for 2nd shot 2/1. I just wanted to pass on some side effects and i did not go on the agency website which i should have to report them. I had a headache off and on the first week. the first day afterward i had a 100 degree fever as well. I never have sleep issues (falling asleep etc) i had insomnia and could not sleep and didnt sleep well for around a week. What i noticed most though is it really affected my stomach and i was awakened with acid reflux several times. the muscles of my stomach were sore like i had been coughing (but hadn&#39;t) and i had no desire for food, only fruit, light watery things. as soon as i eat anything i have stomach pain digesting. Since last weekend i sleep way too much, even if i set the alarm i turn it off and keep sleeping. I try to walk and get out.  when i wake up it seems my stomach has been really active, i have a horrible taste in my mouth and acid reflux liquid in my through.  Just letting you know; and I have the 2nd shot so fingers crossed i&#39;ll come through all of this. Take care as well. Thanks

On January 16 woke up feeling great and about 3:30 in the afternoon with no warning extreme dizziness and nausea came over me.  Felt so awful, tried to eat something, vomited immediately.   Felt so horrible, had to go to bed, slept on and off throughout the night.  Woke up Sunday, feeling better, not 100%.  I?m concerned if on January 16th was a reaction because it was two full days after receiving the injection.

Three days later for next 4 days, tested negative each time for Covid. Since vaccine 1 to 3 weeks later fatigue, no appetite, suicidal thoughts as if my endorphins were temporarily deleted but endorphins returned 24 hours later. Due to the extreme side affects, 1/22/21, I will not receive my 2nd Moderna vaccine.

The feeling in chest and back would last about 10 seconds, subside for a little while and then start again. This happened off and on for about an hour. The tingling in legs continued for about 2 hours. About 1 hour after I received vaccine I started having vision problems, blurriness, strange spots /lights , had trouble focusingnmyneyes. Then a terrible headache set in. I have had similar vision problems with a migraine headache in the past. Felt like it triggered a migraine. Vitals were normal. Checked out by EMS and went to local ER.

The very day I did not notice anything but then 24-48 hours after the vaccine it started being pretty bad and it got a point where it got so bad  the whole left side of my face swollen up, my tonsils, my neck, down the throat, only on the left side of my face.  At one point it was hard to swallow (NY Eve), it was hard to swallow and breathe. I had just started taking the medication my DDS prescribed and it was not really helping yet. On New Years day when I woke up a little better.  It took about 4-5 days for the swelling to go down. After 2 doses of the medication prescribed the pain was much more bearable and the swelling started going down. On 01/02/2021 my dentist cauterized some of the sores in my mouth,

I was told not to take Tylonel because my &#34;immune system&#34; needs to do its job. I have an Immune Deficiency (CVID) and infuse gamma globulin 2x weekly.. I believe that if I was able to take Tylonel at the onset my reactions wouldn&#39;t have been so severe. Immune Deficiency cannot fight off viruses.

Around 9:00 this morning, I noticed I was having trouble typing.  Looked down at my hands and both hands were severally swollen, to the point that  I could not even make a fist.  This swelling lasted about three hours.  Swelling started to subside around noon and is completely gone now, at 2:30 in the afternoon

                                                I received my shot on Friday Jan. 22,2021. Other than a sore arm no other symptoms until Monday morning at 10:30 when suddenly I had a very sore throat. As time passed it got worse and I had trouble swallowing and speaking but not breathing. I work for a dentist and he looked at my throat and my uvula and soft palate were very swollen and red. He referred me to my primary physician who saw me late that afternoon.  I had no other symptoms except pressure in my ears. My doctor gave me a steroid injection and put me on prednisone for 5 days and amoxicillin 500mg, 1 gram twice a day. About 3 hours later the swelling had gone down enough for me to eat some and talk better. By the next day things were much better. I really don?t know if this was a reaction to the vaccine or not but many people have told me to report it. My doctor wasn?t sure if it was that or a bacterial infection. He treated me for both to get the swelling down.

Also got upset stomach and little light headed.  A co-worker (teacher ) took her pulse and it was 66.  Lasted for about an hour and then felt better. She notified public health by phone after 30 min and was recommended she call her healthcare provider. Called her back 30 min after that (about hour and 10 min after vaccine) and she had not called provider and was feeling much better. Denies having problems with any shots in the past

Later sometime in the middle of the night, I wasn&#39;t able to fall asleep as if I&#39;d had a stimulant, and had intense arm pain where shot given, some nausea, some intestinal discomfort, intense pain at temples and behind eyes, overall &#34;crappy&#34; feeling.  Sun., Feb 14, 3rd day after shot: Pains/symptoms same as above with the addition of a low grade fever (99.9), chills, fatigue, no appetite. Tylenol didn&#39;t help. Was able to drift in and out of light sleep. Later in the day, fever and majority of symptoms suddenly &#34;left&#34;,  gradually decreasing until I felt fine again by Sunday evening. No issues Monday, Feb. 15.

                                                I started experiencing chills within half an hour after the shot.  The following 24 hours I experienced total insomnia, chills, headache, body ache, shoot pains, extreme weakness, and nausea.  Insomnia lasted 3 nights.  The other side effects began to decrease after 24 hours, but still prominent enough to prevent from actively engage in anything for another 24 hours.  After the third night of insomnia, I thought I had turned the corner.  But I continued to experience headache (I basically never have headache), occasional nights of insomnia (I usually sleep extremely well), and low level of nausea, and fatigue.  Today, 8 days after the shot, after another night of difficulty in sleeping, I woke up with the same headache behind my right eye, nausea, weakness, and fatigue.  This is when I thought to report these side effects.

Looked at numbers on my fit bit, and even though I was sitting at my desk, exerting no excessive energy, my heart rate read 96 bpm (lasted for about 10-15 min).    As the day progressed I began to feel more blah. That evening, I took bandaid off injection site and it was patchy read and raised skin, warm to touch, and the areas where the bandaid was were raised and patchy (I have never had a reaction to bandaids before).  As night progressed, I became excessively chilled and could not get warm.  Would occasionally have a &#34;hot&#34; moment and then return to chilled where I couldn&#39;t get warm enough.  Body aches, headache, and chilled through the night. Second day, totally consumed with body aches, chilled, headache, tired and weak feeling. Took Tylenol.  Slept on and off through the day. Second evening  awoke around 8pm and everything still hurt, including my teeth.  Took Tylenol, tried to eat a few crackers- no appetite. Went back to bed. Third morning feeling 90% better. Still have headache. Took Tylenol.

One of my physician colleague&#39;s that was nearby checked on me as well as the nurse that gave me the injections. it took about 30-40 minutes for the symptoms to subside. I was sent to our Urgent care dept in the same clinic by wheelchair at around 12:30-12:40 pm. I was evaluated and my symptoms subsided in 30-40 minutes. I was out of Urgent care at 1:25 pm, able to walk upstairs back to my office and felt okay and was seeing patients again at 1:30 PM.  This reaction was similar to getting a shot of Novocaine w/ epinephrine for a dental procedure I received a few years ago, so if I were to sum it up it was like getting a shot of epinephrine. it was not a vasovagal reaction as my BP was high. I have felt fine since. I plan to get the second vaccine. Any suggestions to avoid these symptoms w/ the second one would be appreciated.

                                                Uneasy stomach with very soft stools in every visit to the bathroom and on a few occasions in between.  Awkward, to say the least. Started overnight after day of vaccination and has continued for over 24 hours and has not yet resolved although frequency has started to diminish as of 48 hours.  Also visibly flushed face/hot flashes, slight rise in temperature at 98.4 (over my normal baseline of 97.5) this morning which has since receded.  Waiting to see how long this lasts.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

Then it moved to both arms, and entire body, nauseous.  By Monday, really getting worse and at night extremely uncomfortable and not wanting to get up in the morning.  Tuesday, off work and still having symptoms throughout the day.  Went to the chiropractor and stated she was tight.  Also got PT and said the same thing, she was very tight in her muscles.  Today, Wednesday she&#39;s feeling better.   Called employee health and notified them.

Had for full week; feels like it is resolving. No difficulty breathing, O2 level 97 plus.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

It only lasted a few minutes.   About after an hour of being home, I had an issue swallowing only once.   I don&#39;t know if adverse reaction, or panic attack.  I have my 2nd dose schedule for the beginning of Feb  I will let them know what happened.   Also, quarter size red spot on right arm.   It hurt when touched.   Lasted a couple days.

Returned to Convention Center, site of vaccination. Paramedics took vitals, determined I was having a &#34;minor&#34; allergic reaction and administered Benadryl. Within 20 minutes of receiving Benadryl, I was able to breathe and swallow without difficulty. No further complications afterwards.

My brain felt compromised in it&#39;s thought process struggling to think straight 30 minutes into receiving shot. Eyelids felt so heavy . I struggled to hold my eyes open but could not. Fell into a 3 hour deep sleep. Woke up feeling foggy brained &amp; clumsy.  At 3am the next day my throat felt thick &amp; dry with difficulty swallowing.  Went to ER at 3:30. Was told my tonsils were swollen. I did not have a sore throat.  Dr tested for strepp throat with negative result. I was given a shot of benedryl &amp; an oral Allegra pill. Symptoms began to subside &amp; I was sent home. Nasty headache &amp; wobblyness continued through the day &amp; into the following day. Started feeling better Sunday night

During the night (  at least 8hrs after shot) developed a fever 101.2, body aches, especially low back, and mild headache.  Had no appetite the next day, 1/29,21, queasy stomach, temp hovered between 99-100 most of the day, back ache was most problematic, no energy, slept most of the day, mild headache remained.  Symptoms disappeared after 30-36 hours.  Had some digestive distress after this but was probably related to not having eaten for over 24 hours &amp; then resuming.

I knew my mouth was hanging open and couldn&#39;t shut it. My husband took my blood pressure,  it was 61/50.  After a few minutes I was coming to, blood pressure began to come back up. My husband had called 911 when my blood pressure dropped so low.  By the time they arrived it was back up to normal.   I have never had any problems with blood pressure,  low or high. Or with dizziness,  fainting etc. I am very sure it was from the vaccine

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine I developed a headache.  Chills, lost of taste in my mouth, nausea, loss of appetite, body aches all over (joint pain), headache, fever. I also have pain at the vaccine injection site. Last night my fever was 102 so I called EMS and they took me to the ER. I was transferred by EMS. I was just in ER they gave two Tylenol and a bag of IV fluids.  Doctor said it was the side effects from the vaccine.   Today I am feeling much better, my headache is better and I was able to eat but still no taste.

Debilitating headache.... took Advil.... no relief...  kept awaking  and felt no better... slept hoping the next time I awoke I would be back to normal. This continued through 24 hours. I believe  the vaccine is incompatible with my DNA  None of my friends had any problems with it.... I did not consult with a Doctor but I am not looking forward to the 2nd dose tomorrow. Thank you.

                                                Patient had the first Moderna Covid vaccine on Thursday 1/21/2021.  She had a bit of sore arm on that day and the day after.  On Saturday 1/23/2021, she had a fever of 100.5 F (11AM), nausea, light headache and chills. The temperature went down after she took ibuprofen.  Patient&#39;s husband enrolled her to V-Safe to report all the adverse effects she experienced. On Sunday 1/24/2021, her temperature was 98.3F. She still had nausea and no appetite.  She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

I slept until 5:30 the next day, 2/3/2021. Was able to eat a bit of soup and went back to sleep until next morning. I was able to go to work on 2/4/2021 but experienced some weird brain fog and fatigue. On 2/5/2021 my arm had a large red ring around injection site and hives below it. I remained fatigued and lack of appetite for 4 days or so.

                                                I had nausea at about 11:30 am the day after I had the Moderna vaccine.  It lasted into the evening.  I know longer have nausea.  I took 1 mg zofran twice to settle it down. The 3 weeks of Clindamycin had upset my stomach with the same symptom so I am not sure if it was the Moderna or residual from the Clindamycin.

Aches, nausea, headache, 3 episodes of not being able to breathe in or out, lasting a few seconds. Some wheezing that started the day after the shot that continued for about 24 hours, did use inhaler(albuterol). All symptoms pretty much over by 72 hours after. Did not seek care at this time. Did talk to heart doctor today and will follow up with them about getting the second shot.

Sometimes dull throb, sometimes sharp pain usually on left side (same side as vaccine shot). Sensitivity to light. When pain is sharper causes indigestion and nausea. Pain goes away if I take  ibuprofen, but always returns and persists overnight. I don&#39;t like taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen more than once a day or for continuous days. Acupuncture worked for a short time. Affects my ability to concentrate and work on computer or watch TV. What other natural treatment will help? How much longer will this last?

I didn&#39;t vomit, although I felt the slight urge.   I slept during the day and it helped.  The next day I was  fine. I thought the medicine was strong. This happened two weeks after the 1st dose.  I&#39;m waiting for the 2nd dose in two weeks, and I&#39;m thinking, is it safe to take after this happened?

I walked through the house to another room. I noticed my arms and legs felt kind of rubbery and that I didn&#39;t seem to have control of them. I fell to the bed and lost consciousness for 5-10 seconds. This was all observed by my spouse. I  recovered quickly. The remainder of the day I had a slight headache and felt slightly nauseous. I took acetaminophen before going to bed and woke up the following morning with no complaints .

                                                I received my first Covid vaccine on Saturday, February 27. I began to experience severe pain in my torso on Sunday, March 1. Initially there was no rash just a line of pain around my torso on the right side. I sought medical attention on Wednesday, March 3. I was diagnosed as having shingles. The doctor has prescribed  prednisone 20 mg twice daily for three days then every day for four days and Famciclovir 500 mg tablets one tablet three times a day for seven days. I am concerned about proceeding with the second dose.

If it had gone on for much longer I would have had to go the the hospital.  The level of pain was terrifying....and lest you think it&#39;s just that I can&#39;t handle pain, I&#39;ve given birth to 5 children without any pain mediation whatsoever.  I am still in the depths of an autoimmune flair-up where severe pain in my joints and muscles occur.  I continue to feel significant fatigue.  I also continue to experience some level of &#34;brain fog&#34; (the inability to follow though streams for long, read more than a few sentences at a time, inability to stay mentally organized).   Mild nausea and inability to digest well continues since the day of the vaccine 3/15.

                                                Tinnitus (severe) and extreme dizziness with nausea. The worst of it was on 3/8/21 and 3/9/21.  I went to ENT doctor on 3/10/21 and was prescribed prednisone for 2weeks. That steroid had very little effect. I am able to function only if I take over the counter motion sickness pills every day. The tinnitus has not diminished but the dizziness is at manageable levels.

Were severe for about an hour and then started subsiding.  Gradually felt better over the course of a couple of hours. After about 6 hours, symptoms completely gone and I felt fine.

                                                While driving home after leaving facility 15 minutes after shot, I started having an increased heart rate.  Once home, the rapid heart rate continued and I noticed throat swallowing was getting a little tighter.  I started drinking water and just breathed normally sitting down.  I went to a mirror to see if I could see any swelling of my face and noticed my neck right under my chin was red about half way down.  My chest seemed fine.  I continued to just sit &amp; drink water and soon the heart rate was getting back to normal.  I noticed the redness on my neck was getting lighter also.  I looked at my watch and it had been a little over an hour since my vaccination.  I did not seek treatment, nor have I called my doctor.  There have been no more adverse reactions.

                                                I woke up with a headache, and feeling quite weak. I did not feel like eating, only had liquids all day. The headache was off and on all day. I also found a rash on the right leg on the inside by the knee. I found a small amount of rash on the left leg in the same area as the right leg, but not as much. I also feel dizzy and my balance was not very good.  I felt better the next day.   On January 18th, I found that I still have the rash, my headache is back and I feel very tired. Again found that I did not have much of an appetite and did not feel up to making food for myself. Had liquids and 2 Ensure protein shakes. Then in the evening had a egg sandwich with mayonnaise.

                                                The day following vaccination I began to have abdominal pains with nausea, and diarrhea. I have been very tired only able to stay up approx. 3 hours then must lay down. Diarrhea quit after 4 days but am still nauseated and feel cold all over.  No fever, no vomiting. Very shaky. I have been keeping hydrated by drinking ginger tea, green tea, ginger snaps.  I am hungry and can eat small amounts which makes me feel better for a couple of hours but then back comes the abdomen discomfort. I am a cardiac patient and a diabetic.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  For the first 8 days, I experienced no reaction to the vaccine.  On day 9, I developed a rash on my right arm surrounding the vaccination  site. I was also flushed and my eyes were red.  And, I experienced diarrhea.  I began taking Benadryl 25mg  every 4 hours during the day (and took zolpidem only at night). In the subsequent 4 days, In addition to the rash, I experienced minor headaches and body aches (not unusual with my Fibromyalgia) so I added Tylenol 500 mg every 6 hours. The rash remained the same. Today is Day 5 and I awoke feeling better and the rash is the same size but not as vibrant. I used a cortisone cream on the rash today and only took Benadryl once when I began to feel lousy at the end of my work day.

Friday continued to feel the same sickness, nauseated, headache, off and on low grade temp and pain  in arms and upper back. I was taking 800mg Ibuprofen 3 times a day and it would ease off headache a little, but nothing  would stop for long.  I was just miserable. had heard the 2nd vaccine could cause such problems, but not the first...therefore, I am a little frightened of getting the 2nd vax. I tried to call the triage nurse at the VA to  ask her about it, but never could get thru to her.  Sent message saturday night to PCP, and was told to go to this website and put in info.

I took some Advil, put addition coverings on and was able to fall asleep. In the morning, I was very achy, had a bad headache and had a temp of 101. (The highest it got was 102 over the next 36-40 hours). My temperature didn&#39;t break until Monday afternoon. But then it returned early in the evening to 101.2. I was very weak, tired, no appetite, headache, and feverish until this morning which is Tuesday at 10:00. I feel better this morning, not achy, just wiped out. I had the virus last March and this few days was worse than when I had it.

                                                From my diary about the events of yesterday and today:   I will try to relate what happened to me yesterday.   I received my second Covid vaccination a few days ago and perhaps the following is related, but I?m not sure.  I think I felt fine yesterday morning, and decided to scrub my tub. I was mostly finished when I felt dizzy and went to lie down around 1pm.  A friend texted me asking if I was free for a chat, but I wanted to rest a little and did so, texting her when I awoke.  I did feel out of sorts when I awoke, and was aware that I had had some dreams, but texted her anyway.  We agreed to have a call at 2pm.  While on the call, I felt I was struggling with the conversation.  I was trying to tell her of my experiences with a recent part-time job (which I quit) and couldn?t remember names of people I worked with or certain events that I wished to convey.  I still can?t remember names of people with whom I worked, and it was just one week ago that I left.  I suddenly felt really out of it and nauseous, and struggled to tell my friend I needed to get off the phone.  I could not remember her name, to tell her this (and I&#39;ve known her for 40 years)!   The next few hours are a total fog.  I know I was having dreams of a sort, but I was not asleep.  There are maybe 2 hours that I can?t account for. It is most troubling to me that I can?t account for this time, but I know something was happening with my brain and while I was having these dreams or hallucinations, I was not asleep. I remember having to think really hard about what my son-in-law?s name was ? note that I live with this person.  I did not seek medical care, but feel like this information could be related to the Covid vaccine, and may be important to you.  It was my night to cook, and I had a really hard time keeping up.  I did manage to pull most of a meal together, but right before I was done, I needed to call my daughter to finish it.  I was unable to eat anything myself, and only wanted a drink.  I felt really nauseous and unsteady, although my thinking was a bit more clear by this time.  I?m not sure when the numbness in my toes and fingers on one side of my body (right side) started, but as of this afternoon, both are still numb and weak.  It is 1:00pm and I am still having trouble remembering some things, and that few hours of the afternoon from yesterday are completely lost to me.  I have like a shadow hanging above one eye. I am seriously thinking I have had some sort of a neurological event.  As of 3:00 today, my right hand and right foot are still numb, although my thinking seems to be clear.

                                                Heart started racing about 7:00 pm the night of the vaccine until today (I haven&#39;t noticed it today for the first time since the vaccine). The next morning after - so nauseous; and aching all over; so tired I could hardly move as I had joint pain, too. Couldn&#39;t throw up but nausea was there constantly - even when I went back to work on Monday I as still nauseated and still in pain. When I came home from work on Monday the body aches were gone and my leg felt numb. So it lasted a good four days for me.  No treatment except drank lots of liquids and stayed still as I could so nausea wouldn&#39;t worsen. I still ache but that might be because of my ruptured disc.

Woke up so got up to take evening meds and brush teeth. Had vertigo and moderate nausea. While brushing teeth, I fainted. Came around quickly - was on bathroom floor. Took only one of my medications - the one to prevent migraines and went back to bed. Continued with body aches and chills on and off through the night. In the morning I had worsened vertigo and nausea, but this is typical of my vestibular migraines and I think that was what was going on. I called in sick to work, took one of my  pills for treating migraines and basically slept all day. I do not get migraines often - usually

(At first I thought it was food poisoning because it came on suddenly within hours of eating. The severe discomfort was Followed by a fever of 100.5, and body aches. I took Tylenol. The next day I took gas-x and Mylanta. The next day my temp was down to 99.5 and I had severe diarrhea all day. The 3rd and 4th days I hydrated and tolerated soft foods.  6 days later I am feeling better and started  eating more solid foods. I got tested for COVID on Tuesday 2/9/21 ans got the results today that I tested negative.  I?m not sure if this was a vaccine Rection or a separate bug. I?m relieved that it wasn?t COVID.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

Over next 36 hours fever was between 100-102. Nausea began 48 hours after injection.  It is now Tuesday, almost 4 days since injection and am still dizzy and weak.  Fever stopped yesterday and only light headache today.   My husband also had all my symptoms except a much lower fever.  We are wondering if we could have got a bad batch???  They said to expect 1-2 days of mild discomfort.  This was like the worst flu I&#39;ve ever had.

The next morning I woke up my face was itching like crazy, and red. I was nauseous. I was &#34;queasy&#34; to my stomach. My left arm it was hot and red. It looked like it spreading. It was 4 fingers down from my shoulder where the shot was put in. I spoke with my Pharmacy on the 13th and the pharmacist told me to use my Flonase and to take Tylenol or Ibuprofen.   She told me if my breathing or anything got worse to go to the ER ( I have SOB due to Alpha-1).  I did speak with my Doctor&#39;s office as well and they told me the same thing if I got worse to go to the ER. The 14th I still felt nauseous, queasy, and my arm was still sore but the itching had improved. I took more of my allergy  medication and  by the 15th I was fine.

                                                On the morning after receiving the vaccine I had severe pain in my left hip, across my shoulders and lower back. I had a golf trip planned so I drove friends from and played 9 holes of golf that afternoon. I took Tylenol every four hours and the pain eased. I felt tired that day but the next day the pain was minor and I was not as tired.I played 18 holes of golf and played 9 on the following day and drove home. The first day of my trip when I had a bowel movement I noticed a strange acidic smell. All that day every time I ate I had a bowel movement, which is RARE for me. I usually go once in the morning. Also when I had to urinate I had to go IMMEDIATELY. The urination issue improved after the 3rd day but I continue to have the bowel problem and a mild headache and just don&#39;t feel well. I am mostly concerned about the bowel problem. I have to go every time I eat. Sometimes it is somewhat normal and sometimes it is like diarrhea.

                                                The day following the vaccine I was fine until approximately 1:30 p.m. when I suddenly got very, very dizzy, had disequilibrium and began to feel nauseous, and had diarrhea.  The dizziness increased from mild to so bad I had to hold onto the wall to walk to the bathroom.  I took half a Benadryl but it continued to escalate and I took another half a Benadryl at which time it stopped escalating but did not dissipate until approximately 4:45 p.m.  I called my physician who was unavailable so I just depended on the Benadryl.  There were no breathing difficulties but I had a scratchy throat in the middle of the attack and my tongue went numb and tingly.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 10-Jan-2021.  On 11-Feb-2021, approximately 2 days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11-Feb-2021, the patient developed body and joint aches, chest pains, fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, and just hurt all over and felt terrible. On 12-Feb-2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms persisted, and she was in the emergency room (ER) to be treated.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, chest pain, body and joint aches, fever, chills, fatigue, and nausea, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

                                                Patient appeared nervous upon receiving vaccine. Patient reported trouble swallowing ( has a history of radiation therapy on throat). When asked if breathing was restricted, patient was able to take long breaths with minimal additional effort. Shortly after, patient appeared to be close to passing out (not completely awake and alert), eyes dilated. The pharmacist who administered the vaccine then administered one dose of the epinephrine (Epi-pen LOT:0FM353/eEXP:NOC 21) while the staff member kept the patient stable in her chair. The facility was instructed to call 911. At 11:49 AM (7 minutes later), symptoms began to improve and the patient became more alert. EMS arrived around 12:00PM to take patient to hospital--patient refused and was back walking around the facility 5 minutes later. No further issues were reported with this patient (pharmacist administering the vaccine left the facility around 1:15PM)

She was noted to have significant nongranulomatous anterior chamber reaction (2&#43; cell). There was no hypopyon or keratic precipitates. She was symptomatic with pain and light sensitivity in the right eye only. (Of note, the left eye was quiet. It had undergone cataract surgery and recently discontinued postoperative steroid drops). I discontinued the Tobradex and start Durezol drops every 2 hours. Of note, she has no history of uveitis. I saw her again 1/12/21 with complete resolution of the inflammation. She is currently tapering down on the topical steroid. I will see her again on 1/26/21 while taking Durezol 1x/day. This should be about 3 days from her second vaccination

                                                Arm started hurting 12 hours after shot. When I woke up in the morning I had chills, headache, diarrhea and nausea  (although I never vomited). Went back to bed at noon because I couldn?t get warm on the couch. Had nightgown, sweater, heating pad, blankets, plus a wool Afghan. Slept from noon until 8:45 AM the next day with a few bathroom breaks and Tylenol. Still having headache today which is Sunday. Had the shot Thursday morning. Had similar, but worse reaction to the second shingle shot.

Started getting sick to her stomach all evening, started throwing up last night beginning at 11:00 PM, throwing up bile.  Today having fever of 101, didn&#39;t take anything for it, but down to 100 now.  Took 2 Tums and had such achy joints and sat down in a chair and could not get up from the chair.  Took some Tylenol and that helped, but freezing cold.  Didn&#39;t sleep all night.  Has not notified her doctor of the symptoms, just calling us.

On Jan 27th (7 days following vaccination) a large (2.5&#34; X 4&#34;) red area formed around the injection site on my arm and it began to ache and itch. I also had diarrhea which began in the middle of the night (2 am on Jan 28), with a total of 3 episodes over 3 hours. That day I was very tired, experienced intestinal upset  (w/ very small episodes of diarrhea) and my arm began to really ache and the swollen area became rather firm and hot. The intestinal episode is over but the hot red welt continues as of this report. Diarrhea is not a common condition for me.

Also slight nausea and loose stools.  After feeling well enough to find the thermometer, temp registered at 100.5, and continued through night. The chills were intense. Treated fever with liquids and rest.  Fever and chills lasted until about 9:00 AM 1/27/2021.  I was able to eat a little, then very fatigued and slept until 4:00 PM 1/27/2021. After a light dinner, slept all night. Woke 1/28/2021 better, but not energetic.  As of today, 1/29/2021, I am able to return to normal activities.

                                                Began with sweating than pain  in upper back between shoulder blades, radiated from back to  chest.  Tightening of jaw (as when eating something really tart).  Pain felt similar to muscle spasms and would be bad enough to cause nausea &amp; vomiting.  When pain subsided would experience chills and shivering.  This would come and go over the next 5-6 hours.    Checked for fever, but temperature was within normal range.

I have taken Imodium and it has helped but the minute this wear off diarrhea returns. The thing is I just NEVER have diarrhea, in 67 years you   could count on 1 hand the times I have had mild diarrhea, never anything like this.  I would classify this as violet diarrhea.

                                                I received the 1st shot of the Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine on 1/23/21 at the Pharmacy. Three days later I started experiencing sharp abdominal cramps with gas that I couldn&#39;t expel and abdominal bloating. I am still experiencing this 6 days later from when it started. I feel better when laying down but when I stand up I have this really heavy feeling in my lower abdomen. I also experience abdominal cramps not long after eating. I am not constipated. In fact, I&#39;ve been having a lot more bowel movements which is not normal for me. Also, on Sunday, 1/31, eight days after injection, I developed a red patch that was very warm on my left arm where I received the injection and a headache. The red patch is still there. I&#39;m concerned about this and wonder if this may be related to one of the ingredients in the vaccine, i.e., polyethylene glycol.  I have reported this to my M.D. this morning and they are asking me to come in.

                                                It started with my arm hurting, even my fingers on the left arm. Then my temperature began to climb to 101.7 within 20 minutes, accompanied by chills.  I was very cold--freezing hands and feet. Could not get warm. Then headache started. Migraine intensity no matter what position I assumed. My joints began to hurt, every joint --knees, elbows, back, even fingers-- so it was difficult walking or moving. Even my teeth hurt where I had had dental work the precious day.   All I could do safely was lie in bed with many pillows to hold my head up. I was also nauseous, and a bad case of post nasal drip developed. I could not  rest properly all night--I took one baby tylenol  every four hours (my usual dose) but it did not help.  Finally at 8:00 AM the fever began to subside slowly till to 98.7 and the head ached/ joint pains are  slowly dissolving while I am writing this. I normally don&#39;t run fever and the last time I had the flue was 40 years ago! I have never been this sick in my life.

Pain continued to worsen through the day.  Called my physician and she said to come in Thursday. Pain worsened Thursday.  Had blood draw to test Lipase and Amylase. as pain seemed similar to Pancreatitis I had in 2018 which occured after a wasp sting. Dr. called early Friday to tell me to go to ER that my Lipase number was 1547. Went to ER. Very crowded.  They repeated the Lipase and it was down to 474.

                                                I felt queasy at 5:15am.  Had severe vomiting and diarrhea throughout the day, with a fever of 100 degrees. Tried taking a Pepcid, but got dry heaves. Had nine episodes of diarrhea. Called the doctor at 1:40pm who recommended tablespoons of water every 10 minutes.  The nausea and dry heaves  would not stop so my husband called the doctor again at 7:00pm who recommended the emergency room for an IV.  But at 7:30pm, the nausea lifted, and I was able to sleep.

                                                I received this vaccine at a walk-in-clinic, called STAT Med.  About 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt nauseated but finally managed to sleep.  The next afternoon on February 23 I became very ill with vomiting and diarrhea all at the same time.  I nearly passed out several times.  First responders arrived and found my blood pressure to be about 70/30.  Got in ambulance and given fluids.  Arrived at hospital around 5:15 pm.  Got more fluids and numerous blood tests, none of which were very remarkable.  My WBC was 17 but nothing else was wrong.  Left hospital at 9:00.  Physician assumes Covid vaccine cause these side effects.

I tired to sleep, but I felt uncomfortable. This morning my fever was broke. I still feel achy , headache, tired feeling, no appetite as of today.  I am getting back to normal but only feel about 80% recovered.

That night ran fever of 103 pain all through body, chills, couldn&#39;t warm up.  couldn&#39;t eat, just drank water Respiration quick and short. Scary all night long..  Next day fever of 102 aching, bone pain, extreme soreness in arm, couldn&#39;t walk without falling..  Stayed in bed, did not eat, no appetite.  Third day fever broke somewhat in night.  Sweating, fever down to 101, still weak and uncoordinated. Still short of breath just walking.  I had a bad case of Covid-19  in July of 2020 and asked if this would aggravate it.  Was told no.  It actually felt like I had a case of it again.  The pain has been really awful.  I still do no want to eat on the third day.  Still having chills.

                                                I experienced onset of a severe headache and vomiting (x2, small amounts) the day after (2/2/2021)receiving the vaccine at noon-3pm. That evening as the headache resolved,  i noticed that the corners of my mouth and the area below my lips were sore and hard to the touch. These are all areas where i had fillers injected in the past (August 11, 2020). Restylane was the filler, i think. The symptoms i experienced felt exactly like when i received the injections in August 2020. The symptoms were gone by the next evening. I called my dermatologist  when i saw on the CDC Moderna training site (i&#39;m a Public Health Nurse volunteer vaccinator) that this &#34;rare&#34; side effect should be reported. She refused to file a VAERS report and told me that my symptoms were because i had vomiting and the muscles around my mouth were irritated, and that it was not from inflammation or a side effect of the vaccine.

Called 911 on way home. EMTs said allergic reaction. Oxygen sat was 97 percent. They said to go to ER if symptoms continued. Went to ER, where I received injections of Benadryl and steroids. Released after a period of observation. Today I am still flushed and tired from vaccine but am otherwise okay.

I gripped the sink and next I knew I woke up on the floor.  I suffered severe bruising from the fall. Only other side effects I had were a slight headache and chills a few hours after this incident.

                                                Nearly immediately post injection, my right neck, and then my right arm down to my hand went numb.  That resolved after one hour or so.  There was no weakness.  The next day I had transient flu symptoms (hot, nausea) and a 12 hour headache.  Within a week I had a bad flare of migratory joint pain and swelling in my knees, hips, shoulders, elbows.  The joint symptoms are somewhat better (maybe 50% or less) but have not resolved.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:30AM. Around 4:00PM that day I started having severe dizziness. About 40 minutes later I had severe pain in my neck, back, and shoulders. I have had 3 herniated discs in the past and the pain from this was much worse than that pain.  About the same time I felt a headache coming on that just got worse as the night went on. I decided to go to bed and try to sleep, however, the pain was so great that I could not lay down flat or sit up. I spent the night walking the floor. During the night I vomited several times. I also developed jaw pain, earaches, and a sore throat.  But the worse part was that during the night I started to feel the sensation of pins and needles being thrust into my legs, ankles, arms, and hands. I never did however have a fever. I finally was able to fall asleep at about 5AM and slept for several hours. When I woke up the pain was mostly gone and I was just left with no energy at all so that I could hardly lift my head off the pillow. I stayed in bed the entire day and the next day I was fine.

Patient was emitting a choking, sputtering noise. Her hands were clenched so hard that pharmacist had difficulty separating them. Her head was extended backward and clenched. Patient&#39;s eyes were unfocused and rolled back. Pharmacist observed patient for about 15-30 seconds before administering epinephrine 0.3mg IM. Patient became responsive and was allowed to drink enough water to wet her mouth. Patient then vomited. EMS showed up within 5 minutes of incident and declared patient appeared normal other than an elevated heart rate. Patient declined further care from EMS. Pharmacist called patient after an hour to verify she was still fine, which she was.

I felt like I was getting a bad case of the flu. I was very lethargic. The site itself was inflamed and warm. I couldn&#39;t function, so I went to bed and let my boss know I was having some sort of reaction. From that point I wasn&#39;t well. I eventually tested positive for COVID and now I have a sinus infection. The swelling at the site started to go down about 5 days later and my symptoms we residing as well for my arm itself. I still had body aches, fever, cough, brain fog, respiratory and sinus issues. I also had intermittent mild nausea.  Symptoms were alleviated  about a week ago.  I still have symptoms, but they are residual. I was on antibiotics prescribed by Dr. via Telemed.

My huband checked my temperature and it was almost 101; so he gave me some tylenol. It did not help. Between 1 and 2 pm I became nauseous and started vomiting. My husband called the Dr&#39;s office but could not reach anyone nor was he able leave a message to report that I was sick and my temp was now 102.  I suffered through the night with tylenol and sips of water, gingerale and tea. On Saturday morning still having rather mild chills and low grade temp of 99.7 and feeling really tired but by evening I could eat soup and crackers which stayed down and drinking sprite,  ale and tea. Sunday,  still feeling tired but moving more and keeping fluids down. I noticed that I was hungry but food had no taste. Fever broke early Monday morning, still feeling sluggish but much improvement.

I was having difficulty catching my breath and unable to burp or clear the liquid.  After three tries, I was able to clear the airway and was able to breathe well.  I also checked my blood pressure which was 163/83.  I had phlegm in my throat and could clear it with drinking water.  After approximately 40 minutes of checking and rechecking my blood pressure and drinking water, I was able to sleep until 9:00 am.  It is now 24 hours from the injection and I feel much better.

After I got this vaccine on 01/20/21, I had got almost all of the symptoms of Covid again that I had:  chills, 100-101 fever,  bad body aches, nausea, vomiting, very tired for 3 days, severe migraine headaches, and very sore left arm.  I had all these symptoms in January and July too. The only thing that I didn?t have was a deep cough and trouble breathing that I also had in January and July.

That subsided, then I had persistent itching at the injection site.  That subsided but now have large, hard red patch the size of a tangerine at the injection sight that is slightly itchy and tender.  Have been experiencing slight nausea on and off, mostly in the mornings. Six days after injection I was feeling light-headed, dizzy and like I was just going to faint or fade away.  Still have those symptoms on and off, but they are not as strong.

A few days after that my blood pressure was going lower than normal and I felt dizzy, so I reduced my blood pressure medication and kept an eye on it. I also had a huge a lump in my arm and my whole arm was sore. It was red and hot to the touch.

                                                I woke  up at 3:30 a.m. February 11.  I noticed I had wet the bed (which I haven&#39;t done for 60&#43; years) and felt very weak--afraid to move for fear I would pass out.  I had no pain and no indication of heart attack or stroke.  After 5-10 minutes I walked to the bathroom where I had diarrhea and vomited a small amount. I stayed on the stool for some time because I felt too weak to safely get up.  I did go back to bed after 15 minutes or so.  I got up again with diarrhea an hour or so later. I got up at 9 a.m. feeling  a lot better but still weak.  Took it easy the rest of the day and had regained most of my energy by evening.  I think I may have suffered a seizure of some kind resulting in the wet bed and extreme weakness.

                                                I had mild pain and itching in my arm the evening of the day of the vaccine (02/12). The next morning I woke up feeling awful, I had a fever of just over 100 and chills, vomiting and diarrhea, body aches and a medium headache. This lasted the full day. I couldn&#39;t eat or drink anything...kept coming back up and out... really awful. When I had Covid-19 back in March although I had a fever for 10 days, I had none of these symptoms... I just lost my sense of taste and smell for 7 months.

                                                Feb. 23 eve. I had pains in the nerves in my left hip going down my leg and the left side of my tongue was sore. Feb. 24. I was very tired and achy all day with a bad headache. I had some nausea. I took Aleve but it didn&#39;t help much. I noticed when I went to bed that I had an open, bleeding sore on my right wrist. I knew that I had not done anything to hurt my wrist. Feb. 25. When I took a shower, I saw that I had an open, bleeding sore on my right shin. The right side of my tongue was hurting and sore. When I looked in the mirror at my tongue it had little red blotches all over the right side.  I have a bad headache but not as bad as yesterday.  I am also somewhat tired, but not achy.

                                                Nausea. Overall muscle aches. Migraines that responded to the 2 different drugs lists, but manifested repeatedly such that the nausea and very severe head pain woke me. My response was to take a different drug in each 24 hour period. Using sumatriptan first and then 24 hours later after the pain ceased and then reestablished itself, using Migrainol, and so on. The drugs worked, but the projectile vomiting and head pain consistently came and went. Injection #1 was a bit shorter and slightly less intense, but the last time I experienced projectile vomiting due to migraines was in 1999.

                                                First two days after vaccine- tired. By day three began experiencing back pain. By Wednesday, January 20th severe back pain and chest tightening. I went first to Urgent Care. Dr. said EKG ok but I should follow up with Dr. or ER. That evening I went to ER at Hospital. By then it felt like my back and chest were in vice. It did not feel like regular back pain- more searing and deep spasms. Had a gnawing kind of feeling in my stomach and esophagus. Pain in upper part of my body....sometimes waves of pain in shoulders and down back half of my arms. ER Dr gave me shot of pain meds and sent me home after a few hours. Vice like feeling subsided but deep muscle pain in back continued.It was not as severe as the previous day. Over the next week it continued to go from severe back to mild.I visited my primary care Dr/PA and tried changing GERD meds from Famotidine to another- no help. Tried muscle relaxers- I just slept on those. About a week after first visit I went to ER again after a bad night of the vice like feeling in chest and back. ER Dr. did CAT scan of heart and lungs. No sign of pneumonia . Since then I have had an endoscope, seen a cardiologist, and an orthopedic Dr.  After second dose, reaction came back, but less severe than the first time.

                                                Sent: 3/4/2021   7:55 AM Subject: Non-Urgent Medical Question                    For a full week now, I have been battling diarrhea and a very hyperactive stomach and intestines. Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).  Patient presented to outlying emergency room with flank pain &amp; transferred here with severe bilateral hydronephrosis on imaging.  Patient had severe left flank pain about 2 weeks ago. Treated with tylenol, motrin, and heat and pain eventually dissipated. Then Tuesday and Wednesday pt did a lot of yard work and lifting. Thursday patient woke up with excruciating right flank pain.  Nothing has made it better.  Patient has tried ice, heat, tramadol Tylenol, Motrin, steroids and pain persists.  Additionally patient having nausea and vomiting.  She has started to have burning with urination.  Pain is excruciating stabbing.  Radiates to the groin.  Patient has also started running fevers today.  She feels pretty miserable.   Also patient notes difficulty with her bowels since her last surgery.  Prior to surgery she took Linzess every day.  Since surgery it has been suggested she does not need this medication.  Patient does note little to no notice when her bowels decide to move.  Severe significant gas.  Other times patient feels quite constipated.   UA suggests possible infection with positive nitrites, 1&#43; leukocyte esterase and 3&#43; blood.  WBC 2.1, Cr 1.0, K 3.0 CT scan with multiple abnormalities, but most notably severe bilateral hydronephrosis without obvious obstructing lesion.  Multiple scattered nodular densities concerning for metastatic disease.    Patient transferred for higher level of care and urology consultation.

Took Tylenol for fever which helped control that symptom.  It was like hospitalized COVIC all over again. Reluctant to receive 2nd dose if I have this same adverse reaction.  I had donated my COVID convalescent plasma that morning for the 4th occasion but I was told it would not interfere with the vaccine.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

Started with severe chills, body shaking, achy all over, head felt like it was going to implode, started to sweat and felt flushed.  Woke up my spouse to get me something to take for headache, etc.  Later that morning could hard lift the Arm, felt a golf ball size lump at injection site and warm to the touch. Was in bed 2 days bcuz it exacerbated my MS.  After that the injection site started itching, with redness.  Lump finally getting smaller.  I took a photo of the injection site which has a red circle the size of my hand.

                                                On Feb 10th, After dinner at about 7pm, , within about 15 min I started throwing up and also had diarrhea . My injection site became inflated to the size of a ping pong ball and VERY dark pink in color and extended out from the injection about 4 inches. I also had an enormously terrible headache and my sinuses were very sore and burning.  Approximately about every 15-20 minutes I was throwing up again until about 4am. This throw up was not chunky with food but more flemm  and jello like.  Finally around 4am I was able to get to sleep in a recliner chair until about 7am.   Currently it is 2:30pm on Feb 11th and my headache is just about gone, the soreness is gone from my body and I feel much better.   My major question is , Should I take the 2nd vaccination and will I have the same reactions to it.  What can I do to make myself feel better if I do get the 2nd shot. ?

                                                At 3:30 pm (2 hours after the injection) my arm at the injection site started to hurt and I felt light-headed and had chills,  These symptoms continued, plus I became exhausted and my joints hurt.  My stomach was queasy.  By the next morning, my joints hurt so much it was difficult to roll over in bed, and all the other symptoms were still there and worse.  I did not have a fever.  I developed a headache.  All I could do was lie in bed; sitting up felt exhausting.  By evening of that day, my joint pain was lessening and my stomach felt somewhat better.  By the following morning, I felt normal, basically.  So in total, about a day and a half of bad reaction.

The next day the injection site was red, with an expanding hard tissue underneath the skin, about five inches in diameter. Seven days later the rash was almost gone. Eight days later the rash came back with a vengeance, extremely itchy and expanding to three inches in diameter. As of this report, at ten days post-injection, the rash remains at three inches diameter and itchy.

                                                Sore arm began a few hours after shot with  a hard swollen area about 3-4 inches in diameter. The other symptoms began during that night about 2 a.m. and continued throughout most of the next day:  nausea and vomiting (early morning only), severe headache, severe body ache...all over. Second day after shot - arm soreness and swelling is still here but with reducing  intensity. All other symptoms seem to have subsided....thank heaven!  I took Goodies powders for headache and body ache after eating a piece of white toast. Took every 4 hours throughout the day which seemed to help but felt bad enough to continue taking until  end of day.

I told her I had the shot on 2-18 and was due again on 3-18.  LShe asked me to report back to her if the dizziness returns or after I get the second shot hnd have a reaction.  I just wanted you to know of this. Again last dizzy reaction on 2-22.

                                                I felt fine until the morning of Jan. 10 (except for very painful arm).  I was awakened early in the morning by severe vertigo (my eyes were blinking rapidly and the room was spinning violently); I was nauseous and couldn&#39;t lie down without the violent spinning re-occurring.  I was very dizzy and exhausted the whole day, unable to function.  The next day I continued to be very dizzy and off-balance, couldn&#39;t work but better than prior day.  Each day, same symptoms have continued but milder.  I called my PCP on Monday, Jan 11.  He told me it sounded like an inner ear problem, probably unrelated to the vaccine and to call him the next day and report my symptoms.  I did (Tues. Jan 12) and reported dizziness was milder but still there.  He suggested I see an ENT doctor.

                                                I began having severe shaking chills on 01/19/2021 in the evening. I kept being awakened by chilling and covered up on 3 blankets. I took my temperature at 11:00pm and it was 100.3 degrees. My normal is 97.3degrees. Around 1:00 am I was awake with nausea and stomach pain. I did doze off and on all night. I woke at 8:00 and my temperature had gone down to99.4. The nausea eased off. I rested all day. My arm was very sore and in the evening it was red. The next day I had no fever, but my arm was a little swollen and sore. The redness had increased and it felt warm to the touch. This began to subside on Friday and is now still a little red, but not painful. I had suffered with COVID in July. I assume this is why I had a reaction. It was much less severe that the infection.

                                                Symptoms started on Saturday morning (1/16/2021)  following the shot having been administered the previous day (1/15/2021) at 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon.  Initially, I had a slight, constant  headache and &#34;medium&#34; fatigue.  I dismissed it as not important because it was relatively minor. and I am generally fatigued at the end of a work week.  The headache lasted all day but was fairly low level. I did not sleep well that night but was able to function during the next day (1/17/2021)  without a problem.  I don&#39;t remember if the headache was present that day.  However, on Sunday evening (1/17/2021) (around 6:00 p.m. or so) chills started to go up and down my body and my hands were very cold.  I had no fever.  I added more garments to keep warm and ignored or was distracted by my activities of the evening. Monday (1/18/2021) during the day the chills continued to go up and down my body  intermittently-- not really staying in one place -- but my hands remained very cold.  It should be stated that I prefer colder temperatures; i keep my house between 60-62 degrees in winter and I am able to stay comfortable with a shirt and sweater in that environment.  So, on Monday, the fact that I had chills was remarkable to me. The chills were intermittent. Tuesday (1/19/2021) I worked from home all day and had an electric heater going focused very closely on my body all day.  I was cold but don&#39;t remember having chills.  Tuesday evening the chills returned, along with a significant headache that circled my head (not focused in one spot), my body ached, my eyeballs ached; I had intestinal cramping .and I simply could not get warm due to the constant &#34;full-body&#34; chills. I went to bed with a heated mattress pad on,  flannel sheets, a comforter an d a thick wool  blanket. I could not get warm.  I was not able to sleep at all the entire night due mostly to the (major) physical discomfort and (minor) worry as to what was going on. I DID NOT have a fever. Around 8:30 on Wednesday morning, I was able to fall asleep as the chills had diminished and I was worn out. The body and eyeball aches were still present as was the intestinal cramping. Later that afternoon the symptoms started to diminish and I was able to sleep Wednesday night. I did not eat anything on Wednesday as I was not interested in food due to the discomfort of  the intestinal cramping. I was able to smell food and had not lost my sense of taste.  Thursday morning (1/21/2021,  I finally felt like I could eat and had  some food which tasted delicious to me.  I was able to get warm, had slight headache, cramping was mostly gone, ..I still had (reduced levels) body aches and eyeball aches.  I had no chills.  I was able to consume and tolerate reduced amounts of food.  Friday (1/22/2021) I was tired but able to function and felt as if I was returning to feeling like myself.  Today, Saturday(1/23/2021, I am feeling about 95% myself and relieved to have this behind me.  I am very concerned about how I might react to the second dose of the vaccine.  I am going to consult the local hospital and my PCP there to inquire about the advisability of getting the second dose.

Figured this was normal so continued home. For the rest of the that day I felt lightheaded, dizzy and just wonky off and on the entire day. I later felt exhausted, like someone flipped a switch on me, around 3:00 pm and took a nap for 2 hours. After the nap I felt nauseous and like I was going to vomit. I ate dinner and later in the evening, I took some allergy medicine and felt a little better and went to bed.  The next day, Friday, I felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and again felt like I was going to vomit in the morning. I ate breakfast, felt nauseous, started cramping, had diarrhea and was then fine.  No more symptoms after that.  Although my arm is still tender today, Saturday.

During the night when I got up for the bathroom, I was very dizzy.  In the morning, the dizziness, shivers, and the dry heaves were gone.   However, the fatigue, headache,achiness  and nausea  and fever continued until approximately 6 PM on Friday.  Everything started to get better and  continued to improve.  It is Saturday 1/30/2021 at 5 pm and all symptoms have disappeared.

                                                After receiving the injection, I was directed by an RN to sit in a chair for 15min in the same room. Five minutes after the injection I felt my upper back  muscles, ribcage area, contract.  The contraction continued around to the front of my chest with next 3 minutes.  I felt tightness with each breath.  The RN who gave me the injection came to see if I felt alright. She informed the charge nurse that my chest felt tight and the charge nurse came to ask me questions.  The charge nurse called the hospital pharmacist to come to see me.  The pharmacist arrived with various medications and talked to me.  He instructed me to do breathing exercises and meditate.  I told him that I was familiar with these techniques and using them.  I also informed the pharmacist that I had a heart attack in 2018 and had atrial tachycardia but I wasn&#39;t feeling any problems with my heart, that it was beating normally.  I also informed the pharmacist of my severe allergies to certain items but I wasn&#39;t experiencing any anaphylaxis that I&#39;ve experienced in past allergic episodes.  The pharmacist left and told the charge nurse to keep me a half hour longer under observation and to call him if I felt worse.  During that half hour, the muscle contractions stopped and I was able to breathe normally.  The charge nurse asked me if I was ready to leave after the half hour was up, I told her I was feeling odd so she said to stay another 20min.   I began to experience intestinal cramping and asked to leave to go to the bathroom.  In the bathroom I had a bout of diarreah that lasted 10minutes.  After that I drove home but was experiencing a headache that started.   The headache lasted for 20hrs. It felt like I was wearing tight hat, squeezing.  Iv&#39;e not had that type of headache before.  My right arm site of injection feels a little warm and is pink but isn&#39;t painful.

                                                On February 29 in the evening, about 8 days after the shot, the site was very itchy and had a rash.  I used an antihistamine and ice and it improved but in the early morning hours of February 2, I was up with abdominal and gastric discomfort and could not sleep.  I was in bed all the next day with terrible unrelenting headache and fever over 102 degrees.  It began to improve by the evening and upon waking on February 3, I felt better and completely fine by mid-morning.  I went to get a COVID test on Feb. 2 and it came back on Feb. 3 NEGATIVE.  It was a very intense and unpleasant experience and I thought you should know about it and the fact it happened about 10 days after the first Moderna shot.  thank you.

Throughout the next 48 hours the symptoms continued but slowly subsided:  by noon (24 hours after inoculation) the fever was 100.  Nausea subsided to allow broth and crackers by 30 hours after injection.  Within 60 hours symptoms were gone except for the arm.  On day three I did develop &#34;Covid arm&#34;.  The red tender patch is still visible (one week after injection) but the rash is slowly diminishing.

After one hour I was fine.  Second vaccine was administered on Feb. 8th at noon. By 3:30 AM Feb 9th I could barely get out of bed because of severe joint pain and aching. I was nauseated, had a mild fever, mild headache and very tired. This lasted until  February the 10th at which time I felt better. By Feb. 11th I had return of deep aching pain in my hips and pelvic bones. ( I have arthritis and know what joint pain is). This was much worse. I felt ill from about one week after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna. I started feeling much better with the occasional return of mild symptoms.  I go to physical therapy for arthritis pain and had taken a week off. I returned to physical therapy on Thursday. February 18th. I was unable to complete my usual workout due to weakness in my legs and joint pain. I returned on Feb. 22nd and the same thing happened I felt weak, diaphoretic, nauseated,  after exercising a short time. This has never happened before.

                                                On Wednesday, February  17, 2021 around 7:00 pm I had a pounding headache that I never experienced before.  The next morning headache began again and started vomiting at 7:45 a.m. thru out the morning until 11:30 a.m.  I could not eat anything , tried eating a piece of toast &amp; after one bite the vomiting began again.  I vomited again at 3:15 p.m.  Tried again to eat white rice and immediately began vomiting again.  On Thursday morning had a slight headache with no vomiting.  Friday I felt OK, just weak from all the vomiting.  Saturday morning I felt Okay, then suddenly I felt dizzy and though I was going to faint.  My daughter immediately told me that she was driving me to the ER because I was pretty dehydrated.  Was diagnosed with dehydration at the ER.

I experience shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness.  My left upper quadrant is sore from the  Moderna vaccine.  It appears to be spreading circular to the size of a quarter to about the size of a fifty-cent piece.  I had gone to sleep.  I contacted the veteran 24 hour nurse, my best friend, and my brother to tell them my health status.  I had eaten dinner, taken a Tylenol, and went back to sleep before brushing my teeth.

                                                The patient received her 2nd dose of vaccine on 2/22/21 at 3. 00 PM. She was sent to the waiting area with  a timer for 15 minutes. While she was waiting, it seems she started becoming nauseous. A staff member notified me about this and I immediately went to see the patient. Just then her 15 minute timer went off. She was throwing up and when I was there she threw up clear vomitus, very little, once only. I talked her after this. She stated that few minutes after she got the vaccine, she started getting a headache and became nauseous after that. I told a staff to page for attending doctors. A team of doctors came and vitaled and assessed her. She was talking and was ok by then. They told her that she could go home as she was ok. I gave her apple juice after drinking which she was ok. I called her adult son to the waiting area and explained to him about what had happened. I had her wait for 15 more minutes. She was back to her baseline after this. She was sent home along with her son. She was ok on dismissal. She was able to walk out without any aid.

                                                High fever with chills, aches all over body, especially in places an injury occurred anytime in my life. Injection arm tender &amp; sore to touch from elbow to shoulder &amp; was slightly red around the injection site.  It felt like my body had been cut up into pieces &amp; scotch taped back together with all the pain everywhere. Thirsty , mildly nauseated.  Thursday morning I ate 5 bites of cream of wheat made with water. I was mostly bedridden until Thursday 18th night; I was able to eat broth &amp; noodle soup.  Continued in bed most of the time, began eating solid food Fri., mashed potatoes, crackers &amp; vegetable salad. Still very tired. By Fri. 2/19/2021 I was beginning to regain my strength to more normal levels. I still needed 2 hour naps &amp; slept 9-10 hours nightly. Still seemed I&#39;d get a low fever, then break it for several days.  I started sleeping on the sore arm side, cuz it was so painful on the other side &amp; on my back after several days in bed. My arm stopped hurting after 5 days3/1/2021 Today is my best day yet.  Happy to have the vaccine, no regrets!!! Thank you so much for that.

Only able to drink water and some apple juice. Could not get out of bed the day after vaccine without getting chills, breaking out in cold sweat and nausea. This is now the second day since vaccine and I have no severe symptoms. I am only feeling weak.

                                                I received the 2nd Moderna Covid 19 Vaccine 2/5/21. That evening I experienced explosive diarrhea every 20- 30minutes from 11pm 2/5/21--7am 2/6/21 the next morning along with the regular aches and shivers expected. The diarrhea continued for 4 weeks when I sought help with a doctor 3/8/21. He prescribed Sulfasalazine to help the inflammation in my colon. I proceeded to get sicker on this med as I was allergic to it but was unaware of the allergy. I was finally sent to the Hospital where I was admitted on 3/17/21. I was immediately taken off the Sulfa Drug due to fever and bright red rash all over my body that just started 3/17/21. Colonoscopy performed 3/19/21 with biopsies taken. Results of the biopsies showed there was an event that caused a lack of circulation to my colon that started the diarrhea and colitis 2/5/21. I am now on decreasing dosage of Prednisone which is treating the inflammation. The Dr. who performed the colonoscopy and did the biopsies feels that this episode was somehow related the receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine.

She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

                                                Had history of delayed reactions to allergy shots in past and staff administering vaccinations were concerned about whether that might possibly occur with the COVID vaccination. Many of the delay had been 48 to 72 hours.  I didn&#39;t feel like going to the Farmer&#39;s Market and by 2 pm started getting a migraine headache which had be concerned.   I had not had any fever but had had arm pain that I had used a heating pad for.  I ate Saturday.  I started noticing neck stiffness and some difficulty moving my head right and left.  I had migraine headaches from age 13 - 50 with an increase during pregnancy so I knew what they were and  what I had started to experience as the night went on into Sunday was more than I had ever  experienced in my life.  Flat on my back, ice, no intake, tylenol/codeine, nothing did anything and and the intensity kept coming.  I vomited some Sunday evening which usually helps release the pressure, but nothing helped.  I continued to have more difficulty turning my neck from side to side, visual difficulties and excruciating pain.  I had a virtual appointment with my endocrinologist and she was concerned about what was going on and gave me some guidelines lines about managing my blood sugars and suggesting that I be on the Farxiga if I went in the hospital.  I made it through another virtual meeting basically holding my head in my hands.  I canceled all my dental and doctor appointments because of the unrelenting pain and my concern for my driving. I began having some spastic jerking of the head and neck, which with the mask on forced my teeth into my front gums and lacerated the wholes front inside of my mouth. On 3/23 my husband died unexpectedly, I canceled Wednesday&#39;s Funeral Home visit because of my concern regarding driving and the extreme degree of pain.  I could barely move my neck past center.  I was also having mobility issues and my right side was working as well as it should.  Typing and writing were difficult.  My pain level was off the chart.  I had spoken with the doctor and once I did the required things at the funeral home, I took myself to the emergency room.  My pain was coming off the right lower part of my neck, affecting my vision, my appetite, my balance--basically neurologically going downhill on a fast slide since Saturday night. I told the nurse that my pain level was 20&#43;. The Spinal Tap in the ER was negative across the board and the fluid was clear.  IV&#39;s were hung to help with hydration.  Solumedrol and methacarbornol were given IV to deal with the inflammation around the vertebrae and the pain muscle spasms. Ice packs were applied to the front and pack of the neck to not only help with swelling, but with to relieve pain and help with neck alignment.  Blood sugars were a real struggle with all the prednisone on board but were helped some with the arrival of my Frixiga from home. It was the new Neurologist in the practice that looked at my posture, listened to my history and said, I am going to get some X-rays which took all day to do.  The X-rays showed that there had been swelling and shifting to make CI and C2 put pressure on the nerve. There was also a problem with L3.  A second neurologist added a morning dose of Topomax (50mg) which began to show some effect on Tuesday after being in the hospital for 5 days.  These 2 neurologist, along with the one in the ER could not rule out that what I experienced was a delayed reaction to the Moderna Vaccination, particularly as I have had delayed reactions to allergy shots in the past. It was suggested by the radiologist that a MRI be  one for a more definitive brain study as well as a spine study but the doctor on originally was doing much and didn&#39;t pick up on that. I have had to wean off of the prednisone at home which has meant wonderful monitoring of blood sugars. I have had to continue to wear the neck collar and slowly ween out of it.  I have been exhausted--the doctors think some of that may be from the muscle spasms and the fact that it took 4 days before there was a significant decrease in the intensity in the headache.  I still have to focus on posture and my right had gets very tired of the board.   Signatures are still not as  neat as they were but better than they were when I was admitted.

I had a bad headache on the back of my head and neck. I used an electrical heating pad on my feet, then I developed a fever. Suddenly I woke up and vomited. I felt a little relief. Took Tylenol again.  I could not move well due to bad muscle aches and stiffness.  Site of injection pain is almost gone, but I am still feeling Ill.

I had chills and was exhausted all day, I took a couple of naps, but registered 95 degrees on the thermometer, so no fever.  The next morning I felt weak and nauseated, but I was fine by 10 a.m.

                                                On the first day of the injection (1/14/2021) the left arm was sore and I felt tired. Towards evening and during the night I felt cold and hot at the same time - an intense burning/freezing sensation, but no sweating. On the first day after the injection (1/15/201) the arm was still sore and I still felt tired - burning/freezing sensation had ceased. On the second day after the injection (1/16/2021) the left arm was not sore and I felt better, but at 11:00 a.m. the vein in the left temple burst and bled until about 6:00 p.m. Continuous throbbing pain across the forehead the entire day. The  middle of the forehead is covered with red dots; the area near the left eye has a number of open, bloody lesions; the area below the temple (left cheek) is black and blue. There are also two bright red spots on my left knee - but no bleeding. Nausea was slight, but present during the entire day on Saturday and Sunday. Since the hospitals have Covid 19 patients and I do not have a car, I stayed home and rested in bed.  Today on Sunday (1/17/2021) I can sit up and walk around somewhat; the throbbing pain in the head has ceased. The lesions are still vivid red , but slowly forming a crust.  Will make contact with my doctor  on Monday, when the office is open.

                                                I had fever (99.8) during the night along with chills.  I felt like I could get warm. My joints and body ached and I had relentless diarrhea.  I also felt like touch of nausea.  Actually, I said to my husband that this felt as bad as COVID (which I contracted in late October).  I took tylenol  every 5 hours and drank lots of liquids.   I am beginning to feel better (about 27 hours after vaccination).

                                                2 days after shot I smelled something odd. This lasted for 3 days.  I also experienced very painful redness and spots on the left side of my tongue and a sore throat. The pain made it  difficult to eat or swallow.Because I often get canker sores in my mouth, I thought that this might be that but it was different than what I usually get.  I took Benadryl, valacyclovir, Motrin, and rinsed and gargled  with various mouth washes and dry mouth products.. Salt water rinses were helpful. Today is day 5 after shot and my throat is better and tongue is better.

The swelling was hard in nature.  Also has had diarrhea and vomiting at 2:00 Am this morning.  Got really hot and cold sweaty feel, then turning to chills.  Stomach hurting, breathing was labored, trying to stay calm.  Finally the diarrhea ran it&#39;s course, went back to bed and is very sore all over, especially her arms and shoulders to the point she can hardly use them.  She is now noticing pain in her arms and legs, just hurts all over.    Yesterday she took Tylenol before bed, has not taken anything today.   The vaccine site is still itchy, red, and swollen in a hard way and hurts.

                                                4 days after the vaccine, I had EXCRUCIATING nerve pain, starting at the upper vertabrae and  shooting down both arms to fingertips. Sometimes all the way down my back and the back of my legs.  I vomited all day, had a low fever which  lasted for 24 hours, then the pain and fever subsided. Still have nausea but no more vomiting .  I went to a doctor  after that, he also thinks it was a reaction..  On the 7th day, a purple splotchy rash showed on my skin and my hands started swelling up at night, so painful I couldn&#39;t even pull up the sheet.  The hand swelling goes down during the day and comes back at night.  I plan to get an antibody test  on  Feb. 26.  I am 98% certain that I had COVID in July, it was precisely the same symptoms and I had with the vaccine.  No treatment, just resting tilll it&#39;s over.  I am almost 80% better now, but not completely. I worry that I will never get back to 100%, it&#39;s been  11 days now.

The next two hours was in a haze and unable to think clearly, and on my way to the bathroom from bed, I fell at the foot of my bed but cannot remember where I landed an if I hit my head.   I am bruised this morning and have concerns because I do have a history of strokes in the last 5 years.  When I woke up this morning, I did not have any full BM but noticed blood and mucus in my stool.   Looking into visiting the doctor after filling out this form.

                                                ON Feb 26, I got up with extreme joint pain (much worse that my usual arthritis pain) the gradually developed muscle aches, fever and headache.  Also had a loss of appetite for a few days.  I was mostly off my feet for 2 to 3 full days.  Then I was extremely sweaty for the morning of the final day, like when a fever finally breaks after flu.   The site of the injection (left deltoid) got a softball sized red  hard itchy and somewhat tender spot.

                                                Neurology consult note 2/16: The patient is a 72-year-old woman, who states that last Friday she began to notice a strange fullness and numbness and perhaps a mild degree of weakness in her right leg and came to  Emergency Room.  She was seen by ER doctors.  Diagnosis was unclear.  She was offered admission to get physical therapy, but she did not wish to stay for the weekend and returned home on Friday the evening only to come back to the ER on Sunday, 2 days later with progression of further right leg weakness, right leg numbness and a hint of new left-sided symptoms that had not begun before Sunday.  None of her symptoms involve the arms or face and everything was below the waist.  There was no significant pain.  She has not had a bowel movement since Thursday and has lost the ability to void.  Her MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine was reviewed by me on the computer monitor and was unrevealing except for mild DJD.  Thoracic MRI scan shows possible spinal cord infarction versus myelitis occurring within the thoracic spine at the dorsal surface of the cord at the T5 and T6 vertebral body levels to the right of midline.  This was a faint finding and not clearly infarct or myelitis and could be artifact.  It appears that she has hydronephrosis on her scans too and now is using a Foley catheter.  She does have a history of high cholesterol for which she takes a statin at home and was taking a baby aspirin a day when the above symptoms occurred. In summary, the patient has a 72-year-old woman, who presents with progressive right lower extremity weakness and now evolving left lower extremity weakness.  This may be related to an autoimmune process such as myelitis or less commonly cord ischemia.  Normally, I would start her on Plavix, but I think she may need to undergo spinal tap tomorrow if MRI scan of the brain and cervical spine are unrevealing.  Patients with mild hyperglycemia can develop a diabetic amyotrophy or lumbosacral plexopathy simply related to diabetes, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Speaking against this would be that her reflexes are intact at both knees at 2&#43; to 3 and slightly brisk, 1&#43; at both ankles and 1&#43; and symmetric in the upper extremities.  We will hold aspirin for today.  Consider LP for tomorrow, but have not ordered as we will try to avoid and hopefully the imaging studies I have ordered will be sufficient.  We will continue to follow.  While admitted to this facility, she was treated with IV dexamethasone 2/14-2/21  She was admitted to an inpatient hospital 2/14-2/23 and discharged to an inpatient rehab unit at a different health system.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   When I went to bed the night of the vaccine, I noticed some soreness in my back muscles and left arm.  I took 2 500 mg tylenol at bedtime.  I woke up about 1:30 a.m.  Soreness in my back was so bad, it hurt to touch it or lay on it.  I also had chills to the point of shaking and added 2 extra blankets and took another 500 mg tylenol.  On Thursday, the day following the vaccine, I continued to have chills, had no appetite and had a headache. The soreness in my back lessened throughout the day and by 7:30 pm had almost disappeared.  I woke up at 1 and 2 am on March5 dripping wet(I assume from fever breaking).When I got up at 5am on the 5th, all adverse symptons were gone and I ate normally.

I went and had breakfast and then i got the chills, then i started sitting up but i felt awful so i went back to bed and dizziness weakness headache, redness around injection site.  My whole left side felt like it was achy and almost like it was numb. I lost bladder control, I had a couple of accidents.  I stayed in bed until next day, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t eat. Got up Saturday, not feeling good, queasy, diarrhea but not as bad as Friday. Every time i would try to do something i would fall asleep. went and had covid test for surgery. Sunday I felt better but not to par. Today i feel the best so far.  Put antibiotic cream on injection site because it was itching, and it is still hard and warm to touch.  Today i have a small cough that I didn&#39;t have before.

By next morning: sore wrists, hands, and shoulders. By afternoon: same soreness, but from elbow to elbow, across shoulders, felt like a bad sunburn of skin. Ankles and knee swollen. 2nd night: intermittant, surprising shooting pain in shin bones, general myalgia, plus upset stomach. 3rd day: more of same, relieved somewhat by Tylenol, but not at all by 1 Aleve (my ususal anti-inflamatory pain med of choice). Thursday, day 4: lessening of inflamed joints, but still soreness across shoulders, neck and back. Day 5: improved.

I took one imodium, but threw it up almost immediately.  Took another one mid day and it stayed down and stopped the diarrhea.  I vomited three times yesterday, but hadn&#39;t eaten anything to speak of.  Drank only water.  No fever until this morning, 48 hours after the injection, when I had a fever of 99.5, about 2 degrees more than usual.  still nauseous and dizzy, but not as bad as yesterday.  Have not thrown up nor have I had any bouts of diarrhea.  I called my doctor, and she said it could be as long as three days, so I&#39;m just sipping water and hoping for the best.

Patient asked to step outside to get some fresh, cool area. Patient stayed outside for approximately 5 minutes, returned inside and said she was feeling better. Out of precaution, during the remaining minutes on her 15 minute timer, we administered 25mg po liquid diphenhydramine. Patient remained seated for about 5 minutes and then complained of feeling even more nauseated and faint than before. We laid the patient down into the recovery position. No improvement in symptoms. Then administered 10mg IM of dexamethasone. Patient showed no signs of improvement nor worsening of symptoms. Administed 1 epipen into left outer thigh. Patient within 3 minutes began to feel better but chose to remain laying on the ground. EMS was called at 9:50am and were on scene to further evaluate patient at 9:58am. Patient was alert, responding, and reported feeling better. Moved to sitting position. Vitals were taken, Pulse of 77bmp, O2 Saturation of 100%, BP of 113/72. Vital signs were within normal limits. Patient had regained color in her face and her response to stimuli was back to normal when EMS were on scene.

Happened in a succession of maybe 2-3 spasms then stopped. Occurred maybe 6 times over the course of about 5 hours, then totally stopped around the 24 hour mark of the injection.

I have never had one but it appeared to be migrane.  Eyes felt the size of tennis balls and couldn&#39;t open eyes.  Could not stand any noise or any light.  Could not pick head up off pillow.  Constant swallowing like going to throw up.  Day #2 same thing.  Day #3 same thing but eyes felt like golf balls.  Eyes blood shot.  Day #4 (today) still some head ache and swollen eyes.  No energy.  Am scheduled for March 8 to have second shot.     WILL NOT.  Getting on plane on March 10 and will not take chance of this happening again.  Husband read that second shot has worse effects.  I sincerely feel like a &#34;lab rat&#34; since no one knows what happens to people after vaccines.  Would be really great if someone will contact me to explain reaction to shot.

By next day, very painful electric transitory pains (seconds) in core of my vascular formation in my upper left leg. This is a congenital defect that responds to estrogen, but also some medicines like synthroid, which I do not take after getting reaction with just 3 pills. Successfully moderated Hashimoto&#39;s with strict gluten-free and dairy-free diet. I have never experience such severe leg pain and massive swelling, still happening today. Th The only other time that I have experienced these short intermitent &#34;electric&#34; pains was during infertility treatment at age 40, more than 30 years ago. I suspect something in the adjuvant. I hope that this will exit my body because the sudden swelling and severe pain is not something I can endure. It barely beats dying from Covid-19. My quality of life is wrecked for the time being. I suspect that this vaccine has caused an autoimmune attack on my vascular malformation; that my T cells have gone beserk. I&#39;d be willing to have my antibodies against Covid checked and I&#39;ll bet I have more than average! The havoc for people with autoimmunity and Moderna vaccine is serious. I despair and hope that it won&#39;t have a lasting impact on my health. I will volunteer to be studied, but no more Moderna vaccine for me! I trusted the medical establishment and government and this has not worked out well!

                                                Received #1 dose as stated.  Next day, 1/27/21, 9:00am , had mild joint pain to both legs, &amp; arms, &amp; slightly tired.  Shortly after that , while driving, had nausea, &amp; muscle aches to legs &amp; arms.  Reaching family members home, could barely carry bags with each arm, due to pain in joints, and to muscles, getting worse.  Through the next 6 hrs. had moderate to severe pain to joints, &amp; muscles &amp; gradually severe fatigue. Took 1 Tylenol 650 mg for pain.   Also, checked temperature thru out this time, with only mild 99.5 temp.  Vaccine site gradually became swollen, with increased pain.  Was doing work on computer, but could not continue, so left for my home, &amp; went to bed, to sleep.  Lt.  Arm started becoming red, with severe soreness &amp; swelling by 1/28/21, 2 days after vaccine.  Vaccine was given very high on my arm, almost shoulder area.  All Symptoms continued for about 10 days, including  to vaccine arm, which continued with redness &amp; soreness for 2 weeks.   My physician was notified.   She advised NSAID before #2 dose, but I already take NSAID daily (Meloxicam), so don&#39;t think I can take another NSAID.  I have been taking Tylenol 650mg at least twice a day, for increased joint &amp; muscle pain, since vaccine.  My 2nd dose, originally scheduled for 2/23/21 has been rescheduled to 2/27/21 due to no vaccines available.

The injection site was also swollen, red and painful for about 5-6 days.  Today, it was itchy.

Since I&#39;m wearing a mask and social distancing I don&#39;t think I was exposed to anyone who was sick.  I did not see a doctor.  I just rested and on the second day  2/25 took an Advil.  I felt better the next day but became nauseous the following night 2/26.  I had some mild diarrhea and felt week again the following day 2/27.  That was followed by a full recovery.

                                                I woke up at 11:30 pm with severe intestinal cramping.  I have IBS so I used what normally worked - heat and a dicyclomine capsule.  It got worse and worse to the point my whole body was shaking.  I felt nauseous and thought I might throw up from the pain (I didn&#39;t).  At 1:00 am I took a 5mg Oxycodone pill.  I got a little relieft at about 1:45 am.  The spasms started coming in waves.  At 3:15 am I took another dicyclomine and again used the heating pad.  At about 4:30 am, I was able to fall asleep.  This is absolutely the worst spasming I have ever had.

Digestive issues including gas; Until today: ongoing pain in left leg; extreme soreness and pain. Saw Dr. for the first time in several years. Got MRI for left leg and pelvis. Results suggest ongoing deterioration of vascular malformation! I have tolerated without problems flu shots for years; first shingles vaccine; pneumonia vaccines. This  completely different. More like the response I had to infertility treatments more than 30 years ago.  I am really suffering from the unexpected results of this vaccine. My leg is still getting very hot and is causing terrible pain, especially at the top back of my left leg so that sitting is painful. I am very unhappy to have had no warning that this vaccine would be so dangerous for me. It has changed the quality of my life. I don&#39;t know what to do! I am awaiting explanation from Dr. Got initial report from my internist. I now have varicose veins in my pelvis. I imagine that this response is similar to the blood clots caused by Astra Zineca&#39;s vaccine. The Moderna has certainly had a very negative effect on me.

I could not get out of bed to take my temperature on Saturday but I imagine it was the same if not higher.  I went to bed on Saturday at 4:30 p.m.  with an upset stomach, fever with chills, headache, sore arm and did not get up until Sunday morning at 8:30 a.m.  I did not eat at on Saturday.  I was able to eat a PB&amp;J sandwich.  On Sunday after an hour of being up I went to bed with fever, chills, upset stomach and sore arm but not as severe.  This morning, Monday, I started the morning slow the way it feels when on the end of a flu.  I was back to normal by 1 p.m.

For the next few hours, I suffered from diarrhea, bad stomach pains, vomiting and was very chilled. I felt like I was going to pass out numerous times. Once the above subsided, I slept on and off. The symptoms never were that bad again. By morning I was feeling better, just weak and chilled. That feeling has stayed for the past two days.

                                                About 3:30 in the morning I woke up and I was really cold. I started having chills. when I checked my temperature it was in the 99s (the highest my temperature 101.9. When I checked my heart rate in the morning and it was in the 90s, and that&#39;s higher than normal for first thing in the morning. My heart rate went high and I had achy muscles. I sat around all day, but I didn&#39;t feel that bad in the morning, I took an extra strength Tylenol and I didn&#39;t have much have an appetite. My heart rate stayed in the 90s-130, so I called my cardiologist and he recommended I alternate Tylenol and ibuprofen and drink lots of fluids. By dinner that night I had no appetite, and then I had nausea and dry heaves, so I took 25 mg of promethazine at about 8 and the dry heaves got better within an hour. I got the COVID tongue. I had a white coating on my tongue and I couldn&#39;t get it off and a weird metallic taste in my mouth, I had a mild headache. The next day I felt much better. I called my PCP and they didn&#39;t think it was necessary for me to come in for a cardiogram because I was feeling better.

The room was spinning, I fell down, vomited and peed.  I laid there for a while until I realized if I closed my eyes the room would stop spinning.  I got up off the floor, back into bed and stayed there for about 5 hours.  When I woke up, I was still dizzy, but not nearly as bad.   The dizzyness and nausia still hits me several times a day.

I was told by the doctor that apparently my blood pressure decreased too fast causing me to faint.

(A trip from my bed to the bathroom was difficult.)  This proceeded to severe nausea (I retched into the. toilet bowl a couple of times and came close to vomiting).  I dosed in bed and the severity of the symptoms eased, but I really haven&#39;t felt completely over it until today (2-22-2021).

These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

Started feeling sick during the night, knew something was wrong.  Could barely get out of bed, was hot, possibly low grade fever, had chills, was achy, bad headache like you feel when having the flu, weakness.   Took Tylenol and her regular medicines.  Today, 1/29/21 when she woke up still has extreme soreness, hot to touch.  She looked at her left arm and it&#39;s all swollen, red and itchy.  She&#39;s now afraid to go back for the 2nd vaccine.   Caller her pharmacy due to her arm and she was instructed to take Benadryl and Ibuprofen, which she only takes Tylenol.

                                                5-10 minutes after I received the vaccine I had a headache. At first it wasn&#39;t bad, however, that afternoon it worsened and did not improve with Tylenol or Advil. The next day was worse than the first because the headache became very bad and I was unable to do anything besides rest on the sofa. The following day I felt somewhat better but the headache persisted along with eye irritation, burning, and pain. That continued for 2 more days. My headache worsened on Tuesday, February 16. I awoke with a pounding headache in the back of my head. It caused me to become nauseous for several hours which improved by the afternoon.I&#39;ve have never had a migraine but think that&#39;s what this was.  I rested the entire day. Today, Wednesday, February 17, I awoke with a mild headache which worsened during the day. Along with this my eyes ached and I noticed reading words and numbers was difficult because they were blurry. I decided to hold off on taking any pain medication to see whether or not the headache would calm down and it hasn&#39;t; it tends to move around my head during the day. Hopefully, the Tylenol will help today.

                                                First Vaccine, no side effects except sore arm for one day and a lot of bruising at injection site which left in 8 days. Vaccine 2 awakened at 2:00 AM in extraordinary pain in my whole body,, dry heaved for 4 hours, sweats and chills, temp only 99 (I usually run 97) Felt sick to stomach rest of  day. Never felt this sick.  By evening it left as quickly as it came.  Was tired for several days but nothing else. On Feb 16th awakened with an very sharp pain in the injection site when I moved my arm up to stretch. This has gotten worse every day. When I move my arm in a certain direction it feels like it is ripping inside. It is not bruised and not painful to the touch. It is inside and in the same location as the injection. Heat and ice make no difference. It seems to be getting more painful and feel it more often. It is painful enough that I let out a yelp when I forget and lift my arm a certain way. As of yesterday I feel it all day, not the sharp pain but more a inside burning, not enough to stop me, but I know it os there.

Dose 2 - A week of being achy, slight fever, tiredness, dizziness and I had a little bit of nausea - I was really bad the second day (the symptoms). The nausea and fever was gone in a couple of days. The achiness lasted about a week.  Tylenol - 600 mg (double strength) - I probably took two of those all together.

                                                woke up a little tired; Achy arm; Diarrhea; Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 74-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced diarrhea, achy arm/vaccination site pain, tired/fatigue and inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot: L0AM20A) on 28-Jan-2021. On 16-Feb-2021, approximately 6 hours prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot: 015M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Six hours, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine the patient reported that she had diarrhea, just once. She stated that went to sleep and woke up a little tired the next day and had some diarrhea. The patient reported that she was a little tired and slept for nine and a half hours.  She also stated that she had an achy arm. On 17-Feb-2021, she stated that she was feeling fine at that time.   Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, diarrhea, achy arm/vaccination site pain, tired/fatigue, was considered unknown . The outcome of the event, inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 Y/O F with nonserious unexpected event of inappropriate schedule of product administration with mRNA-1273 (lot # unknown) and adverse events of NS unexpected diarrhea and NS expected vaccination site pain, fatigue.  Adverse events occurred 6 hours after second dose mRNA-1273, and event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Hospital admission that evening. 2/26 Steroid treatment stopped headaches and eye pain. 2/27 released from hospital after BP was &lt;160.  Diagnosis-migraines possibly triggered by vaccine.  Pain/nausea elevated BP and decreased food intake which caused low blood sodium levels. IV treatments to increase sodium and lower BP. Dizziness from low sodium and high BP created fall risk, so bed had alarm.  Bed confinement necessitated daily injections to prevent blood clots.  Twice daily blood tests done to monitor sodium and potassium levels &#43; kidney function.

Cardiac enzymes negative.  EKG look good with normal sinus rhythm.  Patient has aortic valve replacement and is on Coumadin with INR goal of 2.5-3.5.  INR was elevated at 4.3.  D-dimer was negative.  Amylase and lipase negative.  Creatinine normal at 0.9.  Chest x-ray done which showed no acute disease.  On the floor, we ordered a CT abdomen.  It did show gallstones, but nonobstructing.  It showed kidney stones in the renal pelvis, but none obstructing.  No other inflammation or signs of bleeding.  Blood pressure came down after medicines in the ER.  Did have some lower blood pressures through the afternoon evening which was felt to be a combination of blood pressure low in medicines in the ER and pain medication.

Creatinine up from 0.9 yesterday to 1.8.  White count up from 8.3 yesterday to 14.4.  INR from 4.3 yesterday to 4.2.  Coumadin was held yesterday.   CT abdomen was repeated. CT abdomen was read as worrisome for necrotic gallbladder and small bile leak Contacted transfer line at hospital.  Surgery accepted and wanted transfer to go through the ER. Patient has PCN allergy.  Surgery said that if reaction was not severe, they wanted Invanz given before she left.  Patient says that she had a itching rash in the 70s.  No trouble breathing or swallowing.  No other reaction.  Dose of Invanz ordered.  IVF were increased.  HPI from hospital: 74 y.o. female who presents with Chief Complaint Patient presents with? Abnormal Scan   Patient presents via EMS as a medical transfer from hospital after having gallbladder necrosis seen on CT imaging.  She was given IV Invanz there.

Her husband reported that she was well until the evening following her vaccination (1/08/2021) at which time she became agitated.  The following day she became very fatigued and unresponsive, taking only sips of water.  The only medical attention they sought at this time was a home health hospice nurse as the patient had been on hospice.  Her condition spontaneously improved without treatment after 3 days and 6 days after her vaccination she was at her normal baseline.

I got auras before migraines years ago but they are rare now.  2.  Three hrs after the shot, I suddenly developed severe imbalance/dizziness which made me nauseous and I broke out in a cold sweat but no fever occurred.  I laid down to relieve the nausea and keep from falling.  In approx an hour, I was back to normal.  This has happened twice previously approximately 2 years ago (cause unknown) so I am not sure this event was due to the shot.  I did not seek medical attention and nothing has occurred since then.

                                                51 hours after the injection, I began to experience fevers (102), severe lower abdominal pain, extreme chilling and vomiting. This lasted throughout the night and the next AM. At around noon on January 29, my husband took me to the ER. There I underwent an abdominal CT, labs ,IV&#39;s, zofran and reglan for nausea, and Fentanyl for pain.  I was discharged mid afternoon to my husband and sent home on ondansetron.

I would guess 10 minutes after the shot my lymph nodes on both sides under my jaw were swelling and my ears felt stuffed up, under pressure.  I tried swallowing and it felt a little harder than it should.  All of these symptoms cleared in four or five hours, except for the headache which had diminished by the end of the day.

Both the nausea and severe migraine lasted for 54 hours after onset.  The first evening I also experienced teeth-chattering chills.  Finally saw an improvement around 2:00 a.m. on Monday morning, February 1, when I woke up in a total sweat.  By daylight on February 1, the nausea and migraine were  gone, but I experienced mild dizziness and blurry vision.  By Tuesday morning, February 2, I am more or less back to normal, although my vision is still a bit blurry and the dizziness still present if I move my head too quickly.

                                                Woke up about 1:00 am in delirium and feverish. No control over thought process or able to get up. Managed to get out of bed at 9:00 am but was so weak could barely make it up a flight of stairs. And when I did ended up in bathroom vomiting. Laid on floor to get some strength back. Went back to bed and slept restlessly until 4:00 pm.  Still feverish and weak but not as bad as earlier. Ate some cold grapes and went back to bed until the following morning. Tried to stay hydrated and took ibuprofen several times. My upper arm was red and blotchy for 3 days. Overall I?d say the severest part of the event lasted 48 hrs and another 24 hrs of tiredness and nausea but not vomiting.

                                                Adverse reaction began around midnight with chills, continued throughout the night alternating chills and hot flashes, severe backache, muscle aches in thighs and general malaise.  Got up around 8 to try to take a warm shower to ease muscle aches but as soon as I got into the bathroom I felt very hot, very nauseated and lightheaded.  I suspected hypotension but of course I wasn&#39;t able to prove it at the time. I attempted to get back to my bed but had syncopal episode a few feet from the bed where I collapsed onto the floor.  I just stayed on the floor and rested because it actually felt better lying down. I am a retired RN and suspect this adverse event was related to orthostatic hypotension.  Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

I took 600mg Ibuprofen and got into bed with lots of covers, but the rigors would not stop for at least 30 minutes when I finally dozed off.  I slept for 11 hours, and also felt sick the next day (a few rigors, headache, nausea, extreme fatigue). I was fine by noon on Monday, 3/1/2021.
