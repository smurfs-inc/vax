                                                For my first dose, I had quite mild symptoms. I woke up with a migraine the next morning and some soreness at the injection site. Both of these lasted a couple of days and were able to be treated with over-the-counter pain medicine. My second dose, however, provided much worse flu-like symptoms. About 12 hours after I received the injection, I was woken with a migraine much worse than the first, nausea, chills, joint pain, sore throat, and fatigue. While the chills and nausea subsided, the other symptoms persisted until the next day. As of today (2/4/21), all symptoms are gone except for soreness at the injection site.

                                                Approximately 7-8 minutes after receiving the vaccine, started to feel light-headed, thought she was going to pass out, and her heart was racing extremely high. The health care team at the site took her blood pressure, measured heart rate, gave her water, juice and chocolate and tried to get her heart rate to drop. It was fluctuating up and down and she couldn&#39;t stand up without dizziness;  we waited 45 minutes and then drove her home as she was unable to drive her own car.  She was experiencing significant lightheadedness, and consistent heart racing even while lying down on the sofa/bed. This continued for several days and she stayed home from school and sports. We called her primary care doctor on the 10th and they suggested she wait another day to see how she was feeling. She started to feel a bit better by Friday, was still experiencing a bit of the tiredness, nauseous, light-headed and heart spikes, but was able to drive, move around.  On Sunday evening, she started to experience increased heart rate again, lymph nodes were very painful and started experiencing the light headedness all evening.  On Monday we took her to her primary care provider and they then referred her to ER for the heart racing and a EKG. The increased light headedness, feeling like she will pass out even while laying in bed, dizziness has all increased and her lymph nodes continue to be swollen and painful. It has been over a week since the vaccine and there is no clear sign of her reaction getting any better, if not worse.  The EKG results indicated a new abnormality and we are trying to get her to a cardiologist.  She is and had been a very healthy, varsity athlete that runs over 30 hours a week with track, and since receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine is unable to move very far within the house without feeling that she is going to pass out or that her heart rate is shooting up uncontrollably.

                                                I started having the symptoms in the afternoon. I was really fatigued and throwing up multiple times (nothing left in my stomach); had chest pain. My boyfriend rushed me to the hospital. While I was at the hospital (about 3:00 am) I threw up again at the hospital. They monitored me and put an IV on me. When I was able to hold down water and stop throwing up they let me go home - which was about 7. Prescribed Zofran and Pepsin.  And they put me on a clear liquid diet for a day.  They told me to Zofran, Pepsin and Benadryl before the second dose and told me to eat a meal before getting the second dose and I had no symptoms at all with second dose.

                                                I developed an initial fever of 101.2° and was completely bed bound, then that same initial day I began to develop extremely painful and unexplainable mouth sores and lesions. Some developed on my cheeks, some developed on my tongue and they were so painful that I could not eat, drink water, or even talk. I continued to spike fevers for an entire week without being able to control it. The pain was so unbearable and nothing was helping the pain go away, I am still unable to eat solid foods although I no longer have fevers. My throat also really hurt and my neck lymph nodes felt sore to the touch. The lesions in my mouth are beginning to heal but I am still bed bound and am trying to recover. Only thing I can bring myself to eat is chicken broth. I saw multiple doctors, not one of them was able to figure out the source of these awful lesions. They put me on acyclovir and cefuroximeacetil as an antibiotic.

                                                It started with bad arm pain at the site of injection. I went to bed around 12:30 but I couldn?t fall asleep. By 3am I figured the only reason I wasn?t sleep was from the vaccine. I then started to feel extremely nauseous and had chills. At 3:30 am I took my temperature and it was 100.5. I laid in bed until 5am with no sleep still and took my temperature again and it was 103.5. I went back into my bed and fell asleep around 5:30 am. The next day I felt as though I had been hit by a truck. I felt extremely groggy and achy and my temperature when I woke up was around 100. Overall, I felt awful.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

                                                Patient came to receive dose 2 of Covid19 Moderna vaccine. States 1 hour after the first dose (administered on  12/28/20) she was at work and her blood pressure dropped, she became dizzy and her face went white. She said her mother insisted she go to the ER to be examined. She states upon examination she was given fluids and tests were ran and the ER staff said she was fine. Explained this to physician at vaccine site and she said it was not a contraindication to receive 2nd dose and it sounds like possible vasovagal reaction or hypoglycemia. Patient states she still wanted to receive vaccine.  Was instructed to monitor patient for 30 minutes after vaccination,  assist patient in ambulation to waiting area to lower fall risk and provided patient with apple juice and trail mix in case of possible hypoglycemia.  About 5-10 minutes after vaccine, patient stated she became dizzy and was dry heaving. She was assisted to supine position; vitals were taken and blood pressure was slightly elevated. 911 was called. Before arrival of EMS, patient stated she was feeling better and vital signs stable. Patient was helped to ambulate around waiting area and upon arrival of EMS, patient states she did not need to be transported. Patient was observed for about 20-25 more minutes and she was fully recovered. Spoke with Dr who was on scene after the incident and she believes it was anxiety.

I received the vaccine during a shift at work, and I was unable to complete the shift at my normal efficiency or concentration. To my coworkers, I described the feeling as being intoxicated, but not slurring my words. This feeling decreased enough by 9pm where I felt safe to drive home, but it was not completely gone until  approximately 11pm.

I started to sweat but had no fever at the time. This continued all night. I had no appetite after receiving my vaccine. Around 6:30 I started to get a fever of 100.3 and continued chills with headaches. I took Tylenol when needed. My whole body was sore throughout the day and got worse are the night progressed. My fever was in and out but around 9pm I had the highest temp of 101.4. I didn&#39;t get good sleep due to feeling unwell all night. I belive I stared feeling more myself sometime around 9:34am. But was still feeling a bit warm. But felt way better as the day progressed. My left arm where I received my shot is still very sore. And I still don&#39;t have an appetite.

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

I could not life my arm past my chest because it was so swollen and sore. I stayed at home and skipped new year&#39;s, going back to sleep around 1030pm. It was not fun

My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

                                                I got up to use the bathroom at 4:30 this morning. I was extremely shaky but made it. I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

                                                Immediate burning in arm right after receiving shot. 15 minutes after receiving shot began to feel tired and got a headache. Later on in the evening I had discomfort in my chest and had to use my inhaler. Pain in arm worsened over night; couldn&#39;t move arm at all. Pains spread into armpit and back. Got up at 3am to my body shivering, thinking I was running a fever I checked my temperature and it was normal but upon standing I had extreme dizziness to the point of almost passing&#39;s out, I had to sit down right away. Had nausea and whole body felt very sore an achey. The morning after my shot I woke with a headache, extreme pain in my arm and armpit, soreness all over my body, stomach pains, and my heart rate was high. Throughout the day my symptoms got worse I ran a fever of 102.7 which broke but then came back later on in the evening.  The following day my symptoms started to diminish, no fever and body was feeling better, arm pain and headache continued. Now I am on day 4 still experiencing pain in my arm and armpit, slight headache, but chest pains have started. It feels as if there is a brick on my chest, almost like a burning sensation with occasional pains in left breast as well as tightness in the left side of my neck.

It lasted the night, and then I took ibuprofen 200mg in the morning and throughout the day it got better, but around 3pm, it started to come back, so I took another 200mg ibuprofen. I also didn?t eat anything for fear I would throw it up. Later that evening, it got worse and I became extremely fatigued. I was able to eat some soup and crackers. I took another ibuprofen and couldn?t go to sleep until 4am. The next morning I felt better, with only residual side effects. My left arm was also extremely sore and tender from the time of administration until Feb. 6.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had a really awful headache and swollen arm, that was incredibly touch-sensitive. Around 3 pm that day, 25 hours after the injection I was hit with severe nausea. About an hour later, I began vomiting and had diarrhea. For some time, I was unable to keep water down. I called a 24-hour nurse line, and they advised contacting my doctor&#39;s emergency line. I did, they said if I couldn&#39;t make it through the night without keeping water down I needed to go to the hospital. Luckily, right before bed I drank some water and was able to make it through the night. The next morning, I had a telehealth visit with someone from my doctors office to review symptoms. Today I have had waves of nausea, but no vomiting. I have had diarrhea, and I had a spontaneous period that was very heavy and two weeks early today (2 days post vaccine).

I fell asleep multiple times and napped by accident. By 10pm,  almost exactly 24 hours later, I felt fine again.

Upon calling the health center, they said that I may have eaten something bad. Around 6pm the same day, I started sweating but I was freezing, and had a headache and muscle pain. I had a 101 fever and that persisted until the next day (3/24/21). It is currently (3/24/21) and I have noticed sharp chest pains on the right side of my chest throughout the day, especially when exerting forces breathing (such as riding my bike or walking up stairs, or getting into and out of bed). I still have a slight fever and feel very cold, but I in fact, still have a slight fever of 100.4

Along on those immediate symptoms I got the injection on my right arm and I experienced pain shooting up from my right arm into my neck and currently still have those pains from time to time when I move my right arm at an elevated angle. Day 4 of the vaccine I woke up one morning with swollen glands, congestion, swollen nasal glands, low grade fever of 100 degree F, very itchy irritated throat and hard to swallow, visited a clinic to see if I possibly had flu or strep but all my test results returned negative, also I had a covid test done and it was negative, I have never contracted covid 19 prior to vaccine and current day. Additionally, symptoms of congestion worsened and I am now experiencing some laryngitis due to the swelling of my lymph nodes, only sinus medication lessens the congestion to manage, I feel very fatigue, and experiencing some migraines.  Today only marks 1 weeks since the vaccine

                                                I received an allergy immunotherapy shot the day before my first dose of the vaccine and instantly felt nauseous and extremely tired after receiving the vaccine, which continued for two days after receiving tut. Three days later, I woke up struggling to breathe (but not anaphylactic), covered in hives, itchy all over, shaking, disoriented, and chilled but not truly feverish.  I reported this to my allergist, who prescribed prednisone and suggested the vaccine combined with immunotherapy were too much for my immune system for one week. The hives, itchiness, and difficulty breathing lasted about four days. I struggled with fatigue and nausea for over two weeks, stopping all school and work in the meantime. After my second dose, I feel just a bit tired and sore, so I think this truly was a bad reaction to the two injections combined rather than to the vaccine itself. Still, it was a debilitating experience,  and I would recommend considering putting out guidance that other immunotherapy patients space out their allergy injections and vaccines farther than I did.

                                                Fainting; Injection site soreness in arm; nauseous; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer  concerning a 21-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced, fainting (syncope), injection site soreness in arm (vaccination site pain), and nausea (nausea).  The patient&#39;s medical history included vasovagal condition that cause heart rate and blood pressure to drop due to stress on body and dehydration resulting in fainting. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 09 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 09 Feb 2021, the patient was fine until about 11 pm after which she experienced arm soreness on the injection site and felt nauseous.   On 10 Feb 2021, at 5 am in the morning, the patient fainted. The patient assumed that shot might have added stress to her body which most likely caused her to faint.   No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the event as patient would be receiving second dose on 09 Mar 2021.  The outcome of events, fainted (syncope), injection site soreness in arm (vaccination site pain), and nauseous (nausea), were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events of syncope, vaccination site pain, and nausea, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s prior medical history of vasovagal reactions is considered a contributing factor to syncope.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At about 10:00pm Wednesday, I started to have a headache and feel tired. My temperature was mostly normal (99.4F) when I went to bed around 2:00am. When I woke up at 12:00pm Thursday, my temperature was 103.9F. By 12:30pm, it was 102.9F. I had a very bad headache, sore throat, nausea, and some light-headedness. My fever went down throughout the day with 2 doses of Tylenol at 1:00pm and 6:30pm. The sore throat, nausea, and light-headedness resolved during the evening, but my headache was constant until I went to bed. Today (Friday), I woke up with a slight headache but no fever or other symptoms.

                                                Less than 24 hours after receiving the vaccine (Jan 7), I started experiencing bad stomach pain, which a family friend had also experienced after she received the vaccine (also ~24 hours later). It did not subside with time, and became feeling like a shooting pain that was coming and going in waves, and I could not sleep that night. I was nauseous at one point, and threw up. I drank water throughout the night, which seemed to help a little bit and was taking an NSAID. The following day (Jan 8), the shooting pain continued, and I was in bed all day. I became nauseous at one point during the day, when attempting to move a piece of furniture, but did not throw up. I continued taking NSAIDs, which did not help. I was able to sleep through the night after taking melatonin, but was in discomfort. The following day (Jan 9), I woke up, and the shooting stomach pain had radiated to my chest, and had not subsided. I called my PCP, who I was unable to see due to timing/distance from the office, and she recommended I go to an ED if I did not feel better. As the pain was in my chest, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it had radiated there or was cardiac related, I had a friend drive me to the ED. My results came back normal at the ED, and the PA was only able to tell me that it was GI related, due to the pain in my stomach/esophagus. She was unsure if it&#39;s GERD, gas trapped, or some other GI issue. I am still experiencing this pain (Jan 11), but have somewhat managed it by taking Tums and eating alkaline foods.

On the way, the patient began to black out to the point where she had to lay down on the floor and could not regain strength for a few minutes and would have fallen over if sitting down and then laying down did not occur. A few minutes were spent laying down and then the episode went away and she was able to get up. She then walked back to her bed and did began to feel light headed, dizzy, and began blacking out again. The patient layed down in bed and waited for the episode to pass again.

My temp was 100.5 before Tylenol. I also experienced GI upset, nausea and diarrhea. The next day after my vaccine I am experiencing a migraine, body aches, a fever of 100.3 and nausea

                                                I had a slight headache the day of the vaccine, and some soreness in my arm. I woke up the next morning after not being able to sleep all night with a temperature of 101.7 Fahrenheit coupled with profuse sweating and a stabbing headache. I took some Tylenol and drank a bunch of water and tried to go back to sleep ( Inhad woken up at 5:30). I was unsuccessful because I ended up having to vomit about 20 minutes later. Throughout the day, my temperature hovered between 99.5-100.4 even though I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen. The symptoms persisted all day and I only started to feel relief around 7 pm. I feel fine today, but I still have a bit of a headache and my left arm is still sore.

                                                I received my vaccine while I was at work around 1400. Around midnight I woke up shivering and could not get warm. My heart rate was elevated but that could have been related to my anxiety. I layered clothing on and finally managed to sleep. Upon waking up around 6 the next morning, I had a temperature of 102, a sore throat, throbbing headache, and was vomiting. My arm was so sore and swollen that I could hardly touch it. After rest, Tylenol, and fluids, I felt better around 8 that evening.

                                                Immediate dizziness @ 10:00 AM, thought it was related to anxiety. Left after sitting for 20 minutes because I thought the &#34;anxiety&#34; would resolve best at home. Arrived home at 10:25 AM. My lips started itching, and then swelled along with my tongue. My throat felt tight and I tried to take an oral Benadryl. It got stuck in my throat and I was unable to swallow the pill. It was also difficult to swallow water. I arrived at the ED by 10:40 AM, where I was treated with IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol. I remained swollen all over, especially in my fingers, for the next 4 days. I gained 12 pounds, either from the reaction or the steroids. My airway did not fully close.

At work (noon), suddenly became very lightheaded, cold, sweaty,  experienced blackout vision around periphery and felt faint and nauseous. Threw up. Went home and had extreme chills and could not get warm. Nausea subsided around 6:00pm 1/27. Headache and neck soreness continues still today (1/30). Headache feels like pressure inside my head, pushing and causing dull pain at the base of my skull and top of neck.

A concerning side effect was that my resting HR was consistently above 105BPM from about 4:30AM-4PM the day after receiving the second dose. It reached as high as 125BPM without doing much movement at all to account for the high HR.

I fell asleep at about 8 pm because I was so fatigued I couldn?t keep my eyes open. Chills when I was trying to sleep. I was up a few times throughout the night sweating. The next morning I felt nauseous and had a bad headache and my body aches. I felt like this the whole next day and am still completely fatigued.

Taking an aspirin alleviated most of the symptoms to where I was more functional. I did call into work and skip a meeting the day after.

I developed hives on my forehead, cheeks, neck, chest, and arms. The fingers on both my hands and my lips were tingling.  Treatment: I was rushed to the ER and given an IV steroid, IV fluids (2 bags), and IV benadryl.   Outcome: All the reactions went away within 4 hours and I was discharged from the ER. I was advised to take benadryl for 48 hours afterwards as needed and given a 5 day course of prednisone; 2 tablets taken daily.

Headache, fatigue, dizziness, random spurts of sweating, and not wanting to eat anything. All started day after vaccine. I have taken Benadryl that helped significantly started taking on Friday(3/12/21). Lymph nodes are still swelling and injection area is starting to itch.

                                                Patient had what appeared to be a vasovagal reaction.  She complained of feeling light-headed and nauseous about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  This continued for a short time and she also began to complain of feeling chilled and was noticeably diaphoretic.  I monitored her blood pressure, which was low on the initial reading and then eventually came up to a reading of 89/60 with a pulse of 73 at the point that her symptoms began to subside.  By approximately 45 minutes after the episode began, she reported feeling better and was able to stand and walk without symptoms.  She went home at that time with a friend.

                                                Several hours after the shot, I began to feel very hot all over my face and body. I got very dry to the touch and I became extremely thirsty. I also had full body tremors. When I woke up the next morning (5/4) around 10 a.m., I had a fever, headache, and serious brain fog. My legs ached, especially my hips and knees. The intense thirst and dryness also persisted. I felt lightly nauseous on and off. I took an extra strength Tylenol and drank a lot of water before sleeping again until around 4 p.m.. Once I woke up, I was still suffering from all the aforementioned symptoms, but with less severity. I had another extra strength Tylenol and drank water and a sports drink. I ate a granola bar right after the Tylenol and started to feel a little better. Then I got really hungry, so I ate a muffin and drank an energy&#43; juice drink that had 80mg caffeine derived from green and black tea. I started to feel a lot better after that, though I was still weak and experiencing aching in my legs and hips. I took another nap from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and then ate once more before going to sleep for the night around 1:30 a.m. I have woken up today (5/5) with a slight headache but no other symptoms save the injection site soreness that has also persisted since a few hours after the shot. A note for comparison: as reported, this is my 2nd dose. My first dose had no symptoms whatsoever aside from injection site soreness.

                                                I had awful migraines that did NOT improve with Tylenol or Ibprophen.  My migraines had an aura to them on the 1/1/2021.  I was also nauseous and had a difficult time keeping food down.  I was also very tired and slept longer than I normally do.  I had my vaccine done on 12/30/2020 and the symptoms did not occur until 1/01/2021. An hour or so after the injection, my arm started to become sore. It was very sore until 1/3/2021. They lasted until 1/3/2021. Now I feel fine.

I woke up a little before 1030PM shaking with chills and nauseated. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night, going between sweating and shaking. The next day 1/6/21 I was still unwell, didn&#39;t go into work, felt weak and sore the whole day and noticed my underarm of the arm I received the shot was swollen and painful,. Today 1/7/21, my underarm is still painful and swollen, but the nausea has subsided. Still slightly going between sweating and being chilled.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

                                                Gradual onset of soreness beginning about an hour post-vaccine and worsening throughout day. By the evening, left arm pain was too uncomfortable to wash dishes and lift household objects. Pain woke me up at 3am that night and I could not push the covers off of me, dress or undress, and I experienced severe pain with slight movement (7/10). Nausea and cold sweats began around 5am and lasted for 45min. I contacted the nurse via messaging system and was told to take OTC nausea medicine and Tylenol. I took the maximum dosage for Tylenol that day but could not do my normal school functions. The next day I was still limited by pain but did not require medication to cope. By day three, I had full range of motion back and minimal pain. Day four I am back to exercising normally.

                                                I received the dose at 1:45 pm on 1/13/2021 at Medical Center. Almost 1 hour post vaccine I started to feel a lump in my throat, as the minutes passed my throat started to feel tighter and fight and flight mode kicked in.  It was hard to swallow, my tongue was swelling and I called EMS at 2:40 pm 1/13/2021.  EMS noticed hives on my chest and left arm where I got the first dose of Moderna.  I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

I went to the Emergency Department and got Prednisone, Pepcid, and Benadryl.  The next day, I started to experience tremors, mostly in my right hand.   Two days later, I was so dizzy that the room was spinning and I could hardly stand up. Did not receive treatment for it.

                                                At first, immediately after the vaccination I felt super sore in my right arm and fatigued. Then after a few days, it went away. Now on 01/16/2021, I started getting a cough, a sore throat, a  fever, and extremely tired. Then the next day the symptoms got worse and now I had a stuffy nose, inner ear pain, nausea, muscle aches all over my body, dizzyness, and chills. This continued into Sunday and now Monday.

                                                Patient only had muffin and coffee that day early in am. Had some arm pain after shot no other reaction.  Did go home felt some nausea . Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

                                                Immediately following the vaccine there was nausea after eating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain which lasted about 8 days. 9 days after receiving the vaccine the injection site area got itchy, hot and swollen. Redness appeared about an hour after icing the area down. Benadryl was taken within 30 minutes of symptoms starting and swelling did go down moderately, but redness and heat from area remained. Today being day 10 after the vaccine, the redness, swelling, hot temperature and itching are still present. The area is about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide. Redness is in the shape of a ring with the center of the swelling area being white and the outer edges being red. None of the symptoms have worsened since day 9 and self care with Benadryl and icing is being continued.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

At 10:30pm began to feel chills and body aches. 11:00pm  got very hot and sweaty, hands began to tingle, vision became fuzzy around the edges, felt like I was going to pass out. Experienced tachycardia, tachypnea, and headache. 12:20am- vomited. Restless sleep through the night, chills, fever (100.6-99.6 on Tylenol), body aches, joint pain, stomach ache, woke at 5:00am.  1/26- spent all day vomiting. At least once every hour. Continued tachycardia, tachypnea, stomach ache,  fever, headache, body aches,  and joint pain. At 7:00pm took Zofran and I stopped vomiting. Still nauseous. Could not eat all day.  1/27- woke up with headache and slight body aches but otherwise felt okay during the day. Was hungry and able to eat. Starting at 10:00pm my stomach began to hurt again. Experienced bloating, sharp stabbing pain and nausea. Felt like I needed to vomit or pass a bowel movement but could not do either. Took Zofran at 11:00pm, did not help in relieving my GI symptoms. Still on round-the-clock extra strength Tylenol. Could not eat all night.   1/28- woke up still with headache, and mild-moderate stomach pain.  Able to eat a couple bites of food.

Throughout the night arm pain got progressively worse and could not sleep due to extreme  pain and inability to move through range of motion, in addition to night sweats.  (did not have a fever). Woke up the next morning with a severe headache and nausea. Fainted around 10am (18 hours post vaccination). Headache and minor dizziness continued throughout the rest of the day.  By 24 hours post vaccine, no symptoms besides very minimal arm soreness.

I had really bad body aches and chills, to the point where I was shivering, even with three layers and a puffy coat on. I normally never get cold. I also had a really bad headache. By the time my shift was over at 1pm, I wasn?t even sure I could trust myself to drive home. Eventually I decided it was fine, but by the time I got home I felt so terrible that it took me at least 15 minutes to get out of the car. I took a hot shower and went to bed. I was shivering violently, even with lots of blankets, and couldn?t even sit up to drink some water. I laid in bed for hours, doing absolutely nothing and feeling miserable. I got up after 7:00 pm to eat some dinner and felt so nauseous that I was dry-heaving into the toilet.

                                                Moderate pain in injection site for first two days (02/02/2021, 02/03/2021). Nausea, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat, low-grade fever (~99°F) and persistent headache, and took Theraflu nighttime before bed on day two (02/03/2021). Temperature of 99.7°F throughout day three (02/04/2021); also, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat with swollen lymph nodes and tonsils with white spots (did at-home test for strep-A, got a negative result), and persistent headache?this night I also took Theraflu nighttime. Day 4 (02/05/2021), I woke up around 7AM  with severe nausea and went back to sleep after having ginger ale; throughout the early afternoon I had mild lower back and knee pain, same throat and tonsil situation, mild headache, and diarrhea. I ended up drinking a lot of water and had a glass of emergen-c as well as taking two pepto bismol tablets. Less than an hour later, I threw up everything I?d consumed throughout the day (water, hot tea, and emergen-c, no food due to nausea). Tried eating plain white rice and drinking  beer that evening but I couldn?t keep it down. Day 5 (today, 02/06/2022), I woke up with only lower back pain, same tonsil/throat situation, headache, and a slightly higher fever- 100.2°F. So far no nausea.

After 2nd shot on 02/06/21, I had most symptoms listed. I got the 2nd dose at 9:03am and once I woke up from a nap at 1pm, most of the side effects had already started. I had severe pain at the injection site where I was unable to dress myself or do normal activities, severe muscle pain and soreness, severe chills, a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, a mild headache, severe dehydration that remained throughout the day and night even though I drank almost 2 gallons of water, stomach pain and bloating, and nausea and vomiting that occurred in the middle of the night at 2am, and extreme fatigue. Even though I had fatigue, I was unable to sleep due to the pain. I finally took pain medicine at 8am on 2/07/21 to help myself go to sleep as well since I was awake for over 24 hours. I slept for 6 hours and woke up still having chills, muscle soreness, a slight fever, a mild headache, and pain at the injection site where I am still unable to lift my left arm and put clothes on.

The majority of these symptoms started around 12 hours after the vaccination, with fever, chills, headache and dizziness being the most prominent. Ibuprofen (200mg) was taken about 18 hours in (as was advised to only take within the first 24 hours). Most of the symptoms are gone now after 24 hours of vaccination and taking ibuprofen. While most other symptoms are gone, there is still continued fatigue, and slight headache and nausea.

For unknown reason the patient arrived to vaccine clinic on 2/9/21 without allergy skin testing or follow up. She reportedly told them that she was &#34;&#34;cleared by Occ health&#34;&#34; after her first reaction and the administering RN said that there was no flag on her chart so she was given the vaccine.  Unfortunately, immediately after she got it, she developed throat tightening and got zyrtec. The reaction progressed very quickly (minutes) to diaphoresis, panic, grabbing at throat saying she was suffocating, nausea, and difficulty verbalizing. She was diffusely red but no hives. They couldn&#39;t get a BP and O2 sat and temp were normal but they put her on a non-rebreather and gave her Epi. Rapid response was called and she was taken to the ED.

Arm was very sore, hot to the touch, and swollen for nearly 3 weeks following the injection.  Second shot on 3/5 R arm, also developed a small red rash but was smaller and went away within a week. Within 24 hours of getting the vaccine, a high fever developed, fatigue, weakness, nausea, pain throughout my body, and migraines.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

                                                I got the injection at 2:50PM. At 5PM, I did an allergic reaction to it: it started tickling in my mouth, I felt my lips and tongue were swelling, my throat was swelling too and I couldn&#39;t swallow anymore and started having difficulty breathing. As I am allergic to peanuts and already did similar reactions, I took my medication: 2 pills 10mg antihistamine and 2 pills of 20mg cortisone. The reaction stopped after I took the pills but by tongue remained a bit swollen for around 2-3 hours.

Some mild confusion and dizziness (though I have been experiencing cognitive issues for over a year now. I believe the fever is exasperating pre-existing symptoms). Some mild nausea and a mild headache. I am not completely back to normal yet (as of 7pm) but I do believe I will be fine as time goes on.

Concurrent medical conditions included Psoriasis. Concomitant products included USTEKINUMAB (STELARA) for Psoriasis.    On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced COELIAC ARTERY COMPRESSION SYNDROME (Celiac artery was compressed) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MALAISE (feeling sick) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VOMITING (did not stop throwing up) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and NAUSEA (nauseated) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, COELIAC ARTERY COMPRESSION SYNDROME (Celiac artery was compressed), MALAISE (feeling sick) and NAUSEA (nauseated) outcome was unknown and VOMITING (did not stop throwing up) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       She gave her stool sample on 12 Apr 2021 and result will take 1 to 2 weeks, she was still throwing up on and off and she was not 100% better. She took ondansetron to treat her vomiting and nausea. She was concerned if she can she take 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine and what would happen if she miss the time limit.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                A few days after vaccination I had a high fever and began coughing so hard that I was throwing up. This lasted for about a week, I then became short of breath and tacchychardic. I went to the ER and was admitted for 5 days where they said I had acute bronchitis that triggered reactive asthma. I?m now on steroids and a bunch of medication. This all followed my first dose of Moderna as I?ve never had breathing issues before hand. I?ve never had bronchitis or asthma in my life so this is all new. I am now experiencing nerve pain on my left side which is where I received the vaccine.

                                                awoke at 2 am  with nausea, chills, generalized pain. Immediately felt myself start to pass out or have a seizure- I am not sure which. Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

At 2 am on Saturday I took my temperature and it was 101.6 F, at 3 am it was 102 F. The body aches, joint pain, fever, and headache continued through the next day until about 6 pm on Saturday. Also on Saturday around 12 pm I began experiencing severe nausea, abdominal pain, and dizziness. At one point it felt as if I was going to pass out. All the major symptoms finally subsided Saturday night around 6 pm. Saturday till Sunday I have felt fatigued and sore but otherwise fine.

                                                On the morning of 1/8/2021 (exactly 6 days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine), I woke up with large hives concentrated mostly on my upper body (face, neck, chest, stomach). I tried taking various antihistamines (excluding Benadryl, which would later prove effective) to combat the hives, but they were largely ineffective. The hives shifted throughout the day, starting in my upper body and working their way down to my lower extremities. The next day, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I woke up with worse hives (now all over my body, mostly concentrated on my stomach, hips, and legs) and angioedema in my face. At this point, I went to the hospital and received a course of IV fluids/steroids/Benadryl/anti-nausea medication and all symptoms subsisted. Symptoms returned a few hours after discharge, where I continued an oral regimen of the aforementioned medications. The next day, 8 days after the initial dose, my symptoms were equally severe and coupled with gastrointestinal distress, feverishness (likely due to dehydration from the Benadryl) and nausea. This morning (1/11/2021), 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my hives have largely subsisted. In summation, starting 6 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced 3 full days and nights of severe hives and swelling.

These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

                                                After about two hours my arm pain was so intense it felt like it was nearly broken and continued to feel worse. I had EXTREME headache and nausea which nearly led to vomiting but kept having to hold it down while alternating between Advil and Tylenol and Tums just to feel a little relief. Pain medications did not help substantially for the first 36 hours. I felt bed bound , had no energy to even move to pick up the TV control a few feet away from me. I had SEVERE chills, and still have them nearly 56 hours out with the headache and nausea still prevalent . I had such bad body aches and dizziness. Have had a hard time getting sleep because of the intensity of my symptoms. Absolutely has been the worst ever and I would NEVER get this shot again. Y?all need to do better. This is completely unacceptable for this to be side effects experienced by people even if it?s less than 10% experiencing the severity I felt. This is so messed up on so many levels. I?m going into medicine myself and although I believe in vaccines, this is not one I will be advocating for until research gets it together and provides a vaccine that is safer for people to receive. Completely anxious and worried and scared as to how my next few days and weeks will go especially with how severe my side effects have been and the news articles showing how some people seem to be dying within hours or days of the Moderna and Pfizer shots. Unacceptable. I can?t believe the amount of fear for my life I have right now.

Took Tylenol but the fever continued to rise. By 12 noon it went up to 104. Contacted the immunologist on call   who prescribed antibiotics and took Naproxen with Celebrex 400 mg. Eventually by 9 pm or so the fever went down. Took Tylenol. In the middle of the night, I vomited. The next day started off with 99 and after taking another Tylenol, it did not come back. The headaches continued with fatigue for about 7-10 days. Currently working with the immunologist to figure out if I need to be pre medicated and post medicated before the 2nd shot.

                                                around 4AM of 01/06/21 (approximately 10 hours after receiving injection) I woke up with stomach cramps, feeling as if I needed to have a bowel movement which is extremely unusual at that hour. I went to the bathroom and ended up having extreme diarrhea. Went back to sleep, proceeded to wake up at 7am for work (I work at a hospital). Went to work, temperature upon arrival to work at 8am was 96.7. Didn&#39;t start to experience any other symptoms till around 10-11am. Developed a headache and thought, &#34;hm this is weird, I haven&#39;t had a headache since I had COVID but I hope it goes away soon.&#34; Then I went to lunch at noon and everything hit me all at the same time - freezing and sweating profusely, headache became so debilitating that it was burning/hurting my eyes, uncontrollably shaking, felt so weak (body aches all over, everything hurt). Took my temperature while I was at home for lunch and it was 101.5 and my heart rate was 160 (my heart rate is usually high because I take a stimulant but it is never that high). Went back to the hospital because I wanted to go to the ER and needed to get the rest of my belongings anyways. The ER physician and staff found the same things when doing initial vitals - high fever and heart rate. I made the ER physician aware of the fact that I had just received the vaccine the night before while also just having had COVID less than one month prior. I was instructed to go home at that point to get rest and recover. For the rest of the day on 01/6/21 and all of 01/7/21 I had to take off work because of adverse symptoms and effects. For all of 01/7/21 I was extremely fatigued and the headache never went away until 01/08/21.  On 01/08/21 I returned to work and symptoms diminished.

After this I noticed I would get stomach pain intermittently. This has not gone away yet (today&#39;s date is 1/28/20). The stomach pain has been intermittent, not related to certain foods, and hurts sometimes when I don&#39;t even eat. It has progressed into getting severely bloated every time I eat any foods. The bloating lasts ~1-2 hours after consumption. No matter how big or small the meal or snack is, or what the food is, it results in me being bloated.

Patient states she received the first dose of the Maderna vaccine in her left arm around 0910 hours this morning. Patient waited 15 minutes afterwards and within 30 minutes was back working in the trauma unit. However, she suddenly began to experience nausea, chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath, throat tightness, light headed, and overall shaky. Patient states she further went down to the vaccine clinic to inform them of her symptoms in which she was prompted to come to the ED for evaluation. She was not given an Epi pen prior to arrival. Patient reports overall feeling better now with only continued tingling in her tongue and fingers, as well as feeling mildly light headed. Patient also states her throat continues to feel tight, but denies any throat swelling. Chest tightness and palpitations have since improved, only with occasional flutters in her chest similar when feeling excited. Denies nausea, rash, itchy skin, or abdominal pain. No history of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions. Patient is prescribed Nexium, but denies taking any other daily medications.  Physical exam shows to be unremarkable with no rash or throat swelling/erythema. Patient does not appear in respiratory distress. Lung sounds are clear.   Will order an EKG. Will administer IV Epipen and IV Benadryl.   Differentials: Allergic Reaction   EKG shows NSR with sinus arrhythmia. Otherwise normal with a rate of 87 bpm.

Flu like symptoms starting that evening (unsure what time, as I was trying to sleep). Arm soreness where I received the vaccine, muscle aches that kept waking me up throughout the night, headache, fever, slight congestion, chills and sweating, nausea, dizziness when I stand up, fatigue. As of 4:00 PM on 1/29 (the day after the vaccine) I am still experiencing this list of flu-like symptoms.

This lump is still present on 2/1 and is planned to be checked as a precautionary measure by my PCP on 2/3.

                                                I received my vaccine at 9 am 02/01/21 and felt exhausted that evening. My arm of injection, was extremely sore and it was hard to sleep. I had chills and night sweats and woke up with my heart racing at 150 bpm. My resting heart rate is usually 90-100. When I finally got up to go to work, I felt dizzy and completely off balance, bumping into walls.  I  feel extremely nauseous, weak and have a migraine.

My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

                                                I had a headache, extreme fatigue, nausea, aches, fever, and chills for 24 hours beginning at 8:00pm the day that I received the vaccine. I had a burning sensation and lypmhadenopathy in the armpit of my injection arm, significant pain at injection site, with slight tingling and numbness radiating down to the hand of my injection arm as well. I took 1,000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours for 24 hours, which provided minimal symptom relief. All symtpoms were relived within 72 hours of receiving the vaccine.

                                                Monday morning woke up with arm soreness, headache, fatigue and feeling slightly warm. After a few hours, and a nap, I had a fever of 101.9 along with chills, severe fatigue and severe nausea.  After a 2 more hours my fever raised to 103.3, I had muscle cramping in my legs, nausea, headache and fatigue.  All of those symptoms lasted until 9pm that night when the fever resolved.  The following day I still had slight warmness, a temperature of 99 and headache, chills and fatigue/weakness.  All of those symptoms, continued until Thursday evening.  On Friday morning I woke up with no headache (only mild intermittent head pains), mild fatigue and arm soreness.  Every day this week my heartrate has been higher than normal with the average rate around 120-130BPM. This was at rest, without any caffeine or other stimulants.  I took alternating tylenol (1000mg) and ibuprofen (800mg) all 4 days.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

Normal for me is between 80-100 bpm. My heart rate remained high (between 120-140 bpm) for about 6 hours. I did not notice it go down to 100bpm until the next day. The high heart rate was never provoked by any physical activity. I rested in bed or in a chair all day and drank lots of water. Throughout the day I had fluctuating periods of feeling very hot and very cold. I took 1000mg of Tylenol every 4 hours throughout the day.  I also experienced expected side effects (chills, joint aches, muscle aches, nausea, headache, fever (100F w/ Tylenol)).

                                                I had on-and-off insomnia starting around 10pm. I woke up every thirty minutes on the minute with a feeling like there was a fifty pound vest on my body.  At 3:30, I felt nauseous. I walked from my bedroom to downstairs to the kitchen. My knees buckled several times en route. When I ate one bite of a protein bar, my nausea increased tenfold. I ask drank water at the time.   I walked back upstairs to my room to sleep where remained awake until ~five am. I slept from ~five am until approximately 8:10am. I felt faint as I walked into the bathroom where I felt my faintness increase by the second. My knees buckled and I passed out on the bathroom floor tile for ~five - ten seconds. I payed there for a few minutes until I felt stable to stand.   This morning, 45 hours after the injection and 22 hours after blacking out, I felt a goose egg on the back of my head. It has hurt all day at a level 4/10 on the pain scale.

                                                The first vaccine I only had mild arm pain which went away after a few days, exactly 7 days later I had a delayed localized reaction (extreme swelling size of a golf ball, redness, itching, hot to the touch). I spoke with my primary and he recommended to still get the second vaccine. The second vaccine the swelling came on almost immediately (about 2 hours after). It has now been two days since I have had the shot and my arm is now double the size of my muscle. (I am petite, 5?3 and 107 lbs) so my arms are tiny. My arm is red, hot to the touch, swollen and itchy. I have had a fever of 102.8, the lowest I have gotten it down is 101.2 with around the clock Tylenol. Other side effects: vomiting, chills, high fever, EXTREME joint pain. I?m concerned about the localized reaction (I would call it localized allergic reaction). I have photos I?m not sure if I can send them.

I woke up on the floor (syncope), ran to the bathroom and started vomiting. I do not know how long I was unconscious for.

I woke up super nauseous at 4:00am and quickly vomited afterwards. From there on I slept for 10-30 minutes in between vomiting for 3 hours. Afterwards the chills and extreme nauseous feeling didn&#39;t leave until the 3rd day after the shot.

                                                Patient  came to the center for a Moderna vaccine at 5pm. The patient expressed that she felt dizzy shortly after immunization (before leaving the immunization chair). Her head began to fall backwards so I quickly supported the patient&#39;s head and neck area and was able to keep her from falling out of her chair. The patient fainted but regained consciousness approximately 3 seconds later. The patient came back alert but nauseous. The patient vomited in a trashcan and then felt fine. The patient blamed the reaction on her severe anxiety and said the exact same thing happened after a nose piercing. I observed the patient for 30 minutes and sent her on her way. The patient left healthy and happy. I told the patient to warn the pharmacist prior to receiving her second dose. No drugs were administered. Written up in SCRT and VAERS. I followed up with the patient at 7 pm and she was home safe.

Patient&#39;s last test for Covid-19 was on Monday (26-Apr-2021) and results came back negative on 28-Apr-2021. Company comment: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and nausea are consistent with the product established safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol.

Later in the day I took my temperature and had a fever of 101, my fever later broke after taking Tylenol and NyQuil. The next day, Saturday, my lymph node in the left armpit was so swollen I could not wear a shirt. My nausea continued but I no longer had a fever. My lymph node continued to be swollen until Monday. On Monday I woke up with a rash on the left side of my chest, small red dots and this resolved by the end of the day.

She took a photo of this and showed it to me today and well. The swelling around the eyes seemed minimal. Her lips were swollen. She also notes that she felt tired and had a mild shortness of breath where she felt more comfortable sitting up. She states these symptoms have somewhat improved, though she has been experiencing increasing nausea since yesterday and continues to feel that way. She states that she does not believe she is pregnant, she has an IUD. She also noticed some body aches yesterday, continuing this morning, but they seem to be improving. They do improve greatly with ibuprofen at home.

Unsure of exact vaccination date and onset of symptoms.  really having to focus to place hands under water to wash them, walking through doors without bumping into them, turning on faucet, getting dressed; left hand is worse than right and not able to easily align things properly;  &#34;feels like her brain isn&#39;t doing what she&#39;s telling it to do&#34;.  Aunt said the symptoms are not improving. Patient had tested negative for Covid the day she got the vaccine.

                                                Arm became incredibly sore about 4 hours after injection.  The soreness was so intense that I felt nauseous when I moved my arm or bumped the injection site. About 11 hours after the injection a severe headache began. Roughly 19 hours after the injection muscle fatigue and overall tiredness began, headache remained as well as arm soreness. About 30 hours after the injection all the symptoms above were present in addition to a fever. Currently it is about 54 hours after the injection and only a slight headache and slight arm soreness remain.

She had to lay down on the floor immediately to avoid losing consciousness. For the next 2 hours, she experienced nausea and faintness when standing for more than 30 seconds. After those 2 hours she no longer experienced these symptoms, and she developed a fever and flu-like symptoms for 36 hours.

These symptoms continued through the night and into the next day with periods of feeling extremely hot and sweating and having chills like ice and sweating.

                                                The staff from another of our own company facility had come for getting vaccinated at this Clinic. After around 15 minutes or so after vaccination, she was feeling little light headed, and nauseating and tried throwing up during the observation period as per protocol after vaccination. We advised her to stay longer and  as precaution, we reached out to our facility, who advised to observe her for some more time and if she does not feel better, she can go to Urgent care accompanied by someone. We gave her Gatorade and after around 40-45 minutes she was feeling better and someone from her family came to pick her up. She did not wanted to go to Urgent Care at that time but we advised her if she does not feel good, she should go to Urgent Care.

BS was checked and was low so I was given crackers and a sprite. I was severly nauseaed and HR elevated to 150 with SOB associated and was like that off and on for about 30 minutes which prompted EMS to be called to come check me out and was transported to the ED.  I was given fluids and my lab work showed I was deydrated. UA neg, Triponin-neg, EKG-tackycardia and they symptoms deminished on its on after about 4-5 hours and I was released from the ED.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

After about an hour of this, severe projectile vomiting occurred multiple times throughout the next two hours. Paramedics came, vitals were normal. Ended up going to sleep, but woke up with a headache.

                                                Approximately five minutes after receiving the shot, I began to feel a burst of pain rush through my entire left arm. A few seconds afterwards, I started to feel nauseated. Immediately, I felt weak, light-headed, and tired. I began to sweat profusely, as well. I could barely move my arm to flag down one of attendants who was monitoring us. She asked me what was wrong, and I tried to describe what was going on, but I could barely talk or keep my eyes open. She radioed for help and the paramedics came over to me. They wanted to move me to a private room and asked if I could walk. I tried to walk there, but I started to fall so one of the paramedics hoisted me up to help me. They asked me some questions will they were waiting for a stretcher, all of which I could hear and understand, but I was unable to response to. The stretcher came and I laid down, but I was already starting to feel better by then. I was very out of it, but I think this entire process took maybe 10-15 minutes. I laid there for maybe another 15 minutes, and I began to be able to talk again and open my eyes. I tried sitting up and that went alright. I answered some questions for them while they took my blood pressure, monitored my pulse, and took my temperature. After another 15 minutes or so, I felt well enough to walk back to my office in the Health Department. I didn&#39;t have any other problems for the rest of the day.

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

My 9pm I felt dizzy, had a headache, and started feeling nauseous  I took some Tylenol and ibuprofen and a snack (can?t take it on an empty stomach when nauseous  Was able to fall sleep but woke up at 2am very shaky, nauseous, and with extreme joint pain. I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

And then it lessened so I could use it but still pain for three or four days. Redness on injection site - just a big, red spot (not rash). Red spot went away and then a big white spot - six days for white spots. Almost like my arm wasn&#39;t getting blood - just white like that for a few days. Headache - still have it - minor enough when I wake up but when I go to bed that every other day I&#39;m still taking medicine for it; nausea; fever; chills; hot flashes - lasted 5 or six days; fatigue - still have a little fatigue. It is better than it was. At first I was sleeping 15-16 hours a day. Still have to go to bed earlier than normal. Stomach pain - those are gone now; runny nose; loss of appetite; brain fog - I knew what I wanted to say or do but couldn&#39;t. Advil was taken and I tried Tylenol, too. I iced my arm. I did a humidifier.

                                                Arm pain developed throughout the day starting 4 hours post vaccination administration. That pain then spread to my upper back alongside a mild headache. I was otherwise well until 12.5 hours post the vaccine where I developed fever and debilitating chills which went on for the remainder of the night. I had full body aches and immense pain in my arm, and kind of a stiffness all over my body accompanied by fatigue which may just be due to the lack of restful sleep I obtained. I also had a loss of appetite. I took 2 advil the next moring and felt better within 2 hours and regained my appetite. The sweating from what I presume to be fever still hadn&#39;t subsided nor had the chills. I would say within 36 hours all that remains is mild arm pain.

The injection site was hot, hard and quite painful (I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body for three nights). I felt generally unwell and achy. After about three days all of my symptoms went down and most of them were gone except for I could still feel a small amount of swelling under the skin that continued to go down. On Tuesday Feb 10, almost a week out I started to experience an itching feeling that increased throughout the day to a deep itch that feels like it goes down to my bone. The injection site has become red, hot and hard again and the lymph node in my left armpit is extremely painful and swollen. I feel dizzy and nauseous.

                                                My arm started hurting very bad after about 2-3 hours. At the 12 hour mark from my vaccine (11:30PM), I started to have chills, a fever, and feel nauseous. Around 1 AM I started to vomit and this occurred for about 15 minutes, and then repeated again about an hour later. By the morning of the day after I was no longer vomiting or had chills but still had a fever. The most prominent symptoms on the day after my vaccine were extreme body aches and horrible joint pain. My hands and feet felt swollen and stiff. I had terrible pains and aches in my whole entire body. I was also very tired and still had a low grade fever. On the second day after the vaccine I had bad chest and neck pain and started to have a mild cough. By the third day after the vaccine, the chest pain was gone but still had bad neck pain and a headache that radiated through my skull.

By day 1 after the vaccine I also had hives and a rash at the injection site. A week after my second dose, I also had more hives pop up on my face and a bit at the injection site. And every few weeks, I have a few come up at the injection site and on my face, and then they go away.

The sleep aid did not help as I only slept a few hours but could not stay asleep due to the pain. I woke up at 7 AM to feed my cat, then tried to lay back down, but was unable to. I went to the toilet feeling nauseous and wretched a few times but did not throw up. I did, however, experience diarrhea that morning and throughout the day. I laid down on the couch and fell in and out of sleep for a few hours. I felt the headache most of the morning, until about 11 AM,. I felt the chills throughout most of the day. I treated my pain with ibuprofen 200mg tablets (3 taken each time, 4-6 hours apart), Pepto-bismol for the nausea and had mostly liquids such as water and juice as well as bread and crackers. I felt much better by around 2 PM, except for the tenderness and swelling in my arm.

                                                Initially sore arm and chills around 8pm. Around 2 am notes Fever, chills, body aches all over, a killer headache, nausea and I could not stay asleep. I took 2 extra strength Tylenol at that time, put an ice pack on my forehead, and drank a Pedialyte.   In addition to those, at about 4 I had ringing in my left ear and then lost the hearing in it. I just went to bed. When I woke up, around 10am on Friday, I could hear, but super dizzy. I couldn?t really walk without  feeling like I?m going to fall over, especially with turns. All symptoms continued throughout all of Friday.  I continued to take the Tylenol per the instructions on the bottle with my last dose around 5pm, I also drank 3 more pedialytes throughout the day in addition to plenty of other fluids. Took a warm shower around 7PM which seemed to help some with body aches and chills, however, dizziness/vertigo remained.  Saturday I woke up several times drenched in sweat. Around 9am my fever was gone. Still feeling a little ?off? in terms of balance/vertigo but nothing compared to Friday.  Slight body aches remain. Other symptoms gone.

It felt like my heart is overworking itself even though I am just sitting still on the computer. Other side effects were headache, nausea, and chills. Noticed my heart rate was fast during the 15 minute observatory period at the facility but assumed it was from the adrenaline &#43; fear of needles. By the twelve hour mark, heart &#43; chest no longer hurt and most side effects were gone.

                                                Pt received 2nd COVID vaccination at 1024. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have dropped her water bottle and become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, she was noted to have moderate pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. Her head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. Pt noted to have some muscular rigidity and not verbally responsive. Another provider advised to call 911 due to unresponsiveness and seizure-like activity. 911 called @1027, meanwhile pt lifted and placed into a wheelchair and moved to treatment area where vitals were obtained, patient became verbally responsive @1034, responses/speech was clear but slow, pt was oriented to self, place, time and situation. Oxygen applied via facemask @4L. Pt provided staff with phone number to call her mother who was notified of daughter&#39;s condition @1032. FD Engine arrival @1033 report given and pt also became more responsive, eyes opened and stated clearly that she was feeling better. Pt color also improved. Pt denied any allergies, PMH or hx of seizure activity. Pt only reported a syncope many years ago. Ambulance arrival @1036, report provided to emergency staff and pt taken to ambulance for further evaluation @1039. Pt returned to vaccine clinic @1052, having declined ambulance transport. When asked about events, pt stated that upon sitting down she felt a sudden onset of moderate nausea and reached for her water bottle in her bookbag, pt states she could not recall or hear anything until she was moved to wheelchair, and did not recall how she came to be in the observation area (based on this information, suspected time unconscious was approx 6-12 seconds). Pt was educated regarding the many causes of syncope and the neccesity for further evaluation in the Emergency department. Pt discouraged from driving herself from the clinic and was able to obtain ride from her roommate. Pt urged again to obtain a ride to the hospital for further evaluation, understanding verbalized and agreed with plan of care.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I noticed extreme tiredness and light headedness. I got up to notify staff and my vision went and I began to feel nauseated. They helped me to a seat and I began sweating profusely and the nausea intensified. After several minutes the nausea and vision changes subsided and I continued to feel extremely tired and light headed.  The staff put a heart rate monitor on me and I saw that my heart rate was sitting around 38-42. I felt like I just wanted to close my eyes but the staff kept asking me questions. After several more minutes a cop arrived. Later on an ambulance arrived and when they put the blood pressure cuff on I noticed tingling in my hand from it. I continued to feel light headed and extremely tired through arriving at the hospital via ambulance around 10:30am. These symptoms gradually subsided throughout the afternoon leaving me with light headedness  only when walking or moving around. While at the hospital they did an EKG which showed inverted T waves (from what I remember of the PA&#39;s description) and so admitted me for observation and performed an echo which came back normal. I was discharged around 10pm on the same night.

On that day, my body felt very cold and did not get sleep at that night. Saturday morning, my head was dizzy and no appetite. But took some meal around 9.30 a.m. Then I started vomiting from  12 p.m. to 3 p.m. several times. My whole body was dizzy and tired for a whole day.

Fever lasted from about 10 pm to 3 pm the following day and then stopped, without the use of medicine. However, the fever and aches later came back that night (3/20, the day after vaccination) at around 10 pm.  Vomiting: Certainly the effect that caught me most off guard. Vomiting lasted from 4:30 pm on 3/20 (day after vaccination) until 7:30 pm that same day. I vomited 5 times in this time span, and was quite nauseous for about an hour or two before the vomiting began. No medicine relieved this effect.  Headache: Came and went with the fever. Not too terrible.  Sore arm: lasted for about 30 hours after the injection.

Diarrhea has persisted since hours after the vaccine, almost a month later including painful stomach cramping. These gastrointestinal symptoms were not present beforehand and appeared at the same time as the other side effect but the GI issues have not resolved or even lessened. I may need to seek medica attention if it persists.

A law enforcement officer witnessed her becoming faint and ran over to attend her. I was called over to assess her as well. The law enforcement officer called EMS. The patient stated that she felt faint, dizzy, she said she had a headache, blurry vision, and was nauseous. The patient appeared sweaty and she appeared to loose consciousness briefly twice. She did not show any signs of redness, rash, or swelling. After sitting for a few minutes, and before EMS arrived, the patient said she was improving. She did not lose consciousness anymore but she still had a headache, nausea, and blurry vision. When EMS arrived they recommended that she get checked out at the emergency room, but the patient refused stating that she did not want to go to the hospital and that she was feeling better. The patient called her parents and they came and picked her up.
