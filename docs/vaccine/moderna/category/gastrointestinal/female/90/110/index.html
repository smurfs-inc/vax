                                                arrhythmias; rapid heartbeat; slight nausea; slight headache; light bothered vision for some days; mild chills; A spontaneous report was received from a retired nurse concerning herself who is 90 year old received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and have experienced arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, some visual problems (light bothered her for some days) and mild chills.  The patient has prior history of irregular heart beat . Her relevant concomitant medications were cholesterol medication, Crestor and medication for irregular heartbeat. No information on allergies.   On 28-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received her first of two planned doses of COVID-19 vaccine intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30-JAN-2021, 2 days after her vaccination, she developed arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, some visual problems (light bothered her for some days) and mild chills. After one week she felt like no more symptoms ongoing and felt good again. She visited her physician for arrhythmias, and he said, she should keep an eye on it, but no medication yet. She is concerned about her second shot.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was not reported.  The outcome of the events, arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, visual problems and chills were resolved at the time of report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of irregular heart beat are considered risk factors for arrhythmias.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (left-arm), my mother began to have moderate pain in her left arm, particularly in the left shoulder area. The pain continued to increase throughout the afternoon, until it became so severe (10 on a 10-point pain scale) by 8:30 pm on 3/10/21 , that she could no longer lift her arm. She took 500 mg of Tylenol to attempt to relive the pain and went to bed early.   At 2:45 am on 3/11/21, she needed to go to the restroom, and I (daughter) had to assist her to get out of bed, as she had no use of her left arm due to severe pain in that arm. While seated on the toilet, she indicated that her arm was extremely painful and she felt that she was going to pass out and felt nauseated. Within a minute, she lost consciousness and  I called emergency services. EMT arrived within 5 minutes and stated that her blood pressure was extremely low and she needed to be placed on the floor.  They placed her on a gurney and took her to the ambulance, where they started an IV and took her to her local hospital.  I followed shortly thereafter, where she was taken to the ER. She was admitted to the hospital for observation and given Ativan (she refused any opioids) She was ultimately diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the pain in her left arm. Two days later, the pain has subsided.

                                                nausea; takes an anticoagulant; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 94-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced nausea and contraindicated product administered.

                                                Patient became lethargic, extremely tired, unable to care well for self.  Patient had no appetite, refused most food and spent many hours simply sitting in her chair.  She felt that she was having a heart attack and called 911 using her emergency response button on 2/21/2021.  Doctors indicated that the patient&#39;s life was in serious danger, but because of age they were hesitant to try to remove the clot pressing on her heart.  She was only allowed to go back home because we utilized Hospice.  When asked about her life expectancy, we were told she could die any minute or might live a few more months, but that she was not expected to live much longer.  SHE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH PRIOR TO THE IMMUNIZATION!
