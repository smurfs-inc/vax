The patient has prior history of irregular heart beat . Her relevant concomitant medications were cholesterol medication, Crestor and medication for irregular heartbeat. No information on allergies.   On 28-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received her first of two planned doses of COVID-19 vaccine intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30-JAN-2021, 2 days after her vaccination, she developed arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, some visual problems (light bothered her for some days) and mild chills. After one week she felt like no more symptoms ongoing and felt good again. She visited her physician for arrhythmias, and he said, she should keep an eye on it, but no medication yet. She is concerned about her second shot.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was not reported.  The outcome of the events, arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, visual problems and chills were resolved at the time of report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of irregular heart beat are considered risk factors for arrhythmias.

Did not go to hospital because of virus cases being there. Vomited 1 time about 3 hours after I woke up. Second day was much better but extremely tired.Third day was back to normal but body very tired. Back to normal now.  Will I have this with second shot???

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (left-arm), my mother began to have moderate pain in her left arm, particularly in the left shoulder area. The pain continued to increase throughout the afternoon, until it became so severe (10 on a 10-point pain scale) by 8:30 pm on 3/10/21 , that she could no longer lift her arm. She took 500 mg of Tylenol to attempt to relive the pain and went to bed early.   At 2:45 am on 3/11/21, she needed to go to the restroom, and I (daughter) had to assist her to get out of bed, as she had no use of her left arm due to severe pain in that arm. While seated on the toilet, she indicated that her arm was extremely painful and she felt that she was going to pass out and felt nauseated. Within a minute, she lost consciousness and  I called emergency services. EMT arrived within 5 minutes and stated that her blood pressure was extremely low and she needed to be placed on the floor.  They placed her on a gurney and took her to the ambulance, where they started an IV and took her to her local hospital.  I followed shortly thereafter, where she was taken to the ER. She was admitted to the hospital for observation and given Ativan (she refused any opioids) She was ultimately diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the pain in her left arm. Two days later, the pain has subsided.

She went to bed for a whole day and then slept the following day.  It is still going on but not quite as bad, very tired.  The arm was a little sore the night of the vaccine, but when she started using the arm the feeling left.  Did have some soreness for a couple of nights.  She can still hardly eat, but her stomach feels better.  She has the bad feeling where she cannot eat but a few bites as she gets nauseated then.  She has not taken anything for her symptoms.  She is just not feeling well at all as if you don&#39;t want to be out of bed.  It&#39;s a big struggle for her to get up and get her something to eat.  Something that she doesn&#39;t have to cook.

                                                Two weeks after the vaccine I had symptoms of a Stomach Virus with vomiting and diarrhea. My daughter had the same symptoms for two days on the two days before mine. I was given medication and recovered. About four weeks after the second dose I was experiencing constipation. After four days of abdominal pain we went to the ER. I was diagnosed with an impacted bowel. We don&#39;t know if was caused by the previous medication for the stomach problems. I was discharged after a few hours and it resolved at home.

                                                nausea; takes an anticoagulant; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 94-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced nausea and contraindicated product administered.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medications included warfarin.  On 24-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot unknown)  in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 25-Jan-2021, the patient experienced nausea.  No treatment information was provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, nausea, was unknown.  The outcome of the event, contraindicated product administered, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 94-year old female patient who received mRNA-1273 and experienced non-serious event nausea and contraindicated product administered. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of nausea, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. The event contraindicated product administered is assessed as not applicable.

                                                My mom received her first Moderna Vaccine on 1/22/21. Late on 1/23 her face began to swell so the staff called the ambulance to come take her to the hospital for what they thought was an abscessed tooth. ER doctor said there was an infection and that she needed to be seen by an oral surgeon. On 1/25/21 I took my mom to Dr., her oral surgeon and after the examination he advised that there was no abscess but an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. He suggested Benadryl. I gave her benadryl and the swelling started subsiding. From this point on her gums and teeth hurt. Her eating habits started to decline. She received her 2nd Moderna vaccine on 2/19/21 and from that point on she could no longer chew or brush her teeth because the pain was so severe. She passed on 3/19/21.

They took her to hospital where the family reports she was diagnosed with bowel obstruction.

                                                About an hour after receiving her 2nd dose, she went to a restaurant and ordered her favorite shredded beef burrito. After only a few bites, she experienced non-stop &#34;burping&#34; and swallowing any liquid became impossible. We were at a useless ER hospital from 2-6 pm when they finally saw her and said they did NOT have any means of looking down her throat.  Long story short -- the next day I drove her to another Hospital. We were there from 2-8 p.m. The Dr. removed a bolus at 7:15 p.m. - 7:45 p.m. and he said &#34;everything looks good&#34;. HOWEVER -- my mom continued having &#34;esophagus&#34; issues from that time on. And ALSO, on April 4, she told me, &#34;I don&#39;t feel good&#34; and she proceeded to fall asleep on her couch and did NOT WAKE UP for about 6 weeks except to use the bathroom, take her morning and evening pills and eat a tiny bit of soft foods. I can&#39;t think of any other reason for this bizarre &#34;sleeping&#34; except for that 2nd Covid shot. I&#39;ve taken her tour GP 2 times since then and all blood work comes back normal. And a few visits to the ER within the last 3 months only showed  she&#39;s had another UTI within 6 weeks  and her swollen lower legs/feet can only be cured with lack of gravity. Weeks ago I took her to her annual checkup with her heart doctor and he said her blood pressure was on track. So as of today, I am waiting a call-back from hospice to see if I can get someone to help me with her bathing, etc. at home. Just wanted to tell somebody that since her second dose of Moderna Covid vaccine, it&#39;s been downhill for her and it&#39;s hard for me to believe the cause can be anything other than that 2nd vaccine.

Pt. proceeded to have significant fall on 6/10. She was ultimately BIBA to the ED on 6/19 with concerns for altered mental status and failure to thrive. She was found to have a significant saccular aneurysm  of the descending thoracic aorta. Ultimate outcome of aneurysm is still pending, as this is a life-threatening disorder.

Nearly everyone in the retirement home was extremely ill after the second dose; most of the administrative staff went home sick; skeleton crew pulled double shifts caring for residents with extreme &#34;blow-out&#34; diarrhea and debilitating nausea. One patient reported temporary paralysis. Men complained of sore arms but women couldn&#39;t get out of bed. We were prepared with prophylactic anti-emetic meds and avoided diarrhea. However, patient had headaches and nausea for a week; refusal to eat/drink put patient at risk for dehydration and kidney issues; fasting  exacerbated confusion and put patient at risk of harm (wandering, falling, etc.) Patient is still lethargic and confused, has started eating again but only minimally, a few bites. Strongly regret vaccinating.

                                                This patient has been under hospice care for over 2 years at the nursing home. She has had a steady decline with gradual weight loss. She was totally dependent in her care needs. She received the vaccine on 1/2/2021 as part of the facility vaccination campaign. No adverse events noted initially. On 1/3/2021 at 6:06 pm, she was noted on vital sign checks (done every 4 hours for first 72 hours after vaccination) with BP 64/52 but otherwise asymptomatic. Subsequent BP improved. On 1/4/2021 at 4:45 am, pt found with respiratory rate of 30 with otherwise normal vital signs. Tachypnea persisted, so she received liquid morphine 2.5 mg without improvement. Supplemental oxygen was applied. Tachypnea persisted. She had poor oral intake after that point had persistent tachypnea and worsening hypoxemia despite clear lungs on exam. She remained under hospice care and comfort measures were continued. No blood testing or imaging tests were done.

                                                Patient became lethargic, extremely tired, unable to care well for self.  Patient had no appetite, refused most food and spent many hours simply sitting in her chair.  She felt that she was having a heart attack and called 911 using her emergency response button on 2/21/2021.  Doctors indicated that the patient&#39;s life was in serious danger, but because of age they were hesitant to try to remove the clot pressing on her heart.  She was only allowed to go back home because we utilized Hospice.  When asked about her life expectancy, we were told she could die any minute or might live a few more months, but that she was not expected to live much longer.  SHE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH PRIOR TO THE IMMUNIZATION!
