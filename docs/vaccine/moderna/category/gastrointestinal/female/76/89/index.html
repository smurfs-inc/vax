The symptoms I&#39;ve had from the shot are pretty much the same as when I was sick.  I was fortunate not to have any respiratory symptoms either time as confirmed by my oximeter.  I had two Antibody tests.  One on Nov. 23rd, which was positive for both  IgG and IgM.  I had my second anti-body test on 1/17/2021, the day of my injection which was positive for IgG and negative for IgM.  I have not contacted my doctor concerning this and I am taking Advil for the fever and ached and pains.  Today i feel better than yesterday.

                                                VACCINE received on Friday 1/15/2021 afternoon; Monday evening 1/18/2021 felt slight chills; early to bed. Tuesday AM awoke with severe &#39;bed-rocking&#39; chills, nausea and fever 100-101 degrees. recommended I go to Hospital ER.  At ER, temperature increased to 102 degrees.  Covid test was negative, but cost X-ray showed reasons to suspect pneumonia. No one suggested I was just suffering acute reaction to vaccine.  Returned home w/ prescription for doxycycline hyclate and request that I return to the ER the next day if I continued to feel ill.  The next morning, 1/19/21, I again awoke with intense, somewhat frightening chills, vomiting and a mild fever.  As instructed I returned to the ER.  Assuming the COVID Test may have been a false negative, a second one was given; it too turned out to be negative, but I remained at the ER and then admitted to Hospital to remain under observation.  Im the hospital the chills, nausea and fever came to an end, but acute headache and utter fatigue lasted until I was released on Jan 22.  My discharge papers indicated no further signs of pneumonia or any other infection; my attending doctor, concluded that my experience was an unusually strong (and delayed) reaction to the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine.

I took a baby aspirin because I was afraid I was having a stroke. This lasted about 5 hours. Then I developed a head ache just behind my nose. The headache subsided in the mid afternoon, but I was wiped out and slept most of the day. Today (the next morning) I feel fine, just a little tired.

The patient was still shaken, the next morning.

                                                My arm wasn&#39;t sore right away but I think I laid on it and the next morning it was sore. It felt like a bee sting I took some medicine and it went away.  On the 27th I had bad gas. I did try a new cereal and thought it was cereal. On the 28th I still gas and upset stomach like flu like symptoms  and felt light headed but not bad. On the 29th still an upset stomach and had diarrhea, I was still light headed and really shaky. I was really weak. I was shaking a lot at arms (hands) and legs were both shaking  and made it hard to walk. On the 30th I still really light headed and my legs and hands were still shaky, still having difficulty walking, still had an upset stomach and still felt weak. On the 31st my stomach was a lot better, I was still shaky and light headed, and I had a weak feeling. My head felt like when you feel like you have a head cold (pressure in my head). Today my stomach is better, I am still lightheaded and still shaky but not as bad. I still feel pressure in my head, but no runny nose or any other cold symptoms.   These were symptoms I had in March when I was sick for 3 weeks. I was negative for COVID but didn&#39;t get back to my normal self until the June.   Doctor was a private practice and recently closed so I do not see my new doctor till the 24th.

                                                Woke up and started vomiting around 11:30 that night(2/5.)  This lasted approximately 1-2 hours.  Was unable to eat anything  until late afternoon on Sat. the 6th.  Had a bad headache throughout and bad soreness at the injection site.  Still have headache (approx. 5pm on Mon. 2/8) but soreness at injection site has almost disappeared.  I do not have a primary physician so have not called anyone. Am now taking Advil for headache which helps but it returns if I stop.

I went to back to bed and slept most of the day. I was really cold and fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. I took some Tylenol. I woke up about 3:30 AM Saturday and my back, arms and my head were all hurting and I took some Tylenol and went back to bed. I woke up about 6AM and was covered in sweat.  I didn&#39;t want to do anything Saturday, I rested most of Saturday and Sunday. Today the 22nd I am back to my normal self.

She went to bed around 8:00 PM and then she couldn&#39;t sleep all night.  She kept trying to drink liquid, running fever, hot and opened a window with temp being 30 outside.  She could hardly walk to the bathroom due to the muscle weakness and fear of falling.  She tossed and turned all night long.  She got up and her temp was 99.8, and she was told not to go to PT this morning.  She is being treated for a frozen shoulder.   She feels dehydrated and is drinking water, and going to drink Ginger ale and crackers due to the nausea.

I went to Clinic Saturday 2/13, for being unbalanced and weak, but not so dizzy. Sunday 2/14 I was extremely weak with low blood pressure and fast heart rate.  Monday  2/15, in the morning,  my left arm started hurting, swelling, was feverish, red, itchy and I had a rash at the injection site. I went to my doctor on 2/19 and he stated that maybe I should not get the 2nd vaccine shot. He stated that he was not certain that everything that happened was a result of the vaccine, but that he couldn&#39;t say that it wasn&#39;t.

I would skip a day and then get a day with several more movements (usually in a.m.). I had C Diff a few years ago and was concerned. It gradually became more watery as time went on. It lasted for 8 days. No fever, didn&#39;t feel sick after the diarrhea passed. I&#39;ve been fine for the last 2 days and tomorrow will be the 2 week mark after the 2nd injection.

Started Saturday day after vaccination with fatigue to the point couldn&#39;t stay awake and weak. Sunday woke with bad ache all over and harder to move along with fatigue. Small headache along with slight nausea in afternoon. Woke about 5 am Monday with total sweat, then chills and couldn&#39;t warm up. still had fatigue but not as much pain. Called Hospital Covid Hotline as directed by my Dr.s office (never talked to my Dr.) Nurse with Hotline discussed it with me and we determined it was probably side effects. Since I am aware of allergic reactions, I didn&#39;t feel threatened, only messed up. The fatigue and some aches lasted throughout the weak, and I am still fatigued and weak compared to normal.Aches seem better.

Thereafter, through the night,  a  feeling of fever, back &amp; forth: skin hot, then normal feeling.  Some chills.  Took my temperature several times and would only get a normal reading.  Puzzled, because  I thought I must have a fever.....the STRANGENESS  of this  was that my skin felt like it was BURNING UNDERNEATH my skin....not like any fever I might have ever had. Still normal temp readings.   The next day...mostly in bed, tired, no appetite, continued fever feeling, but no fever temp reading.  The second day, up and around, eating.

Dermatologist  did a Biopsy.  The rash lasted for four days and cleared up.

The following day I was feeling a little better, but the chest pain was worrisome. I went to Urgent care and they said my EKG was not normal. I was taken to the hospital which was also the vaccine site. I was treated in the ER and they ruled out a heart issue with a complete workup. I was admitted for an unexplained bowel obstruction and remained in the hospital for four days. I got the second dose of the vaccine and I did not have any significant problems. I may have Covid-19 in the spring of 2020.

                                                On 03/20/21 a day after receiving 1st dose of Moderna, I woke up at around 8am with a dark bruise on the right outside corner of my bottom lip.  I checked it in the mirror and noticed a dark bruise inside the same area.  I also noticed some small boil like bumps on the same corner of my right bottom lip.  Also some sort of lesions inside of my mouth on the right cheek and inside the right side of the bottom lip and inside the bottom of the skin between my gums and bottom of bottom lip.  The next day 03/21/21 the bruises were gone, but the small bumps and lesions were still there and have been until the present.  I did not call my doctor or go to urgent care, because I got very sick to my stomach like stomach flu, and it takes forever to get through to make an appointment with the clinic and urgent care.  I was going to call for an appointment today,  but have had diahrrea  for the last week.  I also don&#39;t know what type of doctor to call for oral  type problems.  I was going to call my insurance company to ask them.  I have a great doctor, but I don&#39;t feel  like waiting on the phone to get through to my doctor or urgent care.  So haven&#39;t been seen by a doctor.

                                                I felt an immediate &#34;anaphylaxis-like&#34; reaction right away.  I had swelling of my mouth, face, eyes and nausea. I felt dizzy and light headed and had fever of 101F, headache, body aches and I could not get out of bed. I had trouble sleeping. I had trouble concentrating, decrease cognitive abilities and extreme fatigue.  I did take an antihistamine (Xyzal) prior to the vaccine.  I took Tylenol and Zofran  for nausea.  The swelling subsided after  2 days,  and the acute-flu like symptoms lasted about a week. I usually see my doctor every week for weekly injection for my RA .  I still have nausea and he prescribed Zofran for that.   I have small-medium lost my appetite and my taste and smell have change and also itchy eye.  But I have noticed increased saliva excretion.

                                                On 3/5 at 2p the patient received dose #2 of Moderna from Martin&#39;s Point Scarborough and initially was fine - went home 8pm that evening she developed severe abdominal pain, called EMS, was significantly hypotensive (70&#39;s/80&#39;s) and was brought here to Hospital- she was here for 5 days, 48 hours of which she suffered diarrhea, nausea and anorexia and was given a diagnosis of ischemic cholitis related to the hypotensive event.  She reported this, at the time to VARES as well as to MCH as an adverse drug reaction to a vaccine. On 5/3 she had a colonoscopy with Dr which showed a stricture in her transverse colon On 5/21 she had a barium study On 6/14 Dr performed a colectomy; she reported the stricture was severe; her passage was 1/8&#34; instead of a normal 1&#34;.  There was no cancer but scar tissue was seen. The patient strongly believes her hypotensive episode the evening following her dose 2 vaccine caused an ischemic event to her colon requiring subsequent surgery and requested it be reported.    Her reason for the call is that she feels she had an extreme reaction to her vaccine and wants to be sure we are aware, and wants to raise aware of the potential for delayed onset hypotension that can have detrimental effects.  She has reported this to the CDC.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I was sitting in a well organized waiting area I started feeling flames in my throat. My throat was literally on fire. I raised my hand as I was instructed to do. I asked for water, they brought me a bottle water, I started to drink it. My throat was having a difficult time swallowing. They brought me over to nursing area. I went into this area and the nurses were there. They made me take my mask off, they took my blood pressure was way lower then normal (110/30). Then they gave me 50MG Benadryl. They called EMS and I refused to go. I had to wait at the clinic until the Benadryl took effect. The &#34;flame&#34; feeling began to lessen. When I got home I took another dose of Benadryl.  The &#34;flame&#34; feeling went away but then I was left with a sore throat for the rest of the night and the following morning. It felt like there was an actual fire in my throat that the Benadryl put out but then it felt as if the after effects of a burn in my throat.    I do have a call in to my primary care provider and still waiting for a call back.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.  2:00 am 1/28/2021- woke up feeling queasy, joints in legs were achy. My left  knee replacement felt like it was in a vise,  This  was a  short lived event with some residual feeling in the knee in the morning.   3 days after injection  10:00 pm 1/30/2021- I noticed a small rash on my left abdomen near the navel, this rash moved quickly to the left and soon covered entire left abdomen, moving to the groin area then down left inner thigh.  I took a Benazepril and went to bed. During the night I woke up several time with a strong pressure in left bowel area. Changing position seemed to help and went back to sleep. woke up about 5 am and checked the rash which was mostly gone except for the original spot where it began.  The rash and pressure seemed to be restricted to front left side below waist area. It is now 11:00 am 1/31/2021 and I am feeling fine, very little residual rash at initial site.   I had not read anything about delayed reactions as late as 3 1/2 days after the injection so wanted to report this event.

Then about 8 days later, just over a week she woke up and her arm was red again and more swollen and looked like a black and blue area where the needle went in.  There was a red rash around that point.  The rash was larger than the palm of her hand.  She was tired that day and it did go away after 2-3 days.  She took Tylenol one night due to the pain to help sleep.  She did not call her doctor.  It has now totally resolved as of today, 2/10/21.

No vomiting. Some abdominal cramping, and my nose was very runny, altho not stuffy. By morning the diarrhea had stopped, but I felt awful. Did not know if I was mainly dehydrated, exhausted from no sleep, or sick. Ate nothing that day, but drank a lot of fizzy water and herbal tea with a little honey. Following day feeling OK, and by third day, fine. The experience felt like a really bad stomach flu or food poisoning, but I haven&#39;t had either of those for over 15 years (and that was from Erythromycin prescribed by my dentist when I didn&#39;t realize I am allergic to it).

                                                I had Covid on 25 Nov. 2020.  I had extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, aching, headaches and abdominal pain. I have IBS which flared up during this time.  It took me December and January to finally get over the fatigue part. When I received my vaccination on Feb. 12, 2021 (Moderna) by that evening I began to run a temp. of 102-103. I had chills, headache, abdominal pain (worse than in Nov.), fatigue, some dizziness, and short of breath. I felt like I had Covid all over again!  I was down for 5 days. On Sunday afternoon, Feb 14 I went to the Clinic to see the doctor on call.  I was told they could not test me since I had Covid November 25 and it hadn&#39;t been 90 days and I would still have the antibodies.

                                                On Wednesday afternoon she had a fever of 103, was very fatigued.  Got up in the middle of the night and had dry heaves, went back to bed and was okay.  Her arm got really red, hot and blisters all over it like a sunburn.  It is down to about the size of a half dollar today.  The blisters burst and have made places, is still warm and sore and looks like it is drying up.  Did look like a severe sunburn.  She ran a little fever until Thursday night 2/18/21.  The arm is still sore to touch today, 2/22/21.  She took some Tylenol the night her fever was 103, then it went to 101.   The fatigue is diminishing, she has slept a lot, but wonders if her arm is ever going to be right.

                                                Started out with waking the next day a fullness in her head, but kind of a headache, and very tired.  Then a couple of hours later she got a severe case of the chills.  She laid down and slept on and off for about 5 hours.  When she got up she took her temperature and it was 101.  She also had body aches in her back and her legs felt very heavy.  She then noticed a rash on her body from a line that went underneath her breast, and redness on the left side of her breast to her belly button, all red around the belly button.   When she realized she had a fever she took Tylenol.  The rash by Saturday was fading and she also had diarrhea on Saturday, persistent diarrhea.  She felt almost normal except that she was tired.  Today, 3/1/21 she has the returned diarrhea, doesn&#39;t k now if it was related to the vaccine.  She spoke to a nurse yesterday, and she told that she had a typical side effect from the vaccine.  She was not sure if the diarrhea was from the vaccine.

At 9:15 pm, I had chills and fever for 3 hours  and during that time, my right forearm, wrist and hand became very, very sore.  I  couldn&#39;t even flex my fingers the pain was so bad.  Pain throughout my body continued during the night, including stomach cramps, back and leg pain and then I took another 200 mg of Advil at 9:15 am on 3/4.  I feel I am 20% improved 25 hours after my second shot.

                                                Sudden dizziness with some nausea and cold drenching sweat - no fever - extremely weak and fatigued and could barely stand and then severe headache came on about 10 minutes into episode.  Dizziness lasted approximately 2 hours until I could safely move and then began to subside.  I noticed my eyes did not want to focus well and was seeing spots when I tried writing down what happened.  Chills began and I felt extremely cold, my head felt &#34;foggy&#34; and tight, ringing in ears started and headache moved to migraine level.  Slight fever 99.8. Main dizziness did pass after about 2 hours but other things continue to linger on an off.  I just feel &#34;off&#34;.  I have actually heard other seniors mention some of these very symptoms so am not super alarmed, however, I did not have any of these side effects before the vaccine for Covid-19.  I did experience extreme fatigue and bad headaches since I received the first dose on January 27, 2021.    I have not called my doctor regarding these side effects since I have heard many seniors complain of very similar reactions.  I have rested as much as possible, tried to stay hydrated, and taken Tylenol when needed.  For the dizziness I tried to stay as still as possible and put my head between my knees until it finally passed.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

I debated calling 911, but had sick animals I couldn&#39;t leave. Went to bed and when I woke, I could swallow again. However I had severe hives as well as debilitation itching and swelling of my fingers, hands and later, my toes and feet as well. These symptoms have continued in varying degrees ever since I received my first Moderna vaccination.

She had diarrhea but not too bad, and then started throwing up uncontrollably, violently, projectile.  She goes to where she was disoriented and did not know where she was.  She was reaching to touch things to figure out where she was.  Her husband called the ambulance, and she went to the hospital and got her normalized but does not know how or what they did.  A woman came in to register her and started talking to her and was not making any sense.  They treated her in the ER, took a bunch of tests, and sent her home.  They told her that she had food poisoning and hadn&#39;t had anything but some biscuit and gravy and had some crackers when she got the vaccine as she was weak.  They gave her Ondansetron for her stomach to stop the diarrhea, but she is still having that.  She is still having the weakness, and not back to her normal self.

                                                dizziness and concern for elevated blood pressure reading. This afternoon at around 12:00, the patient received her second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at the clinic. She had no apparent complications with her first dose of the COVID vaccine. However, about 10 minutes post second vaccination, she suddenly began to feel dizzy, described as lightheadedness, with associated nausea, all of which were rated a 4/10 in severity. Staff there took her blood pressure, which was noted to be elevated, reportedly at 220/104. EMS was activated, and en route to the ED, the patient was given Zofran by paramedics. Currently the patient no longer has nausea and has not had any vomiting. She does have chills, but no measured fever.

Chills, fever (102.4) nausea, sore throat, slight cough, loss of appetite and it has lasted until tonight 4/20/21/.. I am finally feeling a bit better BUT still not right. The idea of having a 2nd injection is off the table. They say you get sick with the 2nd. I surely don&#39;t want to get any sicker than I am.

That is why I took these vaccinations  Over the last twenty years I have taken a number of vaccination including an annual seasonal flu shot. I have learned during these years that when I take such a vaccination I need to do it when my schedule is clear to allow for several days of down time. I usually need several days to recover from such a vaccination. I also take only one vaccination at a time to lessen any problems I may have with it. Sometimes I have had a large red spot on my vaccination arm, up to four inches wide, near or around the injection site.  Continued:

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 21-Dec-2020, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 21-Dec-2020, the patient experienced CARDIAC FLUTTER (30 minutes of rapid heart rate and fluttering) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath), SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (supraventricular tachycardia), DIZZINESS (Dizzy), HYPERHIDROSIS (diaphoretic), PALPITATIONS (Palpitations), FATIGUE (Fatigue) and NAUSEA (nauseous). On 21-Dec-2020, CARDIAC FLUTTER (30 minutes of rapid heart rate and fluttering) had resolved. At the time of the report, DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath), SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (supraventricular tachycardia), DIZZINESS (Dizzy), HYPERHIDROSIS (diaphoretic), PALPITATIONS (Palpitations), FATIGUE (Fatigue) and NAUSEA (nauseous) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 21-Dec-2020, Electrocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) supraventricular tachycardia. On 21-Dec-2020, Heart rate: increased (High) increased.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No relevant concomitant medications were provided. About 3 hours after receiving vaccine, patient had 30 minutes of rapid heart rate, and fluttering. She laid down, went to sleep, and it resolved. She didn&#39;t seek emergency care. Did not have chest pain or shortness of breath.  Continued to have palpitations occasionally, fatigue, tachycardia. She presented to primary care professional on 07 Jan 2021 for symptoms and was transferred to for additional cardiac workup and treatment after capturing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) on electrocardiogram (EKG). Also diaphoretic, dizzy, nauseous, shortness of breath with palpitations. She was given IV metoprolol in ED with conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). They suspect that the vaccine may have been her trigger. She was able to discharge without escalation of care.

                                                Driving my car on route 50 in morning of the 6th, felt fine after getting up showering and getting ready for work.  About 10 miles to my destination I felt naueous and completed fainted at the wheel.  I then hit a guard rail on the right and I can only assume I pulled the wheel to the left and hit the guard rail there.  I was very lucky I did&#39;t hit another car or I wasn&#39;t hit myself by another car.  This road is very busy all the time.  I then got myself together and pulled off to a place where I could evaluate my situation.  Someone came to my aid as I tried to remove myself from the drivers side door, which was dented in.  The called 911 and I was taken to the hospital. The did a number of tests and I was told that I was fine.  I have had no re-occurrences and have no history of fainting.  I did about 15,000 of damage to my car.

                                                (Information gained secondhand from patient&#39;s close friend as patient was intubated and sedated at the time that potential relationship between events and vaccine administration recognized). 77 yo F with no known significant PMH (was independent in ADLs, active, line-danced twice/week) who developed nausea, headache, fatigue on first day after first dose of Moderna vaccine. Friend reports that patient complained of &#34;just not feeling right&#34; following vaccine administration. Complained of poor sleep, poor appetite, dyspepsia and began complaining of lower extremity swelling in the weeks following vaccine administration. Was no longer able to line-dance, etc. Was fatigued. Her friends became concerned and encouraged her to seek medical attention, patient reported that she had was prescribed &#34;water pill&#34; and told to &#34;lay off salt,&#34;. Friends later found out that she had lied about doctor&#39;s visit and was self-medicating with over the counter  &#34;water pills&#34; for all of the water weight she was gaining. Eventually developed worsening shortness of breath. Admitted to hospital on 5/4 with shortness of breath and worsening abdominal pain. Found to have systolic heart failure (EF 20-30%) and was in SVT. Also diagnosed with UTI and SMV thrombus. Grossly anasarcic on exam. Treated for heart failure with diuretic and for her UTI with antibiotics, was started on Heparin drip for SMV thrombus. Underwent left heart catheterization at OSH that was negative for significant CAD. Developed worsening septic shock and was transferred to our hospital for higher level of care. Unfortunately had ongoing decline, found to be fungemic. Eventually succumbed to her septic shock, passed away on 5/14/21.  Patient had second dose of vaccine on 3/18/21 according to vaccine card in her purse. Friend states that because of symptoms she developed after first dose of vaccine, she was fearful of getting second dose.  Friends insist that she was well before the vaccine---knee pain was limiting factor for her activity level, never shortness of breath. Of note, several friends tested positive for COVID on 2/11/21, the week prior to patient receiving her vaccine. Patient tested negative and reportedly got tested at frequent intervals and was always negative.

She continued to have that high fever off &amp; on every other day and spoke to her primary care physician who told her he didn&#39;t know why she had the fever, then finally advised her to go to the ER. She had already recovered from COVID prior to taking the 2nd shot, and tested negative for COVID by the time she went to the ER. She went to the ER on about 5/18/21, and in addition to fever, experienced sore throat, appetite loss and fatigue. She was admitted and the doctors told her they&#39;re unsure if it&#39;s related to the experimental shot, but they can&#39;t rule it out at this time. They continue to give her drugs and run tests, with no real answers to speak of and she believes it&#39;s likely an adverse reaction to the shot(s).

                                                She received her vaccine. The next few days, she was extremely tired and slept a lot. A couple days after the vaccine, she complained that her stomach hurt slightly. Days went by and the pain slowly got worse. She didn&#39;t feel like eating. Then on 2/8/21 in the middle of the night, she woke up in excruciating pstomach pain and her husband called ambulance. They rushed her to ER. The determined that her colon had ruptured near her stomach and they took her in for emergency colonoscopy. The surgery was a success, but a couple days after, she was weak and said she didn&#39;t want to fight any longer. They put her on hospice measures and she died 2/15/21. We feel that she was doing fine before the vaccine, and then all of a sudden this occurred. Seems to be too much of a coincidence. Finally taking the time to report it, in case there are others having colon and or stomach issues.

Upon arrival in ER had bloodwork, CT, and MRI (results below)  Diagnosed as idiopathic pancreatitus since no reason could be found.  No alcohol at all, no stones, and no routine meds known to cause this. Admitted NPO and on IV fluids.  Discharged next evening after pain resolved and tolerating po fluids. Hospital physicians told me they did not think the vaccine could have been the issue but I still feel this was such a coincidence that it should be reported.

                                                On March 6, 2021, three days after second Moderna vaccine, I had sudden onset deafness in my right ear and progressing dis equilibrium.  Within a couple of hours I could barely walk.  Extreme dizziness/vertigo, nausea.  Went to ER next day, 3/7 and was transferred after about 5 hours to Medical Center.  Was eventually diagnosed with Idiopathic Labyrinthitis.  ER wanted to admit me at 11:30pm but I hadn&#39;t eaten or had any fluids and they don&#39;t feed people in the ER so I went home.  Conditions worsened with walking like a very drunk person and brain fog, dizziness, vertigo.  Went back to ER where they completed all kinds of tests and scans.

It went off and on on Sunday then it went away.  (felt like I was suffering from vertigo) I do not think I have suffered from it since then.

                                                The first day felt fine, the next day when she got up in the morning she didn&#39;t feel well, but felt well enough to put a roast in the crockpot.  Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

Alzheimer&#39;s disease is a confounding factor too. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information has been requested.

I woke up at 5am the 10th and I was shaking and having chills and I was hot and cold... I was dizzy and my eyes hurt. My arm was hurting. I took another tylenol. at 6am I called my NP daughter for advice and she told her it was a reaction of the vaccine. my fever was 102.5. I was advised to take more tylenol and to rest. the fever broke later that morning but I was still experiencing those side effects. 3 days later I&#39;m still not 100%.

By 7pm I was dizzy and nauseated, and it got worse, I got chills and shook and shook and shook, I had a fever and the next day I tried to get out of bed, and I fell to the floor and couldn?t stand up, I had no energy or appetite. I had covid in August 2020 and the wasn?t made aware of the possible side effects if you had covid. They didn?t ask if I had covid in the past and the pharmacist told me later that people who has had covid has reported having bad side effects. I had gone a couple weeks ago to see if I had the covid antibodies and I was positive for antibodies and the injection works against the antibiotics. This part of the procedure was overlooked. I have no one else to help me and going through this alone, it would have been better to have been made aware of this ahead of time.

Then was fine for 7 days.  On 2/5/2021, I went to get my B12 shot and asked the doctor to check left arm where Moderna shot was given as it was itching and a bit sore at the same time.  He told me I was having reaction.  By evening, a third of my arm around injected area was swollen an had red rash.  Then same symptoms of fatigue, etc. came back and I was in and out of bed for the next three days....then at end had a bout of diarrhea.

By day #7, I called my dr who wasn&#39;t in and spoke to his associate. She said if it got worse to follow up with my dr. They continued to get worse and by Day #9, I called my doctor and sent him a photo. He told me to take benedryl and an antihistamine (zyrtec).  By the next day, the lips were worse, sent another photo and he prescribed Prednisone 20 mg for 5 days. I had a lot of trouble eating and drinking. My lips also felt like pins were constantly being stuck in them. The prednisone helped but it took at least another week before my lips returned to normal. On the advice of my doctor, I did not get the second Moderna dose.

                                                On Saturday 02/20  twenty four hours after receiving   the injection I felt fatigued with loss of appetite and some chills. At the same time I noticed a 2inch  red ring around the injection site. The next day I felt fine ,but had a very sore arm with the red circle and a large pink blush running down to my elbow which never disappeared. The following week the red circle disappeared but the pink blush remained. On Sunday, 02/28 I noted that the blush disappeared but I now had a 3inch red circle around the injection site. On Monday 03/1, the red circle grew and spread, and by 03/2 it was no longer in circular form but spread down my arm to 3inches by 6inches. It remains the same 0n 0/3. It is not painful or itchy. I am worried. I know this is called covid arm but my reaction does seem extreme. I do have some photos beginning on 02/28

She took 2 Tylenol, and went back and laid down.  She then awoke the next day starting to have some chills but not as bad as the night before.  She covered up with an electric  blanket in a chair and finally passed over.  She noticed  Saturday that she had nausea and dizziness.  She then had  tenderness in her mouth, used warm salty water which seems to be helping.  She cannot eat any hard food on it due to the discomfort.  She has continued nausea in the evenings.  No problems with the arm where she got the vaccine.  She feels it it getting some better, but the dizziness and nausea is the worst issue.  She did call her doctor and they told her that they could not give her anything for the rash in her mouth, and the chills. They told her that it had to run it&#39;s course.

                                                About 9 days after my 1st dose of Moderna vaccine, I began to have itching on my right upper arm in the area of the injection.  That continues today.  Two days after I noticed the itching, the upper arm was hot to the touch, red, and swollen.  The area is about 6&#34; in diameter.  I did not have an elevated temperature, but I felt slightly nauseous and light-headed on March 5.    I had no reaction to the shot until a week and a half to two weeks after the injection.   I still have a red, itchy area on my right arm.  It seems to be slowly improving.

Too weak to make it to the bathroom by myself.  I felt like I was in a delirium but my husband said that I was not incoherent.  Appetite is still not normal.  Mouth was so dry that I was not able to feel any moisture at all which I feel led to my sinus infection.

I drank lots of water, forced myself to eat some crackers, lay on the sofa all day for several days.  On 3/29 I started taking Omeprazole.  On 4/3 my nausea started improving and by 4/5 was gone.

Suddenly felt very sweaty-hair wet - decided to wash face - went into bathroom- Quick reaction - Instant  diarrhea and vomiting in bucket.  Very scary - asked husband for more toilet paper.  After cleaning up, I was extremely COLD.  Put on extra clothes sweatshirt - got 3 blankets, by now it is 1:30 A.M.   Slept in recliner.  Next morning - felt weak, unsteady - afraid to eat anything but did drink lots of water.  Today is Sunday April 11th, still very cautious about eating and still taking it easy.  Seem to have a  little discomfort in sternum area (thinking this could be my &#34;years ago diagnosed hiatal hernia ??

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Cholesterol (Tressor for cholesterol), Stress (Takes &#34;stress pills&#34;) and Drug allergy (azithromycin (Zithromax)).   On 21-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 19-Feb-2021, the patient experienced LYMPHADENOPATHY (Enlargement of lymph node), DECREASED APPETITE (No appetite) and PYREXIA (High fever). On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FACIAL PARALYSIS (Bell&#39;s Palsy) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 05-Mar-2021, LYMPHADENOPATHY (Enlargement of lymph node), DECREASED APPETITE (No appetite) and PYREXIA (High fever) had resolved. At the time of the report, FACIAL PARALYSIS (Bell&#39;s Palsy) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   On 10-Apr-2021, she experienced right-sided facial paralysis and was unable to keep her eyes closed. Her doctor subsequently diagnosed Bell&#39;s Palsy.  The patient inquired if there were patients who have experienced the same thing.  Action taken with mRNA in respect to the events was not applicable. Concomitant medications included stress pills and tressor for cholesterol. Treatment included prednisone, unspecified antiviral medication and eye drops for the right eye.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She finally managed to get to her phone again, she was not able to get up, and she called 9-1-1 and they came out and got her in the chair, but did not take her to the hospital.  She has not passed out anymore but she feels very dizzy and woozy and does not move fast.  She also had some nausea, but that is pretty much gone.  She has not called her doctor as it was over the weekend.

                                                I felt fine after my vaccination until about midnight. I felt weak, and generally sick - horrible. I felt like I had a fever and I felt like my heart was still thumping too hard. I felt nauseas and generally all over sick as a dog, weak as a kitten. And I was afraid as well, because it was midnight and I live alone. I thought about going to the ER due to my condition. I took my BP and it was 120/68 which is normal. I took my temperature and it was 96.7 and then I did my blood oxygen and it was 96 with a heart rate of 66 so all of my little at home tests were normal. I was no longer afraid. I took two baby aspirin and I drank a lot of water and I went to sleep. I did not feel good in the morning but due to my vitals being okay, I began to stop worrying. Around noon the day after my vaccine, I felt OK. I contacted my DR the next day and they called me back and I was fine at that point so said nevermind.

Next morning, diarrhea, fever, and was unable to stand up, even with aid of a walker and my husband&#39;s help. Muscle weakness, which  lasted about  24 hours. . After 24 hours, took 2 Tylenol,  Next day problem was gone. And no further problem with muscle weakness. Did read CDC recommendations, not to take 2nd dose if there were problems. And I will not be t aking the second one on 03-03021. Did call Health Dept and reported it but not sure what staff member I visited with, but it was not the nurse who gave injection nor the Administrator.

The area does not really itch, but is just red.  For the first two days, the rash didn&#39;t move.  Then over the next several days, the rash starting spreading down the upper arm. On February 18, the patient experienced bad diarrhea.  On February 21, the patient put a cold damp cloth over the area to soothe the area.  Some areas within the rash are improving, but the redness continues to spread down the arm.  The area felt like a bad sunburn, and the patient put some salve on it one day, but did not notice a difference.

Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

                                                Really tired on Monday the 22nd and I felt fatigued. I began to get nauseated and then I began to vomit. I vomited 5-6 times even though I had not eaten anything. I also had diarrhea. I had chills. Some point during the night I spiked a fever, I woke up and drenched. Yesterday  the 23rd I  had a fever, my stomach still does not feel settled. I have not ate much since Sunday but have been trying to stay hydrated with lots of water.  I also developed a cough yesterday. Tuesday night my temperature 100.6 and I think it got higher because I woke up once again drenched in sweat. This morning my temperature was 99.  I am achy today with muscle and joint pain,  my stomach feels better but I still leery of  eating. I did eat some Ginger ale and eat some saltine crackers.  I also feel horse.  I called my doctor yesterday and still have not heard back. I will call again today.  It feels like I feel better in the morning but as the day goes on I get worse and start feeling worse. I have been resting a lot in bed.

                                                First 2-3 days felt normal discomfort at injection sit. It got progressively worse and began to feel like a torn rotator cuff.  A lot of pain (7-8) unable to sleep on that side and unable to lift more than two pounds or drive or reach above my shoulder without pain of about a 10 on scale of 1-10.  Saw orthapedic physician assistant  on 03/26   who gave me a steroid shot in that shoulder with 75%  relief by the next day. Still some minor residual discomfort at this writing.  Also ran a fever with nausea and headache exactly two weeks after first shot.

Then had headaches off and on, as well as muscle and joint pain everywhere, weakness all over her body.  She also had a low grade fever Saturday and Sunday.  She did have the  Corona Virus in July of 2020.  She is feeling better today as far as the weakness, just a little bit of muscle and joint pain.  She did have a trace of nausea this morning, but took her medication and it subsided.  The weakness was something like she had never had before.  She took Tylenol for her symptoms.  She did not call her doctor.   Just has a small amount of symptoms, but still not feeling herself yet.

On Sunday night 21-Feb-2021, she was able walk up stairs without huffing and puffing and felt much better. The patient states they have recovered from it all except sometimes when doing yoga, they can feel a bit of an ache in the injection arm.  No treatment information was provided.

                                                I notice mild weasing  after about 10 minutes but used my Albuterol Sulfate HFA Inhaler.   Weasing went away.   I did feel fine until I got severe chills about 6 PM.  Chills remained for several hours.  Went to bed with heavy covers.  Woke up about 2 AM with stomach not feeling well.  Was dizzy walking into kitchen getting a Sprite.  Set in recliner with heavy covers.  Took my blood pressure at 5AM &amp; it had dropped to 104 /44 which was apparently why I was so dizzy.   I then took a Tylenol and felt fine after 9AM.  I still feel fine but wanted to report my extremely low blood pressure which usually is 135/65 in mornings.    I&#39; m thankful for the vaccine.

                                                Was napping the day after receiving the vaccine and woke up about 3:00 pm to severe chest pain on the right side radiating deep into the shoulder blade.  It would last about 5 - 10 min., stop for the same amount of time, then start up again.... on &amp; off until close to 11:00 pm.   Since someone else I know had the same thing happen the day after her shot, I assumed I had the same symptom, tho&#39; it was very frightening.  A week later after going to bed on Friday night, I woke at 2:00 a.m. to the same pain only this time on my left side.  Thinking I could be having a heart attack, I went to the hospital where I was admitted after having a series of tests.  I was there for 2 days during which time I also began to have un-controllable diarrhea.  Altho&#39; they could find nothing wrong with my heart,  after scans, x-rays, a stress test, numerous blood tests etc., they cannot say positively whether or not it was from the Covid vaccine.  I tho&#39;t it best to report this in case others have similar events.  I had the MODERNA vaccine

                                                My arm was sore to the touch and it was very big and the size of an Avocado. It was very hot to the touch. I had put some lotion on it and it did not itch. I was given antibiotics. The doctor thought it was moving down my arm. They drew a circle around it, and it did not grow. It slowly went down over the course of a week. I got the second dose, and I was poorly for two and a half days. My arm was not affected by the second dose. I did have a low appetite for a month after the second shot. LOT # 024M20A

These symptoms began on 2/23/21, 5 days after receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine. Symptoms were similar to but more intense than symptoms experienced after my 1st Moderna vaccine. I was taken to the ER during the night of 02/24/2021 beause of intensification of symptoms.  Symptoms continued intermittently until 03/23/202 when a cardiac ablation was performed at a Cardiovascular Center.  I also experienced some post-op Afib in first 2 weeks following the procedure.

By 5th day all okay, except some cognitive issues (slower thinking, searching for words, poor memory) still with me on May 3, these are subtle changes, but it&#39;s obvious to me they began after this vaccine shot.  SERIOUS REACTIONS BEGAN AFTER 2ND COVID SHOT ON 2/26/2021: Pain in neck, hips, head, down left leg. Diagnosed as inflammation and bursitis in left hip, which still remains in May and limits my life in the extreme.

I slept on and off all day and felt too weak to do anything. Wed, the 5th, I still had the headache which wore off around 10 or 11.  I felt stronger as the day progressed I was able to eat and do some activities. Now, Wed evening, I feel fine and no more side effects.

Treatment team Severe sepsis (CMS/HCC) Principal problem Discharge Summary Internal Medicine    Inpatient DeathSummary   BRIEF OVERVIEW Admission Date: 4/6/2021     Discharge Date: 4/17/2021  DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY   Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Patient is an 79 y.o. female morbidly obese with past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia follow-up that was initially scheduled oncology follow-up for April 7 now postponed to the next 2 weeks, COPD on 2 L oxygen support at home, GERD, depression and anxiety.  She was recently seen in the ED on April 4, 2021 with complaint of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fever, chills, nonbloody diarrhea, vomiting and weakness and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.  She had however received a second dose of COVID-19 a week before and was  discharged home due to lack of significant findings on imaging chest x-ray and lack of requirement for higher  oxygen support. She presented to the emergency via EMS for evaluation of progressive shortness of breath with associated with fever, chills, headache, persistent shortness of breath, cough productive of thick clear sputum, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  She denies abdominal pain, chest pain, or dizziness.  Denies recent antibiotic usage or recent travel.  Apparently, she thought she was getting better upon discharge after being kept for about 12 hours in the last ED visit, however she was not feeling well after going to bed last night and asked the husband to call 911.  Upon EMS arrival patient was saturating in the 80s and in respiratory distress.  She received 1 DuoNeb and was eventually placed on 10 L oxygen support.  She was noted to be in significant respiratory distress during speech.   Hospital Course Patient was admitted to hospital due to shortness of breath, and was found to have severe sepsis on presentation due to COVID-19 pneumonia.  She had evidence of acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure as well.  She was started on IV antibiotics, as well as remdesivir and Decadron at high dose.   Unfortunately she continued to have clinical deterioration, and ultimately required high flow oxygen therapy.  She was then transferred to the ICU, and ultimately required intubation due to severe profound ongoing hypoxia despite optimal medical treatment.  She did not respond to remdesivir or steroids or antibiotics.  Post intubation, she also developed acute renal failure during the course of her admission.   Multiple discussions were had throughout the hospitalization regarding goals of care, and initially patient and family wish to be continually aggressive.  She received full medical treatment, including life support, with minimal improvement.  Despite being on ventilator for roughly 5 days, she continued to have severe hypoxia.  She was proned, and was unable to sustain oxygen saturations when supine even for short period.   Her renal function continued to decline as well, and at that point discussion was had with family regarding goals of care again.  They were explained that symptoms continue to be persistent, and her illness continues to progress despite aggressive medical therapy.  Ultimately decision was made to not pursue dialysis, and to allow the patient to be kept comfortable and pass away naturally from this infection.   She was terminally extubated on 4/17 and passed away at 11:16 AM due to COVID-19 and acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure.

On 02/09/2021 we both got the Covid antibodies but they did not work for her. It ended up going into Covid pneumonia and she was treated for that and once she got over that she got bacterial pneumonia and we have been going through that since (still ongoing).  She has seen specialists and had a hospital stay for 9 days. She has had all kinds of blood tests. She just had a test on 06/16/2021 to see if she has an immunity to Covid. She has had overall weakness and when we took her to hospital she fainted.

                                                Pt received Moderna covid 19 vaccines on Feb 6th 2021 and March 6th 2021.  She was diagnosed with new aggressive possible lymphoma or lung cancer for which she  ultimately died from on 7/2/21 . Daughters reported symptoms started suddenly 5 1/2 weeks ago around 5/20/21. PCP notes confirm this. She saw her PCP on 5/25 for the cough and a cxr done that day was normal. She was prescribed tesselon perles and azithromycin.  She presented back on 6/8 with persistent cough with new hemoptysis, decreased appetite and weight loss and ct scan done 6/15 showed a large heterogenous mass of the mediastinum 6.6 x 7.6 x 13cm encasing the r main pulmonary artery the r brachicephalic, r subclavian and common carotids. There was mass effect on the trachea and r main stem bronchus. The 6mm nodule seen in the posterior left upper lobe was stable and unchanged from previous ct chest from 9/20. This rapidly progressed in a very short time resulting in her admission to the hospital  for respiratory failure on 6/28 and she was so unstable we were unable to transfer her for a biopsy and start of treatment as recommended by oncology. She passed away on 7/2/21. The family decided they wanted to pursue a limited autopsy to have the mass biopsied to determine what the cancer was which was so rapidly progressive. They describe her as prior to the start of the cough and hemoptysis  on 5/20 that she was living alone, used no assistive devices and other than her dementia was generally healthy and was very interactive and involved with her family

                                                Severe diarrhea and destruction of part of her intestine and subsequent sepsis.  ER doctors &#34;could not rule out the vaccine as a contributing factor.&#34;   It was suggested she have a portion of her intestines removed.  She refused and  went on a high dose of antibiotics.  She was hospitalized in the ICU and eventually released to a nursing home when stabilized.  She never regained control of her bowels or had a solid bowel movement.  Her antibiotics were reduced and she again suffered severe abdominal pain and a distended abdomen and return of sepsis.  She went back to ER and was told this would keep happening if she did not have the damaged portion of her intestine removed.  She elected to go home on hospice, where she died.  Her kidney doctor also relayed  to her family that this reaction was a direct result of the vaccine.  When the family questioned reporting this event, every healthcare provider backed off from admitting it was a result of the vaccine or stated they were not the primary physician and thus was not for them to report.

This lasted about 5 minutes and then subsequently resolved.  She then got up to leave and again began feeling the left chest pain, diaphoresis, and again lasting about 5 to 6 minutes and then subsequently resolving.  She does state a history of anxiety but did take Xanax this morning preventatively.  However, she states she has had similar pains in her chest over the past month.  She states these are not necessarily associated with any exertion and seemed to be somewhat better after antacids.  She notes she has not had anything to eat or drink this morning which is not unusual for her and her blood sugar was 117 this morning.

                                                Please see details on previous page regarding itching and mild diarrhea.  I also had a slightly sore arm at the injection site, but not until 9 hours after the injection at 11 PM.  Itching may be due to my  occasional eczema--I still have it, or it may have been triggered by the gel used for my heart echocardiogram on 2/12/21 or possibly by the vaccine.  The mild diarrhea was only on 2/14/21 and resolved with OTC medication.

I felt faint.  Had a hard time standing.  I have never had anything like that in my whole life and I have had food poisoning in the past.  This was worse, much worse.  Afterwards, for days, I was weak and now three days later still have some nausea although I am not throwing up.  I do have loose bowels though.

                                                A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 80-year-old, female patient who suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia).                                                                                                                      The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided/unknown by the reporter.    On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.   On 02-MAR-2021, she experienced a side effect which was not listed in the sheet she was given. She wanted to call and report the side effect. She said that she was at the stove cooking and suddenly felt very weak and felt that her vision started to flip. She called for her husband to come over who seated her on a chair. After that she says she doesn&#39;t remember what happened, but her husband told her that her whole body was shaking, her head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds. When she came back, she could hear a rushing sound coming out of her left ear. She was also drenched in perspiration. She felt very nauseated and cold the whole afternoon.  On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I had Extreme fatigue, nausea, headache, balance was off, muscle and nerve and back pain.  Just took covid test and just got results--Negative. (3-19-21)  The symptoms subsided March 12.  Still vaguely experiencing all of them.   Should I take the 2nd shot.  Feel those results would return at an even heightend level.  Pharmacist said I was probably 85 % covered now with these effects from the 1st shot and should not take the 2nd.  My Dr.  said the 2nd shot was my call to make and that I should report it to CDC.

                                                The morning after the 2nd dose, I got up to make coffee.  I had just started and felt a bit light-headed.  I was going to go sit down, but I passed out and fell onto the kitchen floor for a few  seconds.   I have never passed out before or felt such light-headedness.  I went to lay down.   I vomited a bit of liquid.  I lay down and several hours later my husband drove me to the emergency room.  After many tests they said I had suffered a Syncope and had a slight concussion.

                                                After my mother took the first vaccine shot on March 4th 2021, I noticed the changes 2 weeks later. Her handwriting became more disoriented in her checkbook. She said she had trouble remembering which week days to write in her checkbook. I noticed incomplete transaction lines. She forgot to take medications for the first time in years.  She used to be an early riser. She started to get up late in the mornings between 8 am and 9 am. She does not eat as much as she should. She drank coffee more frequently all day daily. She hardly drank enough water to avoid her chronic consciptation problem in the bathroom. She has not been herself lately since her first shot. So I have a good reason to be concerned. I think a 2nd vaccine shot is not really a good idea.

Went to Urgent care and was givenMeclizine 12.5mg and Ondansetron 4mg.  Dizziness and nausea lessened over the next 3 days.   Went to ENT doctor - Hearing  test on 3/29/21 revealed total loss of hearing in right ear.  Hearing in left ear was diminished before vaccination and that was about the same after the vaccination.  ENT injected steriod into right ear on 3/31/21.  Second steriod injection on 4/2/21.  No improvement in hearing so far. Dizziness continues off and on.  Still unstable and needs to use a walker.

                                                She got her 2nd vaccine, they kept her 30 minutes as she had problems with the 1st one, her BP was okay and that she could drive home and was told to drink a lot of water.  She went home and after every bottle of water she had 3-4 episodes of diarrhea and kept drinking water all day and after 3-4 she did not have any more diarrhea.   She had some pain in her arm.   She started having visions of chicken scratches/white lines across her eyebrows from the left to the right across her whole forehead.    She always has this vision discrepancy all day long inside the house and outside when she goes and gets the mail.  She first went to the eye doctor as she was having floaters, white lines visually appearing but have not had them for a long time, and these did not go away and they were not the usual floaters like she had before.  They got her in the office immediately and that doctor said that he did not have an answer for her and he didn&#39;t find anything wrong with her eyes.   She told him that she was worried about what happened after the vaccine.    She went to her PCP and she ended up in the hospital as she has a problem with her left rotator cuff and needs surgery on that but is waiting for her leg to heal from total knee surgery.   When she lays down at night she has chest pains, and didn&#39;t know what it was and was told that there is a nerve that runs down from the shoulder and crosses over to the heart and gives the feeling of chest pains.  She had tests done and they did not give her any answers to what the pains were.   She then went to her PCP again and told her about the vision issues and she didn&#39;t have an answer to her issues either.  Her daughter suggested that perhaps her BP was an issue and she brought that to her attention and she told her to document it and to FU this week with her nurse to see that everything was working okay.  She states that her BP has never been the same, she has never had a BP problem before.  She takes it every morning between 9-10 AM.  131/86, 139/80, at 5:00 132/74, 148/88, 133/84, 139/92, yesterday was 137/83, today 132/84.   She has been placed on BP medicine, Cardizem 30 mg.

On 26-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia) (seriousness criterion medically significant), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (sick for five days), MOBILITY DECREASED (could not get out of bed), PRESYNCOPE (she felt like passed out), HYPERTENSION (having episodic of blood pressure really), DIZZINESS (dizziness), VOMITING (vomited for 3 days), NAUSEA (nausea) and PYREXIA (had a temperature). At the time of the report, PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia), MOBILITY DECREASED (could not get out of bed), PRESYNCOPE (she felt like passed out), HYPERTENSION (having episodic of blood pressure really), DIZZINESS (dizziness), NAUSEA (nausea) and PYREXIA (had a temperature) outcome was unknown and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (sick for five days) and VOMITING (vomited for 3 days) had resolved.      It was reported that the blood pressure intervals were high mainly during the day time.  The patient stated that prior to getting the vaccine, she was healthy and was baby sitting for 10 hours. The patient said she had to do stop doing that because she felt like she may drop her grandson since she felt like passed out.  Treatment information was not reported.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-023313 (Patient Link).

I understand that there may or may not be a link between my mother&#39;s symptoms and the vaccine, but I want to make sure that it is looked into.  Three days after dose, my mother woke up with shortness of breath.  Over the last week, the shortness of breath has lingered and she has also had stomach issues.   She has now been hospitalized since yesterday.  These are not uncommon symptoms with her, but she  has definitely been worse since the vaccine.  Assuming she recovers, I am concerned about her taking the second dose, scheduled in two weeks.  Her symptoms are very similar to those of a Physician in an article I read today.

I was feeling close nauseated. I almost felt shaky. I took an Advil about four hours later and I felt a little better. I had diarrhea that afternoon. I turned up the heat and started drinking chamomile tea to warm up. I didn&#39;t eat anything anything until about 6:00, when I had toast and banana. Feelin 95% better by Monday.

                                                early next morning got up to use bathroom, and collapsed on bathroom floor, went in and out of consciousness and was too weak/had no energy to pull herself up from the floor.  Severe diarrhea all over floor and self.   Was not found until Saturday afternoon, and was transported to the ER by ambulance.  Remained in hospital Saturday evening until Monday afternoon.  As of today, the following Friday the 12th, she is still weak and unsteady at times, where she was previously ambulating fine with adequate energy.  Still feels like she has no strength.

                                                She had no issues with the 1st dose in the series.  She did not have any symptoms but acknowledged feeling anxious about the side effects prior to arrival for vaccine. After the 2nd dose, she experienced chest pain, jaw pain, body numbness and tingling, and nausea. She did not have vomiting, shortness of breath, syncope, or headache. She was hypertensive on the cardiac monitor and EKG with T wave inversion in lead III, otherwise unremarkable. Heart rate stable, alert and oriented, cardiopulmonary exam benign. She was sent to the ER for further workup, but did not seem to have any allergic reaction to the vaccine. It is unknown what occurred at ER, as she either went to a separate health system or did not go at all.

When we were going home they told me I was swerving, all over the road and they told me to stop, they would drive, I said no, i don&#39;t trust anyone with my car. We got home, I remember changing into my nightgown and was texting someone and I suddenly I stopped. After that I was unresponsive. I would not answer anyone, they said I looked pale and stared into the air. They called my children and they came and emergency personnel was called. I was taken to a hospital and they transferred me to another hospital. I stayed there for 3-4 days. After going home it took me some days to be able to walk without assistance. I wanted to say I had covid in May (1st time) and September (2nd time) . I still do not have taste or smell back from the covid. I can only eat 3 or 4 bites and then I am done.

Besides this were chills, extreme tiredness, a sort of &#34;brain fog,&#34; general aches and pains with the second shot and knees weak and feeling like a rag doll which lasted a couple days.  Several episodes of urgent diarrhea with the first dose.  First &#34;Covid arm&#34; lasted 8 days, the second just 4.  With both, there was an almost constant feeling of queasiness.

She sat up to get some saltine crackers to help her feel better, and she started to get dizzy. She then remembers trying to hold herself up, and then the next thing she recalls is laying on her back on her kitchen floor. It was then she felt dizzy again and then sat herself up enough so she could vomit 3 times. She also reported having profuse sweating and dry heaves. Her husband found her about 30 minutes later when he returned home from picking up lunch for them. She refused to go in the hospital to get checked out until she called her PCP on 05/21/2021 because she still was not feeling well. They recommended that she go into the ER. She had a CT scan, UA, troponin levels checked, and other blood work. Was treated with IV lactated ringers in the ER, and given meclizine for the dizziness. UA showed positive E. coli, indicative of a UTI. Pt chose to be discharged home instead of staying overnight because she stated she would get plenty of rest at home. Spoke with pt 05/25/2021 after she had called to let us know what happened. Pt has scheduled additional CT scan on 06/08/2021 and follow-up with a neurologist 06/10/2021.

                                                I began feeling dizzy, nauseous, weak in legs, blurred vision in early May which continued throughout the month.  On June 3 I experienced an event like no other.  My legs felt like rubber and  tried but could not speak.  My husband carried me to the sofa, when I sat down I felt disoriented, and saw a circle in front of my eyes.  I felt as if I was about to pass out.  I saw my cardiologist a week later.  He is concerned that the neurological symptoms are new.  He suspects I had a mini stroke despite being on blood thinner for my CHF and referred me to a neurologist.  He suggested I report this sudden change to VAERS.

And late morning/mid day I took something like an Advil/ibuprofen and some tums and felt better the next evening.

                                                Patient was given her first dose of the moderna covid vaccine. She briefly waited around the pharmacy afterwards then began wandering to the back of the store. Roughly 30 minutes after administering the vaccine, she came back to the pharmacy and vomited. Pharmacy staff checked on her and she stated she felt weak, nauseaus, and sick. She stated she just needed a moment to recover and did not need EMS, but the feeling did not pass, so a code white was called and EMS were called to check out the patient. They checked vitals and spoke with the patient, but she did not want to go to the hospital at that time, so she was allowed to rest in the immunization booth until she felt comfortable driving herself home. However, the feeling still did not pass, so roughly 45 minutes later she requested EMS be called again, and she was taken to the hospital.

                                                On 4/7/21, she received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Then, around 5/1/21, she developed fevers to 102 with associated fatigue and poor appetite, but no other clear localizing symptoms, including no sore throat, cough, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V/D, joint swelling/pain, rashes, or dysuria. She presented to an outside hospital ED where she had an infectious workup that included a CXR concerning for LLL pneumonia. She was prescribed doxycycline for 7 days with resolution of her fevers and subjective improvement.    In early June 2021,  the patient redeveloped fevers and chills, worst at nighttime, without localizing symptoms. Her appetite and energy level remained very poor despite several changes to antidepressants as an outpatient. She was treated with nitrofurantoin x 5 days for presumed UTI, but fevers persisted, still without associated cough, CP, or SOB. With going fevers, fatigue, and poor appetite resulting in ~18lb unintentional weight loss, she was admitted to Hospital on 6/22/21 for further evaluation.  While at Hospital, she continued to have fevers to 102&#43; without localizing symptoms despite empiric doxycycline. A broad infectious workup returned negative. CT chest and CTAP were also unrevealing for a cause of fevers. She was found to have an elevated ferritin, LDH, and triglycerides, as well as a low fibrinogen, concerning for HLH (high H-score). She received high-dose dexamethasone. Bone marrow biopsy was performed that was negative for malignancy. However, peripheral flow cytometry returned with a clonal B-cell population, her soluble IL-2 was elevated, and she was found to have splenic enhancement on PET-CT, all concerning for occult lymphoma as the potential driver of her HLH. She remains admitted and is critically ill with complications of DIC and bleeding that preclude a splenic biopsy to confirm the suspected diagnosis of lymphoma. Since her fevers, malaise, and fatigue started less than 1 month after her second dose of the Moderna vaccine, and the patient was insistent that she &#34;hadn&#39;t felt right&#34; since she received that second dose of the vaccine, we decided to report this event in the VAERS system.

                                                approximately 60 hours after receiving the vaccine, i experienced extreme pain in the lower left of my abdomen.  i was able to manage the pain by exercising my legs over a 2 hour period.  when i felt the need to go to the toilet, a huge amount of watery substance came out.  the water in the toilet was brown.  there were small particles of feces floating in the brown water.  i had to flush twice to get rid of it. over the next 5 or 6 hours, there was less watery substance and somewhat larger pieces of feces.  by 12 hours from the onset of the pain, there were only small stools which were a bit larger as time passed.  i kept myself quiet for the rest of the day and had no more symptoms.    i kept myself hydrated throughout the day.   i ate a banana, later some rice,  later an apple  and later some tea and toast. the next day i was able to eat my normal diet.  stools were solid and small. i feel fine. my doctor insisted that i make this report.  i reported the incident on My Chart.

                                                The patient called to report an adverse event on Saturday 02-06-2021 at 11 AM. She stated she developed about 1/4 inch red spot on or near (within 2 inches) vaccination site. The spot was very itchy and was localized to that area only. The patient first noticed the area the morning after the vaccination (on 2-5-21). Also, the patient reported this morning (2-6-21) she had developed severe diarrhea. She was not able to attribute the diarrhea to anything else within her diet or otherwise. The patient stated that the red spot and itching had subsided since yesterday, but she still is experiencing minor itching. I advised the patient to try Imodium in the meantime to combat the diarrhea and to monitor the site as well as the diarrhea for improvement; however, if no improvement or worsening of symptoms is seen within the next 2 days to contact her PCP for further evaluation/treatment.

That lasted about 3 hours when it slowed down and finally stopped. I slept. in the morning I awoke, with a terrible headache and was completely exhausted. I slept all day. (taking Advil and Tylenol for the headache. Nothing helped. I finally took an Imitrex, when I went to bed again. During the day, when I woke I had about a bottle of water during the entire day and all night . Didn&#39;t feel like eating anything. Today I was still tired and the headache was back, but not as bad. I had breakfast and supper and slept in between. Tonight I feel much better.

Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine I had racing heartbeat for 2 hours. I was short of breath over the next few days. I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

It is hard to describe.  I did not think I could drive home safely, so I sat back down and told the girl. She let me sit quietly and than took my blood pressure which was either 185 or 189.  She let me rest and then took it again.  This time it was 167.  I left there about 8:30a.m., came right home and went to bed.  Got up after a long nap and B.P. was 165/82 61 at 6:45p.m. My face is still flushed, have chills and slight headache, took aspirin.  At 9:45 B.P. was 150/92 64, felt the same.

                                                On the first evening I had a fever and joint pains which resolves by the next morning, On 02/03/2021 I had diarrhea on awakening and about two hours later, after doing morning chores including carrying and lifting 4 gallons of water, I fainted,which included having another episode of diarrhea while I was out.  I was seen by emergency medical personnel, had an EKG, and then my children, with whom I live, took me to see my primary care provider who ordered some basic blood tests: a CBC and panel.  All blood tests were normal as well as the EKG, I assume.  We think the faint was perhaps triggered by the diarrhea and exertion of chores in addition to the vaccine&#39;s effect .    Since then I have had fatigue.

The headache and fever lasted 30 hours. Is it possible this is a reaction to the vaccine? Had no other symptoms, but had had headache and achiness  for 2 days right after vaccine.

She said within 3 days her legs started to go numb and especially her thigh muscles and her veins in her left foot were engorged. She said she went to the ER and they rxed 40mg prednisone for 4 days and her papers from the ER read &#34;allergy.&#34;  When I spoke to her for the second time and advised her she does not qualify for a second moderna vaccine, patient said that when she went to the ER she went for abdominal swelling, leg swelling, leg numbness, and swelling of the left ankle and foot. I confirmed with her that her symptoms have all improved and she said &#34;yes, tremendously.&#34; She said she spoke to her PCP and at least one additional doctor yesterday.

Back in the middle of February the patient had a high-grade small-bowel obstruction ended up with laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.  She was extremely deconditioned.  She came to swing bed here and states here for about 2 weeks.  She thought she was ready to go home and be successful at that time.  Unfortunately, she has gotten home and found that she can barely take care of herself.  She is extremely deconditioned.  She thinks she just needs to be built up for another week or 2 and then could be very successful at home.  She does have a friend that is helping her, but is worried about getting so weak that she end up hurting herself.  I saw her yesterday in the office and thought that another swing bed stay a might be in order.

This lasted all day.    I was also very tired and slept on and off all day.   I slept well that night and woke feeling fine but still a bit on the tired side.   Thankfully, no more nausea or headache.   I had no treatments except what I did for myself which was to drink lots of fluids and have very bland food and little of it.   I live alone and have no family near so I take care of myself. I do need to know if I should have the second shot.    I have one scheduled but would rather not go through that nasty experience again.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included levothyroxine, vitamin D, calcium and senior vitamin not specified.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 030M20A) on 06 Feb 2021 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Feb 2021, patient experienced sore arms which was resolved on 08 Feb 2021.  On 06 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 08 Mar 2021 the patient experienced headaches, nausea, felt shaking extremely cold, hot and weak, the patient was found unconscious, hitting patient with a ton of bricks and was taken to emergency room on an ambulance.  Treatment for the event included hydration fluids, tylenol and aspirin.  The action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The all events were recovered except tiredness which was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                The patient received her FIRST dose of Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/26/21 and SECOND dose on 2/23/21. On 3/8, she first started to experience shortness of breath, which was attributable to cardiac etiology and diastolic heart failure at the time, but which in retrospect may have been her earliest symptom of new onset myasthenia gravis, which is the AE I am wanting to report. She was hospitalized from 3/8-3/13, and underwent extensive cardiac workup that was negative. She again developed shortness of breath on 3/17/21 and was re-admitted to the hospital on 3/18/21 for diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure exacerbation, received diuresis from 3/18-3/22/21 but then developed new onset diplopia, at which pint I evaluated her in neurological consultation on 3/22. Her brain MRI disclosed an UNrelated incidental  small left cerebellar infract, but her neurological exam showed a new R lateral rectus palsy and new moderate to severe left eyelid ptosis, suspicious for myasthenia gravis. Anti-acetylcholineseterase antibodies--- binding, blocking, and modulating, were all sent off and came back all strongly positive on 3/26-27/21. The patient then called stating she had developed recurrent shortness of breath, new onset dysphagia, and worsening double vision. I urgently re-evaluated her in outpatient follow-up in my office on 4/2/21 and sent her immediately to the hospital to be readmitted, where she remains as of this reporting date and she has been receiving IVIG with improvement in her symptoms. She did NOT have any previous known history of eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia, or muscle weakness. In retrospect, the patient states that her current symptomatology began around 3/7/21 with the benefit of hindsight. I am reporting this event because it is very unusual for an 82 year old WOMAN to develop new onset of myasthenia gravis, and it is a known autoimmune disease, and a vaccine would be a plausible trigger for its development, or trigger for its first symptomatic manifestation. I was also especially concerned because my fellow neurologist, ALSO had a patient develop myasthenia gravis about 2 weeks or so following their second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. It would be an EXTRAORDINARY coincidence for two instances of new onset myasthenia gravis to occur 2 weeks post- vaccination at essentially the same time in an institution of our size, so we both felt obliged to report both cases ASAP to the VAERS. I was not able to reach the patient in her hospital room today to get additional specifics about where she got the vaccine, its lot number etc., however she is a retired and has indicated her willingness to provide you with any and all additional information you need, and I am also personally very willing to provide any additional information about her eventual outcome.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (also treated with 5 days of Remdesivir) in January 2021 and Lumpectomy. Concomitant products included NICOTINAMIDE, PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE, RIBOFLAVIN, THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (VITAMIN-B COMPLEX), ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN-C), VITAMIN D [VITAMIN D NOS], ZINC, APIXABAN (ELIQUIS), CARVEDILOL, ATORVASTATIN and LETROZOLE for an unknown indication.    On 03-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 04-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (hit her head and blacked out) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FEELING ABNORMAL (feeling awful), MALAISE (not felt well ever since), DECREASED APPETITE (don&#39;t feel like eating), COVID-19 (feeling the same symptoms as she did when she had covid), TASTE DISORDER (taste not the same), HEADACHE (headache), FATIGUE (Fatigue), MYALGIA (mucsle aches), NAUSEA (slight nausea) and INJECTION SITE LYMPHADENOPATHY (problem with a lymph node in that arm). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (hit her head and blacked out), FEELING ABNORMAL (feeling awful), MALAISE (not felt well ever since), DECREASED APPETITE (don&#39;t feel like eating), COVID-19 (feeling the same symptoms as she did when she had covid), TASTE DISORDER (taste not the same), HEADACHE (headache), FATIGUE (Fatigue), MYALGIA (mucsle aches), NAUSEA (slight nausea) and INJECTION SITE LYMPHADENOPATHY (problem with a lymph node in that arm) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Mammogram: sensitive (Inconclusive) Sensitive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment information included was acetaminophen for headache. The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.

                                                My mother suffered a massive stroke 40 days after receiving the 2nd dose of the cover 19 vaccine. She fell sick the day after the injection and suffered with brain fog, memory issues, lethargy from that day forward. On day 36 after the 2nd dose she developed a debilitating stomach issue that cause explosive diarrhea that lasted 4 days/nights. This bout with stomach issues left her extremely weak and exhausted. On the 4th night of the diarrhea she got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and couldn&#39;t lift herself off of the commode. It took two hours for her to call for help. Once admitted to the ER the stroke was confirmed. Because they could not pinpoint the first stroke symptom she was not eligible for the life saving blood thinning meds and suffered complete paralysis of her right side.

When I arrived she was laying in the floor very nauseous and could not stand on her own. She had crawled to bathroom and then just laid on floor in hallway outside of bathroom. I called 911 to check her vitals as she wasn?t responding much but she was conscious. EMTs got her sitting in a chair and checked BP 190/90 and pulse and pulse ox was 94. She dry vomited once and EMTs got her in her bed and eventually she became a bit more alert as was able to sip water and tea and a few bites of toast. Just in and out falling asleep. As of 2:40 pm on 4/29 just sleeping.

I also had no appetite, so forced myself to eat 1/3 can of chicken soup. On the 4th day after my shot and taking a morning shower (within about 15 minutes), I had a sudden itchy, pink body rash with water blisters on my thighs. It was awful! I applied frozen food packages continually, back and forth, trying to alleviate the itchy rash. I must add that everyone I have talked to since, also have had an adverse reaction to the 2nd shot but they are not reporting it. I didn&#39;t go to the doctor because I have no insurance. I am ok now, aside from the small scars from my bloody scratches.

For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

                                                On January 29,2021 at about 9 am I experienced extreme total body weakness as though I was about to faint. I managed to lie down. Concurrent with the extreme weakness I felt intense nausea. The weakness and nausea lasted for approximately 45 minutes to one hour when I had to rush to the toilet for a bowel movement. Within an hour to an hour and one half I was totally asymptomatic. There was no recurrence of the GI symptoms or exteme weakness. At the same time I felt itching at the site of the Covid 19 vaccination. When the GI symptoms and weaknes subdided and I looked at my upper left arm, there was swelling and redness surrounding the vaccination site and around the side of my left arm. The itching, swelling and redness lasted for 24 hours and began to subsdide until it was only faintly recognizable as a light pink discoloration around the original vaccination site. Today, February 6th, 2021 the redness has almost completely faded.

                                                Bad headache, very stuffy nose, I couldn&#39;t breathe and almost went to the hospital. Ears were ringing, my eyes were ready to pop out of my head. Temples hurt, lymph glands were swollen, sore throat. Mostly in upper part of anatomy above collar bone. It made me very weak, I had trouble getting out of rocking chair to answer phone. So I took another Tylenol. I usually only take 1-2 Tylenol a day and that was my second one by the middle of the day. I had to lay down and I live alone so I was nervous and had phone beside me and debated calling 911 which I have never done. I dozed and when I woke up about a couple of hours later it was much better. Still had headache and a little stuffiness but anybody can handle that. Also, I was very nauseated and couldn&#39;t eat but I did drink water.

Medics came and ran several tests but all was okay and I have had no trouble since.

                                                Got the vaccine and was feeling tired, and her arm hurt, an all she wanted to do was lay in bed with her heating pad.  The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

On 3/3/21 the arm where the vaccine was given became swollen, red, and hot.  She developed a severe sinus headache and sinus congestion with no fluid draining.  The headache pain was more severe than she&#39;d ever experienced and was not like a migraine. &#34;It hurt to blink.&#34; She was sick through 3/7 with symptoms progressing to fatigue &#34;too tired to write a note&#34; and nausea and &#34;violent&#34; dry heaves.  The symptoms resolved quickly and completely on Sunday 3/7/21 and she felt well for the days after.

                                                My mom lhad been up walking around for maybe an hour or so.  She then laid down across the bed &amp; when I looked at her, she was drenched with sweat, then she started hacking, almost like she was choking or couldn&#39;t breathe.  She also started mumbling &amp; called on Jesus.  I tried sitting her up, her eyes then rolled back in her head, then this very gold colored stuff started coming out of her mouth (which scared me to death).  Her body was so limp, she slid on the floor.  I wiped her mouth &amp; also put a cold rag on her  forehead to try to cool her down.  I dialed 911 &amp; continued talking to her.  She started to respond to me &amp; along with my help we were able to sit her back on the bed.  EMS arrived, took her vitals.

About 5 minutes after that she slumped in her chair and began vomiting.  She was non-responsive, vomiting and shaking.  We called 911 and kept her upright, allowing her to vomit while waiting on ambulance.  When they arrived she was still vomiting but becoming aware of her surroundings.  She was taken to Hospital and given fluids and Zofran and sent home about 7pm.  Today she is feeling much better.

Based on temporal association between mRNA-1273 use and onset of the events of runny nose, vaccination site induration, pain and swelling, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  There is not enough information to assess the other events due to lack of critical details in patient&#39;s medical history. Additional information is being requested.

She mentioned chest pain and an ambulance was called.  Following her vaccinations she was very confused and had fallen in the kitchen the Thursday (22nd) prior to her heart attack.   They took her to ER noted she was in shock and had very low blood pressure enroute to hospital.  Her pulse was very low.  She was life flighted to the medical center.  It was determined a blood clot had blocked a major artery into the right side of her heart and it was removed and a stent was placed.  She remained at hospital 3 nights and was transferred to nursing home for recovery and therapy where she currently is being assessed for mental issues and is on 4 different heart medications to control blood pressure and prevent future heart attacks.  There is not a family history of heart issues. Pt was very healthy in spite of being 83 years old.

I was not ill before I had the vaccine.  I only know that after my reaction to the second Moderna Vaccine, I had side effects and never felt well after the vaccine.  My bloodwork done for my Wellness Checkup showed low platelet and as time went by my white count went higher and higher above normal.  Weekly bloodwork and testing of my blood showed that &#34;something&#34; caused my platelets to fight, thus dropping my count to  a low of 21.  What caused the platelets to attack?  We will never know.  Now, with all the study done by my Oncologist, I am beginning to heal.  It all started after my Moderna Vaccine.  Do you think that the vaccine may have caused my health issues?

She was eating breakfast after at home and complained to a neighbor that her teeth hurt and she was nauseated after eating. In the afternoon, she felt dizzy and had diarrhea accompanied with blood. Close to 9 PM, her son went to check on her. The patient was found on the floor--she was unresponsive and had purple lips. Her son called an ambulance and started chest compressions. The patient passed away at the hospital. The doctor has ordered an autopsy, and the results are pending.

The dizziness and vertigo continue through the day Along with chills and nausea throughout the day. My biggest concern was the dizziness which has never happened before. I took her to the emergency room which resulted in a diagnosis of a fractured and displaced clavicle . The dizziness was the most concerning part and they ruled out any cerebrovascular causes. A meclizine 25 mg was given and also prescribe for her when she was discharged. I am a registered pharmacist and is a healthcare provider I looked into the side effects listed. Vertigo and dizziness is not commonly communicated as a adverse effect. This is so concerning for the elderly patients regarding  potential falls which can lead to fractures and be detrimental to their health.That?s exactly what happened to my mother

I very suddenly became light-headed and felt like I could pass out .  I sat down on a chest and put my head down on the foot of the bed and hoped it would pass.  About a minute later I became very nauseated and thought I would vomit.  I  waited about 15 min and did not do so.   I went back to bed and stayed quiet for the rest of the night.  The 24th I was extremely tired and slept most of the day.  When I did get up briefly I ached all over.  This gradually ceased by the next day.   These symptoms did not return. I am very active and know no other reasons for the reaction.

I very suddenly became light-headed and felt like I could pass out .  I sat down on a chest and put my head down on the foot of the bed and hoped it would pass.  About a minute later I became very nauseated and thought I would vomit.  I  waited about 15 min and did not do so.   I went back to bed and stayed quiet for the rest of the night.  The 24th I was extremely tired and slept most of the day.  When I did get up briefly I ached all over.  This gradually ceased by the next day.   These symptoms did not return. I am very active and know no other reasons for the reaction.

Felt like her face was drawn and tight. This morning, she has been very shaky, sounds like some congestion in her chest (cough), very tired, very dry mouth. She is never sick, so this is alarming to her and to me.

                                                The following day, food did not taste as it should and water tasted like metal.  By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

It could also be 012620A Received the vaccine and that night around 10 PM I started having chills and my body started shaking for about  1 1/2 hours.  The next morning, I had a dry mouth and vomiting with mucous  going down the back of my throat, low grade fever of 99.6F  loss of appetite and diarrhea which lasted about 17 hours.  My arm hurt and later it started itching.  A  rash formed around the injection site.  I went to Urgent Care.  They said I got an infection from the needle and gave me an antibiotic and told me to use a heating pad to stop the itch.  i got a blister on my arm which my son used a needle to puncture it and water came out.  Nothing helped so I went to my primary doctor,  Dr.  He said I was highly allergic to the vaccine and gave me a script for Prednisone  which I took for 7 days (start high with pills and then reduce amount     I think 3 of 10 mg )  he advised me not to take the second shot for the vaccine so I cancelled the appointment as the doctor said it would make me sicker.

                                                @ 2:32  (10/12/35) Patient presented to the front desk with concerns about covid-19 vaccine side effects.  She received her first dose on 2/18 and did fine till 2/20 when she started having a red itchy rash that lasted two weeks.  I explained to her that that was one of many normal reactions to the vaccine.  I emailed her an article about it.  She then said she had nausea for two weeks and still has some but less intense.  She is seeing her PCP.  I found a CDC report stating nausea can be one of the side effects.  She stated understanding.  She will be going out-of-town and will not be able to get her second covid-19 vaccine until 4/13. CDC article I referred to re: nausea: Local Reactions, Systemic Reactions, Adverse Events, and Serious Adverse Events: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient was given V-Safe information at the time of her first vaccine.  She said she did not use it because she is not tech savvy. The two weeks of intense nausea and still have some nausea now, though less intense is why the VEARS report.

The registration form for patient said it was her first dose and was signed by her POA. I administered the vaccine and discovered as I was logging the information into Impactsiis that the resident had received the complete series of PFIZER. Her first dose was on 01/11/21 and her second was on 02/01/2021. I administered MODERNA on 04/28/21. I spoke to the administrator to make him aware. I contacted the facility on 4/29 and they said the resident had lack of energy, wouldn&#39;t eat and her blood pressure was running 135/48.  The physician had them monitoring the blood pressure every 30 minutes.

She had a hard time sitting up, trying to lift her arms, had a hard time articulating how she felt and what was wrong, her speech seemed a little slurred, and she felt nauseated. Her daughter denied facial droop and localizing weakness. She continued to be &#34;out of it&#34; and weak until her daughter put her in bed about 7 hours later. She slept well and got up twice during the night to use the bathroom and seemed ok. She is feeling better today. Pt reports she kept hearing the telephone ringing all night and thought she heard someone yelling about the phone.

On Tuesday she was having headache, not sleeping well and no energy.   She also was not sleeping well, had  a headache.  By 2/17/21 was feeling better, not great as she was still not sleeping well.   She did have covid in April of last year, and was not allowed to see her husband who was in a nursing home until 6/3/20.   When she had the covid test she was inconclusive and that&#39;s why she could not see her doctor.   Her doctor did the antibody test that showed she had antibodies.  She is feeling back to normal as of today, 3/8/21.  She had the malaise from COVID after she got the 1st vaccine.  Feels that they should ask people before getting the vaccine if they had COVID.

She was sick to her stomach, really tired and lost her appetite.   On the 22nd I called her doctor again... no response, on the 23 I called again.  On the 24th finally someone spoke to me.. they stated they had called my mom and spoke with her.  They are suppose to call me, my mom could not remember by the time she would hang up.  They said to let her rest and give her electrolytes and Vit. B6.  On the 26th when I called the doctor and said she is lethargic they said to take her to the ER.  She flat lined at the hospital and her body went into shock.  She ended up having Kidney, Heart and Liver Failure.  She was still driving and doing all of her cooking, banking, shopping, showering, walking every day on Feb 18th.  She died on March 5th.

About 5:00 PM her mouth started watering and she got the drive heaves, and then about 15 minutes and then started having them bad.  She laid down and after 15 minutes she could not breath, couldn&#39;t get any air.  When she was able to get some air, her throat was sore and she was really hoarse.  Later in the evening she laid down again and the breathing difficulty happened again and it was worse.  She was scared to the point that she was afraid to lie down.   She is fatigued.  She finally fell asleep during the night and didn&#39;t sleep much and today is very tired.  She called her doctor this morning, and talked to the nurse.   They told her if it got worse to go to the ER.  Told her to call the CDC.

This happened on Saturday after having the shot on Friday night.  Sunday a.m. my temp was 99 and I just felt lethargic.  However, I had a large red patch at the injection site - as I did following the first injection.  This has itched very much.  I had felt fine since Monday until today when I have had some stomach cramping.

                                                Received call from patient on 3/3/2021. She reports that approximately 1.5hrs after receiving her COVID vaccine, she began having pain in the top of her head, neck, between her shoulder blades, down both arms to her fingertips, and down her spine.  Reports also began having swelling in her feet. Reports having nausea and pain in her chest with walking. She reports she already had trouble with ambulation prior to vaccine, but it has been worse since receiving the vaccine. She reports as of 3/3/21, the pain is still occurring and not getting better.  She has not seen her primary doctor since being vaccinated. I encouraged her to speak with her doctor or schedule a visit with them as her pain is not improving.

                                                Got shot on Wed. 2/10/2021. Started feeling ill within a few hours. Next day, was &#34;sick&#34; and needed to vomit (but didn&#39;t).  Temperatures for 3 days was less than normal.  95.6 to 96.1.  FridayI I started vomiting and had incidents of a pain in my stomach area and by that night became sicker and dehydrated.  Was so sick I couldn&#39;t get out of bed to get water (I live alone).  By midnight Friday (12:00) Feb. 13 I was so sick I called daughter to take me to hospital.  Went to ER and then did blood work.  Blood work showed  liver enzymes were over 500 and eventually reached over 600, when normal is under 100.  Was admitted to hospital.  My electrolytes were out of &#34;whack&#34; too.  My doctor told me in 11 years practice she had never seen a liver enzymes reading over 600.  I am scared to take another vaccine shot at this point.  Note:  I had blood work done Friday, March 5, 2021 and my liver enzymes was 26 -- normal but I am not interested in getting that sick again and I have concerns about my liver.

This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) in an 87-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 029L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Penicillin allergy, Syncope (granddaughter states patient has episodes of syncope) and Wheelchair user.    On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 22-Jan-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) (seriousness criterion medically significant). 22-Jan-2021, the patient experienced URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), BEDRIDDEN (Bedridden) and VOMITING (Patient began to vomit). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) had resolved and URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), BEDRIDDEN (Bedridden) and VOMITING (Patient began to vomit) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   After administration, the patient remained in waiting area for the recommended 15 minutes observation time. Approximately 20 minutes after vaccination, patient was unconscious and appeared not to be breathing, but pulse was palpable. Pharmacist administered 1 dose of 0.3mg epinephrine via epi-pen into patient&#39;s left thigh. The patient quickly regained consciousness, spoke to family, said she did not feel well. Emergency medical services (ems) arrived. The patient began to vomit, was placed on stretcher and left with ems. A few hours later the granddaughter reported that the patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) and physical exam by emergency room (ER) attributed her experience to untreated infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Vomiting is consistent with event safety profile.

                                                Though patient was experiencing pain due to her arthritis, soon after the vaccination (1-2 hours) she experienced increased knee pain in both legs. Since the vaccination, she has also had bad diarrhea. Lastly, the worst symptom she experienced was light headedness and fatigue. At around 8:30pm on the day of the vaccination, she got up from dinner to go to bed a bit early. She was feeling tired and started to fade. She fell backwards against the wall, hit her head and landed on her bottom. Thankfully, I was there to help her up and was able to stay up with her to ensure she didn&#39;t have a concussion. Admittedly, she did not drink much water that day so it&#39;s possible this exacerbated the side effects of the vaccine. Maybe the clinics can offer people water bottles or other hydrating beverages to ensure things like this don&#39;t happen?

She stated that the evening after the patient received the vaccine, she felt some mild injection site pain.  The morning after, the patient reported severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting.  The patients daughter then called her physician to report these symptoms and attributed them as an adverse reaction to the vaccine at that time.  These symptoms were intermittent for one week and no other adverse reactions were noted.  In the early morning hours of 1/27/2021, the patient was toileting and had expired while doing so.  An ambulance was called and cause of death was not found. An autopsy was not performed.

                                                approx. ten or eleven days after receiving the Moderna  vaccine, my mother experienced fatigue, nausea, body aches and a fever. Within hours, her body was inflamed with rashes from head to toe, with hives in certain spots, and she looks sunburned all over her body.  She is extremely itchy and in pain and generally very uncomfortable.

                                                throat closure three weeks after second dose; has lost the ability to swallow.; hernia; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning an 88-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced throat closure three weeks after second dose/obstruction, hernia, and lost ability to swallow/dyphagia.  The patient&#39;s medical history included an aortic valve replacement. Concomitant medications were not provided by the reporter.   On 13 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 01120A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 10 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 007M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection  On an unknown date, the patient had lost the ability to swallow. Patient was taken to the ER and ER doctors thought it was a hernia and suggested a surgery. This was three weeks post dose of the vaccine. The reporter reported that the patient was taken to the hospital on 4 Mar 2021. The doctor diagnosed hernia, but they didn&#39;t explain the throat closing. They told him to take the patient to a GI doctor. The GI didn&#39;t think it was necessary to do a surgery and scheduled a colonoscopy.  The reporter disagreed with the colonoscopy because it didn&#39;t address the throat swelling. The hospital had put the patient on IV fluids but didn&#39;t have a lot of answers. On 8 Mar 2021, the hospital prescribed antibiotics and speech therapy.   Treatment activities reported by the reporter included IV fluids, antibiotics, and speech therapy .  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of events, obstruction, hernia, and dysphagia were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events were consistent with increased risk of complications associated with elderly age of patient. Company assessed the events to be unlikely related to company product.

                                                The morning after the vaccine injection, I started vomiting, continuing up until just before 6 PM, -- which caused severe rib and bone soreness, and severe headache. The next morning, I woke to severe itching over most of my body. After spending the day scratching to the point of bleeding, I finally went to the clinic on Saturday morning. After an exam, the doctor prescribed allergic anti-itch meds, along with a hydrocortisone cream. (one of my concerns was that I am on blood thinner, and the scratching caused some bleeding much to my dismay)

Came home, did not feel bad, day and half later started feeling bad, as  well as kind of like a cold with drainage to her throat, a little coughing.  Has had diarrhea for the last 3 days, nausea and generally feeling bad.  The first week had a lot of drowsiness, had fogginess as far as thinking.   The first few days took Tylenol and did not take anymore as her daughter said it contained aspirin for the pain.  Still having the headache, feeling like she is not thinking real good.  About a month ago had blood work and everything was perfect, no problems.  Due to the fact that she is still having these reactions 2 weeks from the injections wanted to report it.

Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.
